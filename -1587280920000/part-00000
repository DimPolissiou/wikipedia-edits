They form one of the five administrative [[district]]s of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]].\n\n==History==\n=== Discovery and early history ===\nThe Crozet Islands were discovered on 24 January 1772 by the expedition of French explorer [[Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne]], aboard ''Le Mascarin''. His second-in-command Jules (Julien-Marie) Crozet landed on \u00cele de la Possession, claiming the archipelago for France.<ref name=\"mills\">{{cite book|last=Mills|first=William J|title=Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=166\u2013167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PYdBH4dOOM4C&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166|accessdate=26 September 2016|isbn=9781576074220}}</ref> The expedition continued east and landed in [[New Zealand]], where Captain Marion and much of his crew were killed and cannibalized by [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]].<ref name=\"cook\">{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Hough |year=1995 |title=Captain James Cook: A Biography |publisher=W.

In 1776 Crozet met [[James Cook]] at [[Cape Town]], at the start of Cook's [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]].<ref name=\"cook\"/> Crozet shared the charts of his ill-fated expedition, and as Cook sailed eastward he stopped at the islands, naming the western group ''Marion'' and the eastern group ''Crozet''.<ref name=\"mills\"/> In the following years, sealers visiting the islands referred to both the eastern and western groups as the Crozet Islands, and Marion Island became the name of the larger of the two [[Prince Edward Islands]], which had been discovered by Captain Marion on the same expedition.<ref name=\"mills\"/>\n\nIn the early 19th century, the islands were often visited by sealers, and the [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s had been nearly exterminated by 1835. Between 1804 and 1911, 153 vessels visited the island for seals, seven of which wrecked on the coast.<ref>R.K. Headland, ''Historical Antarctic Sealing Industry'', Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, 2018, p.166.</ref> Subsequently, [[whaling]] was the main activity around the islands, especially by the whalers from [[Massachusetts]]. In 1841 there were a dozen whaleships around the islands. Within a couple of years this had increased to twenty from the United States alone. Such exploitation was short-lived, and the islands were rarely visited for the rest of the century.\n\nThere were many shipwrecks on the Crozet Islands. The British sealer, ''Princess of Wales'', sank in 1821, and the survivors spent two years on the islands. The ''Strathmore'' was wrecked in 1875. In 1887, the French ''Tamaris'' was wrecked and her crew stranded on \u00cele des Cochons. They tied a note to the leg of an [[albatross]], which was found seven months later in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], but the crew was never recovered. For some time the [[Royal Navy]] dispatched a ship every few years to look for stranded survivors. The steamship ''Australasian'' also checked for survivors en route to Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article208527244 |title=THE CROZET ISLANDS. |newspaper=[[The Express and Telegraph]] |volume=XXVI |issue=7,584 |location=South Australia |date=21 March 1889 |accessdate=4 May 2016 |page=3 (Second Edition.) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nBetween 1924 and 1955, France administered the islands as a dependency of [[Madagascar]]. Crozet Islands became part of the [[French Southern Territories]] in 1955. In 1938, the Crozet Islands were declared a nature reserve. In 1961, a first research station was set up, but it was not until 1963 that the permanent station [[Alfred Faure]] opened at Port Alfred on \u00cele de la Possession (both named after the first leader of the station). The station is staffed by 18 to 30 people (varying by season). They perform [[meteorology|meteorological]], [[biology|biological]], and [[geology|geological]] research, and maintain a [[seismograph]] and a geomagnetic observatory ([[IAGA]] code: CZT). The [[CTBTO|Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization]] has listening equipment on the island and it was disclosed that two of its stations, the other being on Ascension Island, detected what is believed to be an underwater, non-nuclear explosion off the coast of Argentina and believed to be the fatal accident of the {{ship|ARA|San Juan|S-42|6}} submarine in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42100620|title='Explosion' dashes sub crew survival hopes|author=|date=23 November 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Submarino ARA San Juan: c\u00f3mo se detect\u00f3 la explosi\u00f3n y qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda significar|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2084967-submarino-ara-san-juan-como-se-detecto-la-explosion-y-que-podria-significar|accessdate=23 November 2017|work=La Nacion|date=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\nThe islands lie on the [[Antarctic Plate]] roughly between the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] and [[Madagascar]] and southern Africa.

Most abundant are the [[macaroni penguin]], of which some 2&nbsp;million pairs breed on the islands, and the [[king penguin]], home to 700,000 breeding pairs; half the world's population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bost|first1=Charles-Andr\u00e9|title=King penquins face longer commute|journal=New Scientist|date=31 October 2015|volume=228|issue=3045|page=17}}</ref> The [[eastern rockhopper penguin]] also can be found, and there is a small colony of [[gentoo penguin]]s. There is also an endemic subspecies of the duck [[Eaton's pintail]]. Other birds include [[black-faced sheathbill]]s, [[petrel]]s, and [[albatross]], including the [[wandering albatross]].\n\nMammals living on the Crozet Islands include [[fur seal]]s, and [[southern elephant seal]]s. [[Killer whales]] have been observed preying upon the seals. The transient killer whales of the Crozet Islands are famous for intentionally beaching (and later un-stranding) themselves while actively hunting the islands' breeding seal population. This is a very rare behaviour, most often seen in the [[Patagonia]] region of [[Argentina]], and is thought to be a learned skill passed down through generations of individual orca families. These killer whales also seem to stay around the Crozet Islands year-round, feeding on mostly seals during the summer, and then feeding on penguins for the winter.\n\nThe Crozet Islands have been a nature reserve since 1938. Introduction of foreign species ([[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, and subsequently [[cat]]s for pest control) has caused severe damage to the original [[ecosystem]]. The [[pig]]s that had been introduced on \u00cele des Cochons and the [[goat]]s brought to \u00cele de la Possession\u2014both as a food resource\u2014have been exterminated.\n\nAnother on-going concern is [[overfishing]] of the [[Patagonian toothfish]], as well as the [[albatross]] population, which is being monitored. The waters of the Crozet Islands are patrolled by the French government.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA 2012 French film, [[Haute Cuisine (film)|''Les Saveurs du Palais'']], begins and ends with scenes in the Crozet Islands. The film's protagonist, a grandmotherly chef from the P\u00e9rigord region of France who signed on as cook for the research station, had once been the personal chef to President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]].\n\nIn the 1978 novel ''[[Desolation Island (novel)|Desolation Island]]'', the fifth book in [[Patrick O'Brian|Patrick O'Brian's]] [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]], the fictional [[Fourth-rate|naval vessel]] HMS ''Leopard'' is severely damaged by a collision with an iceberg in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The crew attempts to make landfall for repairs on one of the Crozet Islands, but they miss the island and continue to drift towards the east, unable to reverse direction.\n\nIn [[Herman Melville]]\u2019s [[Moby Dick]], the Pequod sails near the \u2018distant Crozetts\u2019, \u2019a good cruising ground for  Right Whalemen\u2019 in Chapter 52, \u2018The Albatross\u2019.

In 1776 Crozet met [[James Cook]] at [[Cape Town]], at the start of Cook's [[Third voyage of James Cook|third voyage]].<ref name=\"cook\"/> Crozet shared the charts of his ill-fated expedition, and as Cook sailed eastward he stopped at the islands, naming the western group ''Marion'' and the eastern group ''Crozet''.<ref name=\"mills\"/> In the following years, sealers visiting the islands referred to both the eastern and western groups as the Crozet Islands, and Marion Island became the name of the larger of the two [[Prince Edward Islands]], which had been discovered by Captain Marion on the same expedition.<ref name=\"mills\"/>\n\nIn the early 19th century, the islands were often visited by sealers, and the [[seal (mammal)|seal]]s had been nearly exterminated by 1835. Between 1804 and 1911, 153 vessels visited the island for seals, seven of which wrecked on the coast.<ref>R.K. Headland, ''Historical Antarctic Sealing Industry'', Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, 2018, p.166.</ref> Subsequently, [[whaling]] was the main activity around the islands, especially by the whalers from [[Massachusetts]]. In 1841 there were a dozen whaleships around the islands. Within a couple of years this had increased to twenty from the United States alone. Such exploitation was short-lived, and the islands were rarely visited for the rest of the century.\n\nThere were many shipwrecks on the Crozet Islands. The British sealer, ''Princess of Wales'', sank in 1821, and the survivors spent two years on the islands. The ''Strathmore'' was wrecked in 1875. In 1887, the French ''Tamaris'' was wrecked and her crew stranded on \u00cele des Cochons. They tied a note to the leg of an [[albatross]], which was found seven months later in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]], but the crew was never recovered. For some time the [[Royal Navy]] dispatched a ship every few years to look for stranded survivors. The steamship ''Australasian'' also checked for survivors en route to Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article208527244 |title=THE CROZET ISLANDS. |newspaper=[[The Express and Telegraph]] |volume=XXVI |issue=7,584 |location=South Australia |date=21 March 1889 |accessdate=4 May 2016 |page=3 (Second Edition.) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nBetween 1924 and 1955, France administered the islands as a dependency of [[Madagascar]]. Crozet Islands became part of the [[French Southern Territories]] in 1955. In 1938, the Crozet Islands were declared a nature reserve. In 1961, a first research station was set up, but it was not until 1963 that the permanent station [[Alfred Faure]] opened at Port Alfred on \u00cele de la Possession (both named after the first leader of the station). The station is staffed by 18 to 30 people (varying by season). They perform [[meteorology|meteorological]], [[biology|biological]], and [[geology|geological]] research, and maintain a [[seismograph]] and a geomagnetic observatory ([[IAGA]] code: CZT). The [[CTBTO|Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization]] has listening equipment on the island and it was disclosed that two of its stations, the other being on Ascension Island, detected what is believed to be an underwater, non-nuclear explosion off the coast of Argentina and believed to be the fatal accident of the {{ship|ARA|San Juan|S-42|6}} submarine in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-42100620|title='Explosion' dashes sub crew survival hopes|author=|date=23 November 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Submarino ARA San Juan: c\u00f3mo se detect\u00f3 la explosi\u00f3n y qu\u00e9 podr\u00eda significar|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2084967-submarino-ara-san-juan-como-se-detecto-la-explosion-y-que-podria-significar|accessdate=23 November 2017|work=La Nacion|date=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\nThe islands lie on the [[Antarctic Plate]] roughly between the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] and [[Madagascar]] and southern Africa.

Most abundant are the [[macaroni penguin]], of which some 2&nbsp;million pairs breed on the islands, and the [[king penguin]], home to 700,000 breeding pairs; half the world's population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bost|first1=Charles-Andr\u00e9|title=King penquins face longer commute|journal=New Scientist|date=31 October 2015|volume=228|issue=3045|page=17}}</ref> The [[eastern rockhopper penguin]] also can be found, and there is a small colony of [[gentoo penguin]]s. There is also an endemic subspecies of the duck [[Eaton's pintail]]. Other birds include [[black-faced sheathbill]]s, [[petrel]]s, and [[albatross]], including the [[wandering albatross]].\n\nMammals living on the Crozet Islands include [[fur seal]]s, and [[southern elephant seal]]s. [[Killer whales]] have been observed preying upon the seals. The transient killer whales of the Crozet Islands are famous for intentionally beaching (and later un-stranding) themselves while actively hunting the islands' breeding seal population. This is a very rare behaviour, most often seen in the [[Patagonia]] region of [[Argentina]], and is thought to be a learned skill passed down through generations of individual orca families. These killer whales also seem to stay around the Crozet Islands year-round, feeding on mostly seals during the summer, and then feeding on penguins for the winter.\n\nThe Crozet Islands have been a nature reserve since 1938. Introduction of foreign species ([[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, and subsequently [[cat]]s for pest control) has caused severe damage to the original [[ecosystem]]. The [[pig]]s that had been introduced on \u00cele des Cochons and the [[goat]]s brought to \u00cele de la Possession\u2014both as a food resource\u2014have been exterminated.\n\nAnother on-going concern is [[overfishing]] of the [[Patagonian toothfish]], as well as the [[albatross]] population, which is being monitored. The waters of the Crozet Islands are patrolled by the French government.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nA 2012 French film, [[Haute Cuisine (film)|''Les Saveurs du Palais'']], begins and ends with scenes in the Crozet Islands. The film's protagonist, a grandmotherly chef from the P\u00e9rigord region of France who signed on as cook for the research station, had once been the personal chef to President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]].\n\nIn the 1978 novel ''[[Desolation Island (novel)|Desolation Island]]'', the fifth book in [[Patrick O'Brian|Patrick O'Brian's]] [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]], the fictional [[Fourth-rate|naval vessel]] HMS ''Leopard'' is severely damaged by a collision with an iceberg in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The crew attempts to make landfall for repairs on one of the Crozet Islands, but they miss the island and continue to drift towards the east, unable to reverse direction.\n\nIn [[Herman Melville]]\u2019s [[Moby Dick]], the Pequod sails near the \u2018distant Crozetts\u2019, \u2019a good cruising ground for  Right Whalemen\u2019 in Chapter 52, \u2018The Albatross\u2019.

The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], Candace Hutson, [[Judith Barsi]] and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]].\n\nProduced by the American companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Lucasfilm]], and the American-Irish [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Ltd.]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young \"Longneck\" (''[[Apatosaurus]]'') named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore. Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera the \"Threehorn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''), Ducky the \"Bigmouth\" (''[[Saurolophus]]''), Petrie the \"Flyer\" (''[[Pteranodon]]''), and Spike the \"Spiketail\" (''[[Stegosaurus]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"Sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). This is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide.\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 18, 1988, the first film spawned [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|a franchise]] with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels and [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]] as well as merchandise.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING! Per WP:FILMPLOT, feature film plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words only! -->\nDuring the [[Mesozoic|age of the dinosaurs]], a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an [[oasis]] known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a \"three-horn\", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: \"three-horns\", \"spike-tails\", \"swimmers\", and \"flyers\". That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"[[Triadobatrachus|hopper]]\", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"[[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]\" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old \"[[Scolosaurus|clubtail]]\" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"[[volcano|Mountains that Burn]]\".\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" named Ducky and a \"flyer\" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Ashamed of her fear and behavior, and reluctant to admit her mistake, Cera leaves them in tears. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley.

Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents.

Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with only dinosaurs. George Lucas was also brought in on the project. An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354 }}</ref> Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.<ref name=\"AFDB\">{{cite book |title= The Animated Films of Don Bluth |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html |author=Cawley, Jon |date=October 1991 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThroughout production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\" About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating. Much of the cut footage consisted of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attack sequence and sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of Sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/04/don-bluth-storyboards-2-land-before.html Part 1 \u2013 Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/06/part-2-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref><ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/10/part-3-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.<ref name=\"AFDB\" />\n\n=== Music and soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 21, 1988<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5Q |title=James Horner, Diana Ross \u2013 The Land Before Time |accessdate=October 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 57:49\n| label      = [[MCA Records]] (1988)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)\n| producer   = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology = Don Bluth Music of Films\n| prev_title = [[An American Tail]]\n| prev_year  = 1986\n| next_title = [[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n | single1date = January 21, 1989\n}}\n}}\nThe music for ''The Land Before Time'' was composed by [[James Horner]], who had previously provided the soundtrack for ''An American Tail'', and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]].

The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], Candace Hutson, [[Judith Barsi]] and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]].\n\nProduced by the American companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Lucasfilm]], and the American-Irish [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Ltd.]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young \"Longneck\" (''[[Apatosaurus]]'') named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore. Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera the \"Threehorn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''), Ducky the \"Bigmouth\" (''[[Saurolophus]]''), Petrie the \"Flyer\" (''[[Pteranodon]]''), and Spike the \"Spiketail\" (''[[Stegosaurus]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"Sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). This is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide.\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 18, 1988, the first film spawned [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|a franchise]] with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels and [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]] as well as merchandise.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING! Per WP:FILMPLOT, feature film plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words only! -->\nDuring the [[Mesozoic|age of the dinosaurs]], a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an [[oasis]] known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a \"three-horn\", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: \"three-horns\", \"spike-tails\", \"swimmers\", and \"flyers\". That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"[[Triadobatrachus|hopper]]\", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"[[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]\" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old \"[[Scolosaurus|clubtail]]\" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"[[volcano|Mountains that Burn]]\".\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" named Ducky and a \"flyer\" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. Ashamed of her fear and behavior, and reluctant to admit her mistake, Cera leaves them in tears. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] as Littlefoot\n* Candace Hutson as Cera\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Ducky\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Petrie\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Littlefoot's mother\n* [[Burke Byrnes]] as Cera's father\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Littlefoot's grandfather\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Narrator and Rooter\n\n== Production ==\nDuring production of ''[[An American Tail]]'', talk began of the next feature with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with only dinosaurs. George Lucas was also brought in on the project. An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354 }}</ref> Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.<ref name=\"AFDB\">{{cite book |title= The Animated Films of Don Bluth |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html |author=Cawley, Jon |date=October 1991 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThroughout production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\" About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating. Much of the cut footage consisted of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attack sequence and sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of Sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/04/don-bluth-storyboards-2-land-before.html Part 1 \u2013 Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/06/part-2-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref><ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/10/part-3-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.<ref name=\"AFDB\" />\n\n=== Music and soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 21, 1988<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5Q |title=James Horner, Diana Ross \u2013 The Land Before Time |accessdate=October 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 57:49\n| label      = [[MCA Records]] (1988)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)\n| producer   = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology = Don Bluth Music of Films\n| prev_title = [[An American Tail]]\n| prev_year  = 1986\n| next_title = [[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n | single1date = January 21, 1989\n}}\n}}\nThe music for ''The Land Before Time'' was composed by [[James Horner]], who had previously provided the soundtrack for ''An American Tail'', and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]].

Euskotren Trena also operates the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia/San Sebasti\u00e1n]] metro under the brand [[Metro Donostialdea]].\n\nEuskotren Trena operates the railway services and networks, while [[Euskotren Tranbia]] operates the tram networks, ''Euskotren Autobusa'' the bus services and ''Euskotren Kargo'' the freight rail services. Since 2006 Euskotren Trena has been the commercial brand for the operator of the railway network in the Basque Country, which is [[Eusko Trenbideak - Ferrocarriles Vascos|Eusko Trenbideak]], while the network itself is owned by the public entity Euskal Trenbide Sarea. In 2012 the commercial brand was changed from simply ''Euskotren'' to ''Euskotren Trena'', adding the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''trena''.\n\n== Services ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\n\n[[File:San Sebastian Eusko Tren station.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Euskotren Trena unit at Amara station, [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n]].]]\n\n''Euskotren Trena'' operates the railway network owned by ''Euskal Trenbide Sarea'' (Basque Railway Network) in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] provinces of [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]], as well as a short track and a station in the [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques]] department of France. The initial network was a continuation of the [[FEVE]] (''narrow gauge railways'') regional services and FTS (''Bilbao's metropolitan railways and transportation'') urban services. The services have since then improved to become a [[commuter rail]] system along with [[Inter-city rail]] services. The network connects the city of [[Bilbao]] with municipalities across the [[Greater Bilbao]] area and the province of [[Biscay]], such as [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], [[Bermeo]] and [[Lezama]]. In the province of [[Gipuzkoa]] it connects the city of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n]] with other cities and towns such as [[Zarautz]], [[Lasarte-Oria]], [[Irun]] and [[Hendaye]], the latter in France. The Inter-city rail services connect the cities of Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n with each other and with Hendaye. Since August 2012, Euskotren Trena has operated the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia/San Sebasti\u00e1n]] metro system, based on the Topo network, under the brand [[Metro Donostialdea]].<ref name=\"metro donostialdea\">http://www.diariovasco.com/v/20121004/al-dia-local/metro-conecta-desde-intxaurrondo-20121004.html</ref>\n\nEuskotren Trena is operated by [[Eusko Trenbideak - Ferrocarriles Vascos|Eusko Trenbideak]].\n\n=== Lines ===\n\n[[File:Mapa euskotren.svg|thumb|right|450px|Map of the network (includes the ''Euskotren Tranbia'' lines).]]\n\nThe ''Euskotren Trena'' network consists of the following lines:\n\n* '''[[Biscay]]-[[Gipuzkoa]]'''\n**[[File:Euskotren E1.svg|19px]] Bilbao-Donostia line \u2013 [[Inter-city rail]] service from [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station|Bilbao-Atxuri]] to [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia-Amara]].\n\n*'''Bilbao, [[Biscay]]'''\n** [[File:Metro de Bilbao L3.svg|19px]] [[Bilbao Metro]] Line 3 \u2013 Kukullaga to Matiko.

The Euskotren trena lines do not appear with other train lines in standard printed network maps, but separate maps are available. The Euskotren Trena lines appear together with other railway networks of the Basque Country in the Moveuskadi.com service provided by the Basque Government.\n\n=== Former or closed lines ===\n\n* Sections of the '''Txorierri line'''. The railway service on the [[Txorierri]] line between [[Casco Viejo]] and [[Deusto]] was suspended in May 2010 for a period of three years, because of the construction of Line 3 of [[Metro Bilbao]]. The closed stations are Deusto, Unibertsitatea, Matiko and Zumalakarregi. The Loruri-Ciudad Jard\u00edn station, formerly closed, was open to provide a service to the users of the now closed stations.\n* '''Urola line'''. The Urola line, formerly served by the Urola Railway, was closed by Eusko Trenbideak in 1986, after a futile attempt to renovate it. The service was replaced by a bus line between the municipalities of [[Zumaia]] and [[Zumarraga, Spain|Zumarraga]].\n* '''Bilbao-Plentzia line'''. Bilbao-Plentzia was the line with the most users at the time of its closure. The original line connected downtown Bilbao, starting at [[Casco Viejo Station]] with the town of [[Plentzia]], at [[Plentzia (Metro Bilbao)|Plentzia Station]]. During the construction of the [[Line 1 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 1]] of [[Metro Bilbao]], it was decided that the section between San Inazio and Plentzia would be managed by Metro Bilbao, as part of line 1, instead of Euskotren. The Casco Viejo Station was then connected to the Txorierri line, and the Ciudad Jard\u00edn and Mallona stations were closed (due their proximity to the station in Casco Viejo). The Deusto-San Inazio section was eventually closed due the construction of a new highway where the railway tracks were located.\n* '''Lutxana-Sondika line'''. The line between [[Sondika]] and Lutxana (in [[Erandio]]), both in the [[Greater Bilbao]] area was closed in 1996 after an attempt to re-open it for passenger services. However, the tracks are still in use; Euskotren Trena uses it for testing new units.\n\n=== Service frequencies ===\n\n[[File:San Sebastian Estacion topo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lugaritz station]]\n\nAs of January 2014, typical services frequencies for weekdays are:<ref name=\"frequencies\">[http://www.euskotren.es/es/viaja/horarios/tren Schedules at Euskotren Trena's Official Website]</ref>\n\n* '''Bilbao-Donostia line''' \u2013 one train per hour between Bilbao-Atxuri and Donostia-Amara.\n* '''Durangaldea line''' \u2013 two trains per hour between Bilbao-Atxuri and Ermua in each direction, with one continuing to Donostia-Amara, and some express trains between Bilbao and Durango, Tra\u00f1a and Zaldibar.\n* '''Kostaldea line''' \u2013 one train per hour between Ermua and Donostia-Amara in each direction (the ones starting at Donostia-Amara continuing to Bilbao-Atxuri).\n* '''Tranbia Ermua-Eibar line''' \u2013 four trains per hour between Ermua and Eibar in each direction.\n* '''Topo line''' \u2013 four trains per hour between Lasarte-Oria and Irun, with two continuing to Hendaye.

There are operations centres in several stations, including those of [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]] and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. Currently, the rolling stock is maintained at depots in Abadi\u00f1o, [[Gernika]] and [[Errenteria]]. New depots are being built in [[Irun]].\n\n=== Ticketing ===\n\nEuskotren Trena uses both regular paper tickets and the [[Barik card]] available only on some lines. Users can acquire single tickets and return tickets at the vending machines available at every station, and monthly and yearly travel cards are also available. Young people and elderly people also may acquire special tickets.<ref>[http://www.euskotren.es/es/node/736 Tickets] at Euskotren Trena official website]</ref> The Barik travel ticket was initially only available on the Txorierri line, and it will be available for use on all lines once it is fully implemented.\n\nThe ticket pricing is based on zone-based rules.\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\n''Euskotren Trena'' uses several trains from four different series, named UT200, UT300, UT3500 and the newest UT900, all produced by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]]. As the whole network is electrified, all the units are electric. The oldest are the trains from the UT3500 series, which started operations in the 1970s as a replacement for the very old and rather dilapidated trains of the Ferrocarriles Vascongados. The UT900 series use state-of-the-art technology and started operations in 2011.\n\n=== Current fleet ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" \n|-\n!Class\n!Image\n!Type\n!Top speed (km/h)\n!Cars per set\n!Routes operated\n!Built\n!Notes\n|-\n|EMU 900\n|[[File:EuskoTren Hendaye.JPG|100px]]\n|[[Electric multiple unit]]\n|90\n|4\n|Metro Donostialdea<br>Durangaldea line\n|2011\u2013present\n|New units started operating in Topo's line.

The developments do not include any expansion of the lines or new lines (those not yet proposed or planned) but the improvements of the current network, with new stations, alternate routes and a second rail track in areas where there is only one, as well as the elimination, or at least reduction, of all the [[level crossing]]s.\n\n*'''Euba-Iurreta section'''. The section between Euba, in [[Amorebieta-Etxano]] and [[Iurreta]] is currently being upgraded to include a second track, in order to improve frequencies and eliminate ten level crossings. This development is part of the ''Durango+'' project, which aims to improve the service and frequencies in the [[Durangaldea]] region.

The network connects the city of [[Bilbao]] with municipalities across the [[Greater Bilbao]] area and the province of [[Biscay]], such as [[Durango, Biscay|Durango]], [[Bermeo]] and [[Lezama]]. In the province of [[Gipuzkoa]] it connects the city of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n]] with other cities and towns such as [[Zarautz]], [[Lasarte-Oria]], [[Irun]] and [[Hendaye]], the latter in France. The Inter-city rail services connect the cities of Bilbao and San Sebasti\u00e1n with each other and with Hendaye. Since August 2012, Euskotren Trena has operated the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia/San Sebasti\u00e1n]] metro system, based on the Topo network, under the brand [[Metro Donostialdea]].<ref name=\"metro donostialdea\">http://www.diariovasco.com/v/20121004/al-dia-local/metro-conecta-desde-intxaurrondo-20121004.html</ref>\n\nEuskotren Trena is operated by [[Eusko Trenbideak - Ferrocarriles Vascos|Eusko Trenbideak]].\n\n=== Lines ===\n\n[[File:Mapa euskotren.svg|thumb|right|450px|Map of the network (includes the ''Euskotren Tranbia'' lines).]]\n\nThe ''Euskotren Trena'' network consists of the following lines:\n\n* '''[[Biscay]]-[[Gipuzkoa]]'''\n**[[File:Euskotren E1.svg|19px]] Bilbao-Donostia line \u2013 [[Inter-city rail]] service from [[Bilbao-Atxuri Station|Bilbao-Atxuri]] to [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|Donostia-Amara]].\n\n*'''Bilbao, [[Biscay]]'''\n** [[File:Metro de Bilbao L3.svg|19px]] [[Bilbao Metro]] Line 3 \u2013 Kukullaga to Matiko.

The Euskotren trena lines do not appear with other train lines in standard printed network maps, but separate maps are available. The Euskotren Trena lines appear together with other railway networks of the Basque Country in the Moveuskadi.com service provided by the Basque Government.\n\n=== Former or closed lines ===\n\n* Sections of the '''Txorierri line'''. The railway service on the [[Txorierri]] line between [[Casco Viejo]] and [[Deusto]] was suspended in May 2010 for a period of three years, because of the construction of Line 3 of [[Metro Bilbao]]. The closed stations are Deusto, Unibertsitatea, Matiko and Zumalakarregi. The Loruri-Ciudad Jard\u00edn station, formerly closed, was open to provide a service to the users of the now closed stations.\n* '''Urola line'''. The Urola line, formerly served by the Urola Railway, was closed by Eusko Trenbideak in 1986, after a futile attempt to renovate it. The service was replaced by a bus line between the municipalities of [[Zumaia]] and [[Zumarraga, Spain|Zumarraga]].\n* '''Bilbao-Plentzia line'''. Bilbao-Plentzia was the line with the most users at the time of its closure. The original line connected downtown Bilbao, starting at [[Casco Viejo Station]] with the town of [[Plentzia]], at [[Plentzia (Metro Bilbao)|Plentzia Station]]. During the construction of the [[Line 1 (Metro Bilbao)|Line 1]] of [[Metro Bilbao]], it was decided that the section between San Inazio and Plentzia would be managed by Metro Bilbao, as part of line 1, instead of Euskotren. The Casco Viejo Station was then connected to the Txorierri line, and the Ciudad Jard\u00edn and Mallona stations were closed (due their proximity to the station in Casco Viejo). The Deusto-San Inazio section was eventually closed due the construction of a new highway where the railway tracks were located.\n* '''Lutxana-Sondika line'''. The line between [[Sondika]] and Lutxana (in [[Erandio]]), both in the [[Greater Bilbao]] area was closed in 1996 after an attempt to re-open it for passenger services. However, the tracks are still in use; Euskotren Trena uses it for testing new units.\n\n=== Service frequencies ===\n\n[[File:San Sebastian Estacion topo.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lugaritz station]]\n\nAs of January 2014, typical services frequencies for weekdays are:<ref name=\"frequencies\">[http://www.euskotren.es/es/viaja/horarios/tren Schedules at Euskotren Trena's Official Website]</ref>\n\n* '''Bilbao-Donostia line''' \u2013 one train per hour between Bilbao-Atxuri and Donostia-Amara.\n* '''Durangaldea line''' \u2013 two trains per hour between Bilbao-Atxuri and Ermua in each direction, with one continuing to Donostia-Amara, and some express trains between Bilbao and Durango, Tra\u00f1a and Zaldibar.\n* '''Kostaldea line''' \u2013 one train per hour between Ermua and Donostia-Amara in each direction (the ones starting at Donostia-Amara continuing to Bilbao-Atxuri).\n* '''Tranbia Ermua-Eibar line''' \u2013 four trains per hour between Ermua and Eibar in each direction.\n* '''Topo line''' \u2013 four trains per hour between Lasarte-Oria and Irun, with two continuing to Hendaye.

Currently, the rolling stock is maintained at depots in Abadi\u00f1o, [[Gernika]] and [[Errenteria]]. New depots are being built in [[Irun]].\n\n=== Ticketing ===\n\nEuskotren Trena uses both regular paper tickets and the [[Barik card]] available only on some lines. Users can acquire single tickets and return tickets at the vending machines available at every station, and monthly and yearly travel cards are also available. Young people and elderly people also may acquire special tickets.<ref>[http://www.euskotren.es/es/node/736 Tickets] at Euskotren Trena official website]</ref> The Barik travel ticket was initially only available on the Txorierri line, and it will be available for use on all lines once it is fully implemented.\n\nThe ticket pricing is based on zone-based rules.\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\n''Euskotren Trena'' uses several trains from four different series, named UT200, UT300, UT3500 and the newest UT900, all produced by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]]. As the whole network is electrified, all the units are electric. The oldest are the trains from the UT3500 series, which started operations in the 1970s as a replacement for the very old and rather dilapidated trains of the Ferrocarriles Vascongados. The UT900 series use state-of-the-art technology and started operations in 2011.\n\n=== Current fleet ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" \n|-\n!Class\n!Image\n!Type\n!Top speed (km/h)\n!Cars per set\n!Routes operated\n!Built\n!Notes\n|-\n|EMU 900\n|[[File:EuskoTren Hendaye.JPG|100px]]\n|[[Electric multiple unit]]\n|90\n|4\n|Metro Donostialdea<br>Durangaldea line\n|2011\u2013present\n|New units started operating in Topo's line.

The developments do not include any expansion of the lines or new lines (those not yet proposed or planned) but the improvements of the current network, with new stations, alternate routes and a second rail track in areas where there is only one, as well as the elimination, or at least reduction, of all the [[level crossing]]s.\n\n*'''Euba-Iurreta section'''. The section between Euba, in [[Amorebieta-Etxano]] and [[Iurreta]] is currently being upgraded to include a second track, in order to improve frequencies and eliminate ten level crossings. This development is part of the ''Durango+'' project, which aims to improve the service and frequencies in the [[Durangaldea]] region. It was scheduled to be finished in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20090806/vizcaya/desdoblamiento-ferrea-hasta-abadino-20090806.html|title=El desdoblamiento de la v\u00eda f\u00e9rrea hasta Abadi\u00f1o enfilara en oto\u00f1o su recta final|editor=El Correo}}</ref>\n*'''Iurreta-Durango-Abadi\u00f1o section'''.

The squadron, by then based at [[Bickendorf]] in Germany, was disbanded in 1922.<ref name=aoa/>\n\nThe squadron re-formed at [[RAF Northolt]] in West London on 1 April 1923, operating the [[Airco DH.9A|de Havilland DH.9A]].<ref name=aoa/> In 1924, it moved to [[RAF Andover]] in [[Hampshire]] and converted to the [[Fairey Fawn]], a single-engined biplane bomber.<ref name=aoa/> The Fawns were replaced in 1926 with the [[Fairey Fox]], which influenced the adoption of the fox's head as part of the squadron badge and the squadron's motto.<ref name=aoa/> The squadron was the only RAF user of the Fairey Fox and its performance was superior to other types, resulting in the motto of 'Leads the Field'. In 1931, the squadron re-equipped with the [[Sydney Camm]] designed [[Hawker Hart]]. In October 1935 the squadron moved to [[Aden]], but returned to Andover in August 1936.<ref name=aoa/> The Harts were replaced by the [[Hawker Hind]] in 1936 and in 1938 the squadron was equipped with [[Fairey Battle]]s.<ref name=aoa/>\n\nOn the first day of the [[Second World War]] the squadron moved to [[France]] to begin operations. On 12 May 1940, over the [[Albert Canal]], Belgium, one bridge in particular was being used by the invading [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], with protection from fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft and machine-guns. The RAF was ordered to demolish this vital bridge, and five [[Fairey Battle]]s from the squadron were dispatched. They met an intensive anti-aircraft fire, but the mission was accomplished, much of the success being due to the coolness and resource of the pilot [[Donald Edward Garland|Flying Officer Garland]] of the leading aircraft and the navigation of [[Thomas Gray (VC)|Sergeant Gray]]. Notwithstanding the success of the mission, the leading aircraft and three others did not return. Flying Officer Garland and Sergeant Gray were both posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 34870|date=11 June 1940 |page=3516}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force- France, 1939-1940 C356.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of eight men in the snow looking at a map placed flat on the ground.|[[Fairey Battle]] crews of No. 12 Squadron RAF consult their maps on the snow-covered airfield at [[Amifontaine]], France.

On 12 May 1940, over the [[Albert Canal]], Belgium, one bridge in particular was being used by the invading [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], with protection from fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft and machine-guns. The RAF was ordered to demolish this vital bridge, and five [[Fairey Battle]]s from the squadron were dispatched. They met an intensive anti-aircraft fire, but the mission was accomplished, much of the success being due to the coolness and resource of the pilot [[Donald Edward Garland|Flying Officer Garland]] of the leading aircraft and the navigation of [[Thomas Gray (VC)|Sergeant Gray]]. Notwithstanding the success of the mission, the leading aircraft and three others did not return.

Between subsequent [[Operation Herrick]] deployments during 2011, No. 12 (B) Squadron was deployed in support of [[Operation Ellamy]], the UK\u2019s participation in the military intervention in Libya under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]]. This saw ten aircrew deploy to [[Gioia del Colle Air Base|Gioia del Colle]] in southern Italy to bolster the Tornado component during the peak of operations. The remainder of the squadron was held at readiness to move to RAF Marham to launch [[Storm Shadow]] raids on hardened Libyan targets. These missions required three air-to-air refuelling brackets on the outward journey and one further on return to Gioia Del Colle.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/12b-squadron-says-goodbye-tornado-gr4/|title=12(B) Squadron says goodbye to the Tornado Gr4|date=14 March 2018|publisher=Defence Journal|accessdate=22 June 2019}}</ref> No. 12 (B) Squadron carried out their last tour of Afghanistan from July to October 2013, being replaced by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|No. 617 Squadron]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-forces-operations-in-afghanistan#chronology-of-events---2013 |title=Chronology of events - 2013 |publisher=Ministry of Defence |website=gov.uk |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20171011151043/https://www.raf.mod.uk/rafmarham/aboutus/12sqnhome.cfm |title=12 (Bomber) Squadron |publisher=Royal Air Force |website=raf.mod.uk |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref> The squadron disbanded on 31 March 2014 under the command of Wing Commander Simon Strasdin.<ref name=\"Reach for the Stars 2013\">{{cite web | title=RAF Lossiemouth \u2013 Typhoon Main Operating Base 2 | website=Reach for the Stars | date=August 14, 2013 | url=http://igale.wordpress.com/2013/08/14/raf-lossiemouth-typhoon-main-operating-base-2/ | access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/3464219/|title=Disbanded squadron will keep history alive|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive/final-salute-for-historic-raf-squadrons-28032014|title=Final salute for historic RAF squadrons|publisher=Royal Air Force}}</ref>[[File:12 Sqn Tornado at Kandahar Airfield MOD 45150432.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a Tornado taking off from an Airfield in Afghanistan|No. 12 (B) Squadron [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado GR4]] ''ZA607'' takes off from [[Kandahar International Airport|Kandahar airfield]] in Afghanistan during 2009.|left]]\n\nAll Tornado aircraft were due to be withdrawn from RAF operations by the end of 2015.
