Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365}} Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|382\u2013389}} The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The engine nozzles could gimbal \u00b110.5\u00b0 in pitch, and \u00b18.5\u00b0 in [[Aircraft_principal_axes#Vertical_axis_(yaw)|yaw]] during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The [[titanium alloy]] reusable engines were independent from the orbiter vehicle, and would be removed and replaced in between flights.  The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid rocket.  The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of {{convert|3285|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}, which was reduced to {{convert|3010|psi|kPa|sigfig=4|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} on the Block II RS-25 engine, which had a larger [[de Laval nozzle|throat]] area. The engine nozzle is {{convert|113|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}} tall and has an interior diameter of {{convert|90.3|in|cm|sigfig=3|sp=us|order=flip|adj=off}}.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|106\u2013107}}\n\n====Orbital Maneuvering System====\n{{main|Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System}}\n\nThe Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted [[AJ10|AJ10-190]] engines and the associated fuel pods.

At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}} At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed.

From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].  Beginning with [[STS-74]], the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the [[Mir space station]].  In its final decade of operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the construction of the [[International Space Station]].<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|III\u2013108, 123, 224, 264}} Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet.

The orbiter vehicle maneuvered to an upside down, tail first orientation and began a 2-4 minute OMS burn approximately 20 minutes before it reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position with a 40\u00b0 angle-of-attack, and the forward RCS jets were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry. The orbiter vehicle's reentry was defined as starting at an altitude {{convert|400000|ft|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}, when it was traveling approximately Mach 25.  The orbiter vehicle's reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent unsafe heating of the TPS.

It was an enthusiasm he shared with his friends, the composers [[Constant Lambert]] and [[William Walton]] and the conductor [[Hyam Greenbaum]]. Hughes taught himself double bass (using a German string bass made of tin<ref name=rough>Carr, Ian and others. ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'' (2004) p 378</ref>) and formed his own jazz group in 1930.

It was an enthusiasm he shared with his friends, the composers [[Constant Lambert]] and [[William Walton]] and the conductor [[Hyam Greenbaum]]. Hughes taught himself double bass (using a German string bass made of tin<ref name=rough>Carr, Ian and others. ''The Rough Guide to Jazz'' (2004) p 378</ref>) and formed his own jazz group in 1930. The group was one of the earliest artists signed to [[Decca Records]] in England, and over 30 sessions were recorded between 1930 and 1933.<ref name=clarke>[http://www.donaldclarkemusicbox.com/encyclopedia/detail.php?s=1619 Clarke, Donald. ''Encyclopedia of Popular Music'']</ref> Originally billed as Spike Hughes and his Decca-Dents, he reportedly did not like the name and after three sessions it was changed either to \"his Dance Orchestra\" or \"his Three Blind Mice\" for smaller sessions. These records were used as the basis for the \"hastily assembled\" jazz ballet ''High Yellow'', put on by the [[Camargo Society]] at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in London, June 1932.<ref>Lloyd, Stephen. ''Beyond the Rio Grande'' (2014), p 173</ref> Choreography for the ballet was by [[Frederick Ashton]] and [[Buddy Bradley (choreographer)|Buddy Bradley]]. The title comes from the once widely used, now discredited term [[high yellow]], describing mixed black and white ancestry.\n\nFrom 1931 Hughes played regularly with the [[Jack Hylton|Jack Hylton Band]].<ref name=rough/> But his jazz recording career culminated in 1933 with his visit to New York, where he arranged three historic recording sessions involving members of [[Benny Carter]]'s and [[Luis Russell]]'s orchestras with [[Coleman Hawkins]] and [[Henry \"Red\" Allen]] from [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band.<ref>'Spike Hughes and Benny Carter, 1933' in ''Jazz Times'', 1 September 1997</ref> These fourteen sides were mostly Hughes' own compositions.<ref name=second_movement/><ref>[https://www.challengerecords.com/products/1182852230 Spike Hughes 1933.

The series was named as a play on [[coarse fishing]]; other later ''Coarse'' books were written by [[Michael Green (humorist)|Michael Green]].\n\n==Personal life==\nHughes married Margery Pargeter in 1931 but the marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to Sybil Milton in 1945.

They were represented by six known [[species]] in four or five [[genus|genera]], although only two species survive in two genera today. They are understood to form a distinct lineage within the passerines, but authorities differ on their assignment to the [[oscines]] or [[suboscine]]s (the two suborders that between them make up the Passeriformes). More recent<!-- DNA-DNA hybridisation [were only the first; by now most studies support it] --> studies suggest that they form a third, most ancient, suborder '''Acanthisitti''' and have no living close relatives at all. They are called \"wrens\" due to similarities in appearance and behaviour to the true [[wren]]s (Troglodytidae), but are not members of that family.\n\nNew Zealand wrens are mostly insectivorous foragers of New Zealand's forests, with one species, the [[New Zealand rock wren]], being restricted to alpine areas. Both the remaining species are poor fliers and four of the five extinct species are known to be, or are suspected of having been, flightless (based on observations of living birds and the size of their [[sternum|sterna]]); along with the [[long-legged bunting]] from [[Tenerife]], one of the [[Canary Islands]], they are the only passerines known to have lost the ability to fly. Of the species for which the [[plumage]] is known, they are drab-coloured birds with brown-green plumage.  They form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonds to raise their young, laying their eggs in small nests in trees or amongst rocks. They are [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] and like all New Zealand passerines, for the most part, are [[Sedentism|sedentary]].\n\nNew Zealand wrens, like many New Zealand birds, suffered several extinctions after the arrival of humans in New Zealand. Two species became extinct after the arrival of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and the [[Polynesian rat]] and are known today only from [[fossil]] remains; a third, [[Lyall's wren]], became extinct on the main islands, surviving only as a [[Relict (biology)|relict]] population on [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]] in the Cook Strait. This species and the [[bushwren]] became extinct after the arrival of Europeans, with the bushwren surviving until 1972. Of the two remaining species, the [[Rifleman (bird)|rifleman]] is still common in both the North and South Islands, while the [[New Zealand rock wren]] is restricted to the alpine areas of the South Island and is considered vulnerable.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe taxonomy of the New Zealand wrens has been a subject of considerable debate since their discovery, although they have long been known to be an unusual family. In the 1880s, [[Henry Ogg Forbes|Forbes]] assigned the New Zealand wrens to the suboscines related to the [[cotinga]]s and the [[pitta]]s (and gave the family the name Xenicidae). Later, they were thought to be closer to the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbird]]s and [[antbird]]s. Sibley's 1970 study comparing egg-white [[protein]]s moved them to the oscines, but later studies, including the 1982 DNA-DNA hybridization study, suggested the family was a sister taxon to the suboscines and the oscines. This theory has proven most robust since then and the New Zealand wrens might be the survivors of a lineage of passerines that was isolated when New Zealand broke away from [[Gondwana]] 82\u201385 [[million years ago]] (Mya),<ref>Ericson P, Christidis L, Cooper, A, Irestedt M, Jackson J, Johansson US, Norman JA. (2002). A Gondwanan origin of passerine birds supported by DNA sequences of the endemic New Zealand wrens. ''Proc Biol Sci''.  269(#1,488):235-41.</ref> though a pre-[[Paleogene]] origin of passerines is highly disputed and tends to be rejected in more recent studies.\n\nAs no evidence indicates passerines were flightless when they arrived on New Zealand (that [[apomorph]]y is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in Passeriformes), they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the [[Mesozoic]]. As unequivocal Passeriformes are known from [[Australia]] some 55 Mya,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}<!-- also missing in Passeriformes article?! 'The Emu' paper by Boles, or mentioned in some Emu paper by Boles. --> the acanthisittids' ancestors likely arrived in the [[Late Paleocene]] from Australia or the then-[[temperate]] [[Antarctic]] coasts. [[Plate tectonics]] indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly 1,500&nbsp;km (1,000 miles) at that time. New Zealand's minimum distance from Australia is a bit more today \u2013 some 1,700&nbsp;km/1,100 miles - whereas it is now at least 2,500&nbsp;km (1,550 miles) from Antarctica.\n\nThe extant species are closely related and thought to be descendants of birds that survived a genetic bottleneck caused by the marine transgression during the [[Oligocene]], when most of New Zealand was under water.<ref>Cooper A. & Cooper R.

The extant genus ''Acanthisitta'' has one species, the [[Rifleman (bird)|rifleman]] and the other surviving genus, ''Xenicus'', includes the New Zealand rock wren and the recently extinct bushwren. Some authorities have retained Lyall's wren in ''Xenicus'' as well, but it is often afforded its own monotypic genus, ''Traversia''.

They were represented by six known [[species]] in four or five [[genus|genera]], although only two species survive in two genera today. They are understood to form a distinct lineage within the passerines, but authorities differ on their assignment to the [[oscines]] or [[suboscine]]s (the two suborders that between them make up the Passeriformes). More recent<!-- DNA-DNA hybridisation [were only the first; by now most studies support it] --> studies suggest that they form a third, most ancient, suborder '''Acanthisitti''' and have no living close relatives at all. They are called \"wrens\" due to similarities in appearance and behaviour to the true [[wren]]s (Troglodytidae), but are not members of that family.\n\nNew Zealand wrens are mostly insectivorous foragers of New Zealand's forests, with one species, the [[New Zealand rock wren]], being restricted to alpine areas. Both the remaining species are poor fliers and four of the five extinct species are known to be, or are suspected of having been, flightless (based on observations of living birds and the size of their [[sternum|sterna]]); along with the [[long-legged bunting]] from [[Tenerife]], one of the [[Canary Islands]], they are the only passerines known to have lost the ability to fly. Of the species for which the [[plumage]] is known, they are drab-coloured birds with brown-green plumage.  They form [[monogamy|monogamous]] pair bonds to raise their young, laying their eggs in small nests in trees or amongst rocks. They are [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] and like all New Zealand passerines, for the most part, are [[Sedentism|sedentary]].\n\nNew Zealand wrens, like many New Zealand birds, suffered several extinctions after the arrival of humans in New Zealand. Two species became extinct after the arrival of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and the [[Polynesian rat]] and are known today only from [[fossil]] remains; a third, [[Lyall's wren]], became extinct on the main islands, surviving only as a [[Relict (biology)|relict]] population on [[Stephens Island, New Zealand|Stephens Island]] in the Cook Strait. This species and the [[bushwren]] became extinct after the arrival of Europeans, with the bushwren surviving until 1972. Of the two remaining species, the [[Rifleman (bird)|rifleman]] is still common in both the North and South Islands, while the [[New Zealand rock wren]] is restricted to the alpine areas of the South Island and is considered vulnerable.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe taxonomy of the New Zealand wrens has been a subject of considerable debate since their discovery, although they have long been known to be an unusual family. In the 1880s, [[Henry Ogg Forbes|Forbes]] assigned the New Zealand wrens to the suboscines related to the [[cotinga]]s and the [[pitta]]s (and gave the family the name Xenicidae). Later, they were thought to be closer to the [[Ovenbird (family)|ovenbird]]s and [[antbird]]s. Sibley's 1970 study comparing egg-white [[protein]]s moved them to the oscines, but later studies, including the 1982 DNA-DNA hybridization study, suggested the family was a sister taxon to the suboscines and the oscines. This theory has proven most robust since then and the New Zealand wrens might be the survivors of a lineage of passerines that was isolated when New Zealand broke away from [[Gondwana]] 82\u201385 [[million years ago]] (Mya),<ref>Ericson P, Christidis L, Cooper, A, Irestedt M, Jackson J, Johansson US, Norman JA. (2002). A Gondwanan origin of passerine birds supported by DNA sequences of the endemic New Zealand wrens. ''Proc Biol Sci''.  269(#1,488):235-41.</ref> though a pre-[[Paleogene]] origin of passerines is highly disputed and tends to be rejected in more recent studies.\n\nAs no evidence indicates passerines were flightless when they arrived on New Zealand (that [[apomorph]]y is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in Passeriformes), they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the [[Mesozoic]]. As unequivocal Passeriformes are known from [[Australia]] some 55 Mya,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}<!-- also missing in Passeriformes article?! 'The Emu' paper by Boles, or mentioned in some Emu paper by Boles. --> the acanthisittids' ancestors likely arrived in the [[Late Paleocene]] from Australia or the then-[[temperate]] [[Antarctic]] coasts. [[Plate tectonics]] indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly 1,500&nbsp;km (1,000 miles) at that time. New Zealand's minimum distance from Australia is a bit more today \u2013 some 1,700&nbsp;km/1,100 miles - whereas it is now at least 2,500&nbsp;km (1,550 miles) from Antarctica.\n\nThe extant species are closely related and thought to be descendants of birds that survived a genetic bottleneck caused by the marine transgression during the [[Oligocene]], when most of New Zealand was under water.<ref>Cooper A. & Cooper R.

They may enter a state of [[torpor]] (like the [[hummingbird]]s of the Americas or a number of Australian passerines) during at least part of the winter, but this has not yet been proved.<ref name = \"HBW\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Wikispecies-inline|Acanthisittidae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q537702}}\n\n[[Category:Acanthisittidae|*]]\n[[Category:Birds of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Higher-level bird taxa restricted to New Zealand]]\n", "name_user": "Hemiauchenia", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_wren"}
