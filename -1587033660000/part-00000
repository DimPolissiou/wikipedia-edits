He was the first Australian to attain the rank of [[Lieutenant general (Australia)|lieutenant general]] and later [[General (Australia)|general]], and the first to lead a [[corps]]. As commander of the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], he was responsible for one of the most decisive victories and fastest pursuits in military history.\n\nThe son of a [[wikt:grazier|grazier]], Chauvel was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, a unit organised by his father, in 1886. After the family moved to [[Queensland]] he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|Queensland Mounted Infantry]] in 1890, and saw service during the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]]. He became a regular officer in 1896, and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland's initial contribution to the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. After the war, he was closely involved with the training of the [[Australian Light Horse]].\n\nPromoted to [[colonel]] in 1913, Chauvel became the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]] but the First World War broke out while he was still ''en route'' to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]], in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to [[Gallipoli]], where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line. He took charge of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the [[Anzac Mounted Division]], gaining victories in the [[Battle of Romani]] in August and the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December, and nearly winning the [[First Battle of Gaza]] in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Beersheba]] in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history's last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.\n\nIn 1919, Chauvel was appointed Inspector General, the Army's most senior post. He was forced to maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] from 1923 until his retirement in 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry George Chauvel was born in [[Tabulam, New South Wales]], on 16 April 1865, the second child of a [[wikt:grazier|grazier]], Charles Henry Edward Chauvel, and his wife Fanny Ada Mary, n\u00e9e James.<ref name=\"adb\">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Hill|first =Alec|year=1979|id=A070634b|title='Chauvel, Sir Henry George (Harry) (1865\u20131945)'|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> By 1884, Charles Henry Chauvel's [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] at Tabulam consisted of {{convert|96000|acre|ha|lk=on}}, on which he raised 12,000&nbsp;head of cattle and 320&nbsp;horses.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=3}}</ref> From an early age Henry George Chauvel was known as \"Harry\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=1}}</ref> He was educated at Mr Belcher's School near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], before going to [[Sydney Grammar School]] from 1874 to 1880, and [[Toowoomba Grammar School]] from 1881 to 1882. While at Sydney Grammar, Harry served in the school [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet unit]], rising to the rank of [[lance corporal]]. In 1886, Charles Henry was given permission to raise two troops of cavalry. On 14 March 1886, he was commissioned as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, with his sons Arthur and Harry becoming [[second lieutenant]]s, while his two younger sons became troopers. The unit escorted [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], [[Governor of New South Wales]], when he formally opened the railway at [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]] in 1886.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Drought in Australia|series of severe droughts]] in northern New South Wales, Charles Henry Chauvel sold his property at Tabulam in 1888 for \u00a350,000. After paying his debts, he bought a much smaller {{convert|12000|acre|ha|adj=on}} property at [[Canning Downs]] on the [[Darling Downs]] in Queensland. In 1889, Harry Chauvel embarked on a solo tour of Europe, visiting Venice, Rome, Florence, Paris and London. While in the United Kingdom, he watched military manoeuvres near [[Aldershot]] in the presence of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany]]. Harry resigned his commission in the New South Wales Military Forces when he moved to Queensland, but on 9 January 1890 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|Queensland Mounted Infantry]]. After completing his examinations for the rank, he was confirmed as lieutenant in June 1890.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nChauvel's unit was called up in March 1891 during the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|shearers' strike]] that had begun earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small detachment of [[Queensland Police]], Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of [[strikebreaker]]s to a station north of [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted [[sheep shearer]]s. When the inspector in charge of the police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in [[Clermont, Queensland|Clermont]], and later the district around [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1896, Chauvel transferred to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the [[9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment|Moreton Regiment]]. He was sent to the United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Victoria]]. Sporting the [[emu]] feathers worn by Queensland units, he marched with the colonial troops through London behind [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] on 21 June 1897. Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at [[Hythe, Kent]], and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]] at Aldershot.

For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer, signing up volunteers from the Darling Downs. The [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out in October 1899, and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> They disembarked at [[Cape Town]] on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen|Lord Methuen]] at the [[Orange River]]. The Queensland Mounted Infantry's first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]]. In February, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]]'s Cavalry Division. After a strenuous march, the Cavalry Division relieved the [[Siege of Kimberley]] on 15 February.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nIn the reorganisation that followed, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General [[Edward Hutton (British Army officer)|Edward Hutton]]'s 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade, along with the Canadian and New Zealand mounted units. Chauvel distinguished himself fighting alongside a group of New Zealanders and capturing a [[Maxim gun]]. The Queensland Mounted Infantry participated in the capture of [[Pretoria]] and the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]]. Chauvel was given a mixed force of British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand mounted troops that became known as \"Chauvel's Mounted Infantry\", with [[Victor Sellheim]] as his chief of staff. Initially, Chauvel was given the mission of escorting 10,000 head of cattle to [[Belfast, Mpumalanga]] to supply the troops in the eastern Transvaal. However, his force was diverted by local commanders, who assigned it to burning homesteads sheltering Boer commandos and attacking Boer units.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=22\u201320}}</ref> The Queensland Mounted Infantry embarked for Australia on 13 December 1900.

When Chauvel returned to Australia on 17 January, he found that during his absence he had become an officer in the newly formed [[History of the Australian Army#Boer War 1899\u20131902|Australian Army]]. A force of 14,000&nbsp;troops was assembled for the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] on 9 May 1901 in [[Melbourne]]; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent, his first Federal posting. He became Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at [[Townsville]], Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was appointed to command of the [[Australian Commonwealth Horse|7th Commonwealth Light Horse]], a unit newly raised for service in South Africa,<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 30-31\"/> with the local rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref name=LTCOL>{{London Gazette|issue=27583|date=4 August 1903|page=4905|nolink=y}} ''Commander, 7th Commonwealth Light Horse''</ref> Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at [[Durban]] on 22 June, three weeks after the war ended. It therefore re-embarked for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields. On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer, Northern Military District once more. He was promoted to the [[brevet (military)|brevet rank]] of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 30-31\">{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Hutton, now [[Chief of Army (Australia)|General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces]], sent Chauvel to [[South Australia]] to organise the light horse regiments there. On returning to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He was promoted to the [[Military rank#Types of rank|substantive rank]] of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]] in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General [[John Charles Hoad|Charles Hoad]]. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas on the nature of [[mounted infantry]]. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 33-37\">{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=33\u201337}}</ref>\n\nChauvel knew Keith Jopp of [[Newmarket, Queensland]] even before the Boer War, and while stationed in Brisbane, Chauvel and Major [[Brudenell White]] played tennis at the Jopps' place with their daughters Dora and Sibyl. Chauvel became engaged to Sibyl in January 1906, and they were married on 16 June 1906 at [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane|All Saints Anglican Church]], Brisbane.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 33-37\"/> Their union ultimately produced two sons and two daughters.<ref name= \"adb\"/> That year Chauvel also sold the property at Canning Downs South.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 33-37\"/> In the shuffle of senior positions that followed Hoad's death in 1911, Chauvel was appointed to the Military Board in Melbourne as Adjutant General. As such, Chauvel was involved in the implementation of the [[Conscription in Australia|universal training scheme]]. Chauvel was particularly involved with the training of the [[Australian Light Horse|light horse]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=40\u201342}}</ref> \"When the next war comes,\" White predicted, \"it will only need an [[Turner Ashby|Ashby]] or a [[J.E.B.

While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the [[War Office]] in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF's proposed quarters on the [[Salisbury Plain]]. He made frequent visits to the site and had a [[Royal Australian Engineers]] officer, Major [[Cecil Henry Foott]], appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel persuaded the [[High Commission of Australia in London|High Commissioner for Australia in London]], former Prime Minister Sir [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]], to approach [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major [[Thomas Blamey]], Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the [[ocean liner]] {{SS|Mooltan||6}} on 28 November 1914, arriving at [[Port Said]] on 10 December 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=42\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Gallipoli===\nChauvel began training his brigade upon arrival in Egypt.

Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> He also formed special [[sniper]] groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=248\u2013253}}</ref> Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel [[James Harold Cannan|J. H. Cannan]] was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major [[Sydney Herring|S. C. E. Herring]] was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=206\u2013229}}</ref> For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.<ref name=\"mid2\">{{London Gazette|issue=29354|date=5 November 1915|page=11001 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''mentioned in despatches (Quinn's Post)''</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 1915, Chauvel was promoted to [[Brigadier General#Australia|brigadier general]], back-dated to when he assumed command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade on 10 December 1914.<ref name= BrigGen>{{London Gazette|issue=29224|date=9 July 1915|page=6707|nolink=y}} ''appointment to Brigadier General''</ref> He spent six weeks in Egypt, in June and July, in hospital with [[pleurisy]], but returned in time for the [[Battle of Sari Bair|August offensive]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=58}}</ref> for which he was mentioned in despatches.<ref name=\"mid3\">{{London Gazette|issue=29455|date=28 January 1916|page=1207 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''mentioned in despatches (August offensive)''</ref> Chauvel was acting commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division for short periods in September and October in Godley's absence.

The majority of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops, including a generous number to officers of Murray's staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=192}}</ref> Lawrence was made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]], but Chauvel, having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli, was recommended for a lesser award, which he refused.

The order was ignored by Brigadier-General [[Charles Frederick Cox]] of the [[1st Light Horse Brigade (Australia)|1st Light Horse Brigade]], whose troops carried the position, and was cancelled by Chetwode.

In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger and the threat of its reinforcement was greater.

This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals [[Granville Ryrie|Ryrie]] and Chaytor, although they believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they could not see the whole battle.

However he overrode Chauvel's own preference to appoint a [[Royal Horse Guards]] officer, Brigadier General [[Richard Howard-Vyse]], known as \"[[Wombat]]\", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=118\u2013123}}</ref> A \"brass-bound brigadier\" was quoted as saying, \"Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paterson|1934|p=120}}</ref> On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, \"I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand \u2013 it is my own trade \u2013 but Fate has willed it otherwise.\"<ref name=\"Hill 1978 118\"/><ref group=\"Note\">Murat's Reserve Cavalry in 1805 had been 22,000 while Bessieres' Reserve Cavalry in 1809 had been 29,000, both larger than Chauvel's 20,000. Hill notes the war establishment of a mounted division in July 1917 was 7,991, so Chauvel would have commanded about 24,000. He also notes the reference to \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" in the name of a film directed by Charles Chauvel, (Chauvel's nephew) was a myth. [Hill 1978 pp. 119\u201320, note]</ref> At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode's \"arms length\" style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=119\u201320}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]] in October 1917, it was again Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the critical role. Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have the resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at [[Beersheba]],<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=345\u2013351}}</ref> in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=363\u2013367}}</ref> The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a [[mounted infantry]] [[bayonet]] charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade&nbsp;\u2013 the last of history's great cavalry charges&nbsp;\u2013 to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=394\u2013402}}</ref> For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more,<ref name= \"mid8\">{{London Gazette|issue=30480|date=15 January 1918|page=937 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''mentioned in despatches (Beersheba)''</ref><ref name=\"mid9\">{{London Gazette|issue= 30492|date=25 January 1918|page=1195 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''mentioned in despatches (Beersheba)''</ref> and appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in the [[1918 New Year Honours]] List.<ref name=\"kcb\">{{London Gazette|issue=30624|date=11 April 1918|page=4409 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB)''</ref>\n\nChauvel, however, was still disappointed with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing the commitment of the Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=439\u2013444}}</ref> In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=651\u2013657}}</ref> In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=142\u2013145}}</ref> Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the [[5th Light Horse Brigade]], formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of [[Spahis]] and [[Chasseurs d'Afrique]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=639\u2013641}}</ref>\n[[File:AWMH10659Damascus.jpg|thumb|Lieutenant General Sir Harry Chauvel, Commander in Chief, Desert Mounted Corps leading his troops through Damascus on 2 October 1918 the day after his corps captured the city]]\n[[File:AWMB00370DamascusFeisal.jpg|thumb|Prince Feisal leaving Chauvel's Desert Mounted Corps Headquarters in Damascus]]\n\nIn September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of two of his mounted divisions.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=688\u2013692}}</ref> Allenby launched a surprise attack on the enemy and won the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]].

By April, the situation had calmed and Chauvel was able to hand over command of the AIF in the Middle East to Ryrie. Chauvel and Lady Chauvel then headed for London on the RMS ''Malwa''. They arrived in time for him to lead Australian troops on a victory march through the city on 3 May.

In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement in the face of defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=200\u2013203}}</ref> On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=207\u2013209}}</ref> Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=215}}</ref> In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of [[General (Australia)|general]].<ref name=\"adb\"/> He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When [[conscription]] was abolished by Prime Minister [[James Scullin]]'s government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=217\u2013219}}</ref>\n[[File:Harry Chauvel J00503.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chauvel at Maribyrnong camp in March 1923.|alt=Head and shoulders of man in Army uniform with Sam Brown belt and slouch hat with emu feathers.]]\n\nChauvel's sons Ian and Edward resigned their commissions in the Australian Army in 1930 and 1932 respectively, and accepted commissions in cavalry regiments of the [[Indian Army (1895\u20131947)|British Indian Army]]. His daughter [[Elyne Mitchell|Elyne]] married [[Thomas Walter Mitchell]], a grazier. Chauvel became a frequent visitor to their property \"Towong Hill\" near [[Corryong]], Victoria.

He was the first Australian to attain the rank of [[Lieutenant general (Australia)|lieutenant general]] and later [[General (Australia)|general]], and the first to lead a [[corps]]. As commander of the [[Desert Mounted Corps]], he was responsible for one of the most decisive victories and fastest pursuits in military history.\n\nThe son of a [[wikt:grazier|grazier]], Chauvel was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, a unit organised by his father, in 1886. After the family moved to [[Queensland]] he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|Queensland Mounted Infantry]] in 1890, and saw service during the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]]. He became a regular officer in 1896, and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland's initial contribution to the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. After the war, he was closely involved with the training of the [[Australian Light Horse]].\n\nPromoted to [[colonel]] in 1913, Chauvel became the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]] but the First World War broke out while he was still ''en route'' to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]], in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to [[Gallipoli]], where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line. He took charge of the [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the [[Anzac Mounted Division]], gaining victories in the [[Battle of Romani]] in August and the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December, and nearly winning the [[First Battle of Gaza]] in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Beersheba]] in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history's last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]]. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.\n\nIn 1919, Chauvel was appointed Inspector General, the Army's most senior post. He was forced to maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] from 1923 until his retirement in 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the [[Volunteer Defence Corps (Australia)|Volunteer Defence Corps]].\n\n==Early life==\nHenry George Chauvel was born in [[Tabulam, New South Wales]], on 16 April 1865, the second child of a [[wikt:grazier|grazier]], Charles Henry Edward Chauvel, and his wife Fanny Ada Mary, n\u00e9e James.<ref name=\"adb\">{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Hill|first =Alec|year=1979|id=A070634b|title='Chauvel, Sir Henry George (Harry) (1865\u20131945)'|accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> By 1884, Charles Henry Chauvel's [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]] at Tabulam consisted of {{convert|96000|acre|ha|lk=on}}, on which he raised 12,000&nbsp;head of cattle and 320&nbsp;horses.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=3}}</ref> From an early age Henry George Chauvel was known as \"Harry\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=1}}</ref> He was educated at Mr Belcher's School near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], before going to [[Sydney Grammar School]] from 1874 to 1880, and [[Toowoomba Grammar School]] from 1881 to 1882. While at Sydney Grammar, Harry served in the school [[Australian Army Cadets|cadet unit]], rising to the rank of [[lance corporal]]. In 1886, Charles Henry was given permission to raise two troops of cavalry. On 14 March 1886, he was commissioned as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, with his sons Arthur and Harry becoming [[second lieutenant]]s, while his two younger sons became troopers. The unit escorted [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], [[Governor of New South Wales]], when he formally opened the railway at [[Tenterfield, New South Wales|Tenterfield]] in 1886.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=4\u20136}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Drought in Australia|series of severe droughts]] in northern New South Wales, Charles Henry Chauvel sold his property at Tabulam in 1888 for \u00a350,000. After paying his debts, he bought a much smaller {{convert|12000|acre|ha|adj=on}} property at [[Canning Downs]] on the [[Darling Downs]] in Queensland. In 1889, Harry Chauvel embarked on a solo tour of Europe, visiting Venice, Rome, Florence, Paris and London. While in the United Kingdom, he watched military manoeuvres near [[Aldershot]] in the presence of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany]]. Harry resigned his commission in the New South Wales Military Forces when he moved to Queensland, but on 9 January 1890 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the [[2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment|Queensland Mounted Infantry]]. After completing his examinations for the rank, he was confirmed as lieutenant in June 1890.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nChauvel's unit was called up in March 1891 during the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike|shearers' strike]] that had begun earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small detachment of [[Queensland Police]], Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of [[strikebreaker]]s to a station north of [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted [[sheep shearer]]s. When the inspector in charge of the police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in [[Clermont, Queensland|Clermont]], and later the district around [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1896, Chauvel transferred to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the [[9th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment|Moreton Regiment]]. He was sent to the United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the [[Diamond Jubilee]] of [[Queen Victoria]]. Sporting the [[emu]] feathers worn by Queensland units, he marched with the colonial troops through London behind [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] on 21 June 1897. Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at [[Hythe, Kent]], and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion, [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] and 2nd Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]] at Aldershot. On returning to Australia, he became a staff officer at Headquarters, Queensland Defence Force.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=10\u201312}}</ref>\n\n==Boer War==\n[[File:Boer War officers P03206.001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Officers of the Queensland Mounted Infantry.

For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer, signing up volunteers from the Darling Downs. The [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out in October 1899, and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=14\u201316}}</ref> They disembarked at [[Cape Town]] on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under [[Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen|Lord Methuen]] at the [[Orange River]]. The Queensland Mounted Infantry's first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]]. In February, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major General]] [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]]'s Cavalry Division. After a strenuous march, the Cavalry Division relieved the [[Siege of Kimberley]] on 15 February.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nIn the reorganisation that followed, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General [[Edward Hutton (British Army officer)|Edward Hutton]]'s 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade, along with the Canadian and New Zealand mounted units. Chauvel distinguished himself fighting alongside a group of New Zealanders and capturing a [[Maxim gun]]. The Queensland Mounted Infantry participated in the capture of [[Pretoria]] and the [[Battle of Diamond Hill]]. Chauvel was given a mixed force of British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand mounted troops that became known as \"Chauvel's Mounted Infantry\", with [[Victor Sellheim]] as his chief of staff. Initially, Chauvel was given the mission of escorting 10,000 head of cattle to [[Belfast, Mpumalanga]] to supply the troops in the eastern Transvaal. However, his force was diverted by local commanders, who assigned it to burning homesteads sheltering Boer commandos and attacking Boer units.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=22\u201320}}</ref> The Queensland Mounted Infantry embarked for Australia on 13 December 1900. They reached Brisbane on 17 January 1901 and the regiment was disbanded there on 23 January.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=30}}</ref> For his part in the fighting, Chauvel was [[mentioned in despatches]],<ref name=\"mid1\">{{London Gazette|issue=27305|date=16 April 1901|page=2607}} ''mentioned in despatches (Boer War)''</ref> and appointed a [[Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG).<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27306|date=19 April 1901|page=2699|nolink=y}} ''Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG)''</ref>\n[[File:Chauvel 33969r.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Colonel H.

When Chauvel returned to Australia on 17 January, he found that during his absence he had become an officer in the newly formed [[History of the Australian Army#Boer War 1899\u20131902|Australian Army]]. A force of 14,000&nbsp;troops was assembled for the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] on 9 May 1901 in [[Melbourne]]; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent, his first Federal posting. He became Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at [[Townsville]], Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was appointed to command of the [[Australian Commonwealth Horse|7th Commonwealth Light Horse]], a unit newly raised for service in South Africa,<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 30-31\"/> with the local rank of [[lieutenant colonel]].<ref name=LTCOL>{{London Gazette|issue=27583|date=4 August 1903|page=4905|nolink=y}} ''Commander, 7th Commonwealth Light Horse''</ref> Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at [[Durban]] on 22 June, three weeks after the war ended. It therefore re-embarked for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields. On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer, Northern Military District once more. He was promoted to the [[brevet (military)|brevet rank]] of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 30-31\">{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=30\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Hutton, now [[Chief of Army (Australia)|General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces]], sent Chauvel to [[South Australia]] to organise the light horse regiments there. On returning to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He was promoted to the [[Military rank#Types of rank|substantive rank]] of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the [[Imperial General Staff]] in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General [[John Charles Hoad|Charles Hoad]]. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas on the nature of [[mounted infantry]]. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 33-37\">{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=33\u201337}}</ref>\n\nChauvel knew Keith Jopp of [[Newmarket, Queensland]] even before the Boer War, and while stationed in Brisbane, Chauvel and Major [[Brudenell White]] played tennis at the Jopps' place with their daughters Dora and Sibyl. Chauvel became engaged to Sibyl in January 1906, and they were married on 16 June 1906 at [[All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane|All Saints Anglican Church]], Brisbane.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 33-37\"/> Their union ultimately produced two sons and two daughters.<ref name= \"adb\"/> That year Chauvel also sold the property at Canning Downs South.<ref name=\"Hill, pp. 33-37\"/> In the shuffle of senior positions that followed Hoad's death in 1911, Chauvel was appointed to the Military Board in Melbourne as Adjutant General. As such, Chauvel was involved in the implementation of the [[Conscription in Australia|universal training scheme]]. Chauvel was particularly involved with the training of the [[Australian Light Horse|light horse]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=40\u201342}}</ref> \"When the next war comes,\" White predicted, \"it will only need an [[Turner Ashby|Ashby]] or a [[J.E.B.

While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the [[War Office]] in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the [[1st Light Horse Brigade]] of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF's proposed quarters on the [[Salisbury Plain]]. He made frequent visits to the site and had a [[Royal Australian Engineers]] officer, Major [[Cecil Henry Foott]], appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel persuaded the [[High Commission of Australia in London|High Commissioner for Australia in London]], former Prime Minister Sir [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]], to approach [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major [[Thomas Blamey]], Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the [[ocean liner]] {{SS|Mooltan||6}} on 28 November 1914, arriving at [[Port Said]] on 10 December 1914.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=42\u201346}}</ref>\n\n===Gallipoli===\nChauvel began training his brigade upon arrival in Egypt.

On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel [[James Harold Cannan|J. H. Cannan]] was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major [[Sydney Herring|S. C. E. Herring]] was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky.<ref>{{harvnb|Bean|1924|pp=206\u2013229}}</ref> For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.<ref name=\"mid2\">{{London Gazette|issue=29354|date=5 November 1915|page=11001 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''mentioned in despatches (Quinn's Post)''</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 1915, Chauvel was promoted to [[Brigadier General#Australia|brigadier general]], back-dated to when he assumed command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade on 10 December 1914.<ref name= BrigGen>{{London Gazette|issue=29224|date=9 July 1915|page=6707|nolink=y}} ''appointment to Brigadier General''</ref> He spent six weeks in Egypt, in June and July, in hospital with [[pleurisy]], but returned in time for the [[Battle of Sari Bair|August offensive]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=58}}</ref> for which he was mentioned in despatches.<ref name=\"mid3\">{{London Gazette|issue=29455|date=28 January 1916|page=1207 |supp=y|nolink=y}} ''mentioned in despatches (August offensive)''</ref> Chauvel was acting commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division for short periods in September and October in Godley's absence.

Its advanced troops&nbsp;\u2013 including Chauvel's Anzac Mounted Division&nbsp;\u2013 became part of the newly formed [[Desert Column]] under Major-General Sir [[Philip Chetwode]], a British cavalry [[baronet]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|p=207}}</ref> In the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December 1916, Chauvel therefore was answerable to the newly arrived Chetwode, instead of the distant commanders on the Canal.

The order was ignored by Brigadier-General [[Charles Frederick Cox]] of the [[1st Light Horse Brigade (Australia)|1st Light Horse Brigade]], whose troops carried the position, and was cancelled by Chetwode.

In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger and the threat of its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle.

A British regular army officer fresh from experience in the [[Senussi Campaign]], Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to the policy of the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]], which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir [[Robert Anderson (general)|Robert Anderson]] to [[Cairo]] to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors.

Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition, entering it after dark, only to have an out-of-touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw, despite Chauvel's protests. This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals [[Granville Ryrie|Ryrie]] and Chaytor, although they believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they could not see the whole battle. All guns, including captured ones were hauled away, as were all unwounded prisoners, the wounded and even the dead.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=277\u2013286}}</ref> Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to [[Deir al-Balah]] were each left with a full water bottle.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|p=105}}</ref>\n\nDobell launched the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] in April 1917 with a full scale frontal assault supported by [[Naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]], tanks and [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=302\u2013307}}</ref> It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|lieutenant general]]. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, during the [[Stalemate in Southern Palestine]], General Sir [[Edmund Allenby]] took over the EEF from Murray.<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=334\u2013335}}</ref> Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines.

However he overrode Chauvel's own preference to appoint a [[Royal Horse Guards]] officer, Brigadier General [[Richard Howard-Vyse]], known as \"[[Wombat]]\", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps.<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1978|pp=118\u2013123}}</ref> A \"brass-bound brigadier\" was quoted as saying, \"Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paterson|1934|p=120}}</ref> On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, \"I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand \u2013 it is my own trade \u2013 but Fate has willed it otherwise.\"<ref name=\"Hill 1978 118\"/><ref group=\"Note\">Murat's Reserve Cavalry in 1805 had been 22,000 while Bessieres' Reserve Cavalry in 1809 had been 29,000, both larger than Chauvel's 20,000.

He also notes the reference to \"Forty Thousand Horsemen\" in the name of a film directed by Charles Chauvel, (Chauvel's nephew) was a myth. [Hill 1978 pp. 119\u201320, note]</ref> At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa.

Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have the resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at [[Beersheba]],<ref>{{harvnb|Gullett|1923|pp=345\u2013351}}</ref> in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line.

Kitt's response to the dossier was to say \"I don't understand what this is about.

In both those shows performing the show-stopping theatrical anthem \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\". Kitt returned to New York City in a triumphant turn in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] spectacle ''[[Timbuktu!]]'' (a version of the perennial ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', set in Africa) in 1978. In the musical, one song gives a \"recipe\" for ''mahoun'', a preparation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], in which her sultry purring rendition of the refrain \"constantly stirring with a long wooden spoon\" was distinctive. She was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] for her performance. In the late 1990s, she appeared as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the North American national touring company of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In 2000, Kitt again returned to Broadway in the short-lived run of [[Michael John LaChiusa]]'s ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''.

Kitt found new audiences in nightclubs across the UK and the United States, including a whole new generation of gay male fans, and she responded by frequently giving benefit performances in support of [[HIV/AIDS]] organizations. Her 1989 follow-up hit \"Cha-Cha Heels\" (featuring [[Bronski Beat]]), which was originally intended to be recorded by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], received a positive response from UK dance clubs, reaching No.&nbsp;32 in the charts in that country. In 1988, Kitt replaced [[Dolores Gray]] in the West End production of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]'' as Carlotta, receiving standing ovations every night for her rendition of \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\" at the beginning of act 2. She went on to perform her own one-woman show at The [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] to sold-out houses for three weeks in early 1989 after ''Follies''.\n\n====1990s====\nKitt appeared with Jimmy James and [[George Burns]] at a fundraiser in 1990 produced by Scott Sherman, agent from the Atlantic Entertainment Group.

I was with her constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [during the last days] she was very funny. We didn't have to [talk] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks. She started to see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't.

In both those shows performing the show-stopping theatrical anthem \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\". Kitt returned to New York City in a triumphant turn in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] spectacle ''[[Timbuktu!]]'' (a version of the perennial ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', set in Africa) in 1978. In the musical, one song gives a \"recipe\" for ''mahoun'', a preparation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], in which her sultry purring rendition of the refrain \"constantly stirring with a long wooden spoon\" was distinctive. She was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] for her performance. In the late 1990s, she appeared as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the North American national touring company of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In 2000, Kitt again returned to Broadway in the short-lived run of [[Michael John LaChiusa]]'s ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''.

Her 1989 follow-up hit \"Cha-Cha Heels\" (featuring [[Bronski Beat]]), which was originally intended to be recorded by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], received a positive response from UK dance clubs, reaching No.&nbsp;32 in the charts in that country. In 1988, Kitt replaced [[Dolores Gray]] in the West End production of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]'' as Carlotta, receiving standing ovations every night for her rendition of \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\" at the beginning of act 2. She went on to perform her own one-woman show at The [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] to sold-out houses for three weeks in early 1989 after ''Follies''.\n\n====1990s====\nKitt appeared with Jimmy James and [[George Burns]] at a fundraiser in 1990 produced by Scott Sherman, agent from the Atlantic Entertainment Group.

Kitt supported the groups' efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas in an effort to keep them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the [[Committee on Education and Labor]]. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels' \"achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult 'do-gooders' realize that these young men and women have performed in 1 short year \u2013 with limited finances \u2013 that which was not achieved by the same people who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it\". She added that \"the Rebels could act as a model for all urban areas throughout the United States with similar problems\".<ref>Hearings, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 558 (1967). pp. 559\u201360.</ref> \"Rebels with a Cause\" subsequently received the needed funding.<ref>Kitt, Eartha (1976).

She had been quoted as saying: \"I support it [gay marriage] because we're asking for the same thing.

She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [during the last days] she was very funny. We didn't have to [talk] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks. She started to see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't.

He is regarded as the outstanding pioneering English rock climber of the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nBrown established a number of new routes in [[Snowdonia]] and the [[Peak District]] that were at the leading edge of the hardest grades. He made ascents in the Alps in the 1950s with others and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world's third highest mountain, [[Kangchenjunga]] in the [[Nepal]]ese [[Himalaya]], with [[George Band]]. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the [[Muztagh Tower]] in the [[Karakoram]] with [[Ian McNaught-Davis]].\n\nBrown helped create new types of \"protection\" to improve safety on climbs, creating some of the first \"[[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]\". in 1966 he opened a shop, since expanded to three shops in Snowdonia. He is also remembered for televised rock climbs in the 1960s and was involved in many films.\n\nHe has been appointed a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) and in 2011 a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the New Year Honours.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn the seventh and last child of a family in [[Ardwick]], [[Manchester]], [[Lancashire]], England.<ref>\"Joe Brown Biography.\" /</ref> Brown was the first in his family to climb: aged 12, he began exploring from camp sites with his friends. They used discarded clothes lines that were not fit for purpose. Brown was employed by a company called Archies, where he was apprenticed to a plumber and general builder.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003631/http://www.joe-brown.com/docman/joe-brown/joe-browns-biography/download.html \"Joe Brown Biography\"] Joe-Brown.com.</ref> He became famous for climbing during the 1950s, and was a member of the Valkyrie Climbing Club and founding member of the [[Rock and Ice climbing club]].<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Simon|title=Unjustifiable Risk?|year=2010|publisher=Cicerone|pages=207\u2013209}}</ref> An early climbing partner was [[Don Whillans]], from the neighbouring city of [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]]. They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from working-class backgrounds, in contrast to the upper and middle class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]].\n\nBrown was enlisted in 1949-50 for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends. Brown broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn but was back up and climbing three months later.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\" />\n\nHe established a number of new routes in [[Snowdonia]] and the [[Peak District]] that were at the leading edge of the hardest grades. Examples on [[Dinas Cromlech]] in the [[Llanberis Pass]] include \"Cenotaph Corner\" (1952, graded E1, with Doug Belshaw) and \"Cemetery Gates\" (1951, E1, with Don Whillans).<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\" /> As well as creating pioneering routes, he helped create new types of \"protection\" to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first \"[[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]\" by drilling the thread out of nuts and threading the centre with a sling. So famous was he that the [[Post Office]] would often deliver letters simply addressed to \"The Human Fly, UK\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBrown's mountaineering achievements in the [[Alps]] and [[Himalayas]]: he made many ascents in the Alps in the 1950s with Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world's third highest mountain, [[Kangchenjunga]] in the [[Nepal]]ese [[Himalaya]], with [[George Band]]. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the [[Muztagh Tower]] in the [[Karakoram]] with [[Ian McNaught-Davis]]. The other members of the team, John Hartog and [[Tom Patey]], reached the main summit the next day.\n\nApart from numerous rock climbs in Britain, and mountaineering achievements abroad, Brown is remembered for televised rock climbs in the 1960s, three in Snowdonia, and in 1967, a spectacular new route on the [[Old Man of Hoy]], a Scottish [[sea stack]], with Ian McNaught-Davis and [[Chris Bonington]]. Fifteen years later Brown repeated the climb on the Old Man on a television documentary with his second daughter Zoe. Her bubbly personality led her to being chosen as a presenter on the children's TV show ''[[Razzamatazz]]''.<!--Not [[Tiswas]], which had been axed by then-->\n\nAlready a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE), Brown was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to rock climbing and mountaineering.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |page=7 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Joe Brown's Shop - geograph.org.uk - 1452330.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Brown shop in [[Capel Curig]]]]\nOn 17 February 1957 Brown married Valerie Melville Gray.\n\nThroughout his climbing career Brown was involved in films such as ''Hazard'',<ref>{{cite web|title=HAZARD (1959) film no: 4570|url=http://www.yorkshirefilmarchive.com/film/hazard|website=Yorkshire Film Archive|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref> ''Upsidedown Wales'', ''[[Five Days One Summer]]'', in which he and other British climbers assisted with the mountaineering scenes.\n\nHis first daughter Helen was born in 1960 followed six years later by Zoe. She later repeated a climb for a TV show.\n\nBrown started to create and improve climbing gear and in 1966 opened a shop,<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\"/> since expanded to three shops in [[Snowdonia]] and an online presence, branded in English as \"Joe Brown shops\" and in Welsh as \"Siopau Joe Brown\".\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book  | last = Brown  | first = Joe  | title = The Hard Years  | publisher=Victor Gollancz  | year = 1967\n  | location = London, UK  | url =  | id = \n  | asin = B001PQCRYK }} (Original Hardcover)\n* {{cite book  | last = Brown  | first = Joe  | title = The Hard Years  | publisher=Mountaineers Books  | year = 2001\n  | location = Seattle, WA, USA  | url =  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-0-89886-845-6 }} (Reprint Edition)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120511235426/http://www.joe-brown.com/first-ascents/index.php List of Brown's first ascents]\n* [http://wn.com/joe_brown_(climber)/#/Video%20on%20climbing%20the%20kangchenjunga/ Video of an interview with Brown]\n* [http://vimeo.com/7285270 Short clip of Brown in George Smiths film ''Upside Down Wales'']\n* [http://www.joe-brown.com/ Brown's on-line store Joe-Brown.com]\n\n{{Mont Blanc massif}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Joe}}\n[[Category:1930 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British rock climbers]]\n[[Category:English mountain climbers]]\n[[Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:People from Ardwick]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=August 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Joe Brown.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brown in the 1990s]]\n'''Joseph Brown''', usually '''Joe Brown''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|commas=on|CBE}} (26 September 1930 - 16 April 2020) is an English [[Climbing|climber]].

They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from working-class backgrounds, in contrast to the upper and middle class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]].\n\nBrown was enlisted in 1949-50 for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends. Brown broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn but was back up and climbing three months later.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\" />\n\nHe established a number of new routes in [[Snowdonia]] and the [[Peak District]] that were at the leading edge of the hardest grades. Examples on [[Dinas Cromlech]] in the [[Llanberis Pass]] include \"Cenotaph Corner\" (1952, graded E1, with Doug Belshaw) and \"Cemetery Gates\" (1951, E1, with Don Whillans).<ref name=\"Thompson 2010\" /> As well as creating pioneering routes, he helped create new types of \"protection\" to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first \"[[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]\" by drilling the thread out of nuts and threading the centre with a sling. So famous was he that the [[Post Office]] would often deliver letters simply addressed to \"The Human Fly, UK\".{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBrown's mountaineering achievements in the [[Alps]] and [[Himalayas]]: he made many ascents in the Alps in the 1950s with Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world's third highest mountain, [[Kangchenjunga]] in the [[Nepal]]ese [[Himalaya]], with [[George Band]]. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the [[Muztagh Tower]] in the [[Karakoram]] with [[Ian McNaught-Davis]]. The other members of the team, John Hartog and [[Tom Patey]], reached the main summit the next day.\n\nApart from numerous rock climbs in Britain, and mountaineering achievements abroad, Brown is remembered for televised rock climbs in the 1960s, three in Snowdonia, and in 1967, a spectacular new route on the [[Old Man of Hoy]], a Scottish [[sea stack]], with Ian McNaught-Davis and [[Chris Bonington]]. Fifteen years later Brown repeated the climb on the Old Man on a television documentary with his second daughter Zoe. Her bubbly personality led her to being chosen as a presenter on the children's TV show ''[[Razzamatazz]]''.<!--Not [[Tiswas]], which had been axed by then-->\n\nAlready a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE), Brown was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to rock climbing and mountaineering.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=59647 |date=31 December 2010 |page=7 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Joe Brown's Shop - geograph.org.uk - 1452330.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Brown shop in [[Capel Curig]]]]\nOn 17 February 1957 Brown married Valerie Melville Gray.\n\nThroughout his climbing career Brown was involved in films such as ''Hazard'',<ref>{{cite web|title=HAZARD (1959) film no: 4570|url=http://www.yorkshirefilmarchive.com/film/hazard|website=Yorkshire Film Archive|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref> ''Upsidedown Wales'', ''[[Five Days One Summer]]'', in which he and other British climbers assisted with the mountaineering scenes.\n\nHis first daughter Helen was born in 1960 followed six years later by Zoe.

In [[Baetica]], he established a monastery at the Island of [[C\u00e1diz]] and one called ''Nono'' (location unknown).<ref name=sanz/>     \n\nAt Nono, he attracted such a number of monks that the local dux complained to the king that he had lost too much of his military levy. His monastery at Compludo was known for its unusually severe Rule. In this monastery, monks were required to reveal all their thoughts, visions and dreams to their superiors. They were subjected to bedtime inspections throughout the night. Monks were forbidden to look at each other. Punishments here were also unusually harsh and included flogging and imprisonment within the monastery on a diet of six ounces of bread for three to six months.<ref>Roger Collins, ''Early Medieval Spain''. (New York: St Martin's Press, 1995), p. 84.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nHis relationship with the kings of his time was not always a happy one. In 652, he wrote what was apparently a second letter to King [[Recceswinth]] asking for the release of political prisoners held from the reign of King [[Chintila]], some of whom had languished in prison until the reign of King [[Erwig]].\n\n===Bishop===\n[[File:S\u00e3o Frutuoso - Galeria dos Arcebispos de Braga.png|thumb|left|Saint Fructuosus as Archbishop of Braga]]\nHe was later present at the [[Eighth Council of Toledo]] in 653, in place of Bishop Riccimer of Dumio. It was at this Council that Fructuosus raised the issue of political prisoners once again. After the death of Bishop Riccimer, Fructuosus succeeded him in the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Dumio in 654. In 656, he undertook to plan for a voyage to the [[Levant]]. However, according to the new laws enacted by King [[Chindasuinth|Chindasvinth]], it was illegal to leave the kingdom without royal permission. One of the few disciples privy to his plans had given him up to authorities and Fructuosus was subsequently arrested and imprisoned.\n\nBishop Fructuosus attended the [[Tenth Council of Toledo]] in December 656. The last will and testament of the recently deceased bishop Riccimer, was disputed by those who saw his freeing of slaves and distribution of church rents to the poor was responsible for the subsequent impoverishment of that see. The Council agreed that, by not providing compensation, Bishop Riccimer had obviated his duty and the acts of his will were rendered invalid. They gave the job of correcting the problem to Fructuosus and commanded him to take moderation in the case of the slaves. At the same Council, Archbishop Potamius of Braga was remanded to a monastery for licentiousness and his archdiocese was given to St Fructuosus on 1 December 656.<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl Joseph von Hefele|title=A History of the Councils of the Church: From the Original Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b9lAAAAMAAJ|volume=Vol. IV.|year=1895|publisher=T. & T.

It was at this Council that Fructuosus raised the issue of political prisoners once again. After the death of Bishop Riccimer, Fructuosus succeeded him in the [[Episcopal see|See]] of Dumio in 654. In 656, he undertook to plan for a voyage to the [[Levant]]. However, according to the new laws enacted by King [[Chindasuinth|Chindasvinth]], it was illegal to leave the kingdom without royal permission. One of the few disciples privy to his plans had given him up to authorities and Fructuosus was subsequently arrested and imprisoned.\n\nBishop Fructuosus attended the [[Tenth Council of Toledo]] in December 656. The last will and testament of the recently deceased bishop Riccimer, was disputed by those who saw his freeing of slaves and distribution of church rents to the poor was responsible for the subsequent impoverishment of that see. The Council agreed that, by not providing compensation, Bishop Riccimer had obviated his duty and the acts of his will were rendered invalid. They gave the job of correcting the problem to Fructuosus and commanded him to take moderation in the case of the slaves. At the same Council, Archbishop Potamius of Braga was remanded to a monastery for licentiousness and his archdiocese was given to St Fructuosus on 1 December 656.<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl Joseph von Hefele|title=A History of the Councils of the Church: From the Original Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_b9lAAAAMAAJ|volume=Vol. IV.|year=1895|publisher=T. & T.

Nevertheless, the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]] and the [[Siege of Buda (1541)|loss of Buda]] in the early 40s frustrated his anti-Ottoman policies.

Dynastic accidents eventually brought in the person of ''Charles of Ghent'', as he was known at his birth, the four inheritances of Burgundy, Castile, Aragon, and Austria. \n\nThe Burgundian inheritance included the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], which consisted of a large number of the lordships that formed the [[Low Countries]] and covered modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Holland]] and [[Luxembourg]]. It excluded [[Burgundy|Burgundy proper]], annexed by France in 1477, with the exception of [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. Charles was born in the Low Countries and his name was chosen in honor of his ancestor [[Charles the Bold|Charles ''the Bold'' of Burgundy]]. At the death of Philip in 1506, Charles was recognized [[Lord of the Netherlands]] with the title of ''Charles II of Burgundy''. During Charles's childhood and teen years, [[William de Cro\u00ff]] (later prime minister) and Adrian of Utrecht (later [[Pope Adrian VI]]) served as his tutors. The culture and courtly life of the Low Countries played an important part in the development of Charles's beliefs. As a member of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in his infancy, and later its grandmaster, Charles was educated to the ideals of the medieval knights and the desire for Christian unity to fight the infidel.<ref>{{cite book| last=Heath| first=Richard| title=Charles V: Duty and Dynasty \u2013 The Emperor and his Changing World 1500\u20131558| year=2018|page=23| isbn=978-1-725-85278-5}}</ref> The Low Countries were very rich during his reign, both [[History of capitalism|economically]] and [[Flemish art|culturally]]. Charles was very attached to his homeland and spent much of his life in [[Brussels]].\n\n[[File:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Jakob Seisenegger]], 1533]]\n\nThe Spanish inheritance, resulting from a [[dynastic union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], included [[Spain]] as well as the Castilian [[West Indies]] and the Aragonese [[Two Sicilies]]. Joanna inherited these territories in 1516 in a condition of mental illness. Charles, therefore, claimed the crowns for himself ''[[jure matris]]'', thus becoming co-monarch of Joanna with the title of ''Charles I of Castile and Aragon'' or ''Charles I of Spain''.  Castile and Aragon together formed the largest of Charles's personal possessions, and they also provided a great number of generals and [[tercios]] (the formidable Spanish infantry of the time). However, at his accession to the throne, Charles was viewed as a foreign prince. Two rebellions, the [[revolt of the Germanies]] and the [[revolt of the comuneros]], contested Charles's rule in the 1520s. Following these revolts, Charles placed Spanish counselors in a position of power and spent a considerable part of his life in Castile, including his final years in a monastery. Indeed, Charles's motto, ''[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]'' (''Further Beyond''), became the national motto of Spain and his heir, later Philip II, was born and raised in Castile. Nonetheless, many Spaniards believed that their resources (largely consisting of flows of silver from the Americas) were being used to sustain Imperial-Habsburg policies that were not in the country's interest.<ref>History of Spain, Joseph Perez</ref>\n\nCharles inherited the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] in 1519, as ''Charles I of Austria'', and obtained the election as Holy Roman Emperor against the candidacy of the French King. Since the Imperial election, he was known as ''Emperor Charles V'' even outside of Germany and the ''[[A.E.I.O.U.]]'' motto of the House of Austria acquired political significance. Despite the fact that he was elected as a German prince, Charles's staunch Catholicism in contrast to the growth of Lutheranism alienated him from various German princes who finally fought against him. Charles's presence in Germany was often marked by the organization of [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial diet]]s to maintain religious unity. He was frequently in Northern Italy, often taking part in complicated negotiations with the [[Pope]]s to address the rise of Protestantism. It is important to note, though, that the German Catholics supported the Emperor. Charles had a close relationship with important German families, like the [[House of Nassau]], many of which were represented at his court in Brussels. Several German princes or noblemen accompanied him in his military campaigns against France or the Ottomans, and the bulk of his army was generally composed of German troops, especially the Imperial [[Landsknechte]].<ref>''Charles V'', Pierre Chaunu</ref><ref>''Germany in the Holy Roman Empire'', Whaley</ref>\n\nIt is said that Charles spoke several languages.

The latter territories lied within the Holy Roman Empire and its borders, but were formally divided between fiefs of the [[German kingdom]] and French fiefs such as Charles's birthplace of Flanders, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. As he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles's requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.\n\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.\n\nCharles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournaisis|Tournai]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.<ref name=\"Kamen\">{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| year = 2005| title = Spain, 1469\u20131714: a society of conflict| edition = 3rd| publisher = Pearson Education| url = https://archive.org/details/spain14691714soc00kame| location = Harlow, United Kingdom| isbn = 0-582-78464-6| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally, they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the wealth of the region's cities, the Low Countries also represented an important income for the Imperial treasury.\n\nThe Burgundian territories were generally loyal to Charles throughout his reign. The important city of Ghent [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|rebelled]] in 1539 due to heavy tax payments demanded by Charles.

With Charles, government became more absolute, even though until his mother's death in 1555 Charles did not hold the full kingship of the country.\n\nSoon resistance to the Emperor arose because of heavy taxation to support foreign wars in which Castilians had little interest, and because Charles tended to select Flemings for high offices in Castile and America, ignoring Castilian candidates. The resistance culminated in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], which Charles suppressed. Immediately after crushing the Castilian revolt, Charles was confronted again with the hot issue of Navarre when King [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] attempted to [[Spanish conquest of Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|reconquer the kingdom]]. Main military operations lasted until 1524, when [[Hondarribia]] surrendered to Charles's forces, but frequent cross-border clashes in the western Pyrenees only stopped in 1528 (Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai).\n\nAfter these events, Navarre remained a matter of domestic and international litigation still for a century (a French dynastic claim to the throne did not end until the [[July Revolution]] in 1830). Charles wanted his son and heir [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to marry the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. Jeanne was instead forced to marry [[William, Duke of Julich-Cleves-Berg]], but that childless marriage was annulled after four years. She next married [[Antoine de Bourbon]], and both she and their son would oppose [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nCastile became integrated into Charles's empire, and provided the bulk of the empire's financial resources as well as very effective military units. The enormous budget deficit accumulated during Charles's reign, along with the [[Spanish price revolution|inflation that affected the kingdom]], resulted in declaring bankruptcy during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].<ref>Elliot, J.H.

As Holy Roman Emperor, Charles was sovereign in several states of northern Italy and had a claim to the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] (obtained in 1530). The [[Duchy of Milan]], however, was under French control. [[Early Modern France|France]] took Milan from the [[House of Sforza]] after victory against Switzerland at the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515. Imperial-Papal troops succeeded in re-installing the Sforza in Milan in 1521, in the context of an alliance between Charles V and Pope Leo X. A Franco-Swiss army was finally expelled from Lombardy at [[Battle of Bicocca|Bicocca]] a year later. Yet in 1524 Francis I of France retook the initiative, crossing into Lombardy where Milan, along with a number of other cities, once again fell to his attack. [[Pavia]] alone held out, and on 24 February 1525 (Charles's twenty-fifth birthday), Charles's forces led by [[Charles de Lannoy]] captured Francis and crushed his army in the [[Battle of Pavia]]. In 1535, [[Francesco II Sforza]] died without heirs and Charles V annexed the territory as a vacant Imperial state. Charles successfully held on to all of its Italian territories, though they were invaded again on multiple occasions during the [[Italian Wars]].\n\nIn addition, Habsburg trade in the Mediterranean was consistently disrupted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1538 a [[Holy League (1538)|Holy League]] consisting of all the Italian states and the Spanish kingdoms was formed to drive the Ottomans back, but it was defeated at the [[Battle of Preveza (1538)|Battle of Preveza]]. Decisive naval victory eluded Charles; it would not be achieved until after Charles's death, at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.\n\n===America===\nDuring Charles's reign, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Castilian territories in the Americas]] were considerably extended by ''[[conquistador]]es'' like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]]. They conquered the large [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] empires and incorporated them into the Empire as the Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] between 1519 and 1542. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe by the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] in 1522, these successes convinced Charles of his divine mission to become the leader of [[Christendom]], which still perceived a significant threat from Islam. The conquests also helped solidify Charles's rule by providing the state treasury with enormous amounts of [[bullion]].

He was also the natural candidate of the [[Prince-elector|electors]] to succeed his grandfather as Holy Roman Emperor. After having paid huge bribes to the electors, he defeated the candidacies of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I, King of France]], and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII, King of England]]. The electors gave Charles the crown on 28 June 1519. On 26 October 1520 he was crowned in Germany and some ten years later, on [[Coronation of Charles V|22 February 1530]], he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Clement VII]] in [[Bologna]], the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.<ref>William Maltby, ''The Reign of Charles V'' (St. Martin's Press, 2002)</ref><ref>Claims that he gained the imperial crown through bribery have been questioned.

They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands. An [[inquisition]] was established as early as 1522. In 1550, the death penalty was introduced for all cases of unrepentant heresy. Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], personally suppressed the [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] in mid-February 1540.<ref name=\"Kamen\"/>\n\nCharles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favour of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558. Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of Emperor.\n\n====Wars with France====\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|Francis I and Charles V made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\n\nMuch of Charles's reign was taken up by conflicts with France, which found itself encircled by Charles's empire while it still maintained ambitions in Italy.  In 1520, Charles visited [[England]], where his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], urged her husband, Henry VIII, to ally himself with the emperor. In 1508 Charles was nominated by Henry VII to the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Royal Collection \u2013 The Knights of the Garter under Henry VIII|url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|archive-url = https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20111206134156/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|url-status = dead|archive-date = 6 December 2011|website = www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate = 16 December 2015}}</ref> His [[Garter stall plate]] survives in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Saint George's Chapel]].\n\nThe [[Italian War of 1521|first war]] with Charles's great nemesis [[Francis I of France]] began in 1521. Charles allied with England and [[Pope Leo X]] against the French and the Venetians, and was highly successful, driving the French out of [[Milan]] and defeating and capturing Francis at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. To gain his freedom, Francis ceded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to Charles in the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], as well as renouncing his support of Henry II's claim over [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].\n\n[[File:Emperor Charles V seated (Titian).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait, 1548, by [[Lambert Sustris]] (formerly attributed to [[Titian]])]]\n\nWhen he was released, however, Francis had the Parliament of Paris denounce the treaty because it had been signed under [[duress]]. France then joined the [[War of the League of Cognac|League of Cognac]] that [[Pope Clement VII]] had formed with Henry VIII of England, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Milanese to resist imperial domination of Italy. In the ensuing war, Charles's [[sack of Rome (1527)]] and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulling]] the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt [[Catherine of Aragon]], so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=Holmes1993a>Holmes (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BsV-qSRKAnAC&pg=PA192 p. 192]</ref><ref name=Froude1891a>Froude (1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=n-Ecc8SnlC0C&pg=PA480 p. 35, pp. 90\u201391, pp. 96\u201397] Note: the link goes to page 480, then click the View All option</ref> In other respects, the war was inconclusive. In the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] (1529), called the \"Ladies' Peace\" because it was negotiated between Charles's aunt and Francis' mother, Francis renounced his claims in Italy but retained control of Burgundy.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|third war]] erupted in 1536. Following the death of [[Francesco II Sforza|the last Sforza Duke of Milan]], Charles installed his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] in the duchy, despite Francis' claims on it. This war too was inconclusive. Francis failed to conquer Milan, but he succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally, the [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], including his capital [[Turin]]. A truce at [[Nice]] in 1538 on the basis of ''[[uti possidetis]]'' ended the war but lasted only a short time. [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|War resumed in 1542]], with Francis now allied with Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] and Charles once again allied with Henry VIII. Despite the conquest of Nice by a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman fleet]], the French could not advance toward Milan, while a joint Anglo-Imperial invasion of northern France, led by Charles himself, won some successes but was ultimately abandoned, leading to another peace and restoration of the ''status quo ante bellum'' in 1544.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|final war]] erupted with Francis' son and successor, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1551. Henry won early success in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], where he captured [[Metz]], but French offensives in Italy failed. Charles abdicated midway through this conflict, leaving further conduct of the war to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n====Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire====\n{{Further|Protestantism and Islam|Habsburg-Persian alliance|Conquest of Tunis (1534)|conquest of Tunis (1535)}}\n\nCharles fought continually with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its sultan, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

However, by 1541, central and southern Hungary fell under Turkish control.\n\nSuleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Christian victories such as the [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunis]] in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] after its victories at [[Battle of Preveza|Preveza]] in 1538 and [[Battle of Djerba|Djerba]] in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim [[Barbary corsairs]], acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.\n\nIn 1536 [[Francis I of France]] allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the [[Peace of Cr\u00e9py|Truce of Cr\u00e9py-en-Laonnois]]. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating<ref name=\"treaty\">In particular, in this [[Truce of Adrianople (1547)]] Charles was only referred to as \"King of Spain\" instead of by his extensive titulature.

The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\n\nThe issue of the [[Protestant Reformation]] was first brought to the imperial attention under Charles V. As [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Charles called [[Martin Luther]] to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, promising him safe conduct if he would appear. After Luther defended [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] and his writings, the Emperor commented: \"that monk will never make me a heretic\". Charles V relied on religious unity to govern his various realms, [[Personal union|otherwise unified only in his person]], and perceived Luther's teachings as a disruptive form of [[heresy]]. He outlawed Luther and issued the [[Edict of Worms]], declaring: \n\n{{quote|You know that I am a descendant of the Most Christian Emperors of the great German people, of the Catholic Kings of Spain, of the Archdukes of Austria, and of the Dukes of Burgundy. All of these, their whole life long, were faithful sons of the Roman Church\u2026After their deaths they left, by natural law and heritage, these holy catholic rites, for us to live and die by, following their example. And so until now I have lived as a true follower of these our ancestors. I am therefore resolved to maintain everything which these my forebears have established to the present.}}\n\nNonetheless, Charles V kept his word and let Martin Luther free to leave the city. Frederick the Wise, [[elector of Saxony]] and protector of Luther, lamented the outcome of the Diet. On the road back from Worms, Luther was kidnapped by Frederick's men and hidden in a far away castle in [[Wartburg]]. There, he began to work on his German translation of the bible. The spread of Lutheranism led to two major revolts: that of the knights in 1522-1523 and that of the paesants led by [[Thomas Muntzer]] in 1524\u20131525. While the pro-Imperial [[Swabian League]], in conjunction with Protestant princes afraid of social revolts, restored order, Charles V used the instrument of pardon to maintain peace.\n\nThereafter, Charles V took a tolerant approach and pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Lutherans. At the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, Luther's assistant [[Philip Melanchthon]] went even further and presented to Charles V the Lutheran [[Augsburg confession]]. The emperor strongly rejected it, and in 1531 the [[Schmalkaldic League]] was formed by Protestant princes. In 1532, Charles V recognized the League and effectively suspended the Edict of Worms with the ''standstill of [[Nuremberg]]''. The ''standstill'' required the Protestants to continue to take part in the Imperial wars against the Turks and the French, and postponed religious affairs until an [[ecumenical council]] of the [[Catholic Church]] was called by the Pope to solve the issue.\n\nDue to Papal delays in organizing a general council, Charles V decided to organize a German summit and presided over the ''[[Regensburg]] talks'' between Catholics and Lutherans in 1541, but no compromise was achieved. In 1545, the [[Council of Trent]] was finally opened and the [[Counter-Reformation]] began. The Catholic initiative was supported by a number of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the Schmalkaldic League refused to recognize the validity of the council and occupied territories of catholic princes. Thus Charles V outlawed the Schmalkaldic League and opened hostilities against it in 1546 (the year of Luther's death). The next year his forces drove the League's troops out of southern Germany, and defeated [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Philip I of Hesse|Philip of Hesse]] at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]], capturing both. At the [[Augsburg Interim]] in 1548, he created a solution giving certain allowances to Protestants until the Council of Trent would restore unity. However, members of both sides resented the Interim and some actively opposed it. \n\nThe Council was re-opened in 1550 with the participation of Lutherans, and Charles V set up the Imperial court in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, sufficiently close to Trent for him to follow the evolution of the debates. In 1552 Protestant princes, in alliance with [[Henry II of France]], [[Second Schmalkaldic War|rebelled again]] and the second Schmalkaldic War began. [[Maurice of Saxony]], instrumental for the Imperial victory in the first conflict, switched side to the Protestant cause and bypassed the Imperial army by marching directly into Innsbruck with the goal of capturing the Emperor. Charles V was forced to flee the city during an attack of [[gout]] and barely made it alive to [[Villach]] in a state of semi-consciousness carried in a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]]. After failing to recapture [[Metz]] from the French, Charles V returned to the Low Countries for the last years of his emperorship. In 1555, he instructed his brother Ferdinand to sign the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in his name. The agreements led to the religious division of Germany between Catholic and Protestant princedoms.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:La emperatriz Isabel de Portugal, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella of Portugal, Charles's wife. Portrait by [[Titian]], 1548]]\nDuring his lifetime, Charles V had several mistresses, his step-grandmother, [[Germaine de Foix]] among them. These liaisons occurred during his bachelorhood and only once during his widowhood; there are no records of his having any extramarital affairs during his marriage.\n\nOn 21 December 1507, Charles was betrothed to 11-year old [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], the daughter of King [[Henry VII of England]] and younger sister to the future King [[Henry VIII of England]], who was to take the throne in two years. However, the engagement was called off in 1513, on the advice of [[Thomas Wolsey]], and Mary was instead married to King [[Louis XII of France]] in 1514.\n\nAfter his ascension to the Spanish thrones, negotiations for Charles's marriage began shortly after his arrival in Castile, with the Castilian nobles expressing their wishes for him to marry his first cousin [[Isabella of Portugal]], the daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and Charles's aunt [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Maria of Aragon]]. The nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood, and a marriage to Isabella would have secured an alliance between Castile and Portugal. However, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice. Instead of marrying Isabella, he sent his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father, King Manuel, in 1518. In 1521, on the advice of his Flemish counselors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], Charles became engaged to his other first cousin, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], daughter of his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and King Henry VIII, in order to secure an alliance with England. However, this engagement was very problematic because Mary was only 6 years old at the time, sixteen years Charles's junior, which meant that he would have to wait for her to be old enough to marry.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could not wait any longer to have legitimate children and heirs. Following his victory in the [[Battle of Pavia]], Charles abandoned the idea of an English alliance, cancelled his engagement to Mary and decided to marry Isabella and form an alliance with Portugal. He wrote to Isabella's brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], making a double marriage contract \u2013 Charles would marry Isabella and John would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine]]. A marriage to Isabella was more beneficial for Charles, as she was closer to him in age, was fluent in Spanish and provided him with a very handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds that would help to solve the financial problems brought on by the Italian Wars.\n\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n\nOn 10 March 1526, Charles and Isabella met at the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Alc\u00e1zar Palace]] in [[Seville]]. The marriage was originally a political arrangement, but on their first meeting, the couple fell deeply in love: Isabella captivated the Emperor with her beauty and charm. They were married that very same night in a quiet ceremony in the Hall of Ambassadors, just after midnight. Following their wedding, Charles and Isabella spent a long and happy honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]]. Charles began the construction of the [[Palace of Charles V]] in 1527, wishing to establish a permanent residence befitting an emperor and empress in the Alhambra palaces. However, the palace was not completed during their lifetimes and remained roofless until the late 20th century.<ref>[http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=/alhambra/history_alhambra/palacio_carlos_v Palace of Charles V] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924081126/http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=%2Falhambra%2Fhistory_alhambra%2Fpalacio_carlos_v |date=24 September 2016 }}, Alhambra.org</ref>\n\nDespite the Emperor's long absences due to political affairs abroad, the marriage was a happy one, as both partners were always devoted and faithful to each other.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamen |date=29 May 1997 |first=H. |title=Philip of Spain |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07081-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 2] |authorlink=Henry Kamen |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 }}</ref> The Empress acted as regent of Spain during her husband's absences, and she proved herself to be a good politician and ruler, thoroughly impressing the Emperor with many of her political accomplishments and decisions.\n\nThe marriage lasted for thirteen years, until Isabella's death in 1539. The Empress contracted a fever during the third month of her seventh pregnancy, which resulted in antenatal complications that caused her to miscarry a stillborn son. Her health further deteriorated due to an infection, and she died two weeks later on 1 May 1539, aged 35. Charles was left so grief-stricken by his wife's death that for two months he shut himself up in a monastery, where he prayed and mourned for her in solitude.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|pp=6\u20137}} Charles never recovered from Isabella's death, dressing in black for the rest of his life to show his eternal mourning, and, unlike most kings of the time, he never remarried.

He lived alone in a secluded monastery, with clocks lining every wall, which some historians believe were symbols of his reign and his lack of time.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jordi|last=Alonso |author2=J. de Zulueta|title=The severe gout of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V |journal=N.

Although Papal coronation was not necessary to confirm the Imperial title, Charles V [[Coronation of Charles V|was crowned]] in the city of Bologna by [[Pope Clement VII]] in the medieval fashion. \n\nCharles V accumulated a large number of titles due to his vast inheritance of Burgundian, Spanish, and Austrian realms. Following the pacts of Worms (21 April 1521) and Brussels (7 February 1522), he secretely gave the Austrian lands to his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] and elevated him to the status of Archduke. Nevertheless, according to the agreements, Charles continued to style himself as Archduke of Austria and maintained that Ferdinand acted as his vassal and vicar.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5OcgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=Ferdinand+younger+brother+vassal+of+Charles&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6iISg79flAhXssaQKHbGvA9YQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20younger%20brother%20vassal%20of%20Charles&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5T6uAAAAMAAJ&q=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&dq=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyfvozcjlAhWMDuwKHY7eCiAQ6AEITzAF]</ref> Furthermore, the pacts of 1521-1522 imposed restrictions on the governorship and regency of Ferdinand. For example, all of Ferdinand's letters to Charles V were signed \"your obedient brother and servant\".<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=vZVHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA487&dq=Ferdinand+Charles+v+muy+poderoso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWxdSv5IzmAhVByqQKHXQ5BJEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20Charles%20v%20muy%20poderoso&f=false]</ref> Nonetheless, the same agreements promised Ferdinand the designation as future emperor and the transfer of hereditary rights over Austria at the imperial succession.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II, King of Hungary and Bohemia]] at the [[Battle of Mohacs]] in 1526, Charles V favored the election of Ferdinand as king of Hungary (and Croatia and Dalmatia) and Bohemia. Despite this, Charles also styled himself as king of Hungary and Bohemia and retained this titular use in official acts (such as his testament) as in the case of the Austrian lands. As a consequence, cartographers and historians have described those kingdoms both as realms of Charles V and as possessions of Ferdinand, not without confusion. Others, such as the Venetian enoys, reported that the states of Ferdinand were \"all held in common with the Emperor\".<ref>''Relazione di Germania 1526'' in ''Relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato: Germania''</ref > \n\nTherefore, although he had agreed on the future division of the dynasty between Ferdinand and [[Philip II of Spain]], during his own reign Charles V conceived the existence of a single \"House of Austria\" of which he was the sole head.<ref> https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=Martyn+Rady+one+house+of+Austria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL_qrej5foAhXB4KQKHUXQCB8Q6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&q=House%20of%20Austria&f=false</ref> In the abdications of 1554\u20131556, Charles left his personal possessions to Philip II and the Imperial title to Ferdinand. The titles of King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, Croatia, etc., were also nominally left to the Spanish line (in particular to [[Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] and son of Philip II). However, Charles's Imperial abdication marked the beginning of Ferdinand's [[suo jure]] rule in Austria and his other lands: despite the claims of Philip and his descendants, Hungary and Bohemia were left under the nominal and substantial rule of Ferdinand and his successors. Formal disputes between the two lines over Hungary and Bohemia will be solved with the [[Onate treaty]] of 1617.\n\nCharles's full titulature went as follows:\n\n''Charles, [[by the grace of God]], Emperor of the Romans, forever [[Augustus (honorific)|August]], King of Germany, King of Italy, King of all Spains, of Castile, Aragon, Le\u00f3n, of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, Navarra, Grenada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Cordova, Murcia, Ja\u00e9n, Algarves, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, King of Two Sicilies, of Sardinia, Corsica, King of Jerusalem, King of the Indies, of the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Lorraine, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Limburg, Luxembourg, Gelderland, Neopatria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Landgrave of Alsace, Prince of Swabia, Asturia and Catalonia, Count of Flanders, Habsburg, Tyrol, Gorizia, Barcelona, Artois, Burgundy Palatine, Hainaut, Holland, Seeland, Ferrette, Kyburg, Namur, Roussillon, Cerdagne, Drenthe, Zutphen, Margrave of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgau, [[Oristano]] and [[Gociano]], Lord of Frisia, [[Windic March|the Wendish March]], Pordenone, Biscay, Molin, Salins, Tripoli and Mechelen.''{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Carlos V en M\u00fchlberg, by Titian, from Prado in Google_Earth.jpg|thumb|right|Charles&nbsp;V on horseback in M\u00fchlberg.

Conversely, in [[Charles De Coster]]'s masterpiece ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak|Thyl Ulenspiegel]]'' (1867), after his death Charles V is consigned to Hell as punishment for the acts of the [[Inquisition]] under his rule, his punishment being that he would feel the pain of anyone tortured by the Inquisition. De Coster's book also mentions the story on the spectacles in the coat of arms of [[Oudenaarde]], the one about a paysant of [[Berchem]] in ''Het geuzenboek'' (1979) by [[Louis Paul Boon]], while {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Hans|nl}} (1882\u20131939) included both tales in ''De liefdesavonturen van keizer Karel in Vlaanderen''.\n* [[Lord Byron]]'s ''Ode to [[Napoleon Buonaparte]]'' refers to Charles as \"The Spaniard\".\n[[File:Escutcheon of Charles V of Spain MET DT287185.jpg|thumb|right|''Escutcheon of Charles V'', watercolour, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1912.

Charles (Don Carlo in the opera) prays before the tomb of [[Charlemagne]]. With the announcement that he is elected as Carlo Quinto he declares an amnesty including the eponymous bandit Ernani who had followed him there to murder him as a rival for the love of Elvira. The opera, based on the [[Victor Hugo]] play ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'', portrays Charles as a callous and cynical adventurer whose character is transformed by the election into a responsible and clement ruler.\n* In another Verdi opera, ''[[Don Carlo]]'', the final scene implies that it is Charles V, now living the last years of his life as a hermit, who rescues his grandson, Don Carlo, from his father [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and the Inquisition, by taking Carlo with him to his hermitage at the monastery in Yuste.\n\n===Food===\n* A Flemish legend about Charles being served a beer at the village of [[Olen, Belgium|Olen]], as well as the emperor's lifelong preference of beer above wine, led to the naming of several beer varieties in his honor.

Charles V borrowed from German and Italian bankers and, in order to repay such loans, he relied on the proto-[[capitalist economy]] of the Low Countries and on the flows of [[precious metals]] from South America to Spain, which were the chief source of his wealth but also the cause of widespread [[inflation]].

In order to consolidate power in his early reign, Charles suppressed two Spanish insurrections ([[Revolt of the Comuneros|Comuneros' Revolt]] and [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods|Brotherhoods' Revolt]]) and two German rebellions ([[Knights' Revolt]] and [[Great Peasants' Revolt]]). \n\nCrowned [[King of Germany|King in Germany]], Charles sided with [[Pope Leo X]] and declared [[Martin Luther]] an outlaw at the [[Diet of Worms]] (1521).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PINEUKYXHd0C&pg=PA626&dq=Carolus+defensor+ecllesia#v=onepage&q=Carolus%20defensor%20ecllesia&f=false|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia metropolitana; Volume 17|year=1845 |location=London|language=en|last1=Smedley|first1=Edward}}</ref> The same year [[Francis I of France]], surrounded by the Habsburg possessions, started a conflict in [[Lombardy]] that lasted until the [[Battle of Pavia]] (1525) led to his temporary imprisonment. The Protestant affair re-emerged in 1527 as [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Rome was sacked]] by an army of Charles's mutinous soldiers, largely of Lutheran faith. After his forces left the [[Papal States]], Charles V [[Siege of Vienna (1529)|defended Vienna]] from the Turks and obtained the coronation as [[King of Italy|King in Italy]] by [[Pope Clement VII]]. In 1535, he annexed the vacant [[Duchy of Milan]] and [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|captured Tunis]]. Nevertheless, the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]] and the [[Siege of Buda (1541)|loss of Buda]] in the early 40s frustrated his anti-Ottoman policies. Meanwhile, Charles V had come to an agreement with [[Pope Paul III]] for the organisation of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545). The refusal of the Lutheran [[Schmalkaldic League]] to recognize the Council's validity led to [[Schmalkaldic War|a war]], won by Charles V with the imprisonment of the Protestant princes.

He was the eldest son of [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] of the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]] (son of  [[Maximilian I of Austria]] and [[Mary of Burgundy]]) and [[Joanna the Mad]] of the Spanish [[House of Trast\u00e1mara]] (daughter of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]]).<ref name=\"State2015\">{{cite book|author=Paul F.

Dynastic accidents eventually brought in the person of ''Charles of Ghent'', as he was known at his birth, the four inheritances of Burgundy, Castile, Aragon, and Austria. \n\nThe Burgundian inheritance included the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], which consisted of a large number of the lordships that formed the [[Low Countries]] and covered modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Holland]] and [[Luxembourg]]. It excluded [[Burgundy|Burgundy proper]], annexed by France in 1477, with the exception of [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. Charles was born in the Low Countries and his name was chosen in honor of his ancestor [[Charles the Bold|Charles ''the Bold'' of Burgundy]]. At the death of Philip in 1506, Charles was recognized [[Lord of the Netherlands]] with the title of ''Charles II of Burgundy''. During Charles's childhood and teen years, [[William de Cro\u00ff]] (later prime minister) and Adrian of Utrecht (later [[Pope Adrian VI]]) served as his tutors. The culture and courtly life of the Low Countries played an important part in the development of Charles's beliefs. As a member of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in his infancy, and later its grandmaster, Charles was educated to the ideals of the medieval knights and the desire for Christian unity to fight the infidel.<ref>{{cite book| last=Heath| first=Richard| title=Charles V: Duty and Dynasty \u2013 The Emperor and his Changing World 1500\u20131558| year=2018|page=23| isbn=978-1-725-85278-5}}</ref> The Low Countries were very rich during his reign, both [[History of capitalism|economically]] and [[Flemish art|culturally]]. Charles was very attached to his homeland and spent much of his life in [[Brussels]].\n\n[[File:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Jakob Seisenegger]], 1533]]\n\nThe Spanish inheritance, resulting from a [[dynastic union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], included [[Spain]] as well as the Castilian [[West Indies]] and the Aragonese [[Two Sicilies]]. Joanna inherited these territories in 1516 in a condition of mental illness. Charles, therefore, claimed the crowns for himself ''[[jure matris]]'', thus becoming co-monarch of Joanna with the title of ''Charles I of Castile and Aragon'' or ''Charles I of Spain''.  Castile and Aragon together formed the largest of Charles's personal possessions, and they also provided a great number of generals and [[tercios]] (the formidable Spanish infantry of the time). However, at his accession to the throne, Charles was viewed as a foreign prince. Two rebellions, the [[revolt of the Germanies]] and the [[revolt of the comuneros]], contested Charles's rule in the 1520s. Following these revolts, Charles placed Spanish counselors in a position of power and spent a considerable part of his life in Castile, including his final years in a monastery. Indeed, Charles's motto, ''[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]'' (''Further Beyond''), became the national motto of Spain and his heir, later Philip II, was born and raised in Castile. Nonetheless, many Spaniards believed that their resources (largely consisting of flows of silver from the Americas) were being used to sustain Imperial-Habsburg policies that were not in the country's interest.<ref>History of Spain, Joseph Perez</ref>\n\nCharles inherited the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] in 1519, as ''Charles I of Austria'', and obtained the election as Holy Roman Emperor against the candidacy of the French King. Since the Imperial election, he was known as ''Emperor Charles V'' even outside of Germany and the ''[[A.E.I.O.U.]]'' motto of the House of Austria acquired political significance. Despite the fact that he was elected as a German prince, Charles's staunch Catholicism in contrast to the growth of Lutheranism alienated him from various German princes who finally fought against him. Charles's presence in Germany was often marked by the organization of [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial diet]]s to maintain religious unity. He was frequently in Northern Italy, often taking part in complicated negotiations with the [[Pope]]s to address the rise of Protestantism. It is important to note, though, that the German Catholics supported the Emperor. Charles had a close relationship with important German families, like the [[House of Nassau]], many of which were represented at his court in Brussels. Several German princes or noblemen accompanied him in his military campaigns against France or the Ottomans, and the bulk of his army was generally composed of German troops, especially the Imperial [[Landsknechte]].<ref>''Charles V'', Pierre Chaunu</ref><ref>''Germany in the Holy Roman Empire'', Whaley</ref>\n\nIt is said that Charles spoke several languages. He was fluent in [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], his native languages.

For the regency and governorship of the Austrian hereditary lands, Charles named his brother [[Ferdinand]] Archduke in the Austrian lands under his authority at the [[Diet of Worms]] (1521). Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as [[King of the Romans]] in Germany, which took place [[Imperial election, 1531|in 1531]].

The latter territories lied within the Holy Roman Empire and its borders, but were formally divided between fiefs of the [[German kingdom]] and French fiefs such as Charles's birthplace of Flanders, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. As he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles's requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.\n\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.\n\nCharles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournaisis|Tournai]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.<ref name=\"Kamen\">{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| year = 2005| title = Spain, 1469\u20131714: a society of conflict| edition = 3rd| publisher = Pearson Education| url = https://archive.org/details/spain14691714soc00kame| location = Harlow, United Kingdom| isbn = 0-582-78464-6| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally, they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood.

Castile had become an authoritarian, highly centralized kingdom, where the monarch's own will easily overrode legislative and justice institutions.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Monreal, Gregorio| author2 = Jimeno, Roldan|year = 2012 | title = Conquista e Incorporaci\u00f3n de Navarra a Castilla| publisher = Pamiela | location=Pamplona-Iru\u00f1a| isbn = 978-84-7681-736-0|pages = 37-43}}</ref> By contrast, in the crown of Aragon, and especially in the Pyrenean kingdom of Navarre, law prevailed, and the monarchy was seen as [[Basque fuero|a contract with the people]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQioAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA104&dq=navarre,+law+prevailed,+and+the+monarchy+was+a+contract+with+the+people&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsyKOXj8zlAhWExVkKHR6HDBQQ6AEwAnoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=navarre,%20law%20prevailed,%20and%20the%20monarchy%20was%20a%20contract%20with%20the%20people&f=false|title=The Albany Law Journal: A Monthly Record of the Law and the Lawyers|date=1899|publisher=Weed, Parsons|language=en}}</ref> This became an inconvenience and a matter of dispute for Charles V and later kings, since realm-specific traditions limited their absolute power. With Charles, government became more absolute, even though until his mother's death in 1555 Charles did not hold the full kingship of the country.\n\nSoon resistance to the Emperor arose because of heavy taxation to support foreign wars in which Castilians had little interest, and because Charles tended to select Flemings for high offices in Castile and America, ignoring Castilian candidates. The resistance culminated in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], which Charles suppressed. Immediately after crushing the Castilian revolt, Charles was confronted again with the hot issue of Navarre when King [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] attempted to [[Spanish conquest of Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|reconquer the kingdom]]. Main military operations lasted until 1524, when [[Hondarribia]] surrendered to Charles's forces, but frequent cross-border clashes in the western Pyrenees only stopped in 1528 (Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai).\n\nAfter these events, Navarre remained a matter of domestic and international litigation still for a century (a French dynastic claim to the throne did not end until the [[July Revolution]] in 1830). Charles wanted his son and heir [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to marry the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. Jeanne was instead forced to marry [[William, Duke of Julich-Cleves-Berg]], but that childless marriage was annulled after four years. She next married [[Antoine de Bourbon]], and both she and their son would oppose [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nCastile became integrated into Charles's empire, and provided the bulk of the empire's financial resources as well as very effective military units. The enormous budget deficit accumulated during Charles's reign, along with the [[Spanish price revolution|inflation that affected the kingdom]], resulted in declaring bankruptcy during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].<ref>Elliot, J.H.

As Holy Roman Emperor, Charles was sovereign in several states of northern Italy and had a claim to the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] (obtained in 1530). The [[Duchy of Milan]], however, was under French control. [[Early Modern France|France]] took Milan from the [[House of Sforza]] after victory against Switzerland at the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515. Imperial-Papal troops succeeded in re-installing the Sforza in Milan in 1521, in the context of an alliance between Charles V and Pope Leo X. A Franco-Swiss army was finally expelled from Lombardy at [[Battle of Bicocca|Bicocca]] a year later. Yet in 1524 Francis I of France retook the initiative, crossing into Lombardy where Milan, along with a number of other cities, once again fell to his attack. [[Pavia]] alone held out, and on 24 February 1525 (Charles's twenty-fifth birthday), Charles's forces led by [[Charles de Lannoy]] captured Francis and crushed his army in the [[Battle of Pavia]]. In 1535, [[Francesco II Sforza]] died without heirs and Charles V annexed the territory as a vacant Imperial state. Charles successfully held on to all of its Italian territories, though they were invaded again on multiple occasions during the [[Italian Wars]].\n\nIn addition, Habsburg trade in the Mediterranean was consistently disrupted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1538 a [[Holy League (1538)|Holy League]] consisting of all the Italian states and the Spanish kingdoms was formed to drive the Ottomans back, but it was defeated at the [[Battle of Preveza (1538)|Battle of Preveza]]. Decisive naval victory eluded Charles; it would not be achieved until after Charles's death, at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.\n\n===America===\nDuring Charles's reign, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Castilian territories in the Americas]] were considerably extended by ''[[conquistador]]es'' like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]]. They conquered the large [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] empires and incorporated them into the Empire as the Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] between 1519 and 1542. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe by the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] in 1522, these successes convinced Charles of his divine mission to become the leader of [[Christendom]], which still perceived a significant threat from Islam. The conquests also helped solidify Charles's rule by providing the state treasury with enormous amounts of [[bullion]]. As the conquistador [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] observed, \"We came to serve God and his Majesty, to give light to those in darkness, and also to acquire that wealth which most men covet.\"<ref name=\"Prescott\">{{cite book| last =  Prescott| first =  William Hickling| year = 1873| title = History of the Conquest of Mexico, with a Preliminary View of Ancient Mexican Civilization, and the Life of the Conqueror, Hernando Cortes| edition = 3rd| publisher = Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/PreConq.html| isbn = 1-152-29570-5}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 August 1518 Charles issued a charter authorising the transportation of slaves direct from Africa to the Americas. Up until that point (since at least 1510), African slaves had usually been transported to Castile or Portugal and had then been transhipped to the Caribbean.

He was also the natural candidate of the [[Prince-elector|electors]] to succeed his grandfather as Holy Roman Emperor. After having paid huge bribes to the electors, he defeated the candidacies of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I, King of France]], and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII, King of England]]. The electors gave Charles the crown on 28 June 1519. On 26 October 1520 he was crowned in Germany and some ten years later, on [[Coronation of Charles V|22 February 1530]], he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Clement VII]] in [[Bologna]], the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.<ref>William Maltby, ''The Reign of Charles V'' (St. Martin's Press, 2002)</ref><ref>Claims that he gained the imperial crown through bribery have been questioned.

They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands. An [[inquisition]] was established as early as 1522. In 1550, the death penalty was introduced for all cases of unrepentant heresy. Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], personally suppressed the [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] in mid-February 1540.<ref name=\"Kamen\"/>\n\nCharles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favour of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558. Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of Emperor.\n\n====Wars with France====\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|Francis I and Charles V made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\n\nMuch of Charles's reign was taken up by conflicts with France, which found itself encircled by Charles's empire while it still maintained ambitions in Italy.  In 1520, Charles visited [[England]], where his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], urged her husband, Henry VIII, to ally himself with the emperor. In 1508 Charles was nominated by Henry VII to the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Royal Collection \u2013 The Knights of the Garter under Henry VIII|url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|archive-url = https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20111206134156/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2011-12-06|website = www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}</ref> His [[Garter stall plate]] survives in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Saint George's Chapel]].\n\nThe [[Italian War of 1521|first war]] with Charles's great nemesis [[Francis I of France]] began in 1521. Charles allied with England and [[Pope Leo X]] against the French and the Venetians, and was highly successful, driving the French out of [[Milan]] and defeating and capturing Francis at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. To gain his freedom, Francis ceded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to Charles in the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], as well as renouncing his support of Henry II's claim over [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].\n\n[[File:Emperor Charles V seated (Titian).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait, 1548, by [[Lambert Sustris]] (formerly attributed to [[Titian]])]]\n\nWhen he was released, however, Francis had the Parliament of Paris denounce the treaty because it had been signed under [[duress]]. France then joined the [[War of the League of Cognac|League of Cognac]] that [[Pope Clement VII]] had formed with Henry VIII of England, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Milanese to resist imperial domination of Italy. In the ensuing war, Charles's [[sack of Rome (1527)]] and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulling]] the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt [[Catherine of Aragon]], so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=Holmes1993a>Holmes (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BsV-qSRKAnAC&pg=PA192 p. 192]</ref><ref name=Froude1891a>Froude (1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=n-Ecc8SnlC0C&pg=PA480 p. 35, pp. 90\u201391, pp. 96\u201397] Note: the link goes to page 480, then click the View All option</ref> In other respects, the war was inconclusive. In the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] (1529), called the \"Ladies' Peace\" because it was negotiated between Charles's aunt and Francis' mother, Francis renounced his claims in Italy but retained control of Burgundy.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|third war]] erupted in 1536. Following the death of [[Francesco II Sforza|the last Sforza Duke of Milan]], Charles installed his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] in the duchy, despite Francis' claims on it. This war too was inconclusive. Francis failed to conquer Milan, but he succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally, the [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], including his capital [[Turin]]. A truce at [[Nice]] in 1538 on the basis of ''[[uti possidetis]]'' ended the war but lasted only a short time. [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|War resumed in 1542]], with Francis now allied with Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] and Charles once again allied with Henry VIII. Despite the conquest of Nice by a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman fleet]], the French could not advance toward Milan, while a joint Anglo-Imperial invasion of northern France, led by Charles himself, won some successes but was ultimately abandoned, leading to another peace and restoration of the ''status quo ante bellum'' in 1544.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|final war]] erupted with Francis' son and successor, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1551. Henry won early success in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], where he captured [[Metz]], but French offensives in Italy failed. Charles abdicated midway through this conflict, leaving further conduct of the war to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n====Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire====\n{{Further|Protestantism and Islam|Habsburg-Persian alliance|Conquest of Tunis (1534)|conquest of Tunis (1535)}}\n\nCharles fought continually with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its sultan, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

However, by 1541, central and southern Hungary fell under Turkish control.\n\nSuleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Christian victories such as the [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunis]] in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] after its victories at [[Battle of Preveza|Preveza]] in 1538 and [[Battle of Djerba|Djerba]] in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim [[Barbary corsairs]], acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.\n\nIn 1536 [[Francis I of France]] allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the [[Peace of Cr\u00e9py|Truce of Cr\u00e9py-en-Laonnois]]. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating<ref name=\"treaty\">In particular, in this [[Truce of Adrianople (1547)]] Charles was only referred to as \"King of Spain\" instead of by his extensive titulature.

The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\n\nThe issue of the [[Protestant Reformation]] was first brought to the imperial attention under Charles V. As [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Charles called [[Martin Luther]] to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, promising him safe conduct if he would appear. After Luther defended [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] and his writings, the Emperor commented: \"that monk will never make me a heretic\". Charles V relied on religious unity to govern his various realms, [[Personal union|otherwise unified only in his person]], and perceived Luther's teachings as a disruptive form of [[heresy]]. He outlawed Luther and issued the [[Edict of Worms]], declaring: \n\n{{quote|You know that I am a descendant of the Most Christian Emperors of the great German people, of the Catholic Kings of Spain, of the Archdukes of Austria, and of the Dukes of Burgundy. All of these, their whole life long, were faithful sons of the Roman Church\u2026After their deaths they left, by natural law and heritage, these holy catholic rites, for us to live and die by, following their example. And so until now I have lived as a true follower of these our ancestors. I am therefore resolved to maintain everything which these my forebears have established to the present.}}\n\nNonetheless, Charles V kept his word and let Martin Luther free to leave the city. Frederick the Wise, [[elector of Saxony]] and protector of Luther, lamented the outcome of the Diet. On the road back from Worms, Luther was kidnapped by Frederick's men and hidden in a far away castle in [[Wartburg]]. There, he began to work on his German translation of the bible. The spread of Lutheranism led to two major revolts: that of the knights in 1522-1523 and that of the paesants led by [[Thomas Muntzer]] in 1524\u20131525. While the pro-Imperial [[Swabian League]], in conjunction with Protestant princes afraid of social revolts, restored order, Charles V used the instrument of pardon to maintain peace.\n\nThereafter, Charles V took a tolerant approach and pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Lutherans. At the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, Luther's assistant [[Philip Melanchthon]] went even further and presented to Charles V the Lutheran [[Augsburg confession]]. The emperor strongly rejected it, and in 1531 the [[Schmalkaldic League]] was formed by Protestant princes. In 1532, Charles V recognized the League and effectively suspended the Edict of Worms with the ''standstill of [[Nuremberg]]''. The ''standstill'' required the Protestants to continue to take part in the Imperial wars against the Turks and the French, and postponed religious affairs until an [[ecumenical council]] of the [[Catholic Church]] was called by the Pope to solve the issue.\n\nDue to Papal delays in organizing a general council, Charles V decided to organize a German summit and presided over the ''[[Regensburg]] talks'' between Catholics and Lutherans in 1541, but no compromise was achieved. In 1545, the [[Council of Trent]] was finally opened and the [[Counter-Reformation]] began. The Catholic initiative was supported by a number of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the Schmalkaldic League refused to recognize the validity of the council and occupied territories of catholic princes. Thus Charles V outlawed the Schmalkaldic League and opened hostilities against it in 1546 (the year of Luther's death). The next year his forces drove the League's troops out of southern Germany, and defeated [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Philip I of Hesse|Philip of Hesse]] at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]], capturing both. At the [[Augsburg Interim]] in 1548, he created a solution giving certain allowances to Protestants until the Council of Trent would restore unity. However, members of both sides resented the Interim and some actively opposed it. \n\nThe Council was re-opened in 1550 with the participation of Lutherans, and Charles V set up the Imperial court in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, sufficiently close to Trent for him to follow the evolution of the debates. In 1552 Protestant princes, in alliance with [[Henry II of France]], [[Second Schmalkaldic War|rebelled again]] and the second Schmalkaldic War began. [[Maurice of Saxony]], instrumental for the Imperial victory in the first conflict, switched side to the Protestant cause and bypassed the Imperial army by marching directly into Innsbruck with the goal of capturing the Emperor. Charles V was forced to flee the city during an attack of [[gout]] and barely made it alive to [[Villach]] in a state of semi-consciousness carried in a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]]. After failing to recapture [[Metz]] from the French, Charles V returned to the Low Countries for the last years of his emperorship. In 1555, he instructed his brother Ferdinand to sign the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in his name. The agreements led to the religious division of Germany between Catholic and Protestant princedoms.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:La emperatriz Isabel de Portugal, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella of Portugal, Charles's wife. Portrait by [[Titian]], 1548]]\nDuring his lifetime, Charles V had several mistresses, his step-grandmother, [[Germaine de Foix]] among them. These liaisons occurred during his bachelorhood and only once during his widowhood; there are no records of his having any extramarital affairs during his marriage.\n\nOn 21 December 1507, Charles was betrothed to 11-year old [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], the daughter of King [[Henry VII of England]] and younger sister to the future King [[Henry VIII of England]], who was to take the throne in two years. However, the engagement was called off in 1513, on the advice of [[Thomas Wolsey]], and Mary was instead married to King [[Louis XII of France]] in 1514.\n\nAfter his ascension to the Spanish thrones, negotiations for Charles's marriage began shortly after his arrival in Castile, with the Castilian nobles expressing their wishes for him to marry his first cousin [[Isabella of Portugal]], the daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and Charles's aunt [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Maria of Aragon]]. The nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood, and a marriage to Isabella would have secured an alliance between Castile and Portugal. However, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice. Instead of marrying Isabella, he sent his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father, King Manuel, in 1518. In 1521, on the advice of his Flemish counselors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], Charles became engaged to his other first cousin, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], daughter of his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and King Henry VIII, in order to secure an alliance with England. However, this engagement was very problematic because Mary was only 6 years old at the time, sixteen years Charles's junior, which meant that he would have to wait for her to be old enough to marry.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could not wait any longer to have legitimate children and heirs. Following his victory in the [[Battle of Pavia]], Charles abandoned the idea of an English alliance, cancelled his engagement to Mary and decided to marry Isabella and form an alliance with Portugal. He wrote to Isabella's brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], making a double marriage contract \u2013 Charles would marry Isabella and John would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine]]. A marriage to Isabella was more beneficial for Charles, as she was closer to him in age, was fluent in Spanish and provided him with a very handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds that would help to solve the financial problems brought on by the Italian Wars.\n\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella.

The marriage was originally a political arrangement, but on their first meeting, the couple fell deeply in love: Isabella captivated the Emperor with her beauty and charm. They were married that very same night in a quiet ceremony in the Hall of Ambassadors, just after midnight. Following their wedding, Charles and Isabella spent a long and happy honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]]. Charles began the construction of the [[Palace of Charles V]] in 1527, wishing to establish a permanent residence befitting an emperor and empress in the Alhambra palaces. However, the palace was not completed during their lifetimes and remained roofless until the late 20th century.<ref>[http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=/alhambra/history_alhambra/palacio_carlos_v Palace of Charles V] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924081126/http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=%2Falhambra%2Fhistory_alhambra%2Fpalacio_carlos_v |date=24 September 2016 }}, Alhambra.org</ref>\n\nDespite the Emperor's long absences due to political affairs abroad, the marriage was a happy one, as both partners were always devoted and faithful to each other.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamen |date=1997-05-29 |first=H. |title=Philip of Spain |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07081-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 2] |authorlink=Henry Kamen |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 }}</ref> The Empress acted as regent of Spain during her husband's absences, and she proved herself to be a good politician and ruler, thoroughly impressing the Emperor with many of her political accomplishments and decisions.\n\nThe marriage lasted for thirteen years, until Isabella's death in 1539. The Empress contracted a fever during the third month of her seventh pregnancy, which resulted in antenatal complications that caused her to miscarry a stillborn son. Her health further deteriorated due to an infection, and she died two weeks later on 1 May 1539, aged 35. Charles was left so grief-stricken by his wife's death that for two months he shut himself up in a monastery, where he prayed and mourned for her in solitude.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|pp=6\u20137}} Charles never recovered from Isabella's death, dressing in black for the rest of his life to show his eternal mourning, and, unlike most kings of the time, he never remarried.

Although Papal coronation was not necessary to confirm the Imperial title, Charles V [[Coronation of Charles V|was crowned]] in the city of Bologna by [[Pope Clement VII]] in the medieval fashion. \n\nCharles V accumulated a large number of titles due to his vast inheritance of Burgundian, Spanish, and Austrian realms. Following the pacts of Worms (21 April 1521) and Brussels (7 February 1522), he secretely gave the Austrian lands to his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] and elevated him to the status of Archduke. Nevertheless, according to the agreements, Charles continued to style himself as Archduke of Austria and maintained that Ferdinand acted as his vassal and vicar.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5OcgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=Ferdinand+younger+brother+vassal+of+Charles&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6iISg79flAhXssaQKHbGvA9YQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20younger%20brother%20vassal%20of%20Charles&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5T6uAAAAMAAJ&q=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&dq=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyfvozcjlAhWMDuwKHY7eCiAQ6AEITzAF]</ref> Furthermore, the pacts of 1521-1522 imposed restrictions on the governorship and regency of Ferdinand.

Despite this, Charles also styled himself as king of Hungary and Bohemia and retained this titular use in official acts (such as his testament) as in the case of the Austrian lands. As a consequence, cartographers and historians have described those kingdoms both as realms of Charles V and as possessions of Ferdinand, not without confusion. Others, such as the Venetian enoys, reported that the states of Ferdinand were \"all held in common with the Emperor\".<ref>''Relazione di Germania 1526'' in ''Relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato: Germania''</ref > \n\nTherefore, although he had agreed on the future division of the dynasty between Ferdinand and [[Philip II of Spain]], during his own reign Charles V conceived the existence of a single \"House of Austria\" of which he was the sole head.<ref> https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=Martyn+Rady+one+house+of+Austria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL_qrej5foAhXB4KQKHUXQCB8Q6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&q=House%20of%20Austria&f=false</ref> In the abdications of 1554\u20131556, Charles left his personal possessions to Philip II and the Imperial title to Ferdinand. The titles of King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, Croatia, etc., were also nominally left to the Spanish line (in particular to [[Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] and son of Philip II). However, Charles's Imperial abdication marked the beginning of Ferdinand's [[suo jure]] rule in Austria and his other lands: despite the claims of Philip and his descendants, Hungary and Bohemia were left under the nominal and substantial rule of Ferdinand and his successors.

Conversely, in [[Charles De Coster]]'s masterpiece ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak|Thyl Ulenspiegel]]'' (1867), after his death Charles V is consigned to Hell as punishment for the acts of the [[Inquisition]] under his rule, his punishment being that he would feel the pain of anyone tortured by the Inquisition. De Coster's book also mentions the story on the spectacles in the coat of arms of [[Oudenaarde]], the one about a paysant of [[Berchem]] in ''Het geuzenboek'' (1979) by [[Louis Paul Boon]], while {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Hans|nl}} (1882\u20131939) included both tales in ''De liefdesavonturen van keizer Karel in Vlaanderen''.\n* [[Lord Byron]]'s ''Ode to [[Napoleon Buonaparte]]'' refers to Charles as \"The Spaniard\".\n[[File:Escutcheon of Charles V of Spain MET DT287185.jpg|thumb|right|''Escutcheon of Charles V'', watercolour, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1912. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n* Charles V is a notable character in [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[All Men Are Mortal]]''.\n* In ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', the title object is said to have been an intended gift to Charles V.\n\n===Plays===\n* Charles V appears as a character in the play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' by the Elizabethan playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]]. In Act 4 Scene 1 of the A Text, Faustus attends Court by the Emperor's request and with the assistance of [[Mephistopheles]] conjures up spirits representing [[Alexander the Great]] and his paramour as a demonstration of his magical powers.\n\n===Opera===\n* [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Karl V]]'' (opus 73, 1930) examines the title character's career via flashbacks.\n* In the third act of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Ernani]]'', the election of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor is presented. Charles (Don Carlo in the opera) prays before the tomb of [[Charlemagne]]. With the announcement that he is elected as Carlo Quinto he declares an amnesty including the eponymous bandit Ernani who had followed him there to murder him as a rival for the love of Elvira. The opera, based on the [[Victor Hugo]] play ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'', portrays Charles as a callous and cynical adventurer whose character is transformed by the election into a responsible and clement ruler.\n* In another Verdi opera, ''[[Don Carlo]]'', the final scene implies that it is Charles V, now living the last years of his life as a hermit, who rescues his grandson, Don Carlo, from his father [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and the Inquisition, by taking Carlo with him to his hermitage at the monastery in Yuste.\n\n===Food===\n* A Flemish legend about Charles being served a beer at the village of [[Olen, Belgium|Olen]], as well as the emperor's lifelong preference of beer above wine, led to the naming of several beer varieties in his honor. The ''Haacht'' Brewery of [[Boortmeerbeek]] produces Charles Quint, while [[Het Anker Brewery]] in [[Mechelen]] produces Gouden Carolus, including a Grand Cru of the Emperor, brewed once a year on Charles V's birthday.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Charles V\n|publisher=Global Beer Network, Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A.\n|url=http://www.pilaarbijter.com/body_pages/Texts/History&Beer/CharlesV.html\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080724/http://www.pilaarbijter.com/body_pages/Texts/History%26Beer/CharlesV.html\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=27 September 2007\n|accessdate=18 July 2007\n|df=dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Charles Quint Golden Blond\n|publisher=Haacht Brewery\n|url=http://www.haacht.com/en/Merken/Beers/Keizer%20Karel%20Goud%20Blond\n|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Charles Quint Ruby Red\n|publisher=Haacht Brewery\n|url=http://www.haacht.com/en/Merken/Beers/Keizer%20Karel%20Robijn%20Rood\n|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Beers by Het Anker\n |publisher   = Brewery Het Anker\n |url         = http://www.hetanker.be/pag_en/index_nl.html\n |accessdate  = 18 July 2007\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702132119/http://www.hetanker.be/pag_en/index_nl.html\n |archivedate = 2 July 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy\n}}</ref> Grupo Cruzcampo brews Legado De Yuste in honor of Charles and attributes the inspiration to his Flemish origin and his last days at the monastery of Yuste.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n* [[Carlos V (candy bar)|Carlos V]] is the name of a popular chocolate bar in Mexico.
