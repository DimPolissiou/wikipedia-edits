His current work is abstract painting and fine art photography. He resides in [[Miami, Florida]], USA.\n\n==Biography==\n\nEmilio H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez was born in the colonial village of [[Sancti Sp\u00edritus]], Cuba, in 1950. His family moved to [[La Habana]] in 1953. He started drawing and experimenting with oil paint and tempera at the age of 12. While a student at the Instituto Pre-Universitario de Marianao (Marianao Senior High School), he participated in several workshops sponsored by San Alejandro Arts Academy. Between 1969 and 1970 he worked under the guidance of Cuban painter Jes\u00fas Antonio Valdovino Diaz at a center for the visual arts run by Consejo Nacional de Cultura (National Council of Culture) located in El Vedado, La Habana.  In 1971 he enrolled in the University of Havana to study Pure Mathematics, but after two years he changed the field to Computer Science, obtaining his degree in 1976. After graduation he worked as a software specialist. In 1978 he began signing his artwork as \u201cEmilio H\u00e9ctor\u201d.  He left Cuba permanently in 1981 and spent one year living in [[Paris]]. He moved to [[Miami]], [[Florida]], in 1982, where he currently resides with his family. Upon arrival in Miami, he started working as a computer analyst/programmer. He began painting with acrylic guided by the Cuban painter Dominica Alc\u00e1ntara in 2005 at the \u201cLatin Quarter Cultural Center\u201d in Miami. Abstract painting became his last interest and passion. He has been painting abstracts since 2007. Emilio H\u00e9ctor has been participating in the workshops of renowned Cuban-American painters and professors Baruj Salinas and Yovani Bauta at Miami Dade College. His work can be found in private and public collections in Florida as well as in other states and countries of South America Europe and Asia.\n\nIn 2010 Emilio H\u00e9ctor presented a group of abstract artists to commemorate a Century since the first abstract artwork by Wassily Kandisnsky. This presentation later continued to become the \u201c7 Plus One Art Project\u201d which has been presenting abstract art exhibitions in diverse institutions such as [[Miami Dade College]], the Koubek Center, [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|Saint Thomas University]] and the Miami Hispanic Cultural Arts Center. Actually, Emilio Hector conducts this project as its founder and artistic director.\n\nIn 2014 Emilio H\u00e9ctor was invited to become a member of The Cuban American Phototheque Foundation in recognition of his work in the field of photography.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n===Individual exhibitions===\n\nHe has presented several solo exhibitions including one in 2015, at Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Florida, and two in 2014, one at the Miami Dade College-West Gallery and  other at Rev. Jorge Sardi\u00f1as Gallery, at  Saint Thomas University both in  Miami, Florida.\n\n'''2019''': AND THE WORD BECAME FLESH Archbishop John C.

His current work is abstract painting and fine art photography. He resides in [[Miami, Florida]], USA.\n\n==Biography==\n\nEmilio H\u00e9ctor Rodr\u00edguez was born in the colonial village of [[Sancti Sp\u00edritus]], Cuba, in 1950. His family moved to [[La Habana]] in 1953. He started drawing and experimenting with oil paint and tempera at the age of 12. While a student at the Instituto Pre-Universitario de Marianao (Marianao Senior High School), he participated in several workshops sponsored by San Alejandro Arts Academy. Between 1969 and 1970 he worked under the guidance of Cuban painter Jes\u00fas Antonio Valdovino Diaz at a center for the visual arts run by Consejo Nacional de Cultura (National Council of Culture) located in El Vedado, La Habana.  In 1971 he enrolled in the University of Havana to study Pure Mathematics, but after two years he changed the field to Computer Science, obtaining his degree in 1976. After graduation he worked as a software specialist. In 1978 he began signing his artwork as \u201cEmilio H\u00e9ctor\u201d.  He left Cuba permanently in 1981 and spent one year living in [[Paris]]. He moved to [[Miami]], [[Florida]], in 1982, where he currently resides with his family. Upon arrival in Miami, he started working as a computer analyst/programmer. He began painting with acrylic guided by the Cuban painter Dominica Alc\u00e1ntara in 2005 at the \u201cLatin Quarter Cultural Center\u201d in Miami. Abstract painting became his last interest and passion. He has been painting abstracts since 2007. Emilio H\u00e9ctor has been participating in the workshops of renowned Cuban-American painters and professors Baruj Salinas and Yovani Bauta at Miami Dade College. His work can be found in private and public collections in Florida as well as in other states and countries of South America Europe and Asia.\n\nIn 2010 Emilio H\u00e9ctor presented a group of abstract artists to commemorate a Century since the first abstract artwork by Wassily Kandisnsky. This presentation later continued to become the \u201c7 Plus One Art Project\u201d which has been presenting abstract art exhibitions in diverse institutions such as [[Miami Dade College]], the Koubek Center, [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|Saint Thomas University]] and the Miami Hispanic Cultural Arts Center. Actually, Emilio Hector conducts this project as its founder and artistic director.\n\nIn 2014 Emilio H\u00e9ctor was invited to become a member of The Cuban American Phototheque Foundation in recognition of his work in the field of photography.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n===Individual exhibitions===\n\nHe has presented several solo exhibitions including one in 2015, at Ave Maria University in Ave Maria, Florida, and two in 2014, one at the Miami Dade College-West Gallery and  other at Rev. Jorge Sardi\u00f1as Gallery, at  Saint Thomas University both in  Miami, Florida.\n\n'''2019''': AND THE WORD BECAME FLESH Archbishop John C.

The parietal lobe is positioned above the [[temporal lobe]] and behind the [[frontal lobe]] and [[central sulcus]].\n\nThe parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various [[sensory modality|modalities]], including spatial sense and navigation ([[proprioception]]), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch in the somatosensory cortex which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the [[postcentral gyrus]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/cglidden/parietal.html | title=Parietal Lobe}}</ref> and the [[two-streams hypothesis#dorsal stream|dorsal stream]] of the visual system. The major sensory inputs from the skin ([[mechanoreceptor|touch]], [[thermoreceptor|temperature]], and [[nociceptor|pain]] receptors), relay through the [[thalamus]] to the parietal lobe.\n\nSeveral areas of the parietal lobe are important in [[language processing in the brain|language processing]]. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure \u2013 the [[cortical homunculus]]<ref>The cortical homunculus should not be confused with the more general ''homunculus'' concept for a \"spectator within the brain\"; see work by psychologist [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]] for more information on this.</ref> (Latin: \"little man\") in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them.<ref name=\"Schacter, D.

New York (NY): Worth Publishers.</ref> The superior parietal lobule and inferior parietal lobule are the primary areas of body or spatial awareness. A lesion commonly in the right superior or inferior parietal lobule leads to [[hemineglect]].\n\nThe name comes from the  [[parietal bone]], which is named from the Latin ''paries-,'' meaning \"wall\".\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Parietal lobe animation small.gif|thumb|left|Animation. Parietal lobe (red) of left cerebral hemisphere.]]\nThe parietal lobe is defined by three anatomical boundaries: The central sulcus separates the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe; the [[parieto-occipital sulcus]] separates the parietal and [[occipital lobe]]s; the [[lateral sulcus]] (sylvian fissure) is the most lateral boundary, separating it from the temporal lobe; and the [[longitudinal fissure]] divides the two hemispheres. Within each hemisphere, the somatosensory cortex represents the skin area on the contralateral surface of the body.<ref name=\"Schacter, D.

The parietal lobe is positioned above the [[temporal lobe]] and behind the [[frontal lobe]] and [[central sulcus]].\n\nThe parietal lobe integrates sensory information among various [[sensory modality|modalities]], including spatial sense and navigation ([[proprioception]]), the main sensory receptive area for the sense of touch in the somatosensory cortex which is just posterior to the central sulcus in the [[postcentral gyrus]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~lngbrain/cglidden/parietal.html | title=Parietal Lobe}}</ref> and the [[two-streams hypothesis#dorsal stream|dorsal stream]] of the visual system. The major sensory inputs from the skin ([[mechanoreceptor|touch]], [[thermoreceptor|temperature]], and [[nociceptor|pain]] receptors), relay through the [[thalamus]] to the parietal lobe.\n\nSeveral areas of the parietal lobe are important in [[language processing in the brain|language processing]]. The somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure \u2013 the [[cortical homunculus]]<ref>The cortical homunculus should not be confused with the more general ''homunculus'' concept for a \"spectator within the brain\"; see work by psychologist [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]] for more information on this.</ref> (Latin: \"little man\") in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them.<ref name=\"Schacter, D.

Within each hemisphere, the somatosensory cortex represents the skin area on the contralateral surface of the body.<ref name=\"Schacter, D. L. 2009\"/>\n\nImmediately posterior to the central sulcus, and the most anterior part of the parietal lobe, is the postcentral gyrus ([[Brodmann area]] 3), the primary [[somatosensory cortex|somatosensory cortical area]]. Separating this from the [[posterior parietal cortex]] is the [[postcentral sulcus]].\n\nThe posterior parietal cortex can be subdivided into the [[superior parietal lobule]] (Brodmann areas [[Brodmann area 5|5]] + [[Brodmann area 7|7]]) and the [[inferior parietal lobule]] ([[Brodmann area 39|39]] + [[Brodmann area 40|40]]), separated by the [[intraparietal sulcus]] (IPS).

Even drawings may be neglected on the left side. Damage to this lobe in the left hemisphere will result in problems in mathematics, long reading, writing, and understanding symbols. The parietal association cortex enables individuals to read, write, and solve mathematical problems. The sensory inputs from the right side of the body go to the left side of the brain and vice versa.\n\nThe syndrome of [[hemispatial neglect]] is usually associated with large deficits of attention of the non-dominant hemisphere. Optic ataxia is associated with difficulties reaching toward objects in the visual field opposite to the side of the parietal damage. Some aspects of optic ataxia have been explained in terms of the functional organization described above.\n\n[[Apraxia]] is a disorder of motor control which can be referred neither to \"elemental\" motor deficits nor to general cognitive impairment. The concept of apraxia was shaped by [[Hugo Liepmann]] about a hundred years ago.{{clarification needed|date=May 2019|reason=This should be made more specific and not relative.}}<ref name='Apraxia'>{{cite journal | title = Apraxia and the Parietal Lobes | journal = [[Neuropsychologia]] | year = 2009 | first = George | last = Goldenberg | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1449\u20131459| id =  | pmid=18692079 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.07.014}}</ref><ref>[[Hugo Liepmann|Liepmann]], 1900 {{clarify|date=May 2012}}</ref>  Apraxia is predominantly a symptom of left brain damage, but some symptoms of apraxia can also occur after right brain damage.<ref name=\"khan2005\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Khan AZ, Pisella L, Vighetto A, Cotton F, Luaut\u00e9 J, Boisson D, Salemme R, Crawford JD, Rossetti Y, etal | year = 2011 | title = Optic ataxia errors depend on remapped, not viewed, target location | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 418\u201320 | pmid = 15768034 | doi = 10.1038/nn1425 }}</ref>\n\n[[Amorphosynthesis]] is a loss of perception on one side of the body caused by a lesion in the parietal lobe. Usually, left-sided lesions cause [[agnosia]], a full-body loss of perception, while right-sided lesions cause lack of recognition of the person's left side and extrapersonal space.
