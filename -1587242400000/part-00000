On the day of full moon ([[Kartik Purnima]]) immense crowd assembles and take bath. The Mela commences on that day and lasts for more than a fortnight. The Shiva temple, Kali temple and other temples and historical religious monuments are situated here and social and economical activities are at the highest peak during the Mela period. People come here to pay their oblation to the lords and thus its importance is not within Sonepur of Bihar rather it is of India and world fame.\n\nAccording to Uday Pratap Singh, author of the book Baba Hariharanath, before 1757, the Hariharanath temple was composed of artistic rock clusters of timber and black stones. These pictures and praises of Hari were engraved on them. Meanwhile, this temple was reconstructed by Ram Narayan Singh, the deputy sub-ruler of [[Mir Qasim]]. He was a resident of [[Nayagaon, Bihar|Nayagaon, Saran]]. After this, in 1860, the Empress of Tekai built a hospice in the temple premises. In 1871, the remaining three oases of the temple complex were constructed by Maharana Jangbahadur of Nepal. In the [[1934 Nepal\u2013Bihar earthquake]], the temple complex, Osara and Pakora were damaged. After this Birla family rebuilt it. English writer Harry Abbott has highlighted the importance of this temple in his diary while visiting the Harihar Nath Temple. In 1871, English writer Minden Wilson described the Sonpur fair in his diary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jagran.com/bihar/patna-city-sonepur-fare-inagurated-in-bihar-britishers-once-purchased-lakhs-of-horses-from-here-18664499.html|title=\u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u200d\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0917\u093e\u091c, \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0905\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091c\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u0916\u0930\u0940\u0926\u0947 \u0925\u0947 \u0932\u093e\u0916\u094b\u0902 \u0918\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nEducation services in Sonepur is being provided by private as well as government schools and colleges.\n\n1.Kendriya Vidyalaya is one of the notable school and is up to the senior secondary level with Science stream.\n\n2.Ram Sundar Das Mahila Mahavidyalay,Sonpur\n.SPS Seminary School is one of the famous and old school in this small town which is up to 10+2.

On the day of full moon ([[Kartik Purnima]]) immense crowd assembles and take bath. The Mela commences on that day and lasts for more than a fortnight. The Shiva temple, Kali temple and other temples and historical religious monuments are situated here and social and economical activities are at the highest peak during the Mela period. People come here to pay their oblation to the lords and thus its importance is not within Sonepur of Bihar rather it is of India and world fame.\n\nAccording to Uday Pratap Singh, author of the book Baba Hariharanath, before 1757, the Hariharanath temple was composed of artistic rock clusters of timber and black stones. These pictures and praises of Hari were engraved on them. Meanwhile, this temple was reconstructed by Ram Narayan Singh, the deputy sub-ruler of [[Mir Qasim]]. He was a resident of [[Nayagaon, Bihar|Nayagaon, Saran]]. After this, in 1860, the Empress of Tekai built a hospice in the temple premises. In 1871, the remaining three oases of the temple complex were constructed by Maharana Jangbahadur of Nepal. In the [[1934 Nepal\u2013Bihar earthquake]], the temple complex, Osara and Pakora were damaged. After this Birla family rebuilt it. English writer Harry Abbott has highlighted the importance of this temple in his diary while visiting the Harihar Nath Temple. In 1871, English writer Minden Wilson described the Sonpur fair in his diary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jagran.com/bihar/patna-city-sonepur-fare-inagurated-in-bihar-britishers-once-purchased-lakhs-of-horses-from-here-18664499.html|title=\u092c\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u200d\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0938\u094b\u0928\u092a\u0941\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0932\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0917\u093e\u091c, \u092f\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u0905\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0947\u091c\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0947 \u0916\u0930\u0940\u0926\u0947 \u0925\u0947 \u0932\u093e\u0916\u094b\u0902 \u0918\u094b\u0921\u093c\u0947}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nEducation services in Sonepur is being provided by private as well as government schools and colleges.\n\n1.Kendriya Vidyalaya is one of the notable school and is up to the senior secondary level with Science stream.\n\n2.Ram Sundar Das Mahila Mahavidyalay,Sonpur\n.SPS Seminary School is one of the famous and old school in this small town which is up to 10+2.

A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for Varick to institute the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]] during his terms as mayor.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>. Under his leadership, the progenitors of the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Department of Health]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and many others would be created creating the basis of modern New York City. \n\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], he served as [[George Washington]]'s aide-de-camp and private secretary. Varick's body of work from this era would lead to the ''Varick Transcripts'' which now live in the [[Library of Congress]]. The value of these documents has been noted throughout their lifetime as invaluable to the understanding of the formation of the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nVarick was a founder of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and the [[American Bible Society]]. He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life & family==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> Both Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]].

Categories of papers, records, and correspondence are organized as follows;\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n|''Continental Congress''\n|''Continental and State Military Personnel''\n|''Civil Officials and Private Citizens''\n|''Foreign Officers and Subjects of Foreign Nations''\n|''Enemy Officers and British Subjects''\n|''Continental Army Council Proceedings (War Council Proceedings)''\n|''General Orders''\n|''Personal Correspondence''\n}}\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nIn 1783 the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] was founded of which Varick was an original member and president of the New York chapter from 1783 until his death in 1831. Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery. \n\n==Political career==\n===Pre-Mayor===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]]]] Varick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as  Major General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations.

The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789). This body of work laid the whole foundation for the [[Law of New York]], the [[New York City Administrative Code]], and the [[Rules of New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/varick-richard|title=Richard Varick|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=www.encyclopedia.com|publisher=|access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nConcurrently to the above, he was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from [[Manhattan|New York County]] from 1786 to 1788. During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as  Major General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations.

These men were skilled in operating the weapons and were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. The rockets had twin side sharpened blades mounted on them, and when fired ''en masse'', spun and wreaked significant damage against a large army. Tipu greatly expanded the use of rockets after Hyder's death, deploying as many as 5,000 rocketeers at a time.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} The rockets deployed by Tipu during the [[Battle of Pollilur (1780)|Battle of Pollilur]] were much more advanced than those the British East India Company had previously seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missiles (up to 2&nbsp;km range).<ref name=Narasimha/>\n\nBritish accounts describe the use of the rockets during the third and fourth wars.{{Citation needed|date= April 2018}} During the climactic battle at Srirangapatna in 1799, British shells struck a magazine containing rockets, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. After Tipu's defeat in the fourth war the British captured a number of the Mysorean rockets. These became influential in British rocket development, inspiring the [[Congreve rocket]], which was soon put into use in the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=Narasimha>Roddam Narasimha (1985).

This temple was hardly a stone's throw from his palace from where he would listen with equal respect to the ringing of temple bells and the [[muezzin]]'s call from the mosque; to the [[Lakshmikanta Temple, Kalale|Lakshmikanta Temple]] at [[Kalale]] he gifted four cups, a plate and [[Spitoon]] in silver.<ref name=\"padiga3\"/><ref name=\"hasan2\"/>\n\n=====Sringeri incident, Maratha sacking, and rebuilding temple=====\nDuring the [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] in 1791, a group of [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] horsemen under Raghunath Rao Patwardhan  raided the temple and ''matha'' of [[Sringeri]] ''[[Shankaracharya]]''. They killed and wounded many people, including Brahmins, plundered the monastery of all its valuable possessions, and desecrated the temple by displacing the image of goddess Sarada.<ref name=\"Hasan358\"/>\n\nThe incumbent ''Shankaracharya'' petitioned Tipu Sultan for help. A bunch of about 30 letters written in [[Kannada]], which were exchanged between Tipu Sultan's court and the [[Sringeri]] [[Shankaracharya]] were discovered in 1916 by the Director of Archaeology in [[Mysore]]. Tipu Sultan expressed his indignation and grief at the news of the raid:<ref name=\"Hasan358\">{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkbJ6xA1_jEC&pg=PA358|title=History of Tipu Sultan|author=Mohibbul Hasan|page=358|isbn=9788187879572|year=2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bO9Ma9Sb2g4aUvIUT29fCP/Why-we-love-to-hate-Tipu-Sultan.html|title=Why we love to hate Tipu Sultan|author=Vikram Sampath|work=www.livemint.com/|date=2014-01-31}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date in this Kali age in accordance with the verse: \"Hasadbhih kriyate karma rudadbhir-anubhuyate\" (People do [evil] deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying).\"<ref>''Annual Report of the Mysore Archaeological Department'' 1916 pp&nbsp;10\u201311, 73\u20136</ref> </blockquote>\n\nHe immediately ordered the Asaf of [[Bednur]] to supply the Swami with 200 ''rahati''s (''[[Travancore Fanam|fanam]]''s) in cash and other gifts and articles.

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C.

He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Macqulay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.<ref name= Bernard >K.L.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b. Abi Talib]], who was both the fourth caliph and the first Shi'ite Imam).\n\n'''Gold''': Faruqi \"\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0642\u06cc\" for the pagoda ([[Umar|Umar al-Faruq]], the second caliph) -- Sad\u00eeqi \"\u0635\u062f\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\" for the double-pagoda ([[Abu Bakr]] al-Sadiq, the first caliph) -- Ahmadi \"\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc\" for the four-pagoda ( \"most praised \", one of the name of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]). During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.

It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.\n\nNoted for his persecution of Christians, historian Thomas Paul notes that Tipu had shifted his hatred for the British to Catholics of Mangalore and other Christian communities of [[South India]].<ref>Thomas, Paul (1954), Christians and Christianity in India and Pakistan: a general survey of the progress of Christianity in India from apostolic times to the present day, Allen & Unwin, p. 235</ref> According to historian Praxy Fernandes, Tipu Sultan was \"an enlightened monarch who followed a secular policy towards his subjects.\"<ref name=\"mehta\"/>\n\n[[C. Hayavadana Rao]] wrote about Tipu in his encyclopaedic court history of Mysore. He asserted that Tipu's \"religious fanaticism and the excesses committed in the name of religion, both in Mysore and in the provinces, stand condemned for all time. His bigotry, indeed, was so great that it precluded all ideas of toleration\". He further asserts that the acts of Tipu that were constructive towards Hindus were largely political and ostentatious rather than an indication of genuine tolerance.<ref name=\"Rao\">{{cite book\n| last = Rao\n| first = Hayavadana C.\n| title = History of Mysore 1399\u20131799: Incorporating the latest Epigraphical, Literary and Historical Researches Vol. 3 pgs 1047\u201353\n| publisher = Bangalore Government Press\n}}</ref>\n\n=====Persecution of Lingayats=====\nAfter Haider Ali was appointed the military chief of the Hindu [[Wadiyar dynasty]] of Mysore and led a coup, the [[Lingayats]] of Karnataka came under Islamic rule in the late 18th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aya Ikegame|title=Princely India Re-imagined: A Historical Anthropology of Mysore from 1799 to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJkn2ukhLgUC&pg=PA123 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-23910-6|pages=123\u2013125}}</ref> During this period, the followers of Lingayatism were persecuted.

There were repeated attempts to capture Kodagu by the sultan and his father [[Hyder Ali]] before him. The primary reason for Sultan's interest in Kodagu was that annexing Kodagu would provide access to Mangalore port. The Kodavas knew their lands and mountains very well which made them excellent at guerrilla warfare. Kodavas were outnumbered 3 to 1 in most of Tippu's attempts to annex Kodagu but they managed to beat back Tippu most of the times by drawing his army towards hilly regions of their land. On few occasions Tippu's army managed to reach Madikeri (Capital of Kodagu) but the Kodavas always ambushed the contingent left behind by Tippu. Kodavas refusal to bow to the sultan was primarily because throughout their history they enjoyed independence, though there were Rajahs ruling over them, governance of the land mainly rested with Kodavas. After capturing Kodagu on another occasion, Tippu proclaimed, \"If you ever dare to ambush my men again, I will honor everyone of you with Islam\", undeterred, the resilient Kodavas ambushed his men yet again and drove them back to Mysore. By now Tippu realised conventional warfare would never yield him Kodagu. He devised a plan to annex Kodagu by offering his friendship. His offer of friendship was welcomed by Kodavas as the battles with the Sultan over the years had cost them dearly. When Kodavas welcomed Sultan to their land in the name of friendship, the Sultan and his men attacked them and took thousands as prisoners. -->\nTipu got Runmust Khan, the ''[[Kurnool|Nawab of Kurnool]]'', to launch a surprise attack upon the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] Hindus who were besieged by the invading Muslim army. 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains.<ref name=\"Prabhu\">{{harvnb|Prabhu|1999|p=223}}</ref> Thousands of Kodavas were seized along with the Raja and held captive at Seringapatam.

For instance, there were a significant number of forced conversions of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the 1780 [[Battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref>William Dalrymple ''White Mughals'' (2006) p.28</ref>\n\nDuring the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics. Those condemned by Tipu Sultan for treachery were hanged instantly, the gibbets being weighed down by the number of bodies they carried. The Netravati River was so putrid with the stench of dying bodies, that the local residents were forced to leave their riverside homes.<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n\nThe Archbishop of Goa wrote in 1800, ''\"It is notoriously known in all Asia and all other parts of the globe of the oppression and sufferings experienced by the Christians in the Dominion of the King of Kanara, during the usurpation of that country by Tipu Sultan from an implacable hatred he had against them who professed Christianity.\"''<ref name=\"Lobo2\"/>\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|left|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]\nTipu Sultan's invasion of the Malabar had an adverse impact on the [[Syrian Malabar Nasrani]] community of the Malabar coast. Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tipu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Syrian Malabar Nasrani were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, arecanut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Syrian Malabar farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tipu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses.

Local South India coinage had been struck in the area that became [[Mysore]] since ancient times, with the first gold coinage introduced about the 11th century (the elephant [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]), and other pagodas continuing through the following centuries. These [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]] were always in the South Indian style until the reign of [[Hyder Ali|Haidar Ali]] (1761-1782), who added pagodas with Persian legends, plus a few very rare gold mohurs and silver rupees, always in the name of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Alam II]] plus the Arabic letter \"\u062d\" as the first letter of his name. His successor, Tipu Sultan, continued to issue [[Pagoda (coin)|pagoda]]<nowiki/>s, mohurs and [[rupee]]s, with legends that were completely new. As for copper, the new large [[paisa]] was commenced by Haidar Ali in AH1195, two years before his death, with the elephant on the obverse, the mint on the reverse, and was continued throughout the reign of Tipu Sultan, who added other denominations. Tipu Sultan introduced a set of new [[Persian language|Persian]] names for the various denominations, which appear on all of the gold and silver coins and on some of the copper. They were:\n\n'''Copper''': Qutb \"\u0642\u0637\u0628\" for the 1/8 paisa ([[Persian language|Persian]] for the [[pole star]]) -- Akhtar \"\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0631\" for the 1/4 paisa (star) -- Bahram \"\u0628\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645\" for the 1/2 paisa (the planet [[Mars]]) -- Zohra \"\u0632\u0647\u0631\u0647\" for the paisa (the planet [[Venus]]) -- either Othmani \"\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc\" for the double-paisa ([[Uthman|the third caliph]] of the Rashidun) or Mushtari \"\u0645\u0634\u062a\u0631\u06cc\" (the planet [[Jupiter]]).\n\n'''Silver''': Khizri \"\u062e\u0636\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/32 rupee ([[Khidr|Khizr]] the prophet) -- Kazimi \"\u06a9\u0627\u0638\u0645\u06cc\" for the 1/16 rupee (for [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]], the seventh Shi'ite Imam) -- Ja'fari \"\u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/8 rupee ([[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the sixth Shi'ite Imam) -- B\u00e2qiri \"\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0631\u06cc\" for the 1/4 rupee ([[Muhammad al-Baqir]], the fifth Imam) -- Abidi \"\u0639\u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\" for the 1/2 rupee ([[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Ali Zain al-'Abidin]], the fourth Imam) -- Imami for the rupee (reference to the [[The Twelve Imams|12 Shi'ite Imams]]) -- Haidari \"\u062d\u06cc\u062f\u0631\u06cc\" for the double-rupee (lion, for [[Ali|Ali b.

During his first 4 years, the large gold coin was the [[mohur]], with an average weight of about 10.95g (AH1197-1200), replaced with the four-pagoda of 13.74g with the calendar change to the Mauludi \"\u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u06cc\" system (AM1215-1219).\n\n===Coinage dating system===\nThe denomination does not appear on the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dated gold coins, but was added on all the Mauludi dated pieces.\n\nAt the beginning of his first year, Tipu Sultan abandoned the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]] dating system and introduced the Mauludi system (from the Arabic word \"walad \", which means \"birth \"), based on the [[Solar calendar|solar]] year and the birth year of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (actually 571 AD, but for some perplexing reason reckoned as 572 by Tipu Sultan for his staff).\n\nFrom the beginning of his reign, Tipu Sultan added the name of the Indian cyclic year on the large silver and gold coins, including this double-pagoda, together with his regnal year. Each of the names is Persian, though in several examples, the meaning of the names in India was different from the Iranian meaning (not indicated here). According to the Indian meanings, these are the cyclic years: Zaki \"\u0632\u06a9\u064a\" for cyclic 37, which corresponded to his year 1 ( \"pure \") -- Az\u00e2l \"\u0623\u0632\u0644\" for 38 ( \"[[eternity]] \", year 2) -- Jalal \"\u062c\u064e\u0644\u0627\u0644\" for 39 ( \"splendor \", year 3) -- Dalv \"\u062f\u064e\u0644\u0648\" for 40 (the sign of [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]], year 4) -- Sh\u00e2 \"\u0634\u0627\u0647\" for 41 ( \"king \", year 5) -- S\u00e2r\u00e2 \"\u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627\" for 42 ( \"fragrant \", year 6) -- Sar\u00e2b \"\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0628\" for 43 ( \"[[mirage]] \", for year 7) -- Shit\u00e2 \"\u0634\u062a\u0627\" for 44 ( \"winter \", year 8) -- Zabarjad \"\u0632\u0628\u0631\u062c\u062f\" for 45 ( \"topaz \", year 9) -- sahar \"\u0633\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0631\" ( \"[[dawn]] \", year 10) -- S\u00e2her \"\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0650\u0631\" ( \"magician \", year 11).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3800760&AucID=3949&Lot=2596&Val=8b527bcdc15cad93b00771f495bbf0ca|title=CoinArchives.com Lot Viewer|website=www.coinarchives.com|access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Assessment and legacy==\n[[File:Double paisa of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|right|Among his many innovations, Tipu introduced new coin denominations and new coin types, including this handsome copper double paisa weighing over 23 gm.

Successive [[Indian National Congress]] governments have often celebrated Tipu Sultan's memory and monuments and relics of his rule while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been largely critical.

{"title_page": "Annianus of Alexandria", "text_new": "{{for|the first-century bishop|Anianus of Alexandria}}\n'''Annianus of Alexandria''' ({{lang-grc-gre|italic=yes|Annianos)}} was a monk who flourished in [[Alexandria]] during the [[bishop]]ric of [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]] around the beginning of the fifth century. He criticized the world history of his contemporary monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria]] for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates.\n\nAs a result, Annianus developed his own [[chronology]] which placed [[Dating Creation|Creation]] on 25 March 5492 BC. This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the [[proleptic calendar|proleptic]] Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC. This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning 29 August 360, which itself was four [[Metonic cycle|19-year cycles]] after the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the Diocletian Era on 29 August 284. The former is known as the Era of Grace in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], whereas the latter is known as the [[Era of Martyrs]]. He was the first [[computus|computist]] to recognize the 532-year cycle of [[Easter]]s in the [[Julian calendar]]. This cycle is often attributed to [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorius]] of [[Aquitaine]] in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West.\n\nNone of Annianus's writings have survived. He is principally known from the discussion of his works by [[George Syncellus]] during the 9th century, though lesser fragments appear elsewhere. [[Elijah of Nisibis]] cites him in his 11th-century ''Chronography''.{{sfn|Mosshammer|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&pg=PA359 359]}}\n\nHowever, Annianus\u2019 Paschal table of 532 years, containing a 532-year Paschal cycle based on a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle, has survived.<ref>Neugebauer (1957) 59-63</ref> Its Metonic 19-year lunar cycle was adopted by bishop Cyril of Alexandria, who used it in his own (Greek language and Alexandrian calendar) Paschal table of 114 years.<ref>Mosshammer (2008) 202-203</ref> Shortly before Cyril\u2019s death (AD 444), a beginning was made with a Latin language and Julian calendar Paschal table probably intended for use in the Latin part of Europe; this resulted in a similar Paschal table of 95 years, referred to as \u2018the Paschal table attributed to Cyril\u2019, which covered time interval AD 437-531.<ref>Declercq (2000) 80</ref> A century later this Paschal table was extended by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to a Paschal table covering time interval AD 532-626, three centuries later by an anonym to [[Bede]]\u2019s Paschal table covering time interval AD 532-1063 and containing a 532-year Paschal cycle.

The school merged with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] in September 2014 to form [[St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College]]. The school is based over both of the former school sites.\n\n==School history==\n===Grammar school===\nSt. Bede's Grammar School opened on 12 June 1900, in  Drewton Street, [[Bradford]].  Its first Headmaster was Rev. Dr. [[Arthur Hinsley]], later Rector of the [[Venerable English College, Rome]], Apostolic Delegate to [[Africa]], and Cardinal [[Archbishop of Westminster]] (1935\u20131943).\n\nIn 1919 the school was moved to its present site at Heaton Hall. The old Hall, home of the Rosse family, proved unsatisfactory as the number of pupils continued to grow and a new school was opened in 1939. Since then many additions and alterations have been made to the accommodation. A new technical wing was built in the 1950s, a new refectory and sixth form centre were added in the 1960s.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThe school has had comprehensive status since the 1960s, and was no longer a grammar school. A Maths/English block was built in the 1970s. New Science laboratories were opened in 2001 and new ICT facilities were provided. By 2008 a new sports hall was opened by Labour Minister for Sports (at the time) [[Gerry Sutcliffe]].  A new extension containing new offices and classrooms was built in the late 2000s.\n\nFrom 2008 the school had one federated governing body with St Joseph's Catholic College and Yorkshire Martyrs Catholic College and when Yorkshire Martyrs closed in 2010 the boys transferred to St Bede's.  An Executive Headteacher was appointed in 2009 to oversee both St Bede's and St Joseph's.\n\n===Merger===\nThe school merged with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] in September 2014 to form [[St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11014636.Largest_Catholic_school_in_country_now_planned_as_St_Bede_s_and_St_Joseph_s_may_merge_in_Bradford/ |title=Largest Catholic school in country now planned as St Bede's and St Joseph's may merge in Bradford |newspaper=Bradford Telegraph and Argus |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> The former St. Bede's is now used as the upper school site of the new school.\n\n==Sixth Form==\nSt Bede's shared an associated sixth form with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] for many years.  In 2008 the sixth forms of St Bede's and St Joseph's joined with the sixth form of Yorkshire Martyrs Catholic College to form the Bradford Catholic Sixth Form.  When Yorkshire Martyrs closed in 2010 the sixth form transferred to St Bede's and St Joseph's and in 2011 the Sixth Form was renamed St Benedict's Sixth Form.\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{Alumni|date=November 2013}}\n{{Seealso|:Category:People educated at St. Bede's Grammar School}}\n===Comprehensive===\n*[[Paul Bolland]], footballer\n*[[Mark Bower]], footballer<ref name = \"St Bede's -

The school merged with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] in September 2014 to form [[St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College]]. The school is based over both of the former school sites.\n\n==School history==\n===Grammar school===\nSt. Bede's Grammar School opened on 12 June 1900, in  Drewton Street, [[Bradford]].  Its first Headmaster was Rev. Dr. [[Arthur Hinsley]], later Rector of the [[Venerable English College, Rome]], Apostolic Delegate to [[Africa]], and Cardinal [[Archbishop of Westminster]] (1935\u20131943).\n\nIn 1919 the school was moved to its present site at Heaton Hall. The old Hall, home of the Rosse family, proved unsatisfactory as the number of pupils continued to grow and a new school was opened in 1939. Since then many additions and alterations have been made to the accommodation. A new technical wing was built in the 1950s, a new refectory and sixth form centre were added in the 1960s.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThe school has had comprehensive status since the 1960s, and was no longer a grammar school. A Maths/English block was built in the 1970s. New Science laboratories were opened in 2001 and new ICT facilities were provided. By 2008 a new sports hall was opened by Labour Minister for Sports (at the time) [[Gerry Sutcliffe]].  A new extension containing new offices and classrooms was built in the late 2000s.\n\nFrom 2008 the school had one federated governing body with St Joseph's Catholic College and Yorkshire Martyrs Catholic College and when Yorkshire Martyrs closed in 2010 the boys transferred to St Bede's.  An Executive Headteacher was appointed in 2009 to oversee both St Bede's and St Joseph's.\n\n===Merger===\nThe school merged with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] in September 2014 to form [[St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/11014636.Largest_Catholic_school_in_country_now_planned_as_St_Bede_s_and_St_Joseph_s_may_merge_in_Bradford/ |title=Largest Catholic school in country now planned as St Bede's and St Joseph's may merge in Bradford |newspaper=Bradford Telegraph and Argus |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> The former St. Bede's is now used as the upper school site of the new school.\n\n==Sixth Form==\nSt Bede's shared an associated sixth form with [[St. Joseph's Catholic College, Bradford|St. Joseph's Catholic College]] for many years.  In 2008 the sixth forms of St Bede's and St Joseph's joined with the sixth form of Yorkshire Martyrs Catholic College to form the Bradford Catholic Sixth Form.  When Yorkshire Martyrs closed in 2010 the sixth form transferred to St Bede's and St Joseph's and in 2011 the Sixth Form was renamed St Benedict's Sixth Form.\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{Alumni|date=November 2013}}\n{{Seealso|:Category:People educated at St. Bede's Grammar School}}\n===Comprehensive===\n*[[Paul Bolland]], footballer\n*[[Mark Bower]], footballer<ref name = \"St Bede's - Danny Devine, Mark Bower and Andy Kiwomya\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/sport/14694272.bantams-youngster-devine-feels-just-fine-with-senior-service/|title=Bantams youngster Devine feels just fine with senior service|website=Bradford Telegraph and Argus|accessdate=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n*[[Joe Cooke (footballer)]]\n*[[Danny Devine (footballer, born 1997)|Danny Devine]], footballer<ref name=\"St Bede's - Danny Devine, Mark Bower and Andy Kiwomya\"/>\n*[[Nick Doody]], comedian and writer\n*[[Barry Gallagher]], footballer\n*[[Roly Gregoire]], Sunderland F.C. footballer<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/559a3f9be4b0d2540b7167de/t/563a493be4b026d940f1177f/1446660411615/1974+07+St+Bede%27s+Magazine.pdf|title=St Bede's Magazine Bradford - Summer 1974|last=|first=|date=1974|website=Squarespace|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://members.pcug.org.au/~mdinn/StBedes/1975mag.pdf|title=St Bede's Magazine Bradford - Summer 1975|last=|first=|date=1975|website=pcug.org.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n*[[Dave Halley]], rugby league player\n*[[Wayne Heseltine]], footballer\n*[[Andy Kiwomya]], footballer<ref name=\"St Bede's - Danny Devine, Mark Bower and Andy Kiwomya\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-kiwomya-91859683/?originalSubdomain=uk|title=Andy Kiwomya CV|last=|first=|date=|website=LinkedIn|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bradfordmdschoolsfa.co.uk/AppendixIV.htm|title=The Story of Bradford Boys - Appendix IV|website=www.bradfordmdschoolsfa.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Our ex-Bradford Boys as Professional Footballers\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bradfordmdschoolsfa.co.uk/Chapter10.htm|title=The Story of Bradford Boys - Chapter 10 - Our ex-Bradford Boys as Professional Footballers|website=www.bradfordmdschoolsfa.co.uk|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n*[[Chris Kiwomya]], footballer<ref name=\"Our ex-Bradford Boys as Professional Footballers\"/>\n*[[Stepan Lucyszyn]], Professor, Imperial College London\n*[[Danny Verity]], footballer\n\n===Grammar school===\n\n* [[Desmond Albrow]], Assistant Editor from 1976-87 of ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', and Editor from 1966-71 of the ''[[Catholic Herald]]''\n* [[John Braine]], novelist<ref>{{cite book |last1=Salwak |first1=Dave |title=Interviews with Britain's angry young men |date=1984 |publisher=Borgo Press |isbn=0-89370-259-5 |page=41 |edition=1}}</ref>, first of the [[angry young men]], whose 1957 book [[Room at the Top (novel)|Room at the Top]] became a [[Room at the Top (1959 film)|1959 film]], the first [[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen-sink]] film, and received six Oscar nominations, winning Best Actress for [[Simone Signoret]] in the [[1959 in film|1959 Oscars]] \n* [[Daniel Brennan, Baron Brennan|Lord Brennan]], lawyer and Labour parliamentarian, President from 1964-65 of the [[University of Manchester Students' Union]], and President from 2001-14 of the [[Catholic Union of Great Britain]], and from 2008-13 of [[Canning House]]\n* [[Alfred John Brown (writer)]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sbsj.co.uk/st-bedes-history-and-old-boys-information|title=St Bede's History|website=St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sbsj.co.uk/st-bedes-magazinesv2|title=St Bede's Magazines|website=St Bede's and St Joseph's Catholic College|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/559a3f9be4b0d2540b7167de/t/561e3f3fe4b0ae904e8c969e/1444822847763/Alfred+John+Brown+-+The+Life+and+Literary+Works.pdf|title=The Life and Literacy Works of Alfred John Brown|last=|first=|date=2013-10-08|website=Squarespace|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref> \n* [[Johnnie Casson]], comedian\n* Monsignor Bernard Doyle, former headmaster of St Thomas Aquinas Grammar School in Leeds (now [[Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School, Leeds|Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School]])<ref>[https://www.thetablet.co.uk/features/2/8208/obituary-monsignor-bernard-doyle ''The Tablet'']</ref>\n* [[Alfred John Brown (writer)|Alfred J.

By March 1800 [[Valletta]], the Maltese capital, had been [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|under siege]] for eighteen months and food supplies were severely depleted, a problem exacerbated by the [[Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)|interception and defeat]] of a French replenishment convoy in mid-February. In an effort to simultaneously obtain help from France and reduce the number of personnel maintained in the city, the naval commander on the island, Contre-amiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], ordered his subordinate Contre-amiral [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] to put to sea with the large ship of the line [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']], which had arrived in the port shortly before the siege began in September 1798. Over 900 men were carried aboard the ship, which was to sail for [[Toulon]] under cover of darkness on 30 March.\n\nThe British had maintained a blockade off Malta since the beginning of the siege, ostensibly led by Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Lord Nelson]], who by March 1800 was defying a direct order from his superior officer [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]] by remaining in [[Palermo]] with his lover [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]]. In his absence the blockade was under the command of Captain [[Manley Dixon]] of [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] and Nelson's flag captain [[Sir Edward Berry]], who were notified of Decr\u00e9s' departure by the patrolling [[frigate]] [[HMS Penelope (1798)|HMS ''Penelope'']] and gave chase. The large ship of the line was initially only attacked by ''Penelope'', which manoeuvered around ''Guillaume Tell''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s stern, causing severe damage and delaying the French ship sufficiently for Berry to bring his squadron into action. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Decr\u00e9s continued to fight for more than three hours, fighting off two British ships but ultimately unable to resist the combined weight of Berry's attacks. Casualties and damage were severe on both sides, and the defiance of the French ship was celebrated in both countries as a brave defence against overwhelming odds.\n\n==Background==\nIn May 1798, a French fleet under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|crossed the]] [[Mediterranean Sea]], sailing for [[Egypt]]. Pausing at [[Malta]] on 9 June, Bonaparte landed soldiers and seized the island leaving a sizeable French garrison at [[Valletta]] under General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] while the rest of the fleet continued on to [[Alexandria]].<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref> After the successful landing in Egypt, Bonaparte marched inland at the head of his army. The fleet anchored in [[Aboukir Bay]] to support the troops ashore and was surprised and almost completely destroyed on 1 August by a British fleet under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]]. Only two [[ships of the line]] and two [[frigates]] escaped the [[Battle of the Nile]] from the 17 French ships that participated in the action.<ref name=\"NM272\">Mostert, p. 272</ref> Of the survivors, the ship of the line [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']] sailed for [[Corfu]] while [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']], under Contre-amiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], reached Malta with the two frigates.<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref>\n\nWhen Villeneuve arrived at Malta in September 1798, the island was already in turmoil: the dissolution of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the island under French rule had been highly unpopular with the [[Maltese people|Maltese population]], who forced the French garrison to retreat into the fortress of Valletta on 2 September.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> By the start of October, British and Portuguese troops had supplemented the Maltese irregulars, while a naval squadron watched Valletta harbour, to prevent any French effort to resupply and reinforce the garrison.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\">James, Vol. 2, p. 189</ref> Although small quantities of material reached Valletta from France in early 1799, by the start of 1800 no ship had arrived for more than seven months, and the garrison was near starvation.<ref name=\"WLC418\">Clowes, p. 418</ref> In an effort to resupply the garrison, the French sent a convoy from [[Toulon]] in February 1800, but the ships were intercepted off Malta by a squadron under Nelson on 17 February and in the [[Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)|ensuing battle]] the flagship [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']] was captured and Contre-amiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e]] was killed.<ref name=EB247>Bradford, p. 247</ref>\n\nWithout Perr\u00e9e's supplies, the garrison faced continued food shortages, and by March Vaubois and Villeneuve decided to send an urgent request for support to France. For this operation they chose the 80-gun ''Guillaume Tell'' under Captain Saulnier, partly because the condition and size of the ship enabled Vaubois to embark over 900 men aboard, many of whom were sick or wounded.<ref name=\"RG69\">Gardiner, p. 69</ref> Contre-amiral [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] had command of the ship and Vaubois and Villeneuve confirmed the date of departure for 30 March. While the French prepared this expedition, the British maintained their blockade, although without their commander. Nelson, in defiance of specific orders from his commanding officer [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], had retired to [[Palermo]] on [[Sicily]] to be with [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the wife of the British ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] with whom Nelson was conducting an adulterous affair.<ref name=\"NM365\">Mostert, p. 365</ref> In his absence, command had passed to Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Troubridge]] on [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] and then to Captain [[Manley Dixon]] on [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']].<ref name=\"WLC420\">Clowes, p. 420</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAt 23:00 on 30 March, with a strong wind from the south, ''Guillaume Tell'' sailed from Valletta, Decr\u00e9s hoping to use the cover of darkness to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate [[HMS Penelope (1798)|HMS ''Penelope'']] under Captain [[Henry Blackwood]].<ref name=\"RG69\"/> At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted ''Guillaume Tell'' and the captain gave chase, ordering the [[brig]] [[HMS Minorca (1799)|HMS ''Minorca'']] under Commander [[George Miller (Royal Navy officer)|George Miller]] to convey the message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance.<ref name=\"WLC421\">Clowes, p. 421</ref> Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as ''Penelope'' gave chase.<ref name=\"WJ3:16\">James, Vol. 3, p. 16</ref>\n\nBlackwood rapidly gained on the ship of the line and by 00:30 the frigate was within range, pulling up under the stern of ''Guillaume Tell'' and beginning a steady fire to which Decr\u00e9s could only respond with his stern-chasers, light cannon situated in the stern of the ship.<ref name=\"WJ3:17\">James, Vol. 3, p. 17</ref> Decr\u00e9s recognised that if he stopped to engage ''Penelope'' then the rest of Berry's squadron, visible on the horizon to the south, would soon overwhelm him. He therefore continued sailing to the northeast, hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate. However, ''Penelope'' was too fast, and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill, managing to pass Decr\u00e9s' stern repeatedly and pour several [[raking fire|raking]] broadsides into the French ship.<ref name=\"RW142\">Woodman, p. 142</ref>\n\nBlackwood's attack was so successful that by dawn on 31 March ''Guillaume Tell'' had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard, considerably reducing the speed at which Decr\u00e9s could travel. The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, but ''Penelope'' had lost only one man killed and three wounded, and was almost undamaged.<ref name=\"WJ3:17\"/> British reinforcements were now arriving from the south: the 64-gun HMS ''Lion'' under Captain Dixon had received ''Minorca''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s warning at 01:00 and immediately sailed in pursuit, sending the brig on to Captain [[Sir Edward Berry]] in [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS ''Foudroyant'']], who lay some distance to leeward.<ref name=\"WJ3:18\">James, Vol. 3, p. 18</ref> By 05:00, Dixon was close enough to engage, passing between ''Penelope'' and ''Guillaume Tell'' and firing a triple-shotted broadside into the [[port (direction)|port]] side of the French ship. Shooting ahead of the now sluggish ''Guillaume Tell'', ''Lion'' crossed its opponent's bows and shot away the [[jib|jib boom]], allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the bow, raking the French ship from one end while ''Penelope'' did the same to the other.<ref name=\"WLC421\"/> During these manoeuvres, Dixon's ship had briefly become entangled with ''Guillaume Tell''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s rigging, and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled.<ref name=\"NM366\">Mostert, p. 366</ref>\n\nFor half an hour, ''Lion'' continued to fire into the larger ''Guillaume Tell'', but Dixon was unable to keep his ship completely out of range of the French broadsides and by 05:30 the subsequent damage showed an effect, ''Lion'' dropping back and falling behind the French vessel, although remaining within range alongside ''Penelope''.<ref name=\"RW142\"/> At 06:00, ''Guillaume Tell'' came under attack for the third time, when Berry himself caught up with the battling ships in ''Foudroyant'' and pulled along the [[starboard]] broadside of the French ship of the line. Berry hailed Decr\u00e9s to demand his surrender, and accompanied the demand with a triple-shotted broadside, to which Decr\u00e9s responded with fire from his own guns.<ref name=\"RG69\"/> ''Foudroyant'' was flying a full set of sails and therefore suffered severe damage to its rigging in the opening exchange, the additional speed provided by this rig forcing ''Foudroyant'' to move ahead of the French vessel.<ref name=\"WLC421\"/> After working back alongside ''Guillaume Tell'', Berry recommenced fire that rapidly tore away much of the remaining French rigging, allowing ''Lion'' and ''Penelope'' to return to the battle while ''Foudroyant'' dropped back to make urgent repairs.<ref name=\"WJ3:18\">James, Vol. 3, p. 18</ref>\n\nBy 06:30 the badly outnumbered French ship had lost both its main and mizen masts, ''Foudroyant'' returning to the battle in time to collapse the foremast by 08:00.

''Lion'' was badly hit, although not so severely as ''Foudroyant'' while ''Penelope'' was only lightly damaged in the masts and rigging.

By March 1800 [[Valletta]], the Maltese capital, had been [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|under siege]] for eighteen months and food supplies were severely depleted, a problem exacerbated by the [[Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)|interception and defeat]] of a French replenishment convoy in mid-February. In an effort to simultaneously obtain help from France and reduce the number of personnel maintained in the city, the naval commander on the island, Contre-amiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], ordered his subordinate Contre-amiral [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] to put to sea with the large ship of the line [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']], which had arrived in the port shortly before the siege began in September 1798. Over 900 men were carried aboard the ship, which was to sail for [[Toulon]] under cover of darkness on 30 March.\n\nThe British had maintained a blockade off Malta since the beginning of the siege, ostensibly led by Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Lord Nelson]], who by March 1800 was defying a direct order from his superior officer [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]] by remaining in [[Palermo]] with his lover [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]]. In his absence the blockade was under the command of Captain [[Manley Dixon]] of [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] and Nelson's flag captain [[Sir Edward Berry]], who were notified of Decr\u00e9s' departure by the patrolling [[frigate]] [[HMS Penelope (1798)|HMS ''Penelope'']] and gave chase. The large ship of the line was initially only attacked by ''Penelope'', which manoeuvered around ''Guillaume Tell''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s stern, causing severe damage and delaying the French ship sufficiently for Berry to bring his squadron into action. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Decr\u00e9s continued to fight for more than three hours, fighting off two British ships but ultimately unable to resist the combined weight of Berry's attacks. Casualties and damage were severe on both sides, and the defiance of the French ship was celebrated in both countries as a brave defence against overwhelming odds.\n\n==Background==\nIn May 1798, a French fleet under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|crossed the]] [[Mediterranean Sea]], sailing for [[Egypt]]. Pausing at [[Malta]] on 9 June, Bonaparte landed soldiers and seized the island leaving a sizeable French garrison at [[Valletta]] under General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] while the rest of the fleet continued on to [[Alexandria]].<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref> After the successful landing in Egypt, Bonaparte marched inland at the head of his army. The fleet anchored in [[Aboukir Bay]] to support the troops ashore and was surprised and almost completely destroyed on 1 August by a British fleet under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]]. Only two [[ships of the line]] and two [[frigates]] escaped the [[Battle of the Nile]] from the 17 French ships that participated in the action.<ref name=\"NM272\">Mostert, p. 272</ref> Of the survivors, the ship of the line [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']] sailed for [[Corfu]] while [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']], under Contre-amiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], reached Malta with the two frigates.<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref>\n\nWhen Villeneuve arrived at Malta in September 1798, the island was already in turmoil: the dissolution of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the island under French rule had been highly unpopular with the [[Maltese people|Maltese population]], who forced the French garrison to retreat into the fortress of Valletta on 2 September.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> By the start of October, British and Portuguese troops had supplemented the Maltese irregulars, while a naval squadron watched Valletta harbour, to prevent any French effort to resupply and reinforce the garrison.<ref name=\"WJ2:189\">James, Vol. 2, p. 189</ref> Although small quantities of material reached Valletta from France in early 1799, by the start of 1800 no ship had arrived for more than seven months, and the garrison was near starvation.<ref name=\"WLC418\">Clowes, p. 418</ref> In an effort to resupply the garrison, the French sent a convoy from [[Toulon]] in February 1800, but the ships were intercepted off Malta by a squadron under Nelson on 17 February and in the [[Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800)|ensuing battle]] the flagship [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']] was captured and Contre-amiral [[Jean-Baptiste Perr\u00e9e]] was killed.<ref name=EB247>Bradford, p. 247</ref>\n\nWithout Perr\u00e9e's supplies, the garrison faced continued food shortages, and by March Vaubois and Villeneuve decided to send an urgent request for support to France. For this operation they chose the 80-gun ''Guillaume Tell'' under Captain Saulnier, partly because the condition and size of the ship enabled Vaubois to embark over 900 men aboard, many of whom were sick or wounded.<ref name=\"RG69\">Gardiner, p. 69</ref> Contre-amiral [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] had command of the ship and Vaubois and Villeneuve confirmed the date of departure for 30 March. While the French prepared this expedition, the British maintained their blockade, although without their commander. Nelson, in defiance of specific orders from his commanding officer [[George Elphinstone, 1st Viscount Keith|Lord Keith]], had retired to [[Palermo]] on [[Sicily]] to be with [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the wife of the British ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] with whom Nelson was conducting an adulterous affair.<ref name=\"NM365\">Mostert, p. 365</ref> In his absence, command had passed to Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Troubridge]] on [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']] and then to Captain [[Manley Dixon]] on [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']].<ref name=\"WLC420\">Clowes, p. 420</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAt 23:00 on 30 March, with a strong wind from the south, ''Guillaume Tell'' sailed from Valletta, Decr\u00e9s hoping to use the cover of darkness to escape the British blockade.

The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating ''\"Cette place est en trop bon \u00e9tat, et je suis moi-m\u00eame trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour \u00e9couter vos propositions.\"'' (\"This place is in too good a situation, and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals\").

As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:\n \n{{centred pull quote|...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial 'rise of superbugs') by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.}}\n\nGlobal-NAMRIP was set up to search for such solutions and mitigations, with particular emphasis to finding alternatives to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. According to the New Scientist,:<ref name=\"NewScientistNAMRIP\"/>\n{{centred pull quote|...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade.

The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business \u2026 indeed most of us.

As Leighton said at NAMRIP's 2016 conference:\n \n{{centred pull quote|...Unless preventative measures are found (and no-one in the world currently knows what those will be), AMR will (through the colloquial 'rise of superbugs') by 2050 be killing more people than cancer, and cost the world economy more than the current size of the global economy. We will not be able to feed the world unless we wean our food production industry off its dependence on antibiotics; common medical procedures (minor surgery, childbirth) will become significantly more hazardous; and advances in treatments (such as those for childhood leukaemia) will become reversed.}}\n\nGlobal-NAMRIP was set up to search for such solutions and mitigations, with particular emphasis to finding alternatives to the oft-cited route of simply funding drug companies to produce more antibiotics. According to the New Scientist,:<ref name=\"NewScientistNAMRIP\"/>\n{{centred pull quote|...I looked at all this and realised that even if there was a billion-dollar fund for new antibiotics, it would not sort out the problem; it might just buy us an extra decade. We need a new approach \u2013 a step change like the one antibiotics gave us when they first came in.<ref name=\"NewScientistNAMRIP\"/>}}\n\n{{centred pull quote|...In many parts of the world, climate change and flooding, war, corruption, politics, received wisdom, traditions and religious practices, and the supply of fuel and money, play a far greater role in food, water, waste treatment, healthcare and the transport of microbes from one host to another, than do the outputs of the drug companies. The twin potential catastrophes are global, and so are the causes. The solutions lie with scientists and engineers to develop new technologies and embed new practices in the public and workforce; they lie with farmers, plumbers, office workers, water and sewage workers, medical practitioners, food retailers, innovators in business \u2026 indeed most of us. And they lie with those who are responsible for shaping behaviour across the world \u2013 not just the pharmaceutical companies.<ref name=Conversation2015>{{Cite journal|last=Leighton |first=Timothy | authorlink1 = Timothy Leighton|year=2015 |title=We need more than just new antibiotics to fight superbugs |journal= The Conversation |issue=15 July 2015 | url = https://theconversation.com/we-need-more-than-just-new-antibiotics-to-fight-superbugs-44054}}</ref>}}\n\nGlobal-NAMRIP creates new research teams,<ref name=\"NAMRIP_news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/news/latest.page?|title=NAMRIP news|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref> commissions new research,<ref name=\"NAMRIP_research\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/research/index.page?|title=NAMRIP research|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref> engaging with industry<ref name=\"NAMRIP_industry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/industry/index.page?|title=NAMRIP industry|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref> to roll out solutions to society, and engaging with the public and policymakers to conduct outreach, education and dialogue.<ref name=\"NAMRIP_outreach\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/publicengagment/index.page?|title=NAMRIP outreach|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref> The award-winning Public Engagement<ref name=\"NAMRIP_outreach\"/> and Policymaker Engagement<ref name=\"NAMRIP_Policymaker_outreach\">{{cite web|url= https://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/publicpolicy/index.page |title=NAMRIP Policymaker Engagement Programme|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2018-11-11}}</ref> programmes that Leighton devised and leads have been mentioned in Parliament by the Under-Secretary of State for Health on 16 November 2017.<ref name=\"Brine_Nov17\">{{cite web|url= https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-11-16/debates/141BEBCB-C1F8-4BA7-ABF5-9186CAAC49F9/WorldAntibioticsAwarenessWeek|title= House of Commons Hansard (16 Nov 2017 Volume 631, 2.31 pm) |publisher=House of Commons, UK |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref><ref name=\"Brine_TV_Nov17\">{{cite web|url= https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/0dbfadce-2829-4ed1-b45a-82bb41c4ed70?in=14:34:58&out=14:35:56|title= Parliament Live TV (16 Nov 2017) |publisher=House of Commons, UK |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref> and Leighton has addressed the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee on his approach to addressing the threat of AMR.<ref name=\"POST2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/news/2018/06/parliamentary-committee.page|title=Prof Leighton addresses Parliamentary and Scientific Committee|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2018-11-10}}</ref><ref name=POST_Journal2018>{{Cite journal|last=Leighton |first=Timothy | authorlink1 = Timothy Leighton|year=2018 |title= Can we end the threat of Anti-Microbial Resistance once and for all? |journal= Science in Parliament |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages= 29\u201332 }}</ref>\n\nGlobal-NAMRIP particularly supports Low/Middle Income Countries with not-for-profit interventions,<ref name=\"NAMRIP_Global-NAMRIP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/about/globalnamrip.page|title=Global-NAMRIP|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2016-08-29}}</ref> for example with initiatives in urban<ref name=\"NAMRIP2018_Accra\">{{cite web|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/news/2018/03/ghana-workshop.page|title=Global-NAMRIP 2018 conference|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2018-11-10}}</ref> and rural Ghana (infection being the primary cause of death in rural Ghana).<ref name=\"Navrongo2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/namrip/news/2018/03/navrongo-starhealer2018.page|title=Africa's first StarStream heads to Navrongo in northern Ghana|publisher=The University of Southampton|accessdate=2018-11-10}}</ref> In Uganda in 2019, Global-NAMRIP members from Uganda, Liberia, Malawi, Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia and the UK met to compare, for the first time, the national AMR strategies of their respective countries, to share best practice.
