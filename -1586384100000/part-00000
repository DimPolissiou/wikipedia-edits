[[Ted Turner]] funded the series as a joint production between the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] and the [[BBC]], and was first broadcast on [[CNN]] in the United States and [[BBC Two]] in the United Kingdom.  Writers included [[Hella Pick]], [[Jeremy Isaacs]], [[Lawrence Freedman]], [[Neal Ascherson]], [[Hugh O'Shaughnessy]] and [[Germaine Greer]]. [[Kenneth Branagh]] was the narrator, and [[Carl Davis]] (who also collaborated with Isaacs with ''The World at War'') composed the theme music.  Each episode would feature historical footage and interviews from both significant figures and others who had witnessed particular events.\n\nAfter the series was broadcast it was released as a set of twelve (NTSC) or eight (PAL) [[VHS]] cassettes.<ref name=cnnarchive/>\n\nThe series was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on May 8, 2012 in [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hometheaterforum.com/t/318354/whv-press-release-cold-war |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416013833/http://www.hometheaterforum.com/t/318354/whv-press-release-cold-war |archive-date=2012-04-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The archival footage has been cropped for widescreen presentation instead of being left in the original format <ref>http://www.moviefreak.com/artman/publish/dvd_coldwar_series.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313050230/http://moviefreak.com/artman/publish/dvd_coldwar_series.shtml |date=2016-03-13 }}.</ref>\n\nThe series excluded several Cold War issues and topics, including the Communist takeovers of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in 1975, the subsequent unification of Vietnam and Vietnamese refugee crisis, the failed Communist revolution in Indonesia in 1965, China after Mao's passing, from the trial of the [[Gang of Four]] to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], Bulgaria, Albania, and more details on the Dominican crisis of 1965.\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode lasts approximately 46 minutes.\n\n{{Episode table |total_width= |background=#689CCF |overall= |title= |aux1= |aux1T=Timeline |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |Title= Comrades\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1917}}\u20131945\n |ShortSummary= Both the United States and the Soviet Union drifted apart after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. Diplomatic and extensive trading relationships were established under Roosevelt, but relations soured following the Soviet [[occupation of the Baltic States]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|eastern Poland]]. After Hitler broke the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] the Western powers worked closely with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Distrust reemerged as Stalin's plans for placing Eastern Europe in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence became apparent towards the war's end, and came to the fore at the [[Potsdam Conference]], just before the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Interviewees include [[George F. Kennan]], [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev|Vladimir Yerofeyev]], Zoya Zarubina, Hugh Lunghi and [[George Elsey]]. The pre-credits scene shows the US Congress nuclear bunker at [[The Greenbrier]], and introduces the television series by explaining how for several decades the world was close to a [[nuclear holocaust]].\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=2\n |Title= Iron Curtain\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1945}}\u20131947\n |ShortSummary=The wartime allies demobilise \u2013 the United States enjoys its economic strength and resurgence while Britain and the rest of Europe is exhausted. A new series of purges takes place in the Soviet Union, and is ravaged by [[Soviet Famine of 1947|famine]]. Germans are expelled from territories now given to Poland by the Soviet Union, and differences emerge over Germany's post-war rehabilitation. Stalin increases his grasp on Eastern Europe, although does not intervene on the side of the Communists in the [[Greek Civil War]]. Britain's power influence goes into decline, weakened from the war and a [[Winter of 1946\u20131947 in the United Kingdom|severe winter]]. Food shortages threatening stability throughout Europe. The United States begins to adopt with a more assertive foreign policy, countering Soviet influence in [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]. Interviewees include [[Lord Annan]], [[Frank Roberts (diplomat)|Sir Frank Roberts]] and [[Paul Nitze]]. The pre-credits scene features [[Winston Churchill]]'s 1946 \"[[Iron Curtain]]\" speech in [[Fulton, Missouri|Fulton]] in the United States, which set the tone for confrontation.\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=3\n |Title= Marshall Plan\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1947}}\u20131952\n |ShortSummary= For both altruistic and self-serving purposes, the United States provides massive grants of aid to the countries of Europe in the form of the [[Marshall Plan]]. Stalin, concerned that the intent of the Marshall Plan is to weaken Soviet influence in Europe, prevents countries in its orbit from participating, and establishes the rival [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]]. Communists come to power through a [[Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat of 1948|coup]] in Czechoslovakia in 1948. Tito, while originally aligned to the Soviet Union, adopts a more independent foreign policy and eventually switches to receiving Marshall Aid Assistance. The [[CIA]] and the [[Catholic Church]] conspire to help oust the [[Italian Communist Party]] and its coalition allies in the [[1948 Italian election]]. The Marshall Plan has the effect of modernising European economies and societies, bringing Western Europe closer together, and closer to the United States. Interviewees include [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev|Vladimir Yerofeyev]], [[Gianni Agnelli]] and [[Giulio Andreotti]]. The pre-credits scene portrays the squalor in post-war Italy, and Truman delivering his [[Truman Doctrine]] speech of 1947.\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=4.\n |Title= Berlin\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1948}}\u20131949\n |ShortSummary= By 1947, the United States placed as a high priority the revival of the German economy, an approach opposed by the Soviet Union. After the introduction of a [[Deutsche Mark]] the Soviet Union began to allow increasingly stringent checks on passenger and cargo flows travelling to the French, British and American sectors of Berlin, located in the heart of East Germany. This ultimately led to a [[Berlin blockade|blockade]] on all rail and road transport linking West Berlin, but an extensive airlift operation ([[Operation Vittles]]) allowed the city to survive. The Communists were however successful in staging a [[putsch]] in the Berlin municipal government, eventually leading to the divisions of both Berlin and Germany. Interviewees include [[Gail Halvorsen]], [[Sir Freddie Laker]] and [[Clark Clifford]]. The pre-credits scene shows the [[Berlin airlift]] in operation.\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=5.\n |Title= Korea\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1949}}\u20131953\n |ShortSummary= Korea after the Second World War was occupied by both the Soviets and the Americans, who respectively installed [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Syngman Rhee]] as leaders. With Soviet support, [[North Korea]] invaded the South in 1950, pushing the unprepared South Korean and US forces back to [[Pusan]]. The world responds, both to combat communism and demonstrate support to the [[United Nations]]. After [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Inchon]] and liberating Seoul, United Nations forces advance into North Korea. This unsettles [[Mao Zedong]], who on Stalin's request sends Chinese forces into Korea and pushes the UN back. Eventually both sides are more or less at [[stalemate]] in the centre of Korea. After countless talks, eventually an armistice is signed. Communism was contained, but Korea would remain divided. Interviewees include [[Lucius D. Battle]], [[Paik Sun Yup]] and [[John Glenn]]. The pre-credits scene shows a battle in progress \u2013 the first \"hot war\" of the Cold War.\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=6.\n |Title=Reds\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1947}}\u20131953\n |ShortSummary= The fears the leadership of both sides had were projected inwards towards their own people. In the United States the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] and the [[Tydings Committee]] carried out investigations into alleged Communist sympathisers in US public life, in particular the [[State Department]] and [[Hollywood]]. In the Soviet Union a [[personality cult]] emerged around Stalin, and a repressive police environment and comprehensive surveillance kept the population fearful. In response to [[Yugoslavia]]'s maverick foreign policy, Stalin inspired the [[Prague Trials]] to warn Eastern European leaders not to stray away from emulating the Soviet model. Repression in the Soviet Union peaked with the investigations into the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]], just before Stalin's sudden death in 1953. Interviewees include [[Arthur Kinoy]], [[Ralph de Toledano]] and [[Boris Pokrovsky]]. The pre-credits scene shows a Soviet labour camp and its victims.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=7.\n |Title=After Stalin\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1953}}\u20131956\n |ShortSummary=[[Nikita Khrushchev]] becomes Soviet leader after the death of Stalin. Khrushchev rolls back a number of oppressive measures that existed under Stalin, restores relations with [[Yugoslavia]] and redirects resources to consumer needs. In a [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|secret speech]] to the Soviet leadership he condemns Stalin's ruthless rule. West Germany is allowed to rearm, provoking the formation of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Khrushchev still wants Eastern Europe to remain within the Soviet orbit \u2013 he sends in troops to quell revolts in [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany]], [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Poland]] and, most significantly, [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]]. Interviewees include [[Anatoly Dobrynin]], [[Charles Wheeler (journalist)|Charles Wheeler]] and [[Sergei Khrushchev]]. The pre-credits scene shows life in Soviet Union under Stalin's personality cult.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=8.\n |Title=Sputnik\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1949}}\u20131961\n |ShortSummary=As a consequence of the [[atomic spies]], the Soviet Union joined the nuclear club, and the two superpowers compete to develop their nuclear arsenals. The Soviet Union's launching of [[Sputnik]] further heightened a sense of vulnerability in the United States, and results in the rapid development of nuclear-armed missiles, and defence-related education. Blamed for a perceived [[missile gap]], Eisenhower is replaced by [[John F. Kennedy]] as US President. The Soviet Union is seen to have taken a solid lead in the [[space race]] after [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s successful return to Earth. Interviewees include [[Joseph Rotblat]], [[Boris Chertok]], [[Andrew Goodpaster]], [[Herbert York]] and [[Gherman Titov]]. The pre-credits scene features the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=9.\n |Title=The Wall\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1958}}\u20131963\n|ShortSummary=West Germany, and West Berlin, become more affluent, prompting a surge of East Germans to cross the borders in [[Berlin]], kept open under the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]]. Khrushchev's demands that the Americans, British and French leave Berlin are opposed, and prospects for a peaceful resolution are dashed after the Soviets pull out of the [[1960 Paris Summit|Paris Summit]] in 1960 as a response to the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]]. Overnight on August 12, 1961 East German police and military units divided the city of Berlin, and work commenced on building the [[Berlin Wall]]. Initial [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|tensions]] culmulate in a stand-off between US and Soviet tanks. Kennedy visits Berlin in June 1963 and delivers his ''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]'' speech. Interviewees include [[Anatoly Gribkov]], [[Valentin Falin]], [[Stefan Heym]], [[Egon Bahr]], [[Raymond L. Garthoff]] and [[Conrad Schumann]]. The pre-credits scene features East Berliners seeking to flee into the West.\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=10.\n |Title=Cuba\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1959}}\u20131962\n|ShortSummary=[[Fidel Castro]] comes to power following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Cuba aligns itself with the Soviet Union and the government starts nationalising American interests, resulting in the United States imposing an economic boycott, and the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Following the detection of Soviet medium range missiles stationed in Cuba, the United States imposes a blockade on the island, and the Soviet Union mobilises for war. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] is eventually resolved through secret negotiations, in which the USSR and the United States agree to withdraw missiles from Cuba and Turkey respectively. Interviewees include Fidel Castro, [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Theodore Sorensen]]. The pre-credits scene has interviews of Fidel Castro, [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] explaining how close they felt the world was to a nuclear holocaust.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=11.\n |Title=Vietnam\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1954}}\u20131968\n|ShortSummary= After losing the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] the French leave Vietnam. A stream of refugees flee to the south after the Communist north institute a harsh [[Land reform in North Vietnam|land reform program]]. The north, with Soviet military assistance, seeks to reunify the country by using the [[Viet Cong]] to destabilise the South, prompting American intervention which escalates after the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] incident. American casualties mount in an increasingly unpopular and seemingly purposeless war that was difficult to wage successfully. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s stature is reduced following the [[Tet Offensive]]. The [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing of North Vietnam]] is interspersed with peace negotiations, which prove fruitless. Interviewees include [[Robert McNamara]], [[William Westmoreland]], [[Nguyen Vo Giap]], [[Bui Diem]], [[Jack Valenti]] and [[Clark Clifford]]. The pre-credits scene portrays the destruction caused by the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=12.\n |Title=MAD\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1960}}\u20131972\n|ShortSummary=The United States [[nuclear strategy]] of [[counterforce]], intended to counter a Soviet conventional attack by targeting military facilities, is discredited following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Instead Defence Secretary McNamara adopts the doctrine of [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), with the belief that the targeting by the superpowers of each other's cities would deter a nuclear war. Both sides step up [[nuclear testing]] and acquire more nuclear weapons, in particular submarines capable of unleashing retaliation should the opponent strike first. The Soviets choose to follow a more defensive doctrine and introduce [[anti-ballistic missiles]], which the United States seek to counter with [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles]]. The arms race remains expensive, controversial and, as demonstrated in the [[Palomares incident]], not without risk. However some small promise of arms control comes from the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] Treaty. Interviewees include [[Russell E. Dougherty]], [[William Kaufmann]] and [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]]. The pre-credits scene has McNamara explaining how MAD was the foundation for [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=13.\n |Title=Make Love Not War\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1960}}s\n|ShortSummary=The United States entered the 1960s with strength and self-confidence. Kennedy increased arms production, bringing an economic boom to [[California]]. Rising expectations led to the [[civil rights movement]] growing stronger, despite the rough response from authorities which regarded them as Communist inspired. More of America's youth became increasingly hostile to the [[Vietnam War]], and embraced new [[counterculture]] and permissive definitions of the American ideals of freedom. Fractures in America's society became increasingly violent, and the latter half of the 1960s brought [[Mass racial violence in the United States|race riots]], the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Chicago Convention protests]]. With the political left appearing divided and radicalised, [[Richard Nixon]] is voted into office. Interviewees include [[Irwin Allen Ginsberg]], [[Rennie Davis]], [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. The pre-credits scene shows [[The Beatles]] touring the United States.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=14.\n |Title=Red Spring\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1960}}s\n|ShortSummary=Likewise the Soviet Union started the decade with [[Khrushchev Thaw|growing openness and optimism]]. There was also an emerging cohort of youth with no memory of the privations and purges of the past, and who had a taste for Western music and fashion that alarmed the established order. Khrushchev sought, with limited success, to make the Soviet consumer economy more affluent, and he initiated housing construction and the poorly organised [[Virgin Lands Campaign]]. Khrushchev's erratic leadership style, his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and a poor 1963 harvest eventually led to his removal from power. Czechoslovakia had an even more profound transformation under [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]], who introduced human rights and free market reforms. However the [[Prague Spring]] was opposed by Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|ended abruptly]] in 1968. Interviewees include [[Milo\u0161 Forman]], [[Vladimir Semichastny]], [[Vasil Bi\u013eak]] and [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]. The pre-credits scene show Khrushchev and Czechoslovak leader [[Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd]] demonstrating solidarity in 1964, in contrast to the Soviet Union ruling by brute force four years later.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=15.\n |Title=China\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1949}}\u20131972\n|ShortSummary=Following the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] [[Mao Zedong]] aligns China firmly with the Soviet Union. China becomes the recipient of Soviet aid, supports Communist movements worldwide and confronts the United States in Korea and in the [[Taiwan straits]]. Domestically China experienced upheaval and disaster with the post-revolution land reforms, the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. A range of factors, including Khrushchev's apparent acceptance of co-existence with the capitalist West and his refusal to share Soviet nuclear technology with China, led to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] and eventual [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|conflict]]. Both sides become deeply distrustful of the other, particularly after China develops nuclear weapons. Sensing an opportunity to contain the Soviet Union, in 1972 the United States suddenly and unexpectedly moves to reestablish ties with China. Interviewees include [[Wu Ningkun]], [[Marshall Green]], [[Liu Binyan]], [[Stepan Chervonenko]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. The pre-credits scene shows [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Nixon's visit to China]], only six years after the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=16.\n |Title=D\u00e9tente\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1969}}\u20131975\n|ShortSummary=Nixon builds closer relations with China and the USSR, hoping to leverage an honourable US exit from Indochina. The Soviet Union is fearful of a US-Chinese alliance, but summits between Nixon and Brezhnev lead to a relaxation of tensions and concrete arms control agreements. [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' strategy also normalises West German relations with [[East Germany]], the USSR and Poland. Although deeply unpopular domestically, US bombing of Cambodia and [[Operation Linebacker II|Hanoi]] succeeds in bringing North Vietnam to the negotiating table, leading to the [[Paris Peace Accords]] in 1972. Deeply resented by South Vietnam, the Accords ultimately fail to prevent Saigon's fall three years later. In 1975 reapproachment continued with the [[Helsinki Accords]], which enshrined [[human rights]] and territorial integrity, and the symbolic [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]]. Interviewees include [[Melvin Laird]], [[Valeri Kubasov]], [[Winston Lord]], [[John Ehrlichman]] and [[Gerald Ford]]. The pre-credits scene shows a Soviet cartoon demonstrating the futility of the arms race.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=17.\n |Title=Good Guys, Bad Guys\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1967}}\u20131978\n|ShortSummary=Under d\u00e9tente the superpowers continued their rivalry, but carefully avoided direct conflict by courting allies in the [[developing world]]. [[Israel]] moved closer to the United States after the [[Six-Day War]], while [[Egypt]] erratically maintained its ties with the USSR. During the subsequent [[Yom Kippur War]] the United States reluctantly supplied aid to Israel, but when it became apparent the Egyptian Army was on the verge of destruction the Soviet Union threatened to intervene. The United States held its ground, brought the two warring sides to the negotiating table, and demonstrated it was the preeminent power in the Middle East. In [[Angola]] the Cuban-backed People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) manages to retain power, [[Angolan Civil War|staving off attacks]] from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-backed [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA), the South African-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) and foreign mercenaries. Cuba also intervenes in the [[Ogaden War]], defending Marxist [[Ethiopia]] from Somalia. Interviewees include [[Saad El Shazly]], [[Abba Eban]], [[Simcha Dinitz]], [[Holden Roberto]], [[Pik Botha]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]. The pre-credits scene shows a group of Africans watching a film possibly about Communism, with the narrator noting American fears of Soviet expansionism in the post-colonial world.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=18.\n |Title=Backyard\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1954}}\u20131990\n|ShortSummary=The United States saw the emergence of leftist movements in different Latin American countries as threatening to its commercial interests, and secretly plotted with military strongmen and middle class interests concerned with the land reforms and [[nationalisation]] policies of new governments. In [[Guatemala]] [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz Guzm\u00e1n|Jacobo \u00c1rbenz]] was [[Operation PBSUCCESS|ousted]] by a CIA-inspired coup in 1954. Similarly US meddling in Chile's economic and political spheres weakened [[Salvador Allende]] grip on power, and he was ultimately deposed by his own military in 1973. The United States sent troops to the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1965 and [[Grenada]] in 1983, and trained and supported various acquiescent juntas, including a brutal regime in [[El Salvador]]. In [[Nicaragua]] the United States secretly supported the [[Contras]] against the leftist [[Sandinista]] government; eventually military actions and economic sanctions push Nicaraguans into voting for anti-Sandinista politician [[Violeta Chamorro]] in 1990. Interviewees include [[Frank Wisner]], [[Hortensia Bussi]], [[Nikolai Leonov]], [[Violeta Chamorro]] and [[Daniel Ortega]]. The pre-credits scene explains that although the USSR avoided intervening in the region, following the [[Cuban Revolution]] Castro and [[Che Guevara]] sought to spark \"100 Vietnams\" across Latin America by initiating guerrilla movements.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=19.\n |Title=Freeze\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1977}}\u20131981\n|ShortSummary=Carter's ambitious proposals for total multilateral nuclear disarmament are rejected by Brezhnev; his championing of [[human rights]] does not win favour either. The [[Helsinki Accords]] encourage writers to establish [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] revitalises Polish nationalism, while in the Soviet Union high profile dissidents and [[refusenik]]s gains popular attention. The Soviets continue a conventional arms race, draining resources from a demoralised consumer economy. [[SALT II]] is signed, to the consternation of many Europeans because of the Treaty's [[NATO Double-Track Decision|\"double track\"]] provisions concerning the deployment of new [[SS-20]] and [[Pershing II]] missiles. Carter's failure to exercise American resolve and strength over the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and an [[1979 energy crisis|oil shock]] ultimately costs him the [[United States elections, 1980|1980 elections]], and the United States decisively swings to a more confrontational foreign policy under [[Ronald Reagan]]. Breznhev successfully leans on Polish leader [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to crack down on the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement. Interviewees include [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], [[Lech Walesa]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] and [[Helmut Schmidt]]. The pre-credits scene shows the United States basking in confidence during its [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]], with the narrator noting d\u00e9tente would shortly be over.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=20.\n |Title=Soldiers of God\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1975}}\u20131988\n|ShortSummary= [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]] [[The Saur Revolution|comes to power]] in [[Afghanistan]] and attempts to modernise the country on Marxist-Leninist lines, provoking a rebellion from more traditional power brokers in the country. The Soviets are initially reluctant to intervene militarily, but respond after Taraki is violently replaced by [[Hafizullah Amin]] who is considered to be destabilising influence. The [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviets invade Afghanistan]], and soon find themselves unprepared facing a hostile army of [[mujahideen]] insurgents, secretly armed by the Americans who see the war as an opportunity to wear down the Soviet Union. To achieve mobility in Afghanistan's rugged terrain the Soviet Union uses helicopters, but are thwarted by [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]]. Atrocities are committed by Soviet and mujahideen forces. Eventually Soviet forces would leave Afghanistan under the terms of the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]], but bloodshed would continue with rival mujahideen forces fighting each other. Interviewees include [[Caspar Weinberger]], [[Artyom Borovik]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. The pre-credits scene shows a battle in progress and presents the views of the superpowers \u2013 the Soviet Union did not want to lose face by being defeated in a [[proxy war]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=21.\n |Title=Spies\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1944}}\u20131994\n|ShortSummary=Throughout the Cold War both sides sought intelligence about their opponents using [[HUMINT|spies]], [[Spy satellite|satellites]] and other means. For political reasons, scientists working on the [[Manhattan Project]] provided nuclear secrets to the Soviets. British agents [[George Blake]] and [[Kim Philby]] passed on to the Soviet Union the identities of Western intelligence assets, and the presence of the [[Berlin Tunnel]]. Conversely, Soviet Colonel [[Oleg Penkovsky]] gave the West vital details of Soviet nuclear vulnerabilities. Intelligence services are also used to silence dissent, in particular in [[East Germany]]. After the Cold War an investigation revealed the Soviet Union had been aware of a number of [[double agents]] operating in its midst from information provided by a CIA [[mole (espionage)|mole]], [[Aldrich Ames]]. One such agent, [[Oleg Gordievsky]], managed to flee the Soviet Union, but [[Adolf Tolkachev]] and [[Dmitri Polyakov]] were arrested, tried and executed.

He hopes that space-based anti-missile systems known as [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) could render nuclear weapons obsolete, but the Soviet Union is concerned of upsetting the [[Mutual assured destruction|MAD]] paradigm that had kept the world safe. [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] assumes power in the Soviet Union, setting to [[Perestroika|reform the Soviet economy]] and [[Glasnost|encourage greater openness]]. He bonds well with both Reagan and [[Margaret Thatcher]], charismatic to Soviet sensibilities, but the SDI issue prevents arms control agreements being made in [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Geneva Summit]] or [[Reykjav\u00edk Summit|Reykjav\u00edk]]. The weakness of the Soviet system is revealed by the [[Chernobyl]] disaster and [[Mathias Rust]]'s Red Square stunt. Knowing the Soviet Union could not compete with SDI without the economic welfare of its people being severely curtailed, whose exposure to popular culture and foreign media has led to raised expectations, Gorbachev eventually agrees to a landmark agreement, the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]]. Disarmament commences, under the maxim of ''[[doveryai, no proveryai]]''. Interviewees include [[Donald Regan]], [[Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater|Sir Charles Powell]], [[Roald Sagdeev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

In Poland [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity]] enters into [[Polish Round Table Agreement|negotiations]] with the Government, and would end up winning a landslide election. In [[Hungary]] the Government chooses to symbolically reinter [[Imre Nagy]], and open its frontier with [[Austria]], which is then crossed by increasing numbers of holidaying East Germans. [[Erich Honecker]] refuses to implement reforms, despite subtle pressure from Gorbachev and growing protests across East Germany. The bloody end to [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|dissent in China]] is never far from the minds of protesters. Just as [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|protests reach a peak]], Soviet forces in East Germany are stood down, and Honecker is replaced by an unimpressive [[Egon Krenz]]. As a concession travel restrictions are lifted but the new regulations are miscommunicated, and the [[Berlin Wall]] is suddenly and irrevocably breached by masses of East Germans. In the momentum, the fate of communism in East Germany is sealed. Interviewees include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth]], [[Egon Krenz]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].

Only the previous week the Communist government [[Velvet Revolution|resigned]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]; and shortly [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] would be deposed and executed in the bloody [[Romanian Revolution]]. Gorbachev permits [[German reunification]] and removes Soviet troops from Europe, but fails to secure financial support from the West. As the Soviet economy collapses, Gorbachev faces opposition from both reformers and hardliners. Sharing their abhorence of Soviet disintegration, Gorbachev brings in hardliners to his government and [[Vilnius massacre|cracks down]] on the Lithuanian independence movement. However they later turn on Gorbachev and stage a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]]. [[Boris Yeltsin]] is instrumental in rallying the public and military to defeat the coup. Sidelining Gorbachev, Yeltsin sets the course for Russia to leave the Soviet Union by establishing the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. The Soviet Union ends on 26 December 1991, and in his Christmas Day address Bush announces the Cold War is over. The cost of the Cold War is considered in retrospect. Interviewees include [[Mircea Dinescu]], [[Alexander Rutskoy]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]].

Diplomatic and extensive trading relationships were established under Roosevelt, but relations soured following the Soviet [[occupation of the Baltic States]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland|eastern Poland]]. After Hitler broke the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] the Western powers worked closely with the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Distrust reemerged as Stalin's plans for placing Eastern Europe in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence became apparent towards the war's end, and came to the fore at the [[Potsdam Conference]], just before the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Interviewees include [[George F. Kennan]], [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev|Vladimir Yerofeyev]], Zoya Zarubina, Hugh Lunghi and [[George Elsey]].

A new series of purges takes place in the Soviet Union, and is ravaged by [[Soviet Famine of 1947|famine]]. Germans are expelled from territories now given to Poland by the Soviet Union, and differences emerge over Germany's post-war rehabilitation. Stalin increases his grasp on Eastern Europe, although does not intervene on the side of the Communists in the [[Greek Civil War]]. Britain's power influence goes into decline, weakened from the war and a [[Winter of 1946\u20131947 in the United Kingdom|severe winter]]. Food shortages threatening stability throughout Europe. The United States begins to adopt with a more assertive foreign policy, countering Soviet influence in [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]].

Stalin, concerned that the intent of the Marshall Plan is to weaken Soviet influence in Europe, prevents countries in its orbit from participating, and establishes the rival [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]]. Communists come to power through a [[Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat of 1948|coup]] in Czechoslovakia in 1948. Tito, while originally aligned to the Soviet Union, adopts a more independent foreign policy and eventually switches to receiving Marshall Aid Assistance. The [[CIA]] and the [[Catholic Church]] conspire to help oust the [[Italian Communist Party]] and its coalition allies in the [[1948 Italian election]]. The Marshall Plan has the effect of modernising European economies and societies, bringing Western Europe closer together, and closer to the United States. Interviewees include [[Vladimir Ivanovich Yerofeyev|Vladimir Yerofeyev]], [[Gianni Agnelli]] and [[Giulio Andreotti]].

After the introduction of a [[Deutsche Mark]] the Soviet Union began to allow increasingly stringent checks on passenger and cargo flows travelling to the French, British and American sectors of Berlin, located in the heart of East Germany. This ultimately led to a [[Berlin blockade|blockade]] on all rail and road transport linking West Berlin, but an extensive airlift operation ([[Operation Vittles]]) allowed the city to survive. The Communists were however successful in staging a [[putsch]] in the Berlin municipal government, eventually leading to the divisions of both Berlin and Germany. Interviewees include [[Gail Halvorsen]], [[Sir Freddie Laker]] and [[Clark Clifford]].

With Soviet support, [[North Korea]] invaded the South in 1950, pushing the unprepared South Korean and US forces back to [[Pusan]]. The world responds, both to combat communism and demonstrate support to the [[United Nations]]. After [[Battle of Inchon|landing at Inchon]] and liberating Seoul, United Nations forces advance into North Korea. This unsettles [[Mao Zedong]], who on Stalin's request sends Chinese forces into Korea and pushes the UN back. Eventually both sides are more or less at [[stalemate]] in the centre of Korea. After countless talks, eventually an armistice is signed. Communism was contained, but Korea would remain divided. Interviewees include [[Lucius D. Battle]], [[Paik Sun Yup]] and [[John Glenn]].

In the United States the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] and the [[Tydings Committee]] carried out investigations into alleged Communist sympathisers in US public life, in particular the [[State Department]] and [[Hollywood]]. In the Soviet Union a [[personality cult]] emerged around Stalin, and a repressive police environment and comprehensive surveillance kept the population fearful. In response to [[Yugoslavia]]'s maverick foreign policy, Stalin inspired the [[Prague Trials]] to warn Eastern European leaders not to stray away from emulating the Soviet model. Repression in the Soviet Union peaked with the investigations into the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]], just before Stalin's sudden death in 1953.

Khrushchev rolls back a number of oppressive measures that existed under Stalin, restores relations with [[Yugoslavia]] and redirects resources to consumer needs. In a [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|secret speech]] to the Soviet leadership he condemns Stalin's ruthless rule. West Germany is allowed to rearm, provoking the formation of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Khrushchev still wants Eastern Europe to remain within the Soviet orbit \u2013 he sends in troops to quell revolts in [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany]], [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Poland]] and, most significantly, [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary]].

The Soviet Union's launching of [[Sputnik]] further heightened a sense of vulnerability in the United States, and results in the rapid development of nuclear-armed missiles, and defence-related education. Blamed for a perceived [[missile gap]], Eisenhower is replaced by [[John F. Kennedy]] as US President. The Soviet Union is seen to have taken a solid lead in the [[space race]] after [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s successful return to Earth. Interviewees include [[Joseph Rotblat]], [[Boris Chertok]], [[Andrew Goodpaster]], [[Herbert York]] and [[Gherman Titov]]. The pre-credits scene features the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=9.\n |Title=The Wall\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1958}}\u20131963\n|ShortSummary=West Germany, and West Berlin, become more affluent, prompting a surge of East Germans to cross the borders in [[Berlin]], kept open under the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]]. Khrushchev's demands that the Americans, British and French leave Berlin are opposed, and prospects for a peaceful resolution are dashed after the Soviets pull out of the [[1960 Paris Summit|Paris Summit]] in 1960 as a response to the [[1960 U-2 incident|U-2 incident]]. Overnight on August 12, 1961 East German police and military units divided the city of Berlin, and work commenced on building the [[Berlin Wall]]. Initial [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|tensions]] culmulate in a stand-off between US and Soviet tanks. Kennedy visits Berlin in June 1963 and delivers his ''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]'' speech. Interviewees include [[Anatoly Gribkov]], [[Valentin Falin]], [[Stefan Heym]], [[Egon Bahr]], [[Raymond L. Garthoff]] and [[Conrad Schumann]]. The pre-credits scene features East Berliners seeking to flee into the West.\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=10.\n |Title=Cuba\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1959}}\u20131962\n|ShortSummary=[[Fidel Castro]] comes to power following the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Cuba aligns itself with the Soviet Union and the government starts nationalising American interests, resulting in the United States imposing an economic boycott, and the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Following the detection of Soviet medium range missiles stationed in Cuba, the United States imposes a blockade on the island, and the Soviet Union mobilises for war. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] is eventually resolved through secret negotiations, in which the USSR and the United States agree to withdraw missiles from Cuba and Turkey respectively. Interviewees include Fidel Castro, [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Theodore Sorensen]]. The pre-credits scene has interviews of Fidel Castro, [[Robert McNamara]] and [[Anatoly Dobrynin]] explaining how close they felt the world was to a nuclear holocaust.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=11.\n |Title=Vietnam\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1954}}\u20131968\n|ShortSummary= After losing the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] the French leave Vietnam. A stream of refugees flee to the south after the Communist north institute a harsh [[Land reform in North Vietnam|land reform program]]. The north, with Soviet military assistance, seeks to reunify the country by using the [[Viet Cong]] to destabilise the South, prompting American intervention which escalates after the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] incident. American casualties mount in an increasingly unpopular and seemingly purposeless war that was difficult to wage successfully. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s stature is reduced following the [[Tet Offensive]]. The [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing of North Vietnam]] is interspersed with peace negotiations, which prove fruitless. Interviewees include [[Robert McNamara]], [[William Westmoreland]], [[Nguyen Vo Giap]], [[Bui Diem]], [[Jack Valenti]] and [[Clark Clifford]]. The pre-credits scene portrays the destruction caused by the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=12.\n |Title=MAD\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1960}}\u20131972\n|ShortSummary=The United States [[nuclear strategy]] of [[counterforce]], intended to counter a Soviet conventional attack by targeting military facilities, is discredited following the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Instead Defence Secretary McNamara adopts the doctrine of [[Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), with the belief that the targeting by the superpowers of each other's cities would deter a nuclear war. Both sides step up [[nuclear testing]] and acquire more nuclear weapons, in particular submarines capable of unleashing retaliation should the opponent strike first. The Soviets choose to follow a more defensive doctrine and introduce [[anti-ballistic missiles]], which the United States seek to counter with [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles]]. The arms race remains expensive, controversial and, as demonstrated in the [[Palomares incident]], not without risk. However some small promise of arms control comes from the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] Treaty. Interviewees include [[Russell E. Dougherty]], [[William Kaufmann]] and [[Harold Brown (Secretary of Defense)|Harold Brown]]. The pre-credits scene has McNamara explaining how MAD was the foundation for [[Deterrence theory|deterrence]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=13.\n |Title=Make Love Not War\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1960}}s\n|ShortSummary=The United States entered the 1960s with strength and self-confidence. Kennedy increased arms production, bringing an economic boom to [[California]]. Rising expectations led to the [[civil rights movement]] growing stronger, despite the rough response from authorities which regarded them as Communist inspired. More of America's youth became increasingly hostile to the [[Vietnam War]], and embraced new [[counterculture]] and permissive definitions of the American ideals of freedom. Fractures in America's society became increasingly violent, and the latter half of the 1960s brought [[Mass racial violence in the United States|race riots]], the assassinations of [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|Chicago Convention protests]]. With the political left appearing divided and radicalised, [[Richard Nixon]] is voted into office. Interviewees include [[Irwin Allen Ginsberg]], [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]].

There was also an emerging cohort of youth with no memory of the privations and purges of the past, and who had a taste for Western music and fashion that alarmed the established order. Khrushchev sought, with limited success, to make the Soviet consumer economy more affluent, and he initiated housing construction and the poorly organised [[Virgin Lands Campaign]]. Khrushchev's erratic leadership style, his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and a poor 1963 harvest eventually led to his removal from power. Czechoslovakia had an even more profound transformation under [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]], who introduced human rights and free market reforms. However the [[Prague Spring]] was opposed by Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and was [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|ended abruptly]] in 1968. Interviewees include [[Milo\u0161 Forman]], [[Vladimir Semichastny]], [[Vasil Bi\u013eak]] and [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]]. The pre-credits scene show Khrushchev and Czechoslovak leader [[Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd]] demonstrating solidarity in 1964, in contrast to the Soviet Union ruling by brute force four years later.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=15.\n |Title=China\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1949}}\u20131972\n|ShortSummary=Following the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] [[Mao Zedong]] aligns China firmly with the Soviet Union. China becomes the recipient of Soviet aid, supports Communist movements worldwide and confronts the United States in Korea and in the [[Taiwan straits]]. Domestically China experienced upheaval and disaster with the post-revolution land reforms, the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. A range of factors, including Khrushchev's apparent acceptance of co-existence with the capitalist West and his refusal to share Soviet nuclear technology with China, led to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] and eventual [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|conflict]]. Both sides become deeply distrustful of the other, particularly after China develops nuclear weapons. Sensing an opportunity to contain the Soviet Union, in 1972 the United States suddenly and unexpectedly moves to reestablish ties with China. Interviewees include [[Wu Ningkun]], [[Marshall Green]], [[Liu Binyan]], [[Stepan Chervonenko]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. The pre-credits scene shows [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Nixon's visit to China]], only six years after the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=16.\n |Title=D\u00e9tente\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1969}}\u20131975\n|ShortSummary=Nixon builds closer relations with China and the USSR, hoping to leverage an honourable US exit from Indochina. The Soviet Union is fearful of a US-Chinese alliance, but summits between Nixon and Brezhnev lead to a relaxation of tensions and concrete arms control agreements. [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' strategy also normalises West German relations with [[East Germany]], the USSR and Poland. Although deeply unpopular domestically, US bombing of Cambodia and [[Operation Linebacker II|Hanoi]] succeeds in bringing North Vietnam to the negotiating table, leading to the [[Paris Peace Accords]] in 1972. Deeply resented by South Vietnam, the Accords ultimately fail to prevent Saigon's fall three years later. In 1975 reapproachment continued with the [[Helsinki Accords]], which enshrined [[human rights]] and territorial integrity, and the symbolic [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]].

[[Israel]] moved closer to the United States after the [[Six-Day War]], while [[Egypt]] erratically maintained its ties with the USSR. During the subsequent [[Yom Kippur War]] the United States reluctantly supplied aid to Israel, but when it became apparent the Egyptian Army was on the verge of destruction the Soviet Union threatened to intervene. The United States held its ground, brought the two warring sides to the negotiating table, and demonstrated it was the preeminent power in the Middle East. In [[Angola]] the Cuban-backed People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola ([[MPLA]]) manages to retain power, [[Angolan Civil War|staving off attacks]] from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-backed [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA), the South African-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]) and foreign mercenaries. Cuba also intervenes in the [[Ogaden War]], defending Marxist [[Ethiopia]] from Somalia. Interviewees include [[Saad El Shazly]], [[Abba Eban]], [[Simcha Dinitz]], [[Holden Roberto]], [[Pik Botha]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]. The pre-credits scene shows a group of Africans watching a film possibly about Communism, with the narrator noting American fears of Soviet expansionism in the post-colonial world.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=18.\n |Title=Backyard\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1954}}\u20131990\n|ShortSummary=The United States saw the emergence of leftist movements in different Latin American countries as threatening to its commercial interests, and secretly plotted with military strongmen and middle class interests concerned with the land reforms and [[nationalisation]] policies of new governments. In [[Guatemala]] [[Jacobo \u00c1rbenz Guzm\u00e1n|Jacobo \u00c1rbenz]] was [[Operation PBSUCCESS|ousted]] by a CIA-inspired coup in 1954. Similarly US meddling in Chile's economic and political spheres weakened [[Salvador Allende]] grip on power, and he was ultimately deposed by his own military in 1973. The United States sent troops to the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1965 and [[Grenada]] in 1983, and trained and supported various acquiescent juntas, including a brutal regime in [[El Salvador]]. In [[Nicaragua]] the United States secretly supported the [[Contras]] against the leftist [[Sandinista]] government; eventually military actions and economic sanctions push Nicaraguans into voting for anti-Sandinista politician [[Violeta Chamorro]] in 1990. Interviewees include [[Frank Wisner]], [[Hortensia Bussi]], [[Nikolai Leonov]], [[Violeta Chamorro]] and [[Daniel Ortega]]. The pre-credits scene explains that although the USSR avoided intervening in the region, following the [[Cuban Revolution]] Castro and [[Che Guevara]] sought to spark \"100 Vietnams\" across Latin America by initiating guerrilla movements.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=19.\n |Title=Freeze\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1977}}\u20131981\n|ShortSummary=Carter's ambitious proposals for total multilateral nuclear disarmament are rejected by Brezhnev; his championing of [[human rights]] does not win favour either. The [[Helsinki Accords]] encourage writers to establish [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]. The visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] revitalises Polish nationalism, while in the Soviet Union high profile dissidents and [[refusenik]]s gains popular attention. The Soviets continue a conventional arms race, draining resources from a demoralised consumer economy. [[SALT II]] is signed, to the consternation of many Europeans because of the Treaty's [[NATO Double-Track Decision|\"double track\"]] provisions concerning the deployment of new [[SS-20]] and [[Pershing II]] missiles. Carter's failure to exercise American resolve and strength over the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and an [[1979 energy crisis|oil shock]] ultimately costs him the [[United States elections, 1980|1980 elections]], and the United States decisively swings to a more confrontational foreign policy under [[Ronald Reagan]]. Breznhev successfully leans on Polish leader [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] to crack down on the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement. Interviewees include [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], [[Lech Walesa]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] and [[Helmut Schmidt]]. The pre-credits scene shows the United States basking in confidence during its [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]], with the narrator noting d\u00e9tente would shortly be over.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=20.\n |Title=Soldiers of God\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1975}}\u20131988\n|ShortSummary= [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]] [[The Saur Revolution|comes to power]] in [[Afghanistan]] and attempts to modernise the country on Marxist-Leninist lines, provoking a rebellion from more traditional power brokers in the country. The Soviets are initially reluctant to intervene militarily, but respond after Taraki is violently replaced by [[Hafizullah Amin]] who is considered to be destabilising influence. The [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviets invade Afghanistan]], and soon find themselves unprepared facing a hostile army of [[mujahideen]] insurgents, secretly armed by the Americans who see the war as an opportunity to wear down the Soviet Union. To achieve mobility in Afghanistan's rugged terrain the Soviet Union uses helicopters, but are thwarted by [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]]. Atrocities are committed by Soviet and mujahideen forces. Eventually Soviet forces would leave Afghanistan under the terms of the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]], but bloodshed would continue with rival mujahideen forces fighting each other. Interviewees include [[Caspar Weinberger]], [[Artyom Borovik]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]. The pre-credits scene shows a battle in progress and presents the views of the superpowers \u2013 the Soviet Union did not want to lose face by being defeated in a [[proxy war]].\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=21.\n |Title=Spies\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1944}}\u20131994\n|ShortSummary=Throughout the Cold War both sides sought intelligence about their opponents using [[HUMINT|spies]], [[Spy satellite|satellites]] and other means. For political reasons, scientists working on the [[Manhattan Project]] provided nuclear secrets to the Soviets. British agents [[George Blake]] and [[Kim Philby]] passed on to the Soviet Union the identities of Western intelligence assets, and the presence of the [[Berlin Tunnel]]. Conversely, Soviet Colonel [[Oleg Penkovsky]] gave the West vital details of Soviet nuclear vulnerabilities. Intelligence services are also used to silence dissent, in particular in [[East Germany]]. After the Cold War an investigation revealed the Soviet Union had been aware of a number of [[double agents]] operating in its midst from information provided by a CIA [[mole (espionage)|mole]], [[Aldrich Ames]]. One such agent, [[Oleg Gordievsky]], managed to flee the Soviet Union, but [[Adolf Tolkachev]] and [[Dmitri Polyakov]] were arrested, tried and executed. Interviewees include [[Markus Wolf]], [[Theodore Hall|Ted Hall]], [[Oleg Kalugin]], [[George Blake]], [[Yuri Modin]] and [[Aldrich Ames]] (who was serving a life sentence). The pre-credits scene shows Polyakov being arrested by the KGB.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=22.\n |Title=Star Wars\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1981}}\u20131988\n|ShortSummary=Reagan's 1983 \"[[Evil Empire speech|Evil Empire]]\" speech sets the tone for a more aggressive US posture against the Soviet Union, and the costly arms race is renewed. He hopes that space-based anti-missile systems known as [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) could render nuclear weapons obsolete, but the Soviet Union is concerned of upsetting the [[Mutual assured destruction|MAD]] paradigm that had kept the world safe. [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] assumes power in the Soviet Union, setting to [[Perestroika|reform the Soviet economy]] and [[Glasnost|encourage greater openness]]. He bonds well with both Reagan and [[Margaret Thatcher]], charismatic to Soviet sensibilities, but the SDI issue prevents arms control agreements being made in [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Geneva Summit]] or [[Reykjav\u00edk Summit|Reykjav\u00edk]]. The weakness of the Soviet system is revealed by the [[Chernobyl]] disaster and [[Mathias Rust]]'s Red Square stunt. Knowing the Soviet Union could not compete with SDI without the economic welfare of its people being severely curtailed, whose exposure to popular culture and foreign media has led to raised expectations, Gorbachev eventually agrees to a landmark agreement, the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]]. Disarmament commences, under the maxim of ''[[doveryai, no proveryai]]''. Interviewees include [[Donald Regan]], [[Charles Powell, Baron Powell of Bayswater|Sir Charles Powell]], [[Roald Sagdeev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

In Poland [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107|Solidarity]] enters into [[Polish Round Table Agreement|negotiations]] with the Government, and would end up winning a landslide election. In [[Hungary]] the Government chooses to symbolically reinter [[Imre Nagy]], and open its frontier with [[Austria]], which is then crossed by increasing numbers of holidaying East Germans. [[Erich Honecker]] refuses to implement reforms, despite subtle pressure from Gorbachev and growing protests across East Germany. The bloody end to [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|dissent in China]] is never far from the minds of protesters. Just as [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|protests reach a peak]], Soviet forces in East Germany are stood down, and Honecker is replaced by an unimpressive [[Egon Krenz]]. As a concession travel restrictions are lifted but the new regulations are miscommunicated, and the [[Berlin Wall]] is suddenly and irrevocably breached by masses of East Germans. In the momentum, the fate of communism in East Germany is sealed. Interviewees include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Mikl\u00f3s N\u00e9meth]], [[Egon Krenz]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. The pre-credits scene includes Gorbachev explaining that by 1989, force alone could not secure the world.\n\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |LineColor=689CCF\n |EpisodeNumber=24.\n |Title=Conclusions\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1989}}\u20131991\n|ShortSummary=Gorbachev and Bush meet at [[Malta Summit|Malta]] in December 1989 to consider the recent dramatic events. Only the previous week the Communist government [[Velvet Revolution|resigned]] in [[Czechoslovakia]]; and shortly [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]] would be deposed and executed in the bloody [[Romanian Revolution]]. Gorbachev permits [[German reunification]] and removes Soviet troops from Europe, but fails to secure financial support from the West. As the Soviet economy collapses, Gorbachev faces opposition from both reformers and hardliners. Sharing their abhorence of Soviet disintegration, Gorbachev brings in hardliners to his government and [[Vilnius massacre|cracks down]] on the Lithuanian independence movement. However they later turn on Gorbachev and stage a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup]]. [[Boris Yeltsin]] is instrumental in rallying the public and military to defeat the coup. Sidelining Gorbachev, Yeltsin sets the course for Russia to leave the Soviet Union by establishing the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. The Soviet Union ends on 26 December 1991, and in his Christmas Day address Bush announces the Cold War is over. The cost of the Cold War is considered in retrospect. Interviewees include [[Mircea Dinescu]], [[Alexander Rutskoy]] and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. The pre-credits scene features Bush and Gorbachev explaining how uncertain the world had suddenly become.\n}}\n\n}}\n\n==VHS vs DVD editions==\nThe VHS version is formatted with 4:3 aspect ratio, common for CRT television sets.

He had several exhibitions e.g. in Budapest at the Ericsson Gallery of Fine Arts Gallery,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artportal.hu/program/athatasok-9015/|title=\u00c1that\u00e1sok|work=artportal.hu|language=hu|accessdate=2020-02-21}}</ref> in Szeged at the Southern Hungarian Creative House, in Zurich, in Sion, in Munich. After several years of persecution in Hungary, he moved to the UK. He publishes new material almost every year.\n\n== About ==\n'''Geza Csosz''' is a Hungarian-born English photographer. Even though he learned his lesson well in composing the accidental moment with precision, in manner of Cartier-Bresson or Josef Koudelka; he uses this knowledge from a rather original perspective. As often his children are the subject of his art, it is inevitably filled with love and intimacy. He does not force the style well learned, and the quasi spontaneity lends his pictures a unique aura, a differentiating feature. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cThings will work out just fine, if you let go.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 These moments of his, in addition to being spontaneous, are incredibly intense, at times even mysterious, or grim at others. They bear, however, no symbolism whatsoever: his abstractions are absolutely photogenic, and the message is the complex ambiguity of the reality behind these pictures. Geza completely trusts viewers to decipher it.\n\nThe key momentum of the aesthetic value is the density of the reference network of analogies within the work of art, i.e. only stylistic fiction can lend meaning to the documented reality in any form of art. Dave's style has some banality and a touch of irony to it. These elevate what we see and scrape the ultimate questions. \u00a0 \u201cHe who has a sense of humour knows everything, he who does not is capable of anything. \u00a0 \u00a0 His \u201cgenre scenes\u201d remind me of the world of Hrabal and Jindrich Streit, of the bitter irony that by the time we die, we could be quite good at living... I trust you to decide if this is the resigned scepticism against a petty, vulnerable life, or if it's a way of posing wise and deeply critical questions. A speculative humanist is someone who, in theory and generally speaking, loves people, but does not love anyone in specific.\u00a0 In Geza's pictures I sense genuine attention and empathy towards others.\n\nOrdinary existence, in terms of art, is a rather thin medium, with a seemingly limited number of possibly aesthetic moments. Dave's \u00a0''faux na\u00eff'' attitude led to surprisingly dense pictures, which have a total lack of academic tedium and boredom, pretentious surreal fantasies, or meaninglessness. Often, he entrusts everything on the atmosphere, at other times he just goes with the flow and leaves space for coincidence. It's as if his attitude as an artist has a complete lack of intention. Actually, he is just very good at hiding it. \u00a0\n\nGeza is definitely not a fundamentalist artist. His humility, intelligence, strong sense of aesthetics and his passionate commitment would make for an ideal combination in a perfect world...\n\nArt does help you live, but what it doesn't do is tell you how you can and should lead your life. Any artist is extremely vulnerable to isolation and loneliness, as there is no such thing as understanding, only misunderstanding. \u00a0You spring back from the concept of art, just like that of God. We think we know the meaning, but we have no idea, and yet this is our only refuge, our only chance of immortality: only art is more powerful than death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.photocsosz.net/2016/05/16/pszeudoprivat/|title=PseudoPrivat \u2013 GEZA CSOSZ|last=Csosz|first=Geza|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\u00a0 \u00a0<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phoo.hu/2016/04/29/pszeudoprivat-csosz-geza-fotoi/|title=PszeudoPriv\u00e1t -

The site was later used as a military command centre, and is now being converted into a museum.\n\nStone was extracted from the quarry until 1914. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) built a [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]] operations room in the quarry. In 1952, during the [[Cold War]], this facility was expanded into a central coordination facility for radar stations throughout Scotland.
