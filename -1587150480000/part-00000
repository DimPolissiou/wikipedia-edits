The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the character was portrayed by [[Scott Reeves]], who made his first appearance On June 26, 1991 as a businessman who wanted to \"work his way to the top of the corporation ladder\". The character gained popularity upon his relationship with [[Victoria Newman]] ([[Heather Tom]]), which initially received criticism due to the characters' [[age gap]]. He was also involved with [[Nina Webster]] ([[Tricia Cast]]) and the insane [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tricia Dennison McNeil|Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]).\n\nReeves, who described Ryan as a \"go-getter\" who was \"shrewd\" and a \"charmer\", found his seduction storyline with Victoria hard to \"play out\" considering her age. In October 2001, the actor announced his exit from ''The Young and the Restless'', stating it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart \"in a big way\". Within the story, Ryan prepared to remarry Victoria but Tricia, his ex-wife, attempted to shoot her and Ryan took two bullets and died from the injury. Throughout his time on the soap opera, Reeves became popular with fans as one of the genre's leading men, garnering multiple awards and nominations.\n\n==Casting==\nReeves first appeared as Ryan in May 1991, on contract.

The two fall in love and marry, to Victor's dismay; however, Victoria refuses to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheats on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorces him, and he then moves in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later marries Nina out of obligation. He eventually develops genuine feelings for Nina; however, she has fallen in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Cole rejects Nina, she has a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tries to commit suicide and shoots herself in a struggle with Ryan; he is arrested for the shooting. Nina suffers short-term amnesia, and although she regains her memory and exonerates Ryan, they divorce. Ryan then ends up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia is very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accuses her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stops taking her birth control pills and they conceive a child; Ryan is against the idea, though he warms up to it. When she eventually miscarries, Tricia sees it as her punishment for having deceived her husband.\n\nTricia then becomes obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She runs Tony down in Megan's driveway, and is suspected of having done so intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons leave town, including Tricia, who leaves Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returns to Genoa City and asks Ryan to take her back; he refuses, as Victoria has become interested in him again. Tricia turns to Carter Mills, who is really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He uses her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide, but Ryan is able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunite, Victor has Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decide to remarry, and on their wedding day Tricia arrives in a wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locks her in a closet and takes her place at the altar, where she holds Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her instead. Victor breaks Victoria free, who enters the chapel; Tricia shoots twice at her, but Ryan jumps in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan dies from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone.

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the character was portrayed by [[Scott Reeves]], who made his first appearance On June 26, 1991 as a businessman who wanted to \"work his way to the top of the corporation ladder\". The character gained popularity upon his relationship with [[Victoria Newman]] ([[Heather Tom]]), which initially received criticism due to the characters' [[age gap]]. He was also involved with [[Nina Webster]] ([[Tricia Cast]]) and the insane [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tricia Dennison McNeil|Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]).\n\nReeves, who described Ryan as a \"go-getter\" who was \"shrewd\" and a \"charmer\", found his seduction storyline with Victoria hard to \"play out\" considering her age. In October 2001, the actor announced his exit from ''The Young and the Restless'', stating it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart \"in a big way\". Within the story, Ryan prepared to remarry Victoria but Tricia, his ex-wife, attempted to shoot her and Ryan took two bullets and died from the injury. Throughout his time on the soap opera, Reeves became popular with fans as one of the genre's leading men, garnering multiple awards and nominations.\n\n==Casting==\nReeves first appeared as Ryan in May 1991, on contract.

The two fall in love and marry, to Victor's dismay; however, Victoria refuses to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheats on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorces him, and he then moves in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later marries Nina out of obligation. He eventually develops genuine feelings for Nina; however, she has fallen in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Cole rejects Nina, she has a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tries to commit suicide and shoots herself in a struggle with Ryan; he is arrested for the shooting. Nina suffers short-term amnesia, and although she regains her memory and exonerates Ryan, they divorce. Ryan then ends up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia is very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accuses her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stops taking her birth control pills and they conceive a child; Ryan is against the idea, though he warms up to it. When she eventually miscarries, Tricia sees it as her punishment for having deceived her husband.\n\nTricia then becomes obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She runs down Tony in Megan's driveway, and is suspected of having done so intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons leave town, including Tricia, who leaves Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returns to Genoa City and asks Ryan to take her back; he refuses, as Victoria has become interested in him again. Tricia turns to Carter Mills, who is really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He uses her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide, but Ryan is able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunite, Victor has Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decide to remarry, and on their wedding day Tricia arrives in a wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locks her in a closet and takes her place at the altar, where she holds Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her instead. Victor breaks Victoria free, who enters the chapel; Tricia shoots twice at her, but Ryan jumps in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan dies from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone.

The amendment was proposed by Congress to the states on August 27, 1962, and was [[ratified]] by the states on January 23, 1964.\n\n[[Southern United States|Southern states]] of the former [[Confederate States of America]] adopted [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]] in laws of the late 19th century and new constitutions from 1890 to 1908, after the Democratic Party had generally regained control of state legislatures decades after the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], as a measure to prevent [[African Americans]] and often poor whites from voting. Use of the poll taxes by states was held to be constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the 1937 decision ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]''.\n\nWhen the 24th Amendment was ratified in 1964, five states still retained a poll tax:  [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]] and [[Virginia]].  The amendment prohibited requiring a poll tax for voters in federal elections. But it was not until 1966 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6\u20133 in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' that poll taxes for any level of elections were unconstitutional. It said these violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Subsequent litigation related to potential discriminatory effects of voter registration requirements has generally been based on application of this clause.\n\n==Text==\n::'''Section 1.

This required that voting not be limited by \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" All voters were required to pay the poll tax, but in practice it most affected the poor. Notably this affected both African Americans and poor white voters, some of whom had voted with [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] and [[Fusion Party|Fusionist]] candidates in the late 19th century, temporarily disturbing Democratic rule. Proponents of the poll tax downplayed this aspect and assured white voters they would not be affected. Passage of poll taxes began in earnest in the 1890s, as Democrats wanted to prevent another Populist-Republican coalition. Despite election violence and fraud, African Americans were still winning numerous local seats. By 1902, all eleven states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had enacted a poll tax, many within new constitutions that contained other provisions as barriers to voter registration, such as literacy or comprehension tests administered subjectively by white  workers. The poll tax was used together with other devices such as [[grandfather clause]]s and the \"[[white primary]]\" designed to exclude blacks, as well as threats and acts of violence. For example, potential voters had to be \"assessed\" in Arkansas, and blacks were utterly ignored in the assessment.{{sfn|Ogden|1958|pp=4\u201313, 170\u2013231}}\n\nFrom 1900 to 1937, such use of the poll tax was nearly ignored by the federal government. Several state-level initiatives repealed poll taxes during this period for two reasons: firstly that they encouraged corruption since wealthy persons could and would pay other people's poll taxes;<ref>Kneebone, John T.; ''Southern Liberal Journalists and the Issue of Race, 1920\u20131944'' p. 142 {{ISBN|0807816604}}</ref><ref>Sullivan, Patricia; ''Days of Hope: Race and Democracy in the New Deal Era'', p. 107 {{ISBN|0807822604}}</ref> secondly, because they discouraged white voting more than many populist Southern politicians desired. The poll tax survived a legal challenge in the 1937 Supreme Court case ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]'', which unanimously ruled that\n\n{{quote|[The] privilege of voting is not derived from the United States, but is conferred by the state and, save as restrained by the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the Federal Constitution, the state may condition suffrage as it deems appropriate.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=302&invol=277 ''Breedlove v. Suttles''], majority opinion.</ref>}}\n\nThe issue remained prominent, as most African Americans in the South were disenfranchised. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke out against the tax.  He publicly called it \"a remnant of the Revolutionary period\" that the country had moved past. However, Roosevelt's favored liberal Democrats in the South lost in the 1938 primaries to the reigning conservative Southern Democrats, and he backed off the issue. He felt that he needed Southern Democratic votes to pass [[New Deal]] programs and did not want to further antagonize them.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=57}} Still, efforts at the Congressional level to abolish the poll tax continued. A 1939 bill to abolish the poll tax in federal elections was tied up by the Southern Block, lawmakers whose long tenure in office from a one-party region gave them seniority and command of numerous important committee chairmanships. A [[discharge petition]] was able to force the bill to be considered, and the House passed the bill 254\u201384.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|page=68}} However, the bill was unable to defeat a [[filibuster]] in the Senate by Southern senators and a few Northern allies who valued the support of the powerful and senior Southern seats. This bill would be re-proposed in the next several Congresses. It came closest to passage during World War II, when opponents framed abolition as a means to help overseas soldiers vote. However, after learning that the US Supreme Court decision ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944) banned use of the \"[[white primary]],\" the Southern block refused to approve abolition of the poll tax.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=74}}\n\nIn 1946, the Senate came close to passing the bill. 24 Democrats and 15 Republicans approved an end to debate, while 7 non-southern Democrats and 7 Republicans joined with the 19 Southern Democrats in opposition. The result was a 39\u201333 vote in favor of the bill, but the filibuster required a two-thirds supermajority to break at the time; a 48\u201324 vote was required to pass the bill.{{clarify|date=February 2011|reason=That's two thirds; and why are there only 72 senators?  My arithmetic says it should require 72\u201324.}}  Those in favor of abolition of the poll tax considered a constitutional amendment after the 1946 defeat, but that idea did not advance either.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=80}}\n\nThe tenor of the debate changed in the 1940s. Southern politicians tried to shift the debate to Constitutional issue, but private correspondence indicates that black disenfranchisement was still the true concern. For instance, Mississippi Senator [[Theodore Bilbo]] declared, \"If the poll tax bill passes, the next step will be an effort to remove the registration qualification, the educational qualification of Negroes. If that is done we will have no way of preventing the Negroes from voting.\"{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=70}} This fear explains why even Southern Senators from states that had abolished the poll tax still opposed the bill; they did not want to set a precedent that the federal government could interfere in state elections.\n\nPresident [[Harry S. Truman]] established the [[President's Committee on Civil Rights]], which among other issues investigated the poll tax. Considering that opposition to federal poll tax regulation in 1948 was claimed as based on the Constitution, the Committee noted that a constitutional amendment might be the best way to proceed. Still, little occurred during the 1950s. Members of the anti-poll tax movement laid low during the anti-Communist frenzy of the period; some of the main proponents of poll tax abolition, such as [[Joseph Gelders]] and [[Vito Marcantonio]], had been committed [[Marxist]]s.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=82}}\n\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]] returned to this issue. His administration urged Congress to adopt and send such an amendment to the states for ratification. He considered the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would be moot. Still, some liberals opposed Kennedy's action, feeling that an amendment would be too slow compared to legislation.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=290}} [[Spessard Holland]], a conservative Democrat from Florida, introduced the amendment to the Senate.  Holland had opposed most civil rights legislation during his career,<ref name=\"nytimes1971\">{{cite news |title=Spessard L. Holland Dies at 79; Former Senator From Florida |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1971/11/07/91311211.pdf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 7, 1971 |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}</ref> and Kennedy's gaining his support helped splinter the monolithic Southern opposition to the amendment.  Ratification of the amendment was relatively quick, taking slightly more than a year; it was rapidly ratified by state legislatures across the country from August 1962 to January 1964.\n\n[[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] called the amendment a \"triumph of liberty over restriction\" and \"a verification of people's rights.\"<ref name=\"nytimes1964\" /> States that had maintained the poll tax were more reserved.  Mississippi's Attorney General, [[Joe Patterson]], complained about the complexity of two sets of voters \u2013 those who paid their poll tax and could vote in all elections, and those who had not and could only vote only in federal elections.<ref name=\"nytimes1964\" /> Additionally, non-payers of the poll tax could still be deterred by such requirements as having to register far in advance of the election and retain records of such registration.<ref name=\"milwaukeejournal\" /> States such as Alabama also continued to exercise discrimination in the application of [[literacy test]]s.\n\n==Proposal and ratification==\n:''See also: {{Slink|Presidency of John F.

These were struck down in 1966 by the US Supreme Court decision in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' (1966), which ruled poll taxes unconstitutional even for state elections. Federal district courts in [[Alabama]] and [[Texas]], respectively, struck down these states' poll taxes less than two months before the ''Harper'' ruling was issued.\n\nThe state of [[Virginia]] accommodated the amendment by providing an \"escape clause\" to the poll tax. In lieu of paying the poll tax, a prospective voter could file paperwork to gain a certificate establishing a place of residence in Virginia.

The amendment was proposed by Congress to the states on August 27, 1962, and was [[ratified]] by the states on January 23, 1964.\n\n[[Southern United States|Southern states]] of the former [[Confederate States of America]] adopted [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll taxes]] in laws of the late 19th century and new constitutions from 1890 to 1908, after the Democratic Party had generally regained control of state legislatures decades after the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], as a measure to prevent [[African Americans]] and often poor whites from voting. Use of the poll taxes by states was held to be constitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the 1937 decision ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]''.\n\nWhen the 24th Amendment was ratified in 1964, five states still retained a poll tax:  [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]] and [[Virginia]].  The amendment prohibited requiring a poll tax for voters in federal elections. But it was not until 1966 that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6\u20133 in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' that poll taxes for any level of elections were unconstitutional. It said these violated the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Subsequent litigation related to potential discriminatory effects of voter registration requirements has generally been based on application of this clause.\n\n==Text==\n::'''Section 1.

This required that voting not be limited by \"race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" All voters were required to pay the poll tax, but in practice it most affected the poor. Notably this affected both African Americans and poor white voters, some of whom had voted with [[People's Party (United States)|Populist]] and [[Fusion Party|Fusionist]] candidates in the late 19th century, temporarily disturbing Democratic rule. Proponents of the poll tax downplayed this aspect and assured white voters they would not be affected. Passage of poll taxes began in earnest in the 1890s, as Democrats wanted to prevent another Populist-Republican coalition. Despite election violence and fraud, African Americans were still winning numerous local seats. By 1902, all eleven states of the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] had enacted a poll tax, many within new constitutions that contained other provisions as barriers to voter registration, such as literacy or comprehension tests administered subjectively by white  workers. The poll tax was used together with other devices such as [[grandfather clause]]s and the \"[[white primary]]\" designed to exclude blacks, as well as threats and acts of violence. For example, potential voters had to be \"assessed\" in Arkansas, and blacks were utterly ignored in the assessment.{{sfn|Ogden|1958|pp=4\u201313, 170\u2013231}}\n\nFrom 1900 to 1937, such use of the poll tax was nearly ignored by the federal government. Several state-level initiatives repealed poll taxes during this period for two reasons: firstly that they encouraged corruption since wealthy persons could and would pay other people's poll taxes;<ref>Kneebone, John T.; ''Southern Liberal Journalists and the Issue of Race, 1920\u20131944'' p. 142 {{ISBN|0807816604}}</ref><ref>Sullivan, Patricia; ''Days of Hope: Race and Democracy in the New Deal Era'', p. 107 {{ISBN|0807822604}}</ref> secondly, because they discouraged white voting more than many populist Southern politicians desired. The poll tax survived a legal challenge in the 1937 Supreme Court case ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]'', which unanimously ruled that\n\n{{quote|[The] privilege of voting is not derived from the United States, but is conferred by the state and, save as restrained by the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments and other provisions of the Federal Constitution, the state may condition suffrage as it deems appropriate.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=302&invol=277 ''Breedlove v. Suttles''], majority opinion.</ref>}}\n\nThe issue remained prominent, as most African Americans in the South were disenfranchised. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] spoke out against the tax.  He publicly called it \"a remnant of the Revolutionary period\" that the country had moved past. However, Roosevelt's favored liberal Democrats in the South lost in the 1938 primaries to the reigning conservative Southern Democrats, and he backed off the issue. He felt that he needed Southern Democratic votes to pass [[New Deal]] programs and did not want to further antagonize them.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=57}} Still, efforts at the Congressional level to abolish the poll tax continued. A 1939 bill to abolish the poll tax in federal elections was tied up by the Southern Block, lawmakers whose long tenure in office from a one-party region gave them seniority and command of numerous important committee chairmanships. A [[discharge petition]] was able to force the bill to be considered, and the House passed the bill 254\u201384.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|page=68}} However, the bill was unable to defeat a [[filibuster]] in the Senate by Southern senators and a few Northern allies who valued the support of the powerful and senior Southern seats. This bill would be re-proposed in the next several Congresses. It came closest to passage during World War II, when opponents framed abolition as a means to help overseas soldiers vote. However, after learning that the US Supreme Court decision ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944) banned use of the \"[[white primary]],\" the Southern block refused to approve abolition of the poll tax.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=74}}\n\nIn 1946, the Senate came close to passing the bill. 24 Democrats and 15 Republicans approved an end to debate, while 7 non-southern Democrats and 7 Republicans joined with the 19 Southern Democrats in opposition. The result was a 39\u201333 vote in favor of the bill, but the filibuster required a two-thirds supermajority to break at the time; a 48\u201324 vote was required to pass the bill.{{clarify|date=February 2011|reason=That's two thirds; and why are there only 72 senators?  My arithmetic says it should require 72\u201324.}}  Those in favor of abolition of the poll tax considered a constitutional amendment after the 1946 defeat, but that idea did not advance either.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=80}}\n\nThe tenor of the debate changed in the 1940s. Southern politicians tried to shift the debate to Constitutional issue, but private correspondence indicates that black disenfranchisement was still the true concern. For instance, Mississippi Senator [[Theodore Bilbo]] declared, \"If the poll tax bill passes, the next step will be an effort to remove the registration qualification, the educational qualification of Negroes. If that is done we will have no way of preventing the Negroes from voting.\"{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=70}} This fear explains why even Southern Senators from states that had abolished the poll tax still opposed the bill; they did not want to set a precedent that the federal government could interfere in state elections.\n\nPresident [[Harry S. Truman]] established the [[President's Committee on Civil Rights]], which among other issues investigated the poll tax. Considering that opposition to federal poll tax regulation in 1948 was claimed as based on the Constitution, the Committee noted that a constitutional amendment might be the best way to proceed. Still, little occurred during the 1950s. Members of the anti-poll tax movement laid low during the anti-Communist frenzy of the period; some of the main proponents of poll tax abolition, such as [[Joseph Gelders]] and [[Vito Marcantonio]], had been committed [[Marxist]]s.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=82}}\n\nPresident [[John F. Kennedy]] returned to this issue. His administration urged Congress to adopt and send such an amendment to the states for ratification. He considered the constitutional amendment the best way to avoid a filibuster, as the claim that federal abolition of the poll tax was unconstitutional would be moot. Still, some liberals opposed Kennedy's action, feeling that an amendment would be too slow compared to legislation.{{sfn|Lawson|1976|p=290}} [[Spessard Holland]], a conservative Democrat from Florida, introduced the amendment to the Senate.  Holland had opposed most civil rights legislation during his career,<ref name=\"nytimes1971\">{{cite news |title=Spessard L.

Ratification of the amendment was relatively quick, taking slightly more than a year; it was rapidly ratified by state legislatures across the country from August 1962 to January 1964.\n\n[[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Lyndon B. Johnson]] called the amendment a \"triumph of liberty over restriction\" and \"a verification of people's rights.\"<ref name=\"nytimes1964\" /> States that had maintained the poll tax were more reserved.  Mississippi's Attorney General, [[Joe Patterson]], complained about the complexity of two sets of voters \u2013 those who paid their poll tax and could vote in all elections, and those who had not and could only vote only in federal elections.<ref name=\"nytimes1964\" /> Additionally, non-payers of the poll tax could still be deterred by such requirements as having to register far in advance of the election and retain records of such registration.<ref name=\"milwaukeejournal\" /> States such as Alabama also continued to exercise discrimination in the application of [[literacy test]]s.\n\n==Proposal and ratification==\n:''See also:'' {{Slink|Presidency of John F.
