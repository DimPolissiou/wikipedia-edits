[[ShapeManager]] has no presence in the kernel licensing market and in 2001 [[Autodesk]] clearly stated they were not going into this business.\n\nThe world's newest geometric modeling kernel is [[Russian Geometric Kernel]] owned by the Russian government, and it is not clear if it is going to be commercially available.

Encomiendas were organized only for the purposes of collecting tribute that went in part to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Spanish army, and to the Royal Treasury. Later on areas which were organized and given the designation of \"province\" (''provincia'') were led by an appointed ''[[alcalde]]'' who performed judicial, fiscal and executive functions. This system of government lasted for almost three hundred years until 1886 when a governor (''gobernador'') was first appointed in each of the eighteen existing provinces, relegating the alcalde to carry out only judicial functions.<ref name=\"civil\">{{cite book |title=Civil Government in the Philippines |last=McGovney |first=Dudley Odell |page=129 |year=1903 |isbn=978-0-559-69396-0 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKSCOjrNJyMC}}</ref>\n\n[[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American rule]] brought radical changes to the system of local government in the country. In 1901 the [[Philippine Commission]] enacted Act No. 83, known as the Provincial Government Act, which outlined the powers, responsibilities and composition of the provincial government. Each regularly organized province was provided a '''Provincial Board''' composed of three provincial officials: the governor, the treasurer, and a \"third member\" who in most cases was known as the supervisor. The governor in regularly organized provinces under civilian control were initially elected by municipal vice-presidents and councilors within the province through a convention held in the provincial capital every even-numbered year.<ref name=\"civil\" /> As civil government took hold, the governorship was made elective. The composition of provincial boards were also later modified, with the treasurer and \"third member\" taken out and replaced by two members elected by popular vote. Not all provinces had the same type of government. Officials in specially organized provinces (those termed \"Non-Christian provinces\") were appointed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] with the approval of the Philippine Commission<ref>{{cite book |title=The Philippines: Past and Present |last=Worcester |first=Dean C. |page=341 |year=1914 |isbn=978-1-4264-5850-7 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0K5Tn28PcrcC}}</ref> until legislation gradually brought each of them in line with regularly organized provinces, that by the time of independence in 1946 all provinces had largely similar governments.\n\nThe passage of Republic Act No. 2264 (the \"Local Autonomy Act\") on June 19, 1959 not only granted greater autonomy to local governments, but also expanded the composition of the Provincial Board by creating a new elective office, the vice-governorship, as well as providing for provinces of the first, second and third income class to have one additional elected board member.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno2264.html Republic Act No. 2264 - Local Autonomy Act], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> However, the Board still had limited real legislative powers, as the provincial government was merely serving as an extension of national government.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=ABA Journal |publisher=American Bar Association |volume=52 |number=2 |title=Constitutional Law in the Philippines |author=Eric Daenecke |page=162 |date=February 1966 |issn=0747-0088 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30UsLWMjJLcC}}</ref> Republic Act No. 5185 was enacted in 1967 with the intention of decentralizing authority and further empowering local governments to address the needs of their constituents more effectively.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno5185.html Republic Act No. 5185 - Decentralization Act of 1967], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nBy virtue of Presidential Decree No. 826 issued by [[Philippine president|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on November 14, 1975<ref name=\"pd826\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno826.html Presidential Decree No. 826], Chan-Robles Law Library</ref> all existing governing boards and councils in each province, city and municipality were renamed '''Sangguniang Bayan'''. The province-level Sangguniang Bayan (later given the name '''Sangguniang Panlalawigan''',<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno925.html Presidential Decree No. 925], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> commonly abbreviated to '''SP''') consisted of all the incumbent provincial board members (including the governor and vice-governor), plus a representative from each municipality within the province, and the provincial president of the ''[[Katipunan ng Mga Kabataang Barangay]]'' or Association of Barangay Youth.<ref name=\"pd826\" />\n\nBatas Pambansa Blg. 51, enacted in 1979, standardized the composition of all provincial legislatures by reducing the membership of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. All provinces were entitled to 6 elective SP members, unless they had more than one million residents (8 members) or less than 100,000 residents (4 members). Direct municipal representation was eliminated, and in its place was indirect \"grassroots\" representation through the president of the provincial [[association of barangay chairmen]] who was appointed by the President, who also happened to be the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]]. Other members of the new Sanggunian were the governor and the vice governor, both elected by popular vote, and the president of the provincial federation of the Kabataang Barangay, appointed by the President/Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 51]</ref> \n\nThe powers and duties of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was codified under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, also known as the Local Government Code of 1983. The governor served as an ''ex officio'' member, who did not vote except only to break a tie, but had the power to veto items within, or entire, Sanggunian ordinances and resolutions. However the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting SP members.<ref name=\"lgc83\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg337.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 337 - Local Government Code of 1983], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nThe Sangguniang Panlalawigan was retained as the legislative branch of all provincial governments under the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991. However, unlike the old Provincial Boards or the pre-1992 Sanggunian, which included in their memberships provincial executives, under current laws the governor is not considered as a Sanggunian member (although he or she retains the power to veto SP legislation, which can still be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting members), and the vice-governor, who has now become the presiding officer, only participates in breaking ties in voting. Since 1992 SP members are elected from districts to ensure geographical representation, and the size of the province's Sanggunian was dependent on its income classification rather than population.<ref name=\"lgc\" />\n\n==Powers, duties, and functions==\nThe powers, duties, and functions of the Sanggunian are outlined in Section 468 of the Local Government Code of 1991.<ref name=\"lgc\" /> The legislative body is tasked in general to ''\"enact ordinances, approve resolutions and appropriate funds for the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants... in the proper exercise of the corporate powers of the province.\"'' Its powers, duties and functions are outlined into five broad mandates:\n*''\"Approve ordinances and pass resolutions necessary for an efficient and effective provincial government,\"'' which includes:\n**Reviewing all ordinances approved by the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] of the province's component cities and municipalities to ensure that they and their mayors are within their scope of powers as outlined in the Local Government Code\n**Enacting measures to maintain peace and order and imposing penalties on violations of such ordinances\n**Approving ordinances that impose fines and/or imprisonment for violations of provincial ordinances\n**Adopt measures to protect the inhabitants of the province from harmful effects of man-made or natural disasters, and provide relief services and assistance for victims not only during and in the aftermath of disasters and calamities, but also in their \"return to productive livelihood\" following the events\n**Enacting ordinances intended to prevent, suppress and impose appropriate penalties for \"activities inimical to the welfare and morals of the inhabitants of the province,\" such as prostitution, juvenile delinquency and drug addiction.\n**Protect the environment and impose appropriate penalties for acts which endanger the environment\n**Determine the powers and duties of officials and employees of the province in accordance with the Local Government Code and pertinent laws, and also determine their wages, salaries, allowances, honorariums, compensation and other emoluments and benefits, and provide for expenditures necessary to properly carry out programs, projects, services and activities of the provincial government\n**Provide a mechanism (and appropriate funding for it) to ensure the safety and protection of all provincial government property, public documents and records\n**When the finances of the provincial government allow, provide for additional allowances or other benefits to officials and public servants working in the province\n*''\"Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the province... with particular attention to agro-industrial development and country-wide growth and progress and relative thereto,\"'' which involve the following:\n**Enact annual and supplemental appropriations of the provincial government and appropriate funds for specific programs, projects, services and activities of the province, or for other purposes not contrary to law, in order to promote the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants\n**Subject to the provisions of Book II of the Local Government Code and applicable laws and upon the majority vote of all the members of the sangguniang panlalawigan:\n***Enact ordinances levying taxes, fees and charges, prescribing the rates thereof for general and specific purposes, and granting tax exemptions, incentives or reliefs\n***Authorize the provincial governor to negotiate and contract loans and other forms of indebtedness\n***Enact ordinances authorizing the floating of bonds or other instruments of indebtedness, for the purpose of raising funds to finance development projects\n**Appropriate funds for the construction and maintenance or the rental of buildings for the use of the province;

The provincial vice-governor serves as its presiding officer, who does not vote except in cases to break a tie.\n\nRegularly elected members are elected from Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts. The total number of SP members to be elected within the province, and the number within each SP district, varies depending on several factors, including the province's income class and the population count within districts.\n\n''Ex officio'' members in the Sanggunian include:\n* the president of the provincial chapter of the [[Liga ng mga Barangay]]\n* the president of the provincial federation of Youth Councils ([[Sangguniang Kabataan]])\n* the president of the provincial federation of [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] members from component cities and municipalities\n* the ''IP Representative'' is pursuant to the Republic Act 8371, or the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997, which calls for the mandatory representation of IPs which is formally certified by the concerned NCIP regional director, upon recommendation of the provincial or community service center head and shall serve for a period of three years from the date of assumption to office and can be re-indorsed for another term as long as he or she would not serve for more than three consecutive terms.\n\nThe Local Government Code of 1991 also provides for the election of 3 \"sectoral representatives,\"<ref name=\"lgc\" /> which are supposed to come from:\n* women's sector\n* agricultural or industrial sector\n* other sectors, including the disabled, the urban poor, or indigenous cultural communities\n\nAlthough several attempts have been made in the past to provide for the election of these sectoral representatives, the lack of a more concrete enabling law upon which the manner of election of these sectoral representatives can be legally based continues to prevent this feature of local governments from being fully realized.<ref name=\"secrep\">[http://www.saligan.org/docs/Local%20Sectoral%20Representation,%20A%20Legal%20Analysis.pdf Local Sectoral Representation: A Legal Analysis].</ref>\n\n==Allocation and apportionment of regularly elected members==\n[[File:Philippine provinces by income classification.PNG|thumb|Provinces based on number of regular Sangguniang Panlalawigan seats: greens at least 10, blues 8, and reds 6.]]\n\nThe number of regular Sanggunian members is based on the income of the province as classified by the [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Department of Finance]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] issues resolutions allocating the number of regular members of the Sanggunian a province may elect should a province's income classification change. First-class and second-class provinces are entitled to 10 regularly elected members, 8 for third- and fourth-class provinces and 6 for fifth- and sixth-class provinces. Exceptions to the rule are provinces which are divided into more than five [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. Each Sangguniang Panlalawigan district in the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Cavite (province)|Cavite]], [[Cebu (province)|Cebu]], [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Pangasinan]] elect two members to the Sanggunian, resulting in a total number of 16 regularly elected SP members in Cavite, 14 in Cebu, and 12 in the three other provinces.\n\nThe Commission on Elections apportions the number of Sanggunian members among the SP districts into which the province is divided. As much as possible, the members are equally divided among the legislative districts. If such equal division is impossible the remaining numbers are assigned to the districts with a bigger population count than the others. The COMELEC likewise factors out the population of [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|independent cities]] which do not elect provincial officials in determining the apportionment of the Sanggunian members among the districts. Provinces comprising a single congressional district are divided into two sanggunian districts by the COMELEC for purposes of electing SP members.\n\nA majority of Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts are contiguous to existing [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. The exceptions are the following:\n* Provinces which comprise a lone congressional district are divided into two Sanggunian districts by the COMELEC.\n* Independent cities which are not allowed to participate in provincial politics are factored out of the congressional districts that contain them: [[Angeles, Pampanga|Angeles]] from [[Legislative districts of Pampanga#1st District|Pampanga\u20141st]], [[Butuan]] from [[Legislative districts of Agusan del Norte#1st District|Agusan del Norte\u20141st]], [[Cotabato City]] from [[Legislative districts of Maguindanao#1st

District|Leyte\u20141st]]\n* The 4th SP district of [[Bulacan (province)|Bulacan]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Bulacan#4th District|4th Congressional district of Bulacan]] plus the city of [[San Jose del Monte]], which in 2004 started to elect [[Legislative district of San Jose del Monte City|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The 1st SP district of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Laguna#1st District|1st Congressional district of Laguna]] plus the city of [[Bi\u00f1an]], which in 2016 started to elect [[Legislative district of Bi\u00f1an|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The 2nd SP district of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Laguna#2nd District|2nd Congressional district of Laguna]] plus the city of [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], which in 2019 started to elect [[Legislative district of Calamba|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The [[Legislative districts of Antipolo#1st District|1st]] and [[Legislative districts of Antipolo#2nd District|2nd]] Congressional districts of [[Antipolo]] also serve ''de facto'' as SP districts of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], with each being allocated one regular SP member.\n\n==List==\nThe following is a table with the number of members elected from each SP

They are the [[legislative branch]] of the province and their powers and responsibilities are defined by the [[Local Government Code]] of 1991.<ref name=\"lgc\">[http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7160_1991.html Local Government Code of 1991]</ref>  Along with the [[List of provincial governors in the Philippines|provincial governor]], the [[executive branch]] of the province, they form the province's government.\n\n==History==\nDuring the early period of [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish colonization]], newly conquered areas were designated as ''[[encomiendas]]'' which were headed by an ''encomendero'' chosen by the Spanish from among the ranks of the powerful local nobles. Encomiendas were organized only for the purposes of collecting tribute that went in part to the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the Spanish army, and to the Royal Treasury. Later on areas which were organized and given the designation of \"province\" (''provincia'') were led by an appointed ''[[alcalde]]'' who performed judicial, fiscal and executive functions. This system of government lasted for almost three hundred years until 1886 when a governor (''gobernador'') was first appointed in each of the eighteen existing provinces, relegating the alcalde to carry out only judicial functions.<ref name=\"civil\">{{cite book |title=Civil Government in the Philippines |last=McGovney |first=Dudley Odell |page=129 |year=1903 |isbn=978-0-559-69396-0 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKSCOjrNJyMC}}</ref>\n\n[[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American rule]] brought radical changes to the system of local government in the country. In 1901 the [[Philippine Commission]] enacted Act No. 83, known as the Provincial Government Act, which outlined the powers, responsibilities and composition of the provincial government. Each regularly organized province was provided a '''Provincial Board''' composed of three provincial officials: the governor, the treasurer, and a \"third member\" who in most cases was known as the supervisor. The governor in regularly organized provinces under civilian control were initially elected by municipal vice-presidents and councilors within the province through a convention held in the provincial capital every even-numbered year.<ref name=\"civil\" /> As civil government took hold, the governorship was made elective. The composition of provincial boards were also later modified, with the treasurer and \"third member\" taken out and replaced by two members elected by popular vote. Not all provinces had the same type of government. Officials in specially organized provinces (those termed \"Non-Christian provinces\") were appointed by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] with the approval of the Philippine Commission<ref>{{cite book |title=The Philippines: Past and Present |last=Worcester |first=Dean C. |page=341 |year=1914 |isbn=978-1-4264-5850-7 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0K5Tn28PcrcC}}</ref> until legislation gradually brought each of them in line with regularly organized provinces, that by the time of independence in 1946 all provinces had largely similar governments.\n\nThe passage of Republic Act No. 2264 (the \"Local Autonomy Act\") on June 19, 1959 not only granted greater autonomy to local governments, but also expanded the composition of the Provincial Board by creating a new elective office, the vice-governorship, as well as providing for provinces of the first, second and third income class to have one additional elected board member.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno2264.html Republic Act No. 2264 - Local Autonomy Act], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> However, the Board still had limited real legislative powers, as the provincial government was merely serving as an extension of national government.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=ABA Journal |publisher=American Bar Association |volume=52 |number=2 |title=Constitutional Law in the Philippines |author=Eric Daenecke |page=162 |date=February 1966 |issn=0747-0088 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=30UsLWMjJLcC}}</ref> Republic Act No. 5185 was enacted in 1967 with the intention of decentralizing authority and further empowering local governments to address the needs of their constituents more effectively.<ref>[http://laws.chanrobles.com/ph/ra/republicactno5185.html Republic Act No. 5185 - Decentralization Act of 1967], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nBy virtue of Presidential Decree No. 826 issued by [[Philippine president|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] on November 14, 1975<ref name=\"pd826\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno826.html Presidential Decree No. 826], Chan-Robles Law Library</ref> all existing governing boards and councils in each province, city and municipality were renamed '''Sangguniang Bayan'''. The province-level Sangguniang Bayan (later given the name '''Sangguniang Panlalawigan''',<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno925.html Presidential Decree No. 925], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref> commonly abbreviated to '''SP''') consisted of all the incumbent provincial board members (including the governor and vice-governor), plus a representative from each municipality within the province, and the provincial president of the ''[[Katipunan ng Mga Kabataang Barangay]]'' or Association of Barangay Youth.<ref name=\"pd826\" />\n\nBatas Pambansa Blg. 51, enacted in 1979, standardized the composition of all provincial legislatures by reducing the membership of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. All provinces were entitled to 6 elective SP members, unless they had more than one million residents (8 members) or less than 100,000 residents (4 members). Direct municipal representation was eliminated, and in its place was indirect \"grassroots\" representation through the president of the provincial [[association of barangay chairmen]] who was appointed by the President, who also happened to be the [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]]. Other members of the new Sanggunian were the governor and the vice governor, both elected by popular vote, and the president of the provincial federation of the Kabataang Barangay, appointed by the President/Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 51]</ref> \n\nThe powers and duties of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan was codified under Batas Pambansa Blg. 337, also known as the Local Government Code of 1983. The governor served as an ''ex officio'' member, who did not vote except only to break a tie, but had the power to veto items within, or entire, Sanggunian ordinances and resolutions. However the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting SP members.<ref name=\"lgc83\">[http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg337.html Batas Pambansa Blg. 337 - Local Government Code of 1983], Chan-Robles Law Library.</ref>\n\nThe Sangguniang Panlalawigan was retained as the legislative branch of all provincial governments under the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code of 1991. However, unlike the old Provincial Boards or the pre-1992 Sanggunian, which included in their memberships provincial executives, under current laws the governor is not considered as a Sanggunian member (although he or she retains the power to veto SP legislation, which can still be overridden by a two-thirds vote of all voting members), and the vice-governor, who has now become the presiding officer, only participates in breaking ties in voting. Since 1992 SP members are elected from districts to ensure geographical representation, and the size of the province's Sanggunian was dependent on its income classification rather than population.<ref name=\"lgc\" />\n\n==Powers, duties, and functions==\nThe powers, duties, and functions of the Sanggunian are outlined in Section 468 of the Local Government Code of 1991.<ref name=\"lgc\" /> The legislative body is tasked in general to ''\"enact ordinances, approve resolutions and appropriate funds for the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants... in the proper exercise of the corporate powers of the province.\"'' Its powers, duties and functions are outlined into five broad mandates:\n*''\"Approve ordinances and pass resolutions necessary for an efficient and effective provincial government,\"'' which includes:\n**Reviewing all ordinances approved by the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] of the province's component cities and municipalities to ensure that they and their mayors are within their scope of powers as outlined in the Local Government Code\n**Enacting measures to maintain peace and order and imposing penalties on violations of such ordinances\n**Approving ordinances that impose fines and/or imprisonment for violations of provincial ordinances\n**Adopt measures to protect the inhabitants of the province from harmful effects of man-made or natural disasters, and provide relief services and assistance for victims not only during and in the aftermath of disasters and calamities, but also in their \"return to productive livelihood\" following the events\n**Enacting ordinances intended to prevent, suppress and impose appropriate penalties for \"activities inimical to the welfare and morals of the inhabitants of the province,\" such as prostitution, juvenile delinquency and drug addiction.\n**Protect the environment and impose appropriate penalties for acts which endanger the environment\n**Determine the powers and duties of officials and employees of the province in accordance with the Local Government Code and pertinent laws, and also determine their wages, salaries, allowances, honorariums, compensation and other emoluments and benefits, and provide for expenditures necessary to properly carry out programs, projects, services and activities of the provincial government\n**Provide a mechanism (and appropriate funding for it) to ensure the safety and protection of all provincial government property, public documents and records\n**When the finances of the provincial government allow, provide for additional allowances or other benefits to officials and public servants working in the province\n*''\"Generate and maximize the use of resources and revenues for the development plans, program objectives and priorities of the province... with particular attention to agro-industrial development and country-wide growth and progress and relative thereto,\"'' which involve the following:\n**Enact annual and supplemental appropriations of the provincial government and appropriate funds for specific programs, projects, services and activities of the province, or for other purposes not contrary to law, in order to promote the general welfare of the province and its inhabitants\n**Subject to the provisions of Book II of the Local Government Code and applicable laws and upon the majority vote of all the members of the sangguniang panlalawigan:\n***Enact ordinances levying taxes, fees and charges, prescribing the rates thereof for general and specific purposes, and granting tax exemptions, incentives or reliefs\n***Authorize the provincial governor to negotiate and contract loans and other forms of indebtedness\n***Enact ordinances authorizing the floating of bonds or other instruments of indebtedness, for the purpose of raising funds to finance development projects\n**Appropriate funds for the construction and maintenance or the rental of buildings for the use of the province;

The provincial vice-governor serves as its presiding officer, who does not vote except in cases to break a tie.\n\nRegularly elected members are elected from Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts. The total number of SP members to be elected within the province, and the number within each SP district, varies depending on several factors, including the province's income class and the population count within districts.\n\n''Ex officio'' members in the Sanggunian include:\n* the president of the provincial chapter of the [[Liga ng mga Barangay]]\n* the president of the provincial federation of Youth Councils ([[Sangguniang Kabataan]])\n* the president of the provincial federation of [[Sangguniang Panlungsod]] and [[Sangguniang Bayan]] members from component cities and municipalities\n* the ''IP Representative'' is pursuant to the Republic Act 8371, or the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997, which calls for the mandatory representation of IPs which is formally certified by the concerned NCIP regional director, upon recommendation of the provincial or community service center head and shall serve for a period of three years from the date of assumption to office and can be re-indorsed for another term as long as he or she would not serve for more than three consecutive terms.\n\nThe Local Government Code of 1991 also provides for the election of 3 \"sectoral representatives,\"<ref name=\"lgc\" /> which are supposed to come from:\n* women's sector\n* agricultural or industrial sector\n* other sectors, including the disabled, the urban poor, or indigenous cultural communities\n\nAlthough several attempts have been made in the past to provide for the election of these sectoral representatives, the lack of a more concrete enabling law upon which the manner of election of these sectoral representatives can be legally based continues to prevent this feature of local governments from being fully realized.<ref name=\"secrep\">[http://www.saligan.org/docs/Local%20Sectoral%20Representation,%20A%20Legal%20Analysis.pdf Local Sectoral Representation: A Legal Analysis].</ref>\n\n==Allocation and apportionment of regularly elected members==\n[[File:Philippine provinces by income classification.PNG|thumb|Provinces based on number of regular Sangguniang Panlalawigan seats: greens at least 10, blues 8, and reds 6.]]\n\nThe number of regular Sanggunian members is based on the income of the province as classified by the [[Department of Finance (Philippines)|Department of Finance]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] issues resolutions allocating the number of regular members of the Sanggunian a province may elect should a province's income classification change. First-class and second-class provinces are entitled to 10 regularly elected members, 8 for third- and fourth-class provinces and 6 for fifth- and sixth-class provinces. Exceptions to the rule are provinces which are divided into more than five [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. Each Sangguniang Panlalawigan district in the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Cavite (province)|Cavite]], [[Cebu (province)|Cebu]], [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Pangasinan]] elect two members to the Sanggunian, resulting in a total number of 16 regularly elected SP members in Cavite, 14 in Cebu, and 12 in the three other provinces.\n\nThe Commission on Elections apportions the number of Sanggunian members among the SP districts into which the province is divided. As much as possible, the members are equally divided among the legislative districts. If such equal division is impossible the remaining numbers are assigned to the districts with a bigger population count than the others. The COMELEC likewise factors out the population of [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|independent cities]] which do not elect provincial officials in determining the apportionment of the Sanggunian members among the districts. Provinces comprising a single congressional district are divided into two sanggunian districts by the COMELEC for purposes of electing SP members.\n\nA majority of Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts are contiguous to existing [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|congressional districts]]. The exceptions are the following:\n* Provinces which comprise a lone congressional district are divided into two Sanggunian districts by the COMELEC.\n* Independent cities which are not allowed to participate in provincial politics are factored out of the congressional districts that contain them: [[Angeles, Pampanga|Angeles]] from [[Legislative districts of Pampanga#1st District|Pampanga\u20141st]], [[Butuan]] from [[Legislative districts of Agusan del Norte#1st District|Agusan del Norte\u20141st]], [[Cotabato City]] from [[Legislative districts of Maguindanao#1st

District|Leyte\u20141st]]\n* The 4th SP district of [[Bulacan (province)|Bulacan]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Bulacan#4th District|4th Congressional district of Bulacan]] plus the city of [[San Jose del Monte]], which in 2004 started to elect [[Legislative district of San Jose del Monte City|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The 1st SP district of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Laguna#1st District|1st Congressional district of Laguna]] plus the city of [[Bi\u00f1an]], which in 2016 started to elect [[Legislative district of Bi\u00f1an|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The 2nd SP district of [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] encompasses the entire [[Legislative districts of Laguna#2nd District|2nd Congressional district of Laguna]] plus the city of [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]], which in 2019 started to elect [[Legislative district of Calamba|its own congressional representative]] but was not separated by law to constitute its own Sangguniang Panlalawigan district.\n* The [[Legislative districts of Antipolo#1st District|1st]] and [[Legislative districts of Antipolo#2nd District|2nd]] Congressional districts of [[Antipolo]] also serve ''de facto'' as SP districts of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]], with each being allocated one regular SP member.\n\n==List==\nThe following is a table with the number of members elected from each SP

During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|Captain and the Kids]]''. In 1937, while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hanna met [[Joseph Barbera]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. In 1957, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, creating and/or producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Huckleberry Hound|The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]''. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]] in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.\n\n''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' won seven Academy Awards, while Hanna and Barbera were nominated for two others and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys. Hanna-Barbera's shows had a worldwide audience of over 300&nbsp;million people in their 1960s heyday, and have been translated into more than 28 languages.\n\n== Early and personal life==\nWilliam Hanna was born to William John (1873-1949) and Avice Joyce (Denby) Hanna (1882-1956) on July 14, 1910, in [[Melrose, New Mexico|Melrose]], [[New Mexico Territory]].<ref name=\"AutoBiog\">{{cite book|last=Hanna|first=William|author2=Tom Ito|title=A Cast of Friends|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Emeryville, California|year=2000|isbn=0-306-80917-6|url=https://books.google.is/books/about/A_Cast_of_Friends.html?id=pSwRAQAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y}}</ref>{{rp|5}} He was the third of seven children and the only son.

During the 1930s, Hanna steadily gained skill and prominence while working on cartoons such as ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|Captain and the Kids]]''. In 1937, while working at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), Hanna met [[Joseph Barbera]]. The two men began a collaboration that was at first best known for producing ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. In 1957, they co-founded [[Hanna-Barbera]], which became the most successful television animation studio in the business, creating and/or producing programs such as ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Huckleberry Hound|The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]''. In 1967, Hanna-Barbera was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] for $12&nbsp;million, but Hanna and Barbera remained heads of the company until 1991. At that time, the studio was sold to [[Turner Broadcasting System]], which in turn was merged with [[Time Warner]] in 1996; Hanna and Barbera stayed on as advisors.\n\n''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' won seven Academy Awards, while Hanna and Barbera were nominated for two others and won eight Emmy Awards. Their cartoons have become cultural icons, and their cartoon characters have appeared in other media such as films, books, and toys.

In 1911 Loupot was enrolled in the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-arts de Lyon]], where he took classes in painting and life drawing, and experimented with lithography. The outbreak of the first world war put an abrupt end to these studies, as Loupot was conscripted to fight and amongst the first to be sent to the front. He was quickly injured, however, and sent back to his parents in Lausanne for a period of convalescence<ref>A. Weill, ''Charles Loupot,'' Mus\u00e9e de l'Affiche, Toulouse, 1978. Unpaginated. </ref>. Back at home Loupot resumed designing, and in 1916 his designs were being published in '[[24 heures (Switzerland)|La feuille d'Avis de Lausanne]]'. His studio became a popular meeting place for a range of creatives based in Lausanne, including the photographer \u00c9mile Gos, and the writer [[Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz|Charles Ramuz]]. At this time Loupot also met Marcelle Vittet, his future wife, who would model for a number of his designs.\n\n=== Move to Paris and Critical Success ===\nLoupot moved to Paris in 1923 and began working for [[Maison Devambez]]. His innovative posters for the automobile company ''Voisin\u00a0'' quickly established Loupot as a pioneering figure on the design scene. In the same year, [[Cassandre (artist)|A. M. Cassandre]] - with whom Loupot would later collaborate\u00a0 - produced 'Le B\u00fbcheron', also representing a radical departure from the established Art Nouveau style. Loupot and Cassandre, along with [[Paul Colin (artist)|Paul Colin]] and [[Jean Carlu]], were nicknamed the 'Musketeers' by critics, and seen to be ushering in a new era of poster design<ref>A. Weill, ''Affiches Art D\u00e9co,'' Art Stock: Paris, 2001, p. 6.</ref>.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nLoupot was chosen as one of the four official poster artists to represent the 1925 [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] (French: [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts|Exposition internationale des arts d\u00e9coratfs et industriels modernes]]). The other artists included France's pre-eminent sculptor and draughtsman [[Antoine Bourdelle]]. The 1925 exhibition attracted 16 million visitors, and fundamental in establishing the [[Art Deco]] style, then known as the ''Style Moderne''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madparis.fr/francais/musees/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/dossiers-thematiques/l-exposition-internationale-des-arts-decoratifs-et-industriels-modernes-de/les-fonds-patrimoniaux/quatre-affiches-pour-annoncer-l-exposition|title=Quatre affiches pour annoncer l\u2019Exposition|website=madparis.fr|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>. \n\nLoupot started to attract prestigious clients, such as the Maison des Vins Nicolas and [[Eug\u00e8ne Schueller]]. \n\nLoupot married a second time to Jane Alfassa, with whom he had a son, Jean-Marie, in 1926.\n\nAlong with many of the major decorative artists and architects of the time, Loupot joined the [[The French Union of Modern Artists|French Union of Modern Artists]] (* link to French wiki? ''[[The French Union of Modern Artists|Union des artistes modernes]]),'' in 1929. Emphasising the importance of design, the group aimed to create beautiful, affordable pieces that could improve the quality of people's lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madparis.fr/francais/musees/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/dossiers-thematiques/le-mad-depuis-1864/l-union-centrale-des-arts-decoratifs-et-la-modernite-l-exposition-de-1925-et-l/l-union-des-artistes-modernes-uam|title=L\u2019Union des artistes modernes (UAM)|website=madparis.fr|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Cassandre was also a part of the union, and the following year Loupot and Cassandre joined forces to create the Alliance Graphique. The collaboration ended in 1934, Loupot continued to work for a range of clients, and in 1936 met Max Augier, head of advertising for the wine company [[St Rapha\u00ebl|St-Rapha\u00ebl]]. This partnership lasted for over 20 years, with few creative restrictions imposed on Loupot\u2019s design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straphael.fr/en/our-history/|title=Our History - St Rapha\u00ebl|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> \n\nFor the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie]], an important opportunity to showcase Loupot's new designs, Max Augier organised not only an entire pavilion, but also the exclusive right to advertise on the surrounding walls of the exhibition.<ref>'''Add Zagrodski'''</ref>\n\nAlthough resident in Paris, Loupot was also a great lover of the countryside. On a visit to the village of Chevroches, near Clamency, he spontaneously bought a house in the neighbourhood. Around this time Loupot met France Pier, who would become his lifelong companion, although they never married. \n\nLoupot later designed murals for a chapel in the vicinity, and there is a [[c:File:Chevroches-FR-58-sentier_Charles_Loupot-1.jpg|permanent inscription dedicated to him at Chevroches]].\n\n=== Break during WWII ===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War II|second world war]], Loupot left Paris for Chevroches<ref>H. Touillier-Feyrabend, 'L'Affiche et le Politique', ''Ethnologie Fran\u00e7aise'' (April - June 1994), p. 307</ref>.\u00a0 Subsequently, the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] imposed a series of restrictions on both the sale and advertising of alcohol from 1940<ref>M. Holt, ed., ''Alcohol: A Social and Cultural History'', Berg: New York, 2006, p. 139. </ref>. As Loupot would not work in service of the regime, for the remainder of the war he did not produce any more posters, and instead dedicated himself to painting, largely in oils. He only recommenced designing for St-Rapha\u00ebl in 1945.\n\n=== Move to Abstraction ===\nFollowing the war Loupot produced series of meticulous designs, that increasingly pushed the boundaries between abstract and figurative works. This change in his style is exemplified in his work for St-Rapha\u00ebl. This shift has been ranked amongst the most iconic examples of the advertising revolution of the twentieth century<ref>W. Brown, 'Communicating Ideology Through Graphic Design: Visual Identities in France'. ''Contemporary French Civilisation'' (October 2004), p. 324.</ref>. By 1950 the majority of laws against alcohol advertising had been lifted, although some restrictions remained. That year, with the help of Max Augier (by then good friends with Loupot), Loupot formed his own advertising agency, called 'Les Arcs'<ref>2T. Devynck, ''Loupot Peintre d'Affiche,'' Mus\u00e9e de l'imprimerie et de la communication graphique: Lyon, 2006, p. 23/32.</ref>. Whilst St-Rapha\u00ebl remained Loupot's major client, he was free to take on other commissions, and worked with Nicolas again. As with his work for St-Rapha\u00ebl, Loupot's post-war Nicolas designs were radically simplified from their original inter-war appearance. \n\n=== Later Years ===\nIn his final years, Loupot spent an increasing amount of time in Provence, at his family home ''Marika'' in Arcs-sur-Argens. By 1962 Loupot had officially retired from poster-making. He died at home in the same year. \n\n=== Style & Technique ===\nLoupot's works were produced using the [[Lithography|lithographic]] technique. He experimented in [[typography]] and aerograph, an early precursor of the airbrush. Each composition was carefully planned with numerous maquettes and revisions.\n\nLoupot was attentive to the major European artistic developments of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His first poster in Paris for the company Voisin clearly demonstrated a knowledge of the French artist [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whilst he also frequently adapted elements from Fauvism and Cubism. Trained in Switzerland, then a leading centre for graphic design, he was also aware of developments there in Swiss typography and design, and his work also shows a German influence of Sachplakat<ref>R. Jubert and J. Cullars, 'The Bauhaus Context: Typography and Graphic Design in France', ''Design Issues,'' vol. 22, no .4 (Autumn 2006), p. 68.</ref>. Following the second world war, Loupot experimented with abstraction, both in reduction of figurative elements, and also with full abstraction.\n\n=== Painting ===\nAlthough Loupot was most famous for his work as a commercial poster, privately he also experimented extensively with painting. These works were not intended to be sold, and were principally images of his surroundings, friends, and lovers. There is, however, some suggestion that Loupot was occasionally commissioned as a decorator at the beginning of his career in Paris, although details surrounding this are unclear<ref>C. Zagrodski, ''Charles Loupot,'' Le Cherche Midi \u00c9diteur: Paris, 1998, p. 19. </ref>. Loupot's most significant contribution to painting was the chapel, Notre-Dame-de-la-T\u00eate-Ronde \u00e0 Menou, that he decorated in the 1950s.\n\n=== Notable Works ===\n\n* Voisin, Colour Lithograph, 1923\n* Cointreau, Colour Lithograph, 1930\n* Coty, Colour Lithograph, 1938\n* St-Rapha\u00ebl, Colour Lithograph, 1950\n* Lion Noire, Colour Lithograph, 1949\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

The 1925 exhibition attracted 16 million visitors, and fundamental in establishing the [[Art Deco]] style, then known as the ''Style Moderne''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madparis.fr/francais/musees/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/dossiers-thematiques/l-exposition-internationale-des-arts-decoratifs-et-industriels-modernes-de/les-fonds-patrimoniaux/quatre-affiches-pour-annoncer-l-exposition|title=Quatre affiches pour annoncer l\u2019Exposition|website=madparis.fr|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>. \n\nLoupot started to attract prestigious clients, such as the Maison des Vins Nicolas and [[Eug\u00e8ne Schueller]]. \n\nLoupot married a second time to Jane Alfassa, with whom he had a son, Jean-Marie, in 1926.\n\nAlong with many of the major decorative artists and architects of the time, Loupot joined the [[The French Union of Modern Artists|French Union of Modern Artists]] (* link to French wiki? ''[[The French Union of Modern Artists|Union des artistes modernes]]),'' in 1929. Emphasising the importance of design, the group aimed to create beautiful, affordable pieces that could improve the quality of people's lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://madparis.fr/francais/musees/musee-des-arts-decoratifs/dossiers-thematiques/le-mad-depuis-1864/l-union-centrale-des-arts-decoratifs-et-la-modernite-l-exposition-de-1925-et-l/l-union-des-artistes-modernes-uam|title=L\u2019Union des artistes modernes (UAM)|website=madparis.fr|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Cassandre was also a part of the union, and the following year Loupot and Cassandre joined forces to create the Alliance Graphique. The collaboration ended in 1934, Loupot continued to work for a range of clients, and in 1936 met Max Augier, head of advertising for the wine company [[St Rapha\u00ebl|St-Rapha\u00ebl]]. This partnership lasted for over 20 years, with few creative restrictions imposed on Loupot\u2019s design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straphael.fr/en/our-history/|title=Our History - St Rapha\u00ebl|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> \n\nFor the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie]], an important opportunity to showcase Loupot's new designs, Max Augier organised not only an entire pavilion, but also the exclusive right to advertise on the surrounding walls of the exhibition.<ref>'''Add Zagrodski'''</ref>\n\nAlthough resident in Paris, Loupot was also a great lover of the countryside. On a visit to the village of Chevroches, near Clamency, he spontaneously bought a house in the neighbourhood. Around this time Loupot met France Pier, who would become his lifelong companion, although they never married. \n\nLoupot later designed murals for a chapel in the vicinity, and there is a [[c:File:Chevroches-FR-58-sentier_Charles_Loupot-1.jpg|permanent inscription dedicated to him at Chevroches]].\n\n=== Break during WWII ===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War II|second world war]], Loupot left Paris for Chevroches<ref>H. Touillier-Feyrabend, 'L'Affiche et le Politique', ''Ethnologie Fran\u00e7aise'' (April - June 1994), p. 307</ref>.\u00a0 Subsequently, the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] imposed a series of restrictions on both the sale and advertising of alcohol from 1940<ref>M. Holt, ed., ''Alcohol: A Social and Cultural History'', Berg: New York, 2006, p. 139. </ref>. As Loupot would not work in service of the regime, for the remainder of the war he did not produce any more posters, and instead dedicated himself to painting, largely in oils. He only recommenced designing for St-Rapha\u00ebl in 1945.\n\n=== Move to Abstraction ===\nFollowing the war Loupot produced series of meticulous designs, that increasingly pushed the boundaries between abstract and figurative works. This change in his style is exemplified in his work for St-Rapha\u00ebl. This shift has been ranked amongst the most iconic examples of the advertising revolution of the twentieth century<ref>W. Brown, 'Communicating Ideology Through Graphic Design: Visual Identities in France'. ''Contemporary French Civilisation'' (October 2004), p. 324.</ref>. By 1950 the majority of laws against alcohol advertising had been lifted, although some restrictions remained. That year, with the help of Max Augier (by then good friends with Loupot), Loupot formed his own advertising agency, called 'Les Arcs'<ref>2T. Devynck, ''Loupot Peintre d'Affiche,'' Mus\u00e9e de l'imprimerie et de la communication graphique: Lyon, 2006, p. 23/32.</ref>. Whilst St-Rapha\u00ebl remained Loupot's major client, he was free to take on other commissions, and worked with Nicolas again. As with his work for St-Rapha\u00ebl, Loupot's post-war Nicolas designs were radically simplified from their original inter-war appearance. \n\n=== Later Years ===\nIn his final years, Loupot spent an increasing amount of time in Provence, at his family home ''Marika'' in Arcs-sur-Argens. By 1962 Loupot had officially retired from poster-making. He died at home in the same year. \n\n=== Style & Technique ===\nLoupot's works were produced using the [[Lithography|lithographic]] technique. He experimented in [[typography]] and aerograph, an early precursor of the airbrush. Each composition was carefully planned with numerous maquettes and revisions.\n\nLoupot was attentive to the major European artistic developments of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His first poster in Paris for the company Voisin clearly demonstrated a knowledge of the French artist [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], whilst he also frequently adapted elements from Fauvism and Cubism. Trained in Switzerland, then a leading centre for graphic design, he was also aware of developments there in Swiss typography and design, and his work also shows a German influence of Sachplakat<ref>R. Jubert and J. Cullars, 'The Bauhaus Context: Typography and Graphic Design in France', ''Design Issues,'' vol. 22, no .4 (Autumn 2006), p. 68.</ref>. Following the second world war, Loupot experimented with abstraction, both in reduction of figurative elements, and also with full abstraction.\n\n=== Painting ===\nAlthough Loupot was most famous for his work as a commercial poster, privately he also experimented extensively with painting. These works were not intended to be sold, and were principally images of his surroundings, friends, and lovers. There is, however, some suggestion that Loupot was occasionally commissioned as a decorator at the beginning of his career in Paris, although details surrounding this are unclear<ref>C. Zagrodski, ''Charles Loupot,'' Le Cherche Midi \u00c9diteur: Paris, 1998, p. 19. </ref>. Loupot's most significant contribution to painting was the chapel, Notre-Dame-de-la-T\u00eate-Ronde \u00e0 Menou, that he decorated in the 1950s.\n\n=== Notable Works ===\n\n* Voisin, Colour Lithograph, 1923\n* Cointreau, Colour Lithograph, 1930\n* Coty, Colour Lithograph, 1938\n* St-Rapha\u00ebl, Colour Lithograph, 1950\n* Lion Noire, Colour Lithograph, 1949\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
