The series is set in Mr Grimes' Toy Factory, where imperfect dolls are thrown into a reject bin. While unobserved by human eyes, the dolls come to life and climb out of the reject bin to have adventures. The series was designed to encourage children to think positively about physical disabilities{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==History==\nThe series was produced for [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]] from 3 April 1986 to 20 December 1994. It was created by Melvyn Jacobson, with scripts, narration and music by [[Neil Innes]]. Yorkshire Television produced the first two series of ''The Raggy Dolls'' before awarding the commission to Orchid Productions Limited in 1987. This was the first programme Yorkshire Television commissioned from an independent production company, and Orchid Productions went on to produce over 100 more episodes of the series. The initial animator for Yorkshire TV was Roy Evans, and consequently after the move to Orchid Productions Mark Mason took over the role, animating and storyboarding 26 episodes, and storyboarding and directing other animators on a further 26 episodes before moving onto work on other children's shows and being replaced by Peter Hale from the 7th series onwards. The series was sold abroad to a number of other countries.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n===The Raggy Dolls===\n*'''Sad Sack''' \u2013 A sample of a design that was deemed too expensive to mass-produce; his appearance is somewhat different from that of the others. He is the oldest of the seven Raggy Dolls in the Reject Bin. As his name suggests, he is very gloomy and cynical, but he still values his friendship with the other dolls.\n*'''Dotty''' - As the oldest next to the lethargic Sad Sack, she sees herself as the leader of the group and is often very bossy. She is so named because she accidentally had paint spilt on her hair and clothing. Dotty's main catchphrase is: \"Good thinking!\"\n*'''Hi-Fi'''  \u2013 He converses with stammer due to him being dropped during testing. It was also stated in episode \"The Trouble with Claude\" that he was wired incorrectly, hence the stammer. He always wears headphones, which allow him to tune into radio and communication signals from seemingly any source.\n*'''Lucy''' \u2013 Her limbs are inadequately attached with nylon thread. She is shy and easily frightened, but always kind-hearted and loyal to her friends. She can be brave on occasion, as first seen in the episode \"Ghosts\". She speaks with a [[Derbyshire]] accent.\n*'''Back-To-Front'''  \u2013 He is a handyman doll with a backward-facing head (as a result of the manufacturer putting his head on the wrong-way round) and a love of machines. Always calm in a crisis, Back-To-Front's catchphrase is \"No problem!\".\n*'''Claude''' \u2013 A French doll, who, unlike his companions, is actually perfect in every way. He fell out of a box of dolls being shipped to France and was left behind, being put in the bin out of a lack of other places.  He speaks with a French accent, and sometimes alternates between speaking English and French. He also has a notable talent for cooking.\n*'''Princess''' \u2013 She should have been a beautiful princess doll, but the machine accidentally cut her hair and left her dress in rags. In the manner of a typical aristocrat, her voice is characterised by [[Phonological history of English fricatives and affricates#H-adding|H-adding]]. As the opening titles indicate, Princess is the youngest of the original seven Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Ragamuffin''' \u2013 A wandering traveller doll who had lost his owner and decided to spend his life taking in new sights and experiences. Introduced in the fifth series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://80scartoons.co.uk/the-raggy-dolls.html|title=Raggy Dolls|work=80scartoons.co.uk|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Friends===\n*'''Pumpernickle''' \u2013 A Scarecrow who is a friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Edward''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's lost teddy bear who becomes a good friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Mr Marmalade''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's pet cat who has a playful trait.\n*'''Hercules''' \u2013 An old farmhorse.\n*'''Rupert the Roo''' \u2013 An Australian toy kangaroo who had been mailed from Australia until he had become a new friend to the Raggy Dolls.\n*'''Natasha''' \u2013 A Russian Doll bought by Mrs Grimes.\n\n===Humans===\n*'''Mr Oswald \"Ozzie\" Grimes''' \u2013 The owner of the toy factory.\n*'''Cynthia''' \u2013 Appeared later in the series to be Mr Grimes's love interest, and later wife.\n*'''Florrie Fosdyke''' \u2013 A kind cafeteria lady who's mostly very forgetful.\n*'''Farmer Brown''' \u2013 The farmer of One Pin Farm.\n*'''Ethel Grimes''' \u2013 Mr Grimes's sister.\n*''' Oz and Boz''' \u2013 Ethel's sons (hence Mr Grimes's nephews), known as the Terrible Twins.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series overview===\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #E34234\n| link1      = #Season 1 (1986-87)\n| episodes1  = 13\n| start1     = {{Start date|1986|4|3}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1987|2|26}}\n\n| color2     = #FBEC5D\n| link2      = #Season 2 (1987-88)\n| episodes2  = 13\n| start2     = {{Start date|1987|11|13}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1988|9|28}}\n\n| color3     = #29AB87\n| link3      = #Season 3 (1988-89)\n| episodes3  = 13\n| start3     = {{Start date|1988|11|16}}\n| end3       = {{End date|1989|8|30}}\n\n| color4     = #29AB12\n| link4      = #Season 4 (1989-90)\n| episodes4  = 13\n| start4     = {{Start date|1989|9|6}}\n| end4       = {{End date|1990|8|30}}\n\n| color5     = #01CD74\n| link5      = #Season 5 (1990)\n| episodes5  = 13\n| start5     = {{Start date|1990|9|6}}\n| end5       = {{End date|1990|12|20}}\n\n| color6     = #0047AB\n| link6      = #Season 6 (1991)\n| episodes6  = 13\n| start6     = {{Start date|1991|9|6}}\n| end6       = {{End date|1991|12|13}}\n\n| color7     = #4B0082\n| link7      = #Season 7 (1992)\n| episodes7  = 13\n| start7     = {{Start date|1992|9|8}}\n| end7       = {{End date|1992|12|8}}\n\n| color8     = #9966CC\n| link8      = #Season 8 (1993)\n| episodes8  = 10\n| start8     = {{Start date|1993|9|28}}\n| end8       = {{End date|1993|12|7}}\n\n| color9     = #DF73FF\n| link9      = #Season 9 (1994)\n| episodes9  = 10\n| start9     = {{Start date|1994|10|11}}\n| end9       = {{End date|1994|12|20}}\n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"5\" style=\"background: #E34234;\"| Season 1\n|-\n!# !!

The series is set in Mr Grimes' Toy Factory, where imperfect dolls are thrown into a reject bin. While unobserved by human eyes, the dolls come to life and climb out of the reject bin to have adventures. The series was designed to encourage children to think positively about physical disabilities{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==History==\nThe series was produced for [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]] from 3 April 1986 to 20 December 1994. It was created by Melvyn Jacobson, with scripts, narration and music by [[Neil Innes]]. Yorkshire Television produced the first two series of ''The Raggy Dolls'' before awarding the commission to Orchid Productions Limited in 1987. This was the first programme Yorkshire Television commissioned from an independent production company, and Orchid Productions went on to produce over 100 more episodes of the series. The initial animator for Yorkshire TV was Roy Evans, and consequently after the move to Orchid Productions Mark Mason took over the role, animating and storyboarding 26 episodes, and storyboarding and directing other animators on a further 26 episodes before moving onto work on other children's shows and being replaced by Peter Hale from the 7th series onwards. The series was sold abroad to a number of other countries.\n\n==Characters ==\n\n===The Raggy Dolls===\n*'''Sad Sack''' \u2013 A sample of a design that was deemed too expensive to mass-produce; his appearance is somewhat different from that of the others. He is the oldest of the seven Raggy Dolls in the Reject Bin. As his name suggests, he is very gloomy and cynical, but he still values his friendship with the other dolls.\n*'''Dotty''' - As the oldest next to the lethargic Sad Sack, she sees herself as the leader of the group and is often very bossy. She is so named because she accidentally had paint spilt on her hair and clothing. Dotty's main catchphrase is: \"Good thinking!\"\n*'''Hi-Fi'''  \u2013 He converses with stammer due to him being dropped during testing. It was also stated in episode \"The Trouble with Claude\" that he was wired incorrectly, hence the stammer. He always wears headphones, which allow him to tune into radio and communication signals from seemingly any source.\n*'''Lucy''' \u2013 Her limbs are inadequately attached with nylon thread. She is shy and easily frightened, but always kind-hearted and loyal to her friends. She can be brave on occasion, as first seen in the episode \"Ghosts\". She speaks with a [[Derbyshire]] accent.\n*'''Back-To-Front'''  \u2013 He is a handyman doll with a backward-facing head (as a result of the manufacturer putting his head on the wrong-way round) and a love of machines. Always calm in a crisis, Back-To-Front's catchphrase is \"No problem!\".\n*'''Claude''' \u2013 A French doll, who, unlike his companions, is actually perfect in every way. He fell out of a box of dolls being shipped to France and was left behind, being put in the bin out of a lack of other places.  He speaks with a French accent, and sometimes alternates between speaking English and French. He also has a notable talent for cooking.\n*'''Princess''' \u2013 She should have been a beautiful princess doll, but the machine accidentally cut her hair and left her dress in rags.

The DVD cover claimed that the show was made by \"the makers of  ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''.\" However, this is only true for ''Charlie Chalk'' (since the slogan was used on all the Woodland Animations DVDs in Australia), because [[Jocelyn Stevenson]] (writer of ''Charlie Chalk'') became the executive producer on ''Thomas and Friends'' from the seventh season onwards.\n\n===Photobooks===\n\nIn 1985, to accompany the programme, some photobooks were released with altered titles to fit the style of the books. These were very similar to the ''Postman Pat'' photobooks, where the front cover would be an original illustration and all pictures within the book were images from the TV programme.\n* ''Bertha and the Great Painting Job (The Great Painting Job)''\n* ''Bertha and the Windmills (The Windmills)''\n* ''Bertha and the Mouse in the Works (A Mouse in the works)''\n* ''Bertha and the Best Machine Competition (The Best Machine Competition)''\n* ''Bertha and the Lost TOM (T.O.M. Gets Lost)''\n* ''Bertha and the Flying Bear (The Flying Bear)''\n\n===Vinyl record===\nIn 1986, after broadcast ended, the BBC's record label released a 12\" vinyl record containing songs from the TV series.\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Side 1\n| extra_column    = Vocals\n\n| all_writing     = Bryan Daly\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = Bertha\n| extra1          = Guy Fletcher\n| length1         =\n\n| title2          = Mrs. Tupp\n| extra2          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length2         =\n\n| title3          = Packing and Stacking\n| extra3          = Guy Fletcher, Eva Burden\n| length3         =\n\n| title4          = The Flying Bear\n| note4           = *) (instrumental\n| extra4          =\n| length4         =\n\n| title5          = Mr. Duncan\n| note5           = *\n| extra5          = Bryan Daly\n| length5         =\n\n| title6          = Turning Wheels\n| note6           = *) (instrumental\n| extra6          =\n| length6         =\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Side 2\n| extra_column    =\n\n| all_writing     =\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = T.O.M. the Robot\n| extra1          = Guy Fletcher\n| length1         =\n\n| title2          = Isn't it Nice?\n| note2           = *\n| extra2          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length2         =\n\n| title3          = Mr. Willmake\n| note3           = *\n| extra3          = Guy Fletcher, Stefanie De Sykes\n| length3         =\n\n| title4          = Tracy's Robot Song\n| extra4          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length4         =\n\n| title5          = Spottiswood March\n| note5           = (*) (instrumental)\n| extra5          =\n| length5         =\n\n| title6          = Roy the Apprentice\n| extra6          = Guy Fletcher\n| length6         =\n}}\n\nTracks marked with an asterisk (*) did not feature in the TV series. However, it is possible that the song \"Mr. Duncan\" was to feature in the episode \"More Speed, Less Work\" but was not included due to it making the episode too long. The same is the case with \"Mr. Willmake\" possibly featuring in the episode \"Bertha's Birthday\".\n\nThe album also had a cassette release with the reference number of ZCR 585. \n\n===Board game===\n\nIn 1987, Falcon released a board game using illustrations similar to those seen on the front covers of the photobooks. The game itself does not differ much from the Monopoly series of board games. If a player lands on T.O.M., they are allowed to ask Bertha to make an item for them.\n\n===Advent calendar===\n\nIn 1985, an Advent calendar using the same profile image as the vinyl record was released.\n\n===Annuals===\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988, ''Bertha'' featured in a total of four annuals:\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1985\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1986\n* ''Buttons'' (based on Children's BBC) annual 1987 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''King Rollo'', ''Towser'', ''Henry's Cat'' and ''Jimbo and the Jet Set'')\n* ''Buttons'' annual 1988 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''Charlie Chalk'', ''Henry's Cat'', ''Towser'', ''King Rollo'' and ''Spot'')\n\n==International Broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|UK}} UK\n** [[BBC1]]\n** [[BBC2]]\n** [[The Children's Channel|TCC]]\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} Poland\n** [[TVP1]]\n* {{flagicon|South Africa}} South Africa\n** [[SABC1]]\n** [[Bop TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Sweden}} Sweden\n** [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** Max\n** [[Nickelodeon (Australia)|Nickelodeon]]\n** [[ABC2]]\n* {{flagicon|Hungary}} Hungary\n** [[M1 (Hungary)|M1]]\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} Canada\n** [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]\n* {{flagicon|Singapore}} Singapore\n** [[MediaCorp Channel 5]]\n* {{flagicon|Norway}} Norway\n** [[NRK]]\n* {{flagicon|Denmark}} Denmark\n** [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]\n* {{flagicon|Nigeria}} Nigeria\n** [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]]\n* {{flagicon|Gibraltar}} Gibraltar\n** [[Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation|GBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|BFBS]]\n** [[Services Sound and Vision Corporation|SSVC Television]]\n\n==Credits==\n* '''Written by:''' Eric Charles\n* '''Narration by:''' Roy Kinnear\n* '''Voices by:''' Roy Kinnear and Sheila Walker\n* '''Music and lyrics by:''' Bryan Daly\n* '''Director of animation:''' Derek Mogford\n* '''Series designed and directed by:''' Ivor Wood\n* '''Film editor:''' Martin Bohan\n* '''Song vocals:''' Guy Fletcher\n* '''Recorded at:''' Havoc House Studios\n* '''Sound by:''' Clive Pendry\n* '''Produced by:''' Woodland Animations Ltd\n* '''\u00a9 Woodland Animations Ltd MCMLXXXV'''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0211240|title=Bertha}}\n* [http://www.thechestnut.com/bertha/bertha.htm Little Gems]\n* [http://www.toonhound.com/bertha.htm Toonhound]\n\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:British stop-motion animated television series]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Classics]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:1980s British animated television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Refimprove |date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox television |\n| show_name = Bertha\n| image =<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Bertha1985.jpg]] -->\n| caption =\n| camera =\n| picture_format =\n| audio_format =\n| runtime = 15 minutes\n| creator= [[Eric Charles]]<br>[[Stephen Flewers]]\n| producer = [[Ivor Wood]]\n| executive_producer =\n| starring = [[Roy Kinnear]] (voice)<br>[[Sheila Walker]] (voice)\n| narrated = [[Roy Kinnear]]\n| theme_music_composer = [[Bryan Daly]]\n| opentheme =\n| endtheme =\n| country = [[United Kingdom]]\n| language = [[English language|English]]\n| network = [[BBC 1]]/[[BBC 2]]\n| first_aired = 1 April 1985\n| last_aired = 18 June 1986\n| num_episodes = 13\n| list_episodes =\n| website =\n|}}\n\n'''''Bertha''''' is a British [[stop motion]]-animated children's television series about a factory machine of that name, comprising 13 episodes that aired from 1985 to 1986. Other major characters in the series were Mr Willmake (factory manager), Mr Sprott (Bertha's chief designer), Tracy (Mr Sprott's young assistant), and Roy. All the characters were designed by Ivor Wood, and the series was produced by his company, [[Woodland Animations]]. It was broadcast on [[BBC Television]].<ref name=\"Bertha\">{{cite web|title=TV TOONS: Bertha (1985)|url=http://www.toonhound.com/bertha.htm|work=Toonhound: cartoons, animation, comic strips and puppets in the UK|publisher=Woodland Animations|accessdate=15 April 2012|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nA series of six storybooks based on ''Bertha'' was published by [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] at the same time as the series was broadcast.

Each episode focuses on a machine called Bertha that can produce any item requested of her. In each episode, the factory experiences a crisis affecting its daily production schedule, which Bertha invariably solves with the help of her factory worker friends.\n\n==Production==\n''Bertha'' was created by Woodland Animations, who also produced the shows ''[[Postman Pat]]'', ''[[Charlie Chalk]]'' and ''[[Gran (TV series)|Gran]]'' for the BBC.

The DVD cover claimed that the show was made by \"the makers of  ''[[Postman Pat]]'' and ''[[Thomas and Friends]]''.\" However, this is only true for ''Charlie Chalk'' (since the slogan was used on all the Woodland Animations DVDs in Australia), because [[Jocelyn Stevenson]] (writer of ''Charlie Chalk'') became the executive producer on ''Thomas and Friends'' from the seventh season onwards.\n\n===Photobooks===\n\nIn 1985, to accompany the programme, some photobooks were released with altered titles to fit the style of the books. These were very similar to the ''Postman Pat'' photobooks, where the front cover would be an original illustration and all pictures within the book were images from the TV programme.\n* ''Bertha and the Great Painting Job (The Great Painting Job)''\n* ''Bertha and the Windmills (The Windmills)''\n* ''Bertha and the Mouse in the Works (A Mouse in the works)''\n* ''Bertha and the Best Machine Competition (The Best Machine Competition)''\n* ''Bertha and the Lost TOM (T.O.M. Gets Lost)''\n* ''Bertha and the Flying Bear (The Flying Bear)''\n\n===Vinyl record===\nIn 1986, after broadcast ended, the BBC's record label released a 12\" vinyl record containing songs from the TV series.\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Side 1\n| extra_column    = Vocals\n\n| all_writing     = Bryan Daly\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = Bertha\n| extra1          = Guy Fletcher\n| length1         =\n\n| title2          = Mrs. Tupp\n| extra2          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length2         =\n\n| title3          = Packing and Stacking\n| extra3          = Guy Fletcher, Eva Burden\n| length3         =\n\n| title4          = The Flying Bear\n| note4           = *) (instrumental\n| extra4          =\n| length4         =\n\n| title5          = Mr. Duncan\n| note5           = *\n| extra5          = Bryan Daly\n| length5         =\n\n| title6          = Turning Wheels\n| note6           = *) (instrumental\n| extra6          =\n| length6         =\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       =\n| headline        = Side 2\n| extra_column    =\n\n| all_writing     =\n| all_lyrics      =\n| all_music       =\n\n| title1          = T.O.M. the Robot\n| extra1          = Guy Fletcher\n| length1         =\n\n| title2          = Isn't it Nice?\n| note2           = *\n| extra2          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length2         =\n\n| title3          = Mr. Willmake\n| note3           = *\n| extra3          = Guy Fletcher, Stefanie De Sykes\n| length3         =\n\n| title4          = Tracy's Robot Song\n| extra4          = Stefanie De Sykes\n| length4         =\n\n| title5          = Spottiswood March\n| note5           = (*) (instrumental)\n| extra5          =\n| length5         =\n\n| title6          = Roy the Apprentice\n| extra6          = Guy Fletcher\n| length6         =\n}}\n\nTracks marked with an asterisk (*) did not feature in the TV series. However, it is possible that the song \"Mr. Duncan\" was to feature in the episode \"More Speed, Less Work\" but was not included due to it making the episode too long. The same is the case with \"Mr. Willmake\" possibly featuring in the episode \"Bertha's Birthday\".\n\nThe album also had a cassette release with the reference number of ZCR 585. \n\n===Board game===\n\nIn 1987, Falcon released a board game using illustrations similar to those seen on the front covers of the photobooks. The game itself does not differ much from the Monopoly series of board games. If a player lands on T.O.M., they are allowed to ask Bertha to make an item for them.\n\n===Advent calendar===\n\nIn 1985, an Advent calendar using the same profile image as the vinyl record was released.\n\n===Annuals===\n\nFrom 1985 to 1988, ''Bertha'' featured in a total of four annuals:\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1985\n* ''Bertha'' annual 1986\n* ''Buttons'' (based on Children's BBC) annual 1987 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''King Rollo'', ''Towser'', ''Henry's Cat'' and ''Jimbo and the Jet Set'')\n* ''Buttons'' annual 1988 (along with ''Postman Pat'', ''Charlie Chalk'', ''Henry's Cat'', ''Towser'', ''King Rollo'' and ''Spot'')\n==Credits==\n* '''Written by:''' Eric Charles\n* '''Narration by:''' Roy Kinnear\n* '''Voices by:''' Roy Kinnear and Sheila Walker\n* '''Music and lyrics by:''' Bryan Daly\n* '''Director of animation:''' Derek Mogford\n* '''Series designed and directed by:''' Ivor Wood\n* '''Film editor:''' Martin Bohan\n* '''Song vocals:''' Guy Fletcher\n* '''Recorded at:''' Havoc House Studios\n* '''Sound by:''' Clive Pendry\n* '''Produced by:''' Woodland Animations Ltd\n* '''\u00a9 Woodland Animations Ltd MCMLXXXV'''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0211240|title=Bertha}}\n* [http://www.thechestnut.com/bertha/bertha.htm Little Gems]\n* [http://www.toonhound.com/bertha.htm Toonhound]\n\n[[Category:BBC children's television programmes]]\n[[Category:British stop-motion animated television series]]\n[[Category:1985 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1986 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British children's television series]]\n[[Category:British children's animated television programmes]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:DreamWorks Classics]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:1980s British animated television series]]\n", "name_user": "109.155.242.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMerchandise)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertha_(TV_series)"}

There were 3 seasons in all.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nDr Melvyn P Otter is the GP for a small group of animals. He lives in a delightful riverside house with his wife, Raylee and his faithful assistant, Flybread (a cat). Each episode, Dr Otter is called upon to tend his little catchment area, which include Mrs Canny Body, Dunston the mole and the Rabbit family, as well as a newt called Lucky.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''Dr Otter''' - is voiced by [[Rob Rackstraw]], who  also voices the naughty scarecrow Spud, in \"Bob the Builder\". He is rather a dapper otter, who always manages to unravel any difficult situations, usually caused by the inexperience of Flybread. He is a kindly soul, trusted by the tiny community.\n* '''Raylee''' - is his wife, she offers assistance in all the episodes. She is very level headed and calm.\n* '''Flybread''' - Dr Otter's assistant, has a tendency to arrogance, but he is really somewhat inexperienced and gets himself into amusing little situations, always to be rescued by Dr Otter or Raylee. He has a very \"posh\" accent.\n* '''Mrs Canny Body''' (voiced by [[Jan Francis]]) - is a delightful old lady who loves to bake cakes for everyone in the community. There is only one problem, they are as hard as concrete and everyone hates them! In at least one episode the cake is used for a completely different purpose to that which was intended. (for instance, a spare tyre!)\n* '''Dunston''' - is a very old and blind mole who lives alone and finds it hard to manage. He gets very confused, and wears an old holey jumper. He needs help in quite a few of the episodes.\n* '''The Rabbit family''' - consist of dad Dexley and mum Dandelion. Their brood  often get into scrapes, as well as getting mysterious \"diseases\" that tend to be \"solved\" quite easily by Dr Otter -(wiping off red spots on faces caused by felt tip pen, etc.)- whilst poor Flybread tends to be poring medical journals for causes of the bogus spots.\n\nAs well being voiced by Rob Rackstraw and Jan Francis, the other characters are voiced by [[Maria Darling]] and [[Jimmy Hibbert]].\n\n== Themes ==\n\nDr Otter is a very gentle medical children's programme that focuses far more on Flybread's attitude and learning about the community, and each episode deals with a minor moral dilemma, rather than a medical one!\n\n== DVD ==\n\nDr Otter was released on Region 2 And Region 4 DVD on 10 January 2005.\n==International Broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom\n** [[BBC]] (''[[CBBC]]''/''[[CBeebies]]'')\n** [[Pop TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Singapore}} Singapore\n** [[MediaCorp Central|Central]] (''[[Kids Central]]'')\n* {{flagicon|South Africa}} South Africa\n** [[M-Net]]\n* {{flagicon|Israel}} Israel\n** [[Israeli Educational Television|IETV]]\n* {{flagicon|Hong Kong}} Hong Kong\n** [[Asia Television|ATV]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** [[ABC2]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[British Forces Broadcasting Service|BFBS]] (''[[Room 785]]'')\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} Poland\n** [[TVP1]]\n* {{flagicon|UAE}} The Emirates\n** [[Dubai 33|Channel 33]]\n** [[City 7 Dubai|City 7]]\n* {{flagicon|Brunei}} Brunei\n** [[Radio Television Brunei|RTB]]\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Season 1 (2001)===\n\n1.Colour Me Lucky\n\n2.Blackberry Surprise\n\n3.Melvyn's Birthday\n\n4.Dr Otter's Mouldy Golf Bag\n\n5.Doctor Donna\n\n6.

Gibbon Jr.]], who had been the executive producer of the original ''[[The Electric Company]]'' for CTW from 1971 to 1977. (Gibbon had left CTW before ''Contact'''s production officially began, though he was still credited as \"Senior Consultant\".) The show was based on the original concept of ''[[The Curiosity Show]]'', an Australian science-based children's educational TV show that had been running since 1972. That program was hosted by Australian scientists [[Rob Morrison (scientist)|Rob Morrison]] and [[Deane Hutton]], who were consultants to The Children's Television Workshop in the early planning stages of what became ''3-2-1 Contact''. CTW wanted to make a version using American scientists as presenters, but PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into ''3-2-1 Contact''.\n\n===Seasons production===\nThe first season of 65 programs began airing January 14, 1980, on select [[List of PBS member stations|PBS member stations]]; it featured a cast of three college students who socialized and discussed science in an on-campus room known as \"the workshop\". This season came to an end on April 11, 1980, and continued in reruns (or removed entirely from scheduling on some stations) for the following three years, as funding for additional episodes was not yet sufficient.\n\nWhen production finally resumed for the second season, which premiered on October 17, 1983, the show presented a more realistic appearance, as the new cast convened in a suburban basement (these segments were shot at [[Teletape Studios|Reeves Teletape]], which also housed ''[[Sesame Street]]'' at the time). This cast continued until October 18, 1985. [[Ozzie Alfonso]] was ''Contact''{{'}}s new director and [[Al Hyslop]] its executive producer.\n\nWhen the fifth season began on September 22, 1986, a third cast was introduced. However, unlike the previous casts, they did not meet in any specific setting; instead, they appeared in various taped and filmed segments. The show ended after seven seasons and 225 episodes on November 18, 1988.\n\n===International and school versions===\n\nFor a time in the mid-1980s, the program was co-produced with the French [[television network]] [[France 3|FR3]] and featured several new French cast members in addition to the [[United States|American]] cast. From 1982 to 1983 the program was aired in Spain with dubbed-over versions of the American original broadcasts, and some local add-ons with four Spanish cast members: [[Sonia Mart\u00ednez]], Luis Bollain, Fernando Rueda, and Marif\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez.<ref>[[La Vanguardia]], February 12, 1982, April 4, 1983.</ref> Another Spanish version of the broadcast was aired from 1990 to 1992.\n\nIt was reported in 1984 that ''3-2-1 Contact'' had an audience of over 7&nbsp;million viewers and was broadcast in 26 countries including [[West Germany]], France, [[Italy]], and Spain making their own dubbed-over versions.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\nFrom September 1, 1991 to May 1, 1992, an edited version titled '''''3-2-1 Classroom Contact''''' was produced, specifically for in-school viewing. It was hosted by either Stephanie Yu, Z. Wright, or both and used previously aired segments from the past series.\n\nBroadcasters wanted children and schools to record and replay the episodes without being afraid of infringement of copyright violations.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\n==Hosts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Liz Moses]] as Lisa (1980)\n* [[Leon W.

Occasionally, shows were also rerun on Nickelodeon's Cable in the Classroom time period. For all these Nickelodeon and Noggin airings, the series was rated TV-Y7 (possibly due to the target audience). It also still aired on some PBS stations as reruns from 1989 to 1998 before it was switched to Noggin in 1999. In 2003, Sesame Workshop sold its half of Noggin to [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] (which already owned the other half). The shows were modified for the shorter running time on these networks to allow for their [[Interstitial program|interstitials]].  It is unknown if the series will be released on DVD.\n\n==International Broadcast==\n* {{flagicon|USA}} United States\n** [[PBS]]\n* {{flagicon|UAE}} United Arab Emirates\n** [[Dubai 33]]\n* {{flagicon|Australia}} Australia\n** [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]]\n* {{flagicon|Guam}} Guam\n** [[KGTF]]\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} Canada\n** [[Knowledge Network]]\n* {{flagicon|Kuwait}} Kuwait\n** [[KTV2]]\n* {{flagicon|Ireland}} Ireland\n** [[RT\u00c9 One]]\n** [[Network 2]]\n* {{flagicon|Singapore}} Singapore\n** [[Mediacorp Channel 5]]\n* {{flagicon|Saudi Arabia}} Saudi Arabia\n** [[Saudi 2]]\n* {{flagicon|Hong Kong}} Hong Kong\n** [[TVB Pearl]]\n* {{flagicon|Nigeria}} Nigeria\n** [[Nigerian Television Authority|NTA]]\n* {{flagicon|Jamaica}} Jamaica\n** [[Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation|JBC]]\n* {{flagicon|Malaysia}} Malaysia\n** [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]]\n* {{flagicon|UK}} United Kingdom\n** [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} Germany\n** [[Armed Forces Network]]\n* {{flagicon|Brunei}} Brunei\n** [[Radio Television Brunei|RTB]]\n* {{flagicon|Israel}} Israel\n** [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]]\n** [[Arutz HaYeladim|The Kids' Channel]]\n* {{flagicon|Korea}} Korea\n** [[American Forces Network|American Forces Korea Network]]\n* {{flagicon|New Zealand}} New Zealand\n** [[TVNZ 1]]\n\n==The Bloodhound Gang==\n{{main|The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)}}\nA frequent segment of the show was [[The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)|''The Bloodhound Gang'']], a series about a group of young detectives who used science to solve crimes. Episodes of the series needed to be run in regular sequence for understandable viewing, as many ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries were cut among two or three ''Contact'' episodes.\n\n==Magazine==\nThree months before the show premiered, a print magazine of the same name that also focused on science was released. In 1985, the magazine absorbed some of the content of sibling publication [[Enter (magazine)|''Enter'']] (which went out of print that same year), including reader submissions of computer programs written in the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[computer language]] as well as reviews of popular computer programs.  The ''Enter'' section also contained a new feature called \"The Slipped Disk Show,\" in which a fictional disc jockey answered computer-related questions submitted by readers.\n\nIn 1987, the magazine began featuring content from another CTW production, ''[[Square One Television]]''. Such content frequently took the form of a two-page comic strip, often parodying a popular show or movie of the time, with a math-related question at the end.\n\nThe ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries also made the leap to the magazine, but they were subsequently replaced with a series entitled '''''The Time Team''''' in September 1990. These stories found teenage characters Sean Nolan and Jenny Lopez traveling to different time periods in the past and future. Their surroundings and personal encounters were described with great detail, educating readers as to the customs of various cultures throughout history, and \u2013 on trips to the future \u2013 often pushing present day hot-button issues. For example, a 1993 story saw the duo traveling to what appeared to be a prehistoric forest, but near the end, they found a [[Brazil]] flag, a newspaper clipping from 1995, and a bulldozer at work: this was in fact a Brazilian [[rainforest]] being levelled.\n\nIn 1996, ''The Time Team'' was replaced by a comic serial, '''''Cosmic Crew''''', which focused on the adventures of a group of teenagers and their robot butler in space. Their first story arc (which ran for more than a year) had them trying to figure out a series of riddles relating to places in the solar system in order to claim a treasure (which turned out to be a scholarship fund). Another story arc had a delinquent (who had been a villain in the first arc) join them in order to chase down a gang of other delinquents. Despite being effectively replaced, a few ''Time Team'' stories were run whenever there were gaps between installments of ''Cosmic Crew''.\n\nMany of the magazine's cover stories involved current events, such as 1990s oil fires in the [[Middle East]]. In addition, the magazine offered a games section in which most of the games were related to the stories in the issue.\n\nIn 1996, CTW presumably concluded that faithful readers from the late 1980s and early 1990s had long since moved on, and the magazine began to reprint non-time-sensitive stories from years past. For example, a 1991 article on the geography of the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] \u2013 a subject relatively unchanging due to the islands' well-enforced ecologically protected status \u2013 could very well re-appear in an identical format a half a decade later.\n\nUnder Children's Television Workshop (now known as [[Sesame Workshop]]), the magazine later became ''Contact Kids'', removing the original reference to the television show. Production of the magazine was suspended indefinitely in 2001.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/archive/3-2-1-contact/}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0190169|title=3-2-1 Contact}}\n* {{tv.com show|3-2-1-contact|3-2-1 Contact}}\n* ''[https://www.facebook.com/321contact1980/ 3-2-1 Contact]''  fan site on Facebook\n\n{{Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n\n[[Category:1980 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American children's television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American children's magazines]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Science education television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Sesame Workshop]]\n[[Category:Television shows filmed in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name = 3-2-1 Contact\n| image = 321 Contact2.png\n| caption = Original opening title of ''3-2-1 Contact''\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = [[Samuel Y.

Gibbon Jr.]], who had been the executive producer of the original ''[[The Electric Company]]'' for CTW from 1971 to 1977. (Gibbon had left CTW before ''Contact'''s production officially began, though he was still credited as \"Senior Consultant\".) The show was based on the original concept of ''[[The Curiosity Show]]'', an Australian science-based children's educational TV show that had been running since 1972. That program was hosted by Australian scientists [[Rob Morrison (scientist)|Rob Morrison]] and [[Deane Hutton]], who were consultants to The Children's Television Workshop in the early planning stages of what became ''3-2-1 Contact''. CTW wanted to make a version using American scientists as presenters, but PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into ''3-2-1 Contact''.\n\n===Seasons production===\nThe first season of 65 programs began airing January 14, 1980, on select [[List of PBS member stations|PBS member stations]]; it featured a cast of three college students who socialized and discussed science in an on-campus room known as \"the workshop\". This season came to an end on April 11, 1980, and continued in reruns (or removed entirely from scheduling on some stations) for the following three years, as funding for additional episodes was not yet sufficient.\n\nWhen production finally resumed for the second season, which premiered on October 17, 1983, the show presented a more realistic appearance, as the new cast convened in a suburban basement (these segments were shot at [[Teletape Studios|Reeves Teletape]], which also housed ''[[Sesame Street]]'' at the time). This cast continued until October 18, 1985. [[Ozzie Alfonso]] was ''Contact''{{'}}s new director and [[Al Hyslop]] its executive producer.\n\nWhen the fifth season began on September 22, 1986, a third cast was introduced. However, unlike the previous casts, they did not meet in any specific setting; instead, they appeared in various taped and filmed segments. The show ended after seven seasons and 225 episodes on November 18, 1988.\n\n===International and school versions===\n\nFor a time in the mid-1980s, the program was co-produced with the French [[television network]] [[France 3|FR3]] and featured several new French cast members in addition to the [[United States|American]] cast. From 1982 to 1983 the program was aired in Spain with dubbed-over versions of the American original broadcasts, and some local add-ons with four Spanish cast members: [[Sonia Mart\u00ednez]], Luis Bollain, Fernando Rueda, and Marif\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez.<ref>[[La Vanguardia]], February 12, 1982, April 4, 1983.</ref> Another Spanish version of the broadcast was aired from 1990 to 1992.\n\nIt was reported in 1984 that ''3-2-1 Contact'' had an audience of over 7&nbsp;million viewers and was broadcast in 26 countries including [[West Germany]], France, [[Italy]], and Spain making their own dubbed-over versions.<ref name=NYTimes/>\n\nFrom September 1, 1991 to May 1, 1992, an edited version titled '''''3-2-1 Classroom Contact''''' was produced, specifically for in-school viewing.

Occasionally, shows were also rerun on Nickelodeon's Cable in the Classroom time period. For all these Nickelodeon and Noggin airings, the series was rated TV-Y7 (possibly due to the target audience). It also still aired on some PBS stations as reruns from 1989 to 1998 before it was switched to Noggin in 1999. In 2003, Sesame Workshop sold its half of Noggin to [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] (which already owned the other half). The shows were modified for the shorter running time on these networks to allow for their [[Interstitial program|interstitials]].  It is unknown if the series will be released on DVD.\n\n==The Bloodhound Gang==\n{{main|The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)}}\nA frequent segment of the show was [[The Bloodhound Gang (TV series)|''The Bloodhound Gang'']], a series about a group of young detectives who used science to solve crimes. Episodes of the series needed to be run in regular sequence for understandable viewing, as many ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries were cut among two or three ''Contact'' episodes.\n\n==Magazine==\nThree months before the show premiered, a print magazine of the same name that also focused on science was released. In 1985, the magazine absorbed some of the content of sibling publication [[Enter (magazine)|''Enter'']] (which went out of print that same year), including reader submissions of computer programs written in the [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] [[computer language]] as well as reviews of popular computer programs.  The ''Enter'' section also contained a new feature called \"The Slipped Disk Show,\" in which a fictional disc jockey answered computer-related questions submitted by readers.\n\nIn 1987, the magazine began featuring content from another CTW production, ''[[Square One Television]]''. Such content frequently took the form of a two-page comic strip, often parodying a popular show or movie of the time, with a math-related question at the end.\n\nThe ''Bloodhound Gang'' mysteries also made the leap to the magazine, but they were subsequently replaced with a series entitled '''''The Time Team''''' in September 1990. These stories found teenage characters Sean Nolan and Jenny Lopez traveling to different time periods in the past and future. Their surroundings and personal encounters were described with great detail, educating readers as to the customs of various cultures throughout history, and \u2013 on trips to the future \u2013 often pushing present day hot-button issues. For example, a 1993 story saw the duo traveling to what appeared to be a prehistoric forest, but near the end, they found a [[Brazil]] flag, a newspaper clipping from 1995, and a bulldozer at work: this was in fact a Brazilian [[rainforest]] being levelled.\n\nIn 1996, ''The Time Team'' was replaced by a comic serial, '''''Cosmic Crew''''', which focused on the adventures of a group of teenagers and their robot butler in space. Their first story arc (which ran for more than a year) had them trying to figure out a series of riddles relating to places in the solar system in order to claim a treasure (which turned out to be a scholarship fund). Another story arc had a delinquent (who had been a villain in the first arc) join them in order to chase down a gang of other delinquents. Despite being effectively replaced, a few ''Time Team'' stories were run whenever there were gaps between installments of ''Cosmic Crew''.\n\nMany of the magazine's cover stories involved current events, such as 1990s oil fires in the [[Middle East]]. In addition, the magazine offered a games section in which most of the games were related to the stories in the issue.\n\nIn 1996, CTW presumably concluded that faithful readers from the late 1980s and early 1990s had long since moved on, and the magazine began to reprint non-time-sensitive stories from years past. For example, a 1991 article on the geography of the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] \u2013 a subject relatively unchanging due to the islands' well-enforced ecologically protected status \u2013 could very well re-appear in an identical format a half a decade later.\n\nUnder Children's Television Workshop (now known as [[Sesame Workshop]]), the magazine later became ''Contact Kids'', removing the original reference to the television show. Production of the magazine was suspended indefinitely in 2001.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|url=http://www.sesameworkshop.org/archive/3-2-1-contact/}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0190169|title=3-2-1 Contact}}\n* {{tv.com show|3-2-1-contact|3-2-1 Contact}}\n* ''[https://www.facebook.com/321contact1980/ 3-2-1 Contact]''  fan site on Facebook\n\n{{Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program}}\n{{PBSKids shows}}\n\n[[Category:1980 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American children's television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American children's magazines]]\n[[Category:PBS original programming]]\n[[Category:Science education television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Sesame Workshop]]\n[[Category:Television shows filmed in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "109.155.242.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBroadcast)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-2-1_Contact"}
