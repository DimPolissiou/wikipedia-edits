{"title_page": "Josef Mitterer", "text_new": "'''Josef Mitterer''' (born 1948) is an Austrian philosopher, and a [[professor emeritus]] at the [[University of Klagenfurt]] Institute for Philosophy.<ref name=\"aau.at\" />\n\nMitterer studied psychology and sociology in Innsbruck and Linz and philosophy in Graz. His studies also took him to the London School of Economics ([[Imre Lakatos]]), to Heidelberg University ([[Richard Rorty]]), IUC Dubrovnik ([[Michael Dummett]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]) and in 1976 to Berkeley where he studied with [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Mitterer received his doctorate at the [[University of Graz]] in 1978. He then worked as a Tour Director in Europe and Asia and as a Management Consultant for the Travel Industry in the USA. Since 1990 Mitterer has been teaching philosophy at the [[University of Klagenfurt]]<ref name=\"aau.at\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aau.at/team/mitterer-josef/|title=Visitenkarte Mitterer Josef}}</ref>; he held guest lectureships at the universities of Innsbruck, Linz, Ljubljana and Siegen. \n\nIn his book ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie'' (''The Beyond of Philosophy''), based on his dissertation, he developed a Non-dualizing Philosophy of Change, which foregoes the categorical distinction between language and language-distinct reality. In ''Die Flucht aus der Beliebigkeit'' (''The Flight from Contingency'') (2001) he critically examines the epistemological goal of truth.

These three fundamental agreements are:\n\n*a dichotomic distinction between language and language-distinct reality, between descriptions and description-distinct objects, between talking about the world and the world itself, etc. - regardless of whether language depicts or constructs reality, whether the relationship between sign and referent is arbitrary or not.\n*the truth-orientation of philosophy. The search for truth and knowledge is a search for agreement between the two sides of this dichotomy: an agreement between language and reality, between description and object, between metalanguage and object language \u2013 regardless whether this agreement is called \"true\" or \"adequate\" with reference to an independent reality or if it is considered as viable in a constructed reality.\n*The direction of thinking is directed towards the objects of thought, whatever may serve as such an object: the world, reality, an element of an object-language. Our cognitive efforts are directed towards the objects of cognition.\nAccording to Mitterer these three commonalities are not only prevalent in realistic philosophies; they can also be found at least as residuals or minimal ontologies in postructuralist, relativist or (radical) constructivist theories of knowledge. He sums up the various philosophical traditions in a simple statement:\n\n''Either: There are distinctions and therefore we make them (realism) or: We make distinctions and therefore they are (idealism, constructivism).''<ref>cf. Josef Mitterer: Die Flucht aus der Beliebigkeit, \u00a7 11.</ref>\n\nIn ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie (The Beyond of Philosophy)'' Josef Mitterer developed an alternative way of thinking which foregoes the dichotomy between between language and reality. A description of an object does not refer to the object, but rather starts from the object. The object of a description relates to the description of the object like a description ''so far'' to a description ''from now on''. A new description of the object changes the object into a new object of further description(s).\nMitterer does not want to deny or overcome the distinctions between language and reality, word and object, between what we talk and what we talk about. He is rather interested in when, how and why these distinctions are introduced into our discourse.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Primary===\n* ''Das Jenseits der Philosophie''.

Furthermore, high negative and positive predictive values were reported for florbetaben imaging to exclude or detect \u03b2-amyloid plaques (negative predictive value 96.0% and positive predictive value 93.9%, see <ref name=Sabri />). Intravenous injections of florbetaben are generally well tolerated in all subject groups. Analysis of 872 patients with 978 florbetaben administrations found no serious adverse reactions related to the tracer.<ref name=US /> All adverse reactions reported were mild to moderate in severity and temporary only. The most common reactions (incidence < 1%) were injection-site pain (3.9% of patients), injection-site erythema (1.7%) and injection-site irritation (1.2%).<ref name=US /> There was no overall difference in the tolerability of florbetaben between different age populations.<ref name=US /> Repeated annual florbetaben injections showed no differences in the tolerability profile.<ref name=EU /> Risks and side effects are addressed in the patient information leaflet.<ref name=US /><ref name=EU /> You may also ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Florbetapir]]\n* [[Flutemetamol]]\n* [[Pittsburgh compound B]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40263-015-0258-7 Syed, Y.Y. and E.

He attended the [[The King's School, Gloucester|Gloucester cathedral school]], where he became a boy-singer.

The words were by [[Ralph Tomlinson]], the president of the society, and were inspired by the 6th-century BC Greek lyric poet, [[Anacreon]], who wrote odes on the pleasures of love and wine. The song became popular in Britain and also America following the establishment of several Anacreontic Societies there. Smith never married.\n\nSmith later became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in 1784, organist for the Chapel Royal in 1802 and [[Master of the Children]] in 1805.

The batter attempts to hit a baseball pitched by the [[pitcher]] (not pictured) to the catcher; and the umpire decides whether pitches are balls or strikes.]]\n\nIn [[baseball]], the '''strike zone '''is the volume of space through which a [[Pitch (baseball)|pitch]] must pass in order to be called a strike, if the batter does not swing. The strike zone is defined as the volume of space above [[Baseball field#Home plate|home plate]] and between the batter's knees and the midpoint of their [[torso]]. Whether a pitch passes through the zone is decided by an umpire, who is generally positioned behind the catcher.\n\nStrikes are desirable for the pitcher and the [[Baseball rules#Fielding team|fielding team]], as three strikes result in a [[strikeout]] of that batter. A pitch that misses the strike zone is called a [[Baseball rules#Batting|ball]] if the batter doesn't swing. Balls are desirable for the [[Batting (baseball)|batter]] and the [[Baseball rules#Batting team|batting team]], as four balls allow the batter to take a \"walk\" to first base as a [[base on balls]].\n\n==History==\nOriginally, the word \"strike\" was used literally: the batter ''striking'' at the ball in an effort to hit it. For example, the 11th of the [[Knickerbocker Rules]] (1845) read \"Three balls being struck at and missed and the last one caught, is a hand-out.\" There was no adverse consequence if the batter chose not to swing, the result being batters prepared to wait all day for \"their\" pitch.  It was not until the 1858 [[National Association of Base Ball Players|NABBP]] convention that a rule was adopted authorizing the umpire to impose a penalty strike for such conduct: \"Should a striker stand at the bat without striking at good balls repeatedly pitched to him, for the purpose of delaying the game or of giving advantage to a player, the umpire, after warning him, shall call one strike, and if he persists in such action, two and three strikes. When three strikes are called, he shall be subject to the same rules as if he had struck at three balls.\"<ref>https://protoball.org/1858_NABBP_Rules</ref>  The called ball first appeared in the rules of 1863, similarly as a discretionary penalty imposed on the pitcher for persistently delivering \"unfair\" balls.<ref>https://protoball.org/1863_NABBP_Rules</ref> \n\nWhether or not a pitch was \"unfair,\" or the batter was unreasonably picky, was a matter left entirely to the umpire's judgement; well into the 1870s umpires were reluctant to make such calls, since they were viewed as penalties for unsportsmanlike play. But by the 1880s they had become routine, and the modern view according to which every pitch results in either a swing, a ball or a called strike had taken hold.  The first rule leading to the creation of a defined strike ''zone'' was enacted by the [[American Association]] before the 1886 season: \"The ball must be delivered at the height called for by the batsman. If at such height it passes over any part of the plate then it is a strike. The idea is to give the pitcher a chance against some cranky umpire who compelled the twirlers to almost cut the plate in two before a strike would be called, even if the height was right.\"<ref>''Sporting Life'', Wednesday, March 17, 1886</ref> The following year, the [[National League]] created the full strike zone, requiring the umpire to call a strike on any pitch that \"passes over home plate not lower than the batsman's knee, nor higher than his shoulders.\"<ref>https://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/strike_zone_rules_history.shtml</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nMultiple sets of rules govern baseball and softball, which define the strike zone slightly differently.  The rulebook in use depends on the level and league.\n\nThe Major League Official Rules defines the top of the strike zone at the midpoint between the top of the batter's [[shoulder]]s and the top of the uniform pants. The bottom of the strike zone is at the hollow beneath the [[kneecap]], both determined from the batter's stance as the batter is prepared to swing at the pitched ball. The right and left boundaries of the strike zone correspond to the edges of home plate. A pitch that touches the outer boundary of the zone is as much a strike as a pitch that is thrown right down the center. A pitch at which the batter does not swing and which does not pass through the strike zone is called a ''ball'' (short for \"no ball\"). The active tally of strikes and balls during a player's turn batting is called the [[Count (baseball)|count]].\n\nThe strike zone is a volume of space delimited by vertical planes extending up from the pentagonal boundaries of the home plate and limited at the top and bottom by upper and lower horizontal planes passing through the horizontal lines of the definition above. This volume thus takes the form of a vertical right pentagonal prism located above home plate. A pitch passing outside the front of the defined volume of the strike zone but curving so as to enter this volume farther back (without being hit) is described as a \"back-door strike\".\n\n[[Major League Baseball]] has occasionally increased or reduced the size of the strike zone in an attempt to control the balance of power between pitchers and hitters.<ref name=\"1968: Year of the Pitcher\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thisgreatgame.com/1968.html |title=1968: Year of the Pitcher |publisher=thisgreatgame.com |access-date=25 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224181907/http://www.thisgreatgame.com/1968.html |archive-date=24 December 2011 |df= }}</ref> After the record home run year by [[Roger Maris]] in {{Baseball year|1961}}, the major leagues increased the size of the strike zone from the top of the batter's shoulders to the bottom of his knees.<ref>{{cite news |title=Expanded strike zone unveiled |agency=Associated Press |work=The Press-Courier |page=9 |date=8 March 1963 |accessdate=25 December 2011 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AxpLAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4SINAAAAIBAJ&pg=7088,849307&dq=1962+strike+zone&hl=en}}</ref> In {{Baseball year|1968}}, pitchers such as [[Denny McLain]] and [[Bob Gibson]] among others dominated hitters, producing 339 [[shutout]]s.<ref name=\"1968: Year of the Pitcher\"/> [[Carl Yastrzemski]] would be the only [[American League]] hitter to finish the season with a [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] higher than .300.<ref name=\"1968: Year of the Pitcher\"/> In the [[National League]], Gibson posted a 1.12 earned run average, the lowest in 54 years, while [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] pitcher [[Don Drysdale]] threw a record 58 and two-thirds consecutive scoreless innings during the 1968 season.<ref name=\"1968: Year of the Pitcher\"/> As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, Major League Baseball took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers by lowering the height of the pitcher's mound from 15 inches to 10 inches, and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the {{Baseball year|1969}} season.<ref>{{cite news |title=McLain Says Lower Mound Will Take Toll of Pitchers |agency=Associated Press |work=The Telegraph-Herald |page=13 |date=14 January 1969 |accessdate=25 December 2011 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LWNFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KbwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5404,1728619&dq=denny+mclain+pitching+mound&hl=en}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the ''[[de facto]]'' enforced strike zone can vary, the Official Rules (Definitions of Terms, STRIKE (b)) define a pitch as a strike \"if any part of the ball passes through any part of the strike zone.\"\n\nA batter who accumulates three strikes in a single batting appearance has [[strikeout|struck out]] and is ruled [[out (baseball)|out]] (with the exception of an [[uncaught third strike]]); a batter who accumulates four balls in a single appearance has drawn a [[base on balls]] (or ''walk'') and is awarded advancement to [[first base]].
