This was confirmed in the case of ''[[R v Carroll]]'', where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll's sworn [[alibi]] two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturn of his conviction (for perjury) by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the England and Wales legislation.\n\nDuring a [[COAG|Council of Australian Governments (COAG)]] meeting of 2007, model legislation to rework double jeopardy laws was drafted,<ref name=\"premier.vic.gov.au\">{{cite web|title=Coalition Government to introduce double jeopardy reforms|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/2427-coalition-government-to-introduce-double-jeopardy-reforms.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322221443/http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/media-centre/media-releases/2427-coalition-government-to-introduce-double-jeopardy-reforms.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 March 2012|work=Victoria's double jeopardy laws to be reworked|accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> but there was no formal agreement for each state to introduce it.

A \"tainted acquittal\" requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal. Unlike reforms in the United Kingdom, New South Wales, Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, this law does not have a retrospective effect, which is unpopular with some advocates of the reform.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/double-jeopardy-changes-insufficient/2007/04/20/1176697080260.html|title=Double Jeopardy Changes Insufficient|newspaper=The Brisbane Times|date=20 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] includes provisions such as [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(h)]] prohibiting double jeopardy. However, the prohibition applies only after an accused person has been \"finally\" convicted or acquitted. [[Canadian law]] allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal, and if the acquittal is thrown out, the new trial is not considered to be double jeopardy since the verdict of the first trial is annulled. In rare circumstances, a [[court of appeal]] might also substitute a conviction for an acquittal. That is not considered to be double jeopardy, since the appeal and the subsequent conviction are then deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.\n\nFor an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] requires the [[Crown of Canada|Crown]] to show that an error in law was made during the trial and that the error contributed to the verdict. It has been suggested that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, lawyer [[Martin Friedland]], in his book ''My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures'', contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be ''responsible'' for the verdict, not just a factor.\n\nA notable example is [[Guy Paul Morin]], who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nIn the [[Guy Turcotte]] case, for instance, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned Turcotte's [[insanity defense|not criminally responsible]] verdict and ordered a second trial after it found that the judge committed an error in the first trial while instructions were given to the jury.

However, the prohibition applies only after an accused person has been \"finally\" convicted or acquitted. [[Canadian law]] allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal, and if the acquittal is thrown out, the new trial is not considered to be double jeopardy since the verdict of the first trial is annulled. In rare circumstances, a [[court of appeal]] might also substitute a conviction for an acquittal. That is not considered to be double jeopardy, since the appeal and the subsequent conviction are then deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.\n\nFor an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] requires the [[Crown of Canada|Crown]] to show that an error in law was made during the trial and that the error contributed to the verdict. It has been suggested that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, lawyer [[Martin Friedland]], in his book ''My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures'', contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be ''responsible'' for the verdict, not just a factor.\n\nA notable example is [[Guy Paul Morin]], who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nIn the [[Guy Turcotte]] case, for instance, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned Turcotte's [[insanity defense|not criminally responsible]] verdict and ordered a second trial after it found that the judge committed an error in the first trial while instructions were given to the jury. Turcotte was later convicted of second-degree murder in the second trial.\n\n===France===\nOnce all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgement is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was [[forgery|forged]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006574827&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154|title=Code of penal procedure, article 6|publisher=Legifrance|accessdate=2 January 2012|language=fr}}</ref> Prosecution for a crime already judged is impossible even if incriminating evidence has been found.

This means the prosecution and/or the defendants can appeal against a judgement if they do not agree with it. In this case the trial starts again in the second instance, the court of appeal (''Berufungsgericht''), which considers the facts and reasons again and delivers the final judgement then.\n\nIf one of the parties disagrees with the judgement of the second instance, he or she can appeal it, but only on formal judicial reasons. The case will checked in the third instance (''Revisionsgericht''), whether all laws are applied correctly.\n\nThe rule applies to the whole \"historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural\". This is true even if new facts occur that indicate other and/or much serious crimes.\n\nThe Penal Procedural Code (''Strafprozessordnung'') permits a retrial (''Wiederaufnahmeverfahren''), if it is in favor of the defendant or if following events had happened:\n\n{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is permissible after a final judgement,\n#if a document that was considered authentic during the trial was actually not authentic or forged,\n#if a witness or authorised expert wilfully or negligently made a wrong deposition or wilfully gave a wrong simple testimony,\n#if a professional or lay judge, who made the decision, had committed a crime by violating his or her duties as a judge in the case\n#if an acquitted defendant makes a credible confession in court or out of court.|\u00a7 362 StPO}}\n\nIn the case of an order of [[summary punishment]], which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours, there is a further exception:\n{{quotation|A retrial not in favour of the defendant is also permissible if the defendant has been convicted in a final order of summary punishment and new facts or evidence have been brought forward, which establish grounds for a conviction of a felony by themselves or in combination with earlier evidence.|\u00a7 373a StPO}}\nIn Germany, a felony is defined by \u00a7 12 (1) StGB as a crime which has a minimum of one year of imprisonment.\n\n===India===\nA partial protection against double jeopardy is a [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Right]] guaranteed under Article 20 (2) of the [[Constitution of India]], which states \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\".<ref name=\"constitution\">{{cite journal |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023 |title=Article 20, Section 2 |work=Constitution of India |quote=No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001157/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/fullact1.asp?tfnm=00%2023 |archivedate=24 November 2010}}</ref> This provision enshrines the concept of ''autrefois convict'', that no one convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time.

This process sometimes takes decades.\n\nThe above is not considered a violation of the constitution. Because of Supreme Court precedent, this process is all considered part of a single proceeding.<ref>[http://blog.livedoor.jp/plltakano/archives/54254570.html \u5211\u4e8b\u88c1\u5224\u3092\u8003\u3048\u308b\uff1a\u9ad8\u91ce\u9686\uff20\u30d6\u30ed\u30b0:\u4e8c\u91cd\u306e\u5371\u967a].

New evidence can be brought to bear during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.\n\nOn 9 April 2013 the Dutch senate voted 36 \"yes\" versus 35 \"no\" in favor of a new law that allows the prosecutor to re-try a person who was found not guilty in court. This new law is limited to crimes where someone died and new evidence must have been gathered. The new law also works retroactively.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\nArticle 13 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] protects a person from being punished or prosecuted more than once for the same offence.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\nThis principle is incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and further elaborated in its Criminal Procedure Act.<ref>Article 6. of the Criminal Procedure Act \u2013 ZAKONIK O KRIVI\u010cNOM POSTUPKU (\"Sl. list SRJ\", br. 70/2001 i 68/2002 i \"Sl. glasnik RS\", br. 58/2004, 85/2005, 115/2005, 85/2005 \u2013 dr. zakon, 49/2007, 20/2009 \u2013 dr. zakon i 72/2009)</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\nThe [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]] in the [[Constitution of South Africa]] forbids a retrial when there has already been an acquittal or a conviction.\n{{quotation|Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right ... not to be tried for an offence in respect of an act or omission for which that person has previously been either acquitted or convicted ...|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, s. 35(3)(m)}}\n\n===South Korea===\nArticle 13 of the South Korean constitution provides that no citizen shall be placed in double jeopardy.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130218201252/http://korea.assembly.go.kr/res/low_01_read.jsp CHAPTER \u2161 Rights and Duties of the Citizens], Constitution of the republic of Korea.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{see also|Criminal Justice Act 2003}}\n\n====England and Wales====\nDouble jeopardy has been permitted in [[England and Wales]] in certain (exceptional) circumstances since the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].\n\n===== Pre-2003 =====\n\nThe doctrines of ''[[Peremptory plea|autrefois acquit]]'' and ''autrefois convict'' persisted as part of the [[common law]] from the time of the [[Norman conquest of England]]; they were regarded as essential elements for protection of the subject's liberty and respect for [[due process]] of law in that there should be finality of proceedings.<ref name=\"Ben\u00e9t1864p97\" /> There were only three exceptions, all relatively recent, to the rules:\n*The prosecution has a right of appeal against acquittal in summary cases if the decision appears to be wrong in law or in excess of jurisdiction.<ref>Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 ss.28, 111; Supreme Court Act 1981 s.28</ref>\n*A retrial is permissible if the interests of justice so require, following appeal against conviction by a defendant.<ref>Criminal Appeal Act 1968 s.7</ref>\n*A \"tainted acquittal\", where there has been an offence of interference with, or intimidation of, a juror or witness, can be challenged in the High Court.<ref name=\"CPIA96\">Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 s.54</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Connelly v DPP]]'' [1964] AC 1254, the [[Law Lords]] ruled that a defendant could not be tried for any offence arising out of substantially the same set of facts relied upon in a previous charge of which he had been acquitted, unless there are \"special circumstances\" proven by the prosecution.

The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

surrounding [[New South Wales]] towns [[Queanbeyan]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]. The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

It originally aired on January 9, 2014 on [[NBC]]; and was written by Erik Sommers and directed by [[Tristram Shapeero]].\n\nIn this episode, a prankster dubbed the Ass Crack Bandit wreaks havoc on the students and faculty of Greendale. This leads Jeff Winger ([[Joel McHale]]) and Annie Edison ([[Alison Brie]]) to further investigate the situation; the episode then shifts in tone after Shirley Bennett ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) reveals shocking news to Jeff, Annie, and the study group.\n\nThis prankster was first referenced in the [[Community (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Intro to Political Science]],\" when Annie states \"the assailant known only as the 'Ass Crack Bandit' will be brought to justice.\"\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim, with most critics commenting positively on [[Donald Glover]]'s comical role as a traumatized Troy Barnes after becoming a victim to the Bandit, while others commented positively on the reveal of Pierce Hawthorne's ([[Chevy Chase]]) fate; the episode also saw a rise in ratings from the episodes \"[[Repilot]]\" and \"[[Introduction to Teaching]],\" with a total audience of 3.58 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 1.4.<ref name=\"5x03ratings\"/><ref name=\"S05E01x02\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the \"Ass Crack Bandit\" (whose [[modus operandi|M.O.]] is to drop a coin down the back of someone's pants when they lean over) returns to campus, Jeff Winger ([[Joel McHale]]) and Annie Edison ([[Alison Brie]]) begin an investigation. Professor Ian Duncan ([[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]) also helps. Soon, Troy Barnes ([[Donald Glover]]) becomes a victim of the Bandit, and Annie is able to deduce from past \"attacks\" that a teacher is the most likely culprit.\n\nJeff and Annie are able to track a phone call made by the bandit to the Greendale [[horse stable|stables]], where they discover former student Alex \"Star-Burns\" Osbourne ([[Dino Stamatopoulos]]). Star-Burns had been living at the stables after faking his own death, and is presumed to be the bandit, even going so far as confessing under pressure.\n\nHowever, during a dance in commemoration of Star-Burns' capture, Star-Burns admits to Jeff that he falsely confessed as part of a bargain with Dean Pelton ([[Jim Rash]]) to get a heating unit for the stables. Annie comes to suspect Professor Duncan may be the \"Ass Crack Bandit\", however this is proven untrue when he becomes a victim himself.\n\nBefore the investigation can go any further, Shirley Bennett ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) arrives and informs the group that former member Pierce Hawthorne ([[Chevy Chase]]) has died.  The group grieves, the investigation for the Ass Crack Bandit is called off, and Star-Burns recants his former confession; it is hinted at the episode's end that several of the show's main and supporting cast members may be the Ass Crack Bandit.\n\nConsiderably the production of this episode could be based off of the hit televison show, \"Criminal Minds\". Several references are mentioned to characters and aspects of the show when the word \"profile\" is mentioned and also when Abed scopes out the room imagining what went down like the character Derek Morgan in Criminal Minds.\n\n==Production==\nThis episode marks the return of [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] as Professor Ian Duncan, who was last seen in the [[Community (season 2)|second season]].  [[Dino Stamatopoulos]] also returns to the series as Alex \"Star-Burns\" Osbourne, having been last seen in the [[Introduction to Finality|third-season finale]]. In addition to this, musician [[Ben Folds]] appears in a cameo, as a [[botany]] professor.<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode adheres to tropes of the crime drama genre, e.g., TV series like ''[[The Bridge (2013 TV series)|The Bridge]]'', ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', and ''[[The Killing (U.S. TV series)|The Killing]]''.<ref name=\"starpulse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Alyssa_Landau/2014/01/10/community_the_best_and_worst_of_basic_ |title='Community': The Best And Worst Of 'Basic Intergluteal Numismatics' |publisher=Starpulse |first=Alyssa |last=Landau |date=January 10, 2014 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref>  Abed also references crime shows that feature lead characters with mild mental disorders (such as ''The Bridge'' and ''Hannibal''), and is later seen deleting said shows from his DVR.

The Seven homages were terrific and hysterical and this will likely be one of the most quoted Community episodes ever among fans, with one awesome line after another. In fact, it was difficult stopping this review from simply naming one highlight after another. While the focus was on Annie and Jeff, this episode also managed to give pretty much every character at least one great line or moment, including Shirley's \"He should be the run on sentence Bandit\", Abed's \"Mildly autistic super detectives everywhere!\" run, Chang's backwards butt costume and Britta naming every possible meaning for the Ass Crack Bandit's crimes.\"\"<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/community-basic-intergluteal-numismatics-review|title=Community: \"Basic Intergluteal Numismatics\" Review|publisher=IGN|first=Eric|last=Goldman|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> He also called Jeff and Annie's storyline in this episode \"one of the best uses of this show\u2019s \u201cWill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d dynamic yet.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Also, in regard to the episode's ending with the reveal of Pierce's death, Goldman said \"The news of Pierce\u2019s death in the midst of all this was certainly a shock and a bit of a jolt to the system, given the episode was in such a specific zone up until then. That was the point, of course \u2013 and Neil\u2019s somber eulogy, followed by \u201cUp next on the dial is Dr. Farts\u201d was hysterical.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nAlan Sepinwall of ''[[HitFix]]'' noted Pierce's death, saying \"I'm glad Harmon and Chase were able to work out one final appearance for him before bumping off Pierce, and introducing his death here lent some gravity to all the silliness between Jeff, Annie and the Ass Crack Bandit, whomever he or she may be.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-community-basic-intergluteal-numismatics-to-the-cat-car|title=Review: 'Community' - 'Basic Intergluteal Numismatics': To the cat car!|publisher=HitFix|first=Alan|last=Sepinwall|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nRay Rahman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the episode's use of the parody, saying \"the episode was a committed (and thoroughly hilarious) genre parody of David Fincher-style suspense thrillers. And it went full-on macro, venturing into new and unknown regions of the Greendale universe, turning the community college into a Springfield of its own.

It really highlights the way that this group exists in their own little Greendale microcosm filled with adventures (like these theme episodes) that distract them from the realities of everyday life, like old friends passing away. While they were busy trying to find a prankster who likes to shove quarters down butt cracks, their friend was off somewhere taking his last breath. Amid all the clever gags and moments of laughter, this show still finds time to have a huge, beating heart in the center of it all, and Dan Harmon balances it all so, so well.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\"/></blockquote>\n\nEmily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V.

It originally aired on January 9, 2014 on [[NBC]]; and was written by Erik Sommers and directed by [[Tristram Shapeero]].\n\nIn this episode, a prankster dubbed the Ass Crack Bandit wreaks havoc on the students and faculty of Greendale. This leads Jeff Winger ([[Joel McHale]]) and Annie Edison ([[Alison Brie]]) to further investigate the situation; the episode then shifts in tone after Shirley Bennett ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) reveals shocking news to Jeff, Annie, and the study group.\n\nThis prankster was first referenced in the [[Community (season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Intro to Political Science]],\" when Annie states \"the assailant known only as the 'Ass Crack Bandit' will be brought to justice.\"\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim, with most critics commenting positively on [[Donald Glover]]'s comical role as a traumatized Troy Barnes after becoming a victim to the Bandit, while others commented positively on the reveal of Pierce Hawthorne's ([[Chevy Chase]]) fate; the episode also saw a rise in ratings from the episodes \"[[Repilot]]\" and \"[[Introduction to Teaching]],\" with a total audience of 3.58 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 1.4.<ref name=\"5x03ratings\"/><ref name=\"S05E01x02\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the \"Ass Crack Bandit\" (whose [[modus operandi|M.O.]] is to drop a coin down the back of someone's pants when they lean over) returns to campus, Jeff Winger ([[Joel McHale]]) and Annie Edison ([[Alison Brie]]) begin an investigation. Professor Ian Duncan ([[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]]) also helps. Soon, Troy Barnes ([[Donald Glover]]) becomes a victim of the Bandit, and Annie is able to deduce from past \"attacks\" that a teacher is the most likely culprit.\n\nJeff and Annie are able to track a phone call made by the bandit to the Greendale [[horse stable|stables]], where they discover former student Alex \"Star-Burns\" Osbourne ([[Dino Stamatopoulos]]). Star-Burns had been living at the stables after faking his own death, and is presumed to be the bandit, even going so far as confessing under pressure.\n\nHowever, during a dance in commemoration of Star-Burns' capture, Star-Burns admits to Jeff that he falsely confessed as part of a bargain with Dean Pelton ([[Jim Rash]]) to get a heating unit for the stables. Annie comes to suspect Professor Duncan may be the \"Ass Crack Bandit\", however this is proven untrue when he becomes a victim himself.\n\nBefore the investigation can go any further, Shirley Bennett ([[Yvette Nicole Brown]]) arrives and informs the group that former member Pierce Hawthorne ([[Chevy Chase]]) has died.  The group grieves, the investigation for the Ass Crack Bandit is called off, and Star-Burns recants his former confession; it is hinted at the episode's end that several of the show's main and supporting cast members may be the Ass Crack Bandit.\n\n==Production==\nThis episode marks the return of [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] as Professor Ian Duncan, who was last seen in the [[Community (season 2)|second season]].  [[Dino Stamatopoulos]] also returns to the series as Alex \"Star-Burns\" Osbourne, having been last seen in the [[Introduction to Finality|third-season finale]]. In addition to this, musician [[Ben Folds]] appears in a cameo, as a [[botany]] professor.<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\"/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode adheres to tropes of the crime drama genre, e.g., TV series like ''[[The Bridge (2013 TV series)|The Bridge]]'', ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]'', and ''[[The Killing (U.S. TV series)|The Killing]]''.<ref name=\"starpulse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Alyssa_Landau/2014/01/10/community_the_best_and_worst_of_basic_ |title='Community': The Best And Worst Of 'Basic Intergluteal Numismatics' |publisher=Starpulse |first=Alyssa |last=Landau |date=January 10, 2014 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}</ref>  Abed also references crime shows that feature lead characters with mild mental disorders (such as ''The Bridge'' and ''Hannibal''), and is later seen deleting said shows from his DVR.

The Seven homages were terrific and hysterical and this will likely be one of the most quoted Community episodes ever among fans, with one awesome line after another. In fact, it was difficult stopping this review from simply naming one highlight after another. While the focus was on Annie and Jeff, this episode also managed to give pretty much every character at least one great line or moment, including Shirley's \"He should be the run on sentence Bandit\", Abed's \"Mildly autistic super detectives everywhere!\" run, Chang's backwards butt costume and Britta naming every possible meaning for the Ass Crack Bandit's crimes.\"\"<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/community-basic-intergluteal-numismatics-review|title=Community: \"Basic Intergluteal Numismatics\" Review|publisher=IGN|first=Eric|last=Goldman|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> He also called Jeff and Annie's storyline in this episode \"one of the best uses of this show\u2019s \u201cWill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d dynamic yet.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Also, in regard to the episode's ending with the reveal of Pierce's death, Goldman said \"The news of Pierce\u2019s death in the midst of all this was certainly a shock and a bit of a jolt to the system, given the episode was in such a specific zone up until then.

And it went full-on macro, venturing into new and unknown regions of the Greendale universe, turning the community college into a Springfield of its own. Not that I don\u2019t like those bottle-episodey group therapy sessions where the only things that are explored are feelings and emotions \u2014 those are also great, but these are a little greater if you ask me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/01/09/community-react-change-is-gonna-come/|title='Community' react: Change is gonna come|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|first=Ray|last=Rahman|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBritt Hayes of ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' gave the episode a positive review, saying \"Of everything in tonight\u2019s episode, Troy might be my favorite, and maybe I'm a bit partial to Donald Glover since he\u2019s leaving us pretty soon, but his Ass Crack Bandit victim with PTSD schtick was beautifully dramatized with a great payoff.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\">{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/community-review-basic-intergluteal-numismatics/|title=\u2018Community\u2019 Review: \"Basic Intergluteal Numismatics\"|publisher=ScreenCrush|first=Britt|last=Hayes|date=January 9, 2014|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}</ref> She also noted the episode's ending, saying: <blockquote>\"the way this week\u2019s episode builds to its Fincheresque climax \u2014 with Annie and Jeff on the cusp of solving the crime during a big student gathering, a couple of clever misdirects, and then the pair losing their bad guy at the last minute \u2014 only to slide gracefully into Shirley announcing the death of Pierce was quite moving. It really highlights the way that this group exists in their own little Greendale microcosm filled with adventures (like these theme episodes) that distract them from the realities of everyday life, like old friends passing away. While they were busy trying to find a prankster who likes to shove quarters down butt cracks, their friend was off somewhere taking his last breath. Amid all the clever gags and moments of laughter, this show still finds time to have a huge, beating heart in the center of it all, and Dan Harmon balances it all so, so well.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrush\"/></blockquote>\n\nEmily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V.

His parents finally agreed however when he made it clear that he would sign on under an assumed name and never write to them if they did not consent.<ref>Hill 2001, pp. 36&ndash;37.</ref> He gave a false date of birth to the recruiting officer, claiming to be 18, when he was actually 14 years and three months.<ref name=AWM/> His father had earlier tried to enlist but had been rejected as being too old.<ref>Hill 2001, p. 34.</ref> Martin joined the 1st Reinforcements of the [[21st Battalion (Australia)|21st Battalion]] as a [[Private (rank)|private]] and trained in [[Broadmeadows, Victoria|Broadmeadows]] and [[Seymour, Victoria|Seymour]] (later [[Puckapunyal]]) camps in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] before boarding [[HMAT Berrima|HMAT ''Berrima'']] in June 1915 to deploy to [[Egypt]],<ref name=AWM/> arriving there in late July.<ref>Hill 2001, p. 64.</ref>\n\nIn late August, following the failed [[Battle of Sari Bair|August Offensive]], he was sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] on the [[Steamboat|steamer]] [[HMT Southland|HMT ''Southland'']], to take part in the fighting against the Turks, which had by that time developed into a bloody stalemate.

Following a period of cold temperatures and heavy rain Martin contracted [[Typhoid fever|enteric fever]] in the trenches. After suffering mild symptoms for about a fortnight during which time he refused treatment,<ref>Hill 2001, p. 123.</ref> he was subsequently evacuated to the [[hospital ship]] {{ship|HMHS|Glenart Castle||2}} on 25 October 1915 after he developed diarrhoea.<ref name=AWM/> He died of heart failure that night, at the age of 14 and nine months, and was [[buried at sea]] the next day.

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

In his notes written at the time of the album's release, he mentions that he began work on \"I Can't Live in This World Anymore\" in December 1992, right after the completion of ''[[Mouth by Mouth]]''.  The project took so long for a few reasons: HNIA's 1993 tour in support of ''Mouth by Mouth''; the death of Defever's mother in 1994, which led his father to move to Florida, leaving the house to Defever and him living alone for the first time; and various other projects that were started but mostly left uncompleted.  The album finally saw release in July 1996 on [[4AD]], both by their native UK branch and their USA wing, which was distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] at the time.\n\nThis was the first album to feature [[Lovetta Pippen]], who became the band's primary vocalist in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  She sings as part of a gospel choir on the song \"Last One.\"\n\n==Concepts==\nWhile a deceptively simple and minimalist album at first glance, ''Stars on ESP'' is actually rich with detail.  The overarching concept is that the album is a pseudo-compilation of singles on the [[ESP-Disk]] label founded in 1966.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, ESP was noted for its roster of psychedelic, folk and progressive bands.  The label had its own identity, similar to the way [[4AD]] would develop its own identity in the 1980s.  On the album's sleeve, all the songs have the album's 4AD catalog number (CAD6010) with a number appended after it, as if each one was a single.  (For example, opener \"Dub Love Letter\" is labeled CAD6010.01, etc.)\n\nThe album also seems to allude to the old days of pop music, that once a song became popular, several different artists recorded their own version of the song.

In his notes written at the time of the album's release, he mentions that he began work on \"I Can't Live in This World Anymore\" in December 1992, right after the completion of ''[[Mouth by Mouth]]''.  The project took so long for a few reasons: HNIA's 1993 tour in support of ''Mouth by Mouth''; the death of Defever's mother in 1994, which led his father to move to Florida, leaving the house to Defever and him living alone for the first time; and various other projects that were started but mostly left uncompleted.  The album finally saw release in July 1996 on [[4AD]], both by their native UK branch and their USA wing, which was distributed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] at the time.\n\nThis was the first album to feature [[Lovetta Pippen]], who became the band's primary vocalist in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  She sings as part of a gospel choir on the song \"Last One.\"\n\n==Concepts==\nWhile a deceptively simple and minimalist album at first glance, ''Stars on ESP'' is actually rich with detail.  The overarching concept is that the album is a pseudo-compilation of singles on the [[ESP-Disk]] label founded in 1966.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, ESP was noted for its roster of psychedelic, folk and progressive bands.  The label had its own identity, similar to the way [[4AD]] would develop its own identity in the 1980s.  On the album's sleeve, all the songs have the album's 4AD catalog number (CAD6010) with a number appended after it, as if each one was a single.  (For example, opener \"Dub Love Letter\" is labeled CAD6010.01, etc.)\n\nThe album also seems to allude to the old days of pop music, that once a song became popular, several different artists recorded their own version of the song.  Therefore, tracks 2, 10, and 15 are all different versions of the same song.\n\nThe other main theme is Defever's memories of AM radio and being a youth in the 1970s, and the songs both reflect the sound of the decade's AM radio fare and are filled with memories of Michigan winters, summers and locations.  There are several musical interludes that give the impression of turning through a radio dial, including snippets of songs that later appear in full.\n\nPerhaps taking this fascination with past AM radio to its extreme, \"Universal Frequencies\" is highly reminiscent of [[The Beach Boys]]' \"[[Good Vibrations]]\".  In interviews, Defever has called the song a \"sequel\" to \"Good Vibrations\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gladstone|first1=Neil|title=His Name Is Alive|url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/082296/article024.shtml|accessdate=9 July 2014|publisher=City Paper|date=August 24, 1996|location=Philadelphia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924134947/http://www.citypaper.net/articles/082296/article024.shtml|archivedate=24 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs are written by Defever, credited as His Name Is Alive, except for: \"The Bees,\" co-written by Erika Hoffman; \"Universal Frequencies\" and \"The Sand That Holds The Lakes In Place,\" co-written by Matthew Smith; \"Across The Street,\" co-written by [[Mark Kozelek]]; and \"Movie,\" written by drummer Trey Many.\n# \"Dub Love Letter\"\n# \"This World Is Not My Home\"\n# \"Bad Luck Girl\"\n# \"What Are You Wearing Tomorrow\"\n# \"The Bees\"\n# \"What Else Is New List\"\n# \"Wall of Speed\"\n# \"Universal Frequencies\"\n# \"The Sand That Holds the Lakes in Place\"\n# \"I Can't Live in This World Anymore\"\n# \"Answer to Rainbow at Midnight\"\n# \"Famous Goodbye King\"\n# \"Across the Street\"\n# \"Movie\"\n# \"Last One\"\n#* 4AD's 1998 reissue contains the tracks from the 1997 [[Nice Day EP]]\n# \"Drive Around the Clock\"\n# \"Crashed Up on the Corner\"\n# \"Soul Resides in the Horse Barn\"\n# \"Whale You Ease My Mind\"\n# \"Oh Sinner Man\"\n\nFor the first time in His Name Is Alive's history, the 4AD UK release (CAD6010CD) and the American CD release were the same.
