When she returns to Tyson's old corner, she meets Darnell, Tyson's cousin and supplier, who tells her he's still alive. Bryant's wife, Gayle, rescinds a donation she made to Murphy's parents, driving a wedge between her and her mother Joy, who has given up trying to help her.

The man who struck Wesley identifies Jess as having witnessed his death to the police; Darnell and Max agree to help her by cleaning her car of Wesley's DNA, but worry that Jess' trauma and poor ability to lie will expose them. Felix assumes ownership of the school despite Joy refusing to sign on to the deal. Jess, feeling that Vanessa does not understand or appreciate her feelings, turns away from her. Darnell advises Jess to use emotional manipulation to throw off the cops, which allows her to pass questioning unscathed. When Vanessa fails to show up for a makeup date, however, she winds up cheating on her with a girl at the bar and decides to hide it. Joy, impressed with Felix's devotion to Guiding Hope, agrees to sign. When Murphy returns home, Jess passes information from Chelsea to her about Tyson's other killer. Felix informs Murphy that from now on, she'll be expected to work like everyone else. He also shows off a new watch--the same watch Wesley owned and that Murphy tried to dispose of.

Darnell refuses to cooperate with the police, and Jules leaves him. He decides to ask Nia for more responsibility, and asks Max to front the cash for a deal, unaware that he is, in fact, an informant. Max tips off his handler, Det. Barnes, to the deal, and is told to find out where it's taking place. Jess, overwhelmed with guilt, admits to cheating on Vanessa on the night of their seven-month anniversary.

Murphy pays for Chloe to get a full makeover, boosting her confidence enough that she manages to overcome her shyness and get Billy to talk to her.

The man who struck Wesley identifies Jess as having witnessed his death to the police; Darnell and Max agree to help her by cleaning her car of Wesley's DNA, but worry that Jess' trauma and poor ability to lie will expose them. Felix assumes ownership of the school despite Joy refusing to sign on to the deal. Jess, feeling that Vanessa does not understand or appreciate her feelings, turns away from her. Darnell advises Jess to use emotional manipulation to throw off the cops, which allows her to pass questioning unscathed. When Vanessa fails to show up for a makeup date, however, she winds up cheating on her with a girl at the bar and decides to hide it. Joy, impressed with Felix's devotion to Guiding Hope, agrees to sign. When Murphy returns home, Jess passes information from Chelsea to her about Tyson's other killer. Felix informs Murphy that from now on, she'll be expected to work like everyone else. He also shows off a new watch--the same watch Wesley owned and that Murphy tried to dispose of.

Darnell refuses to cooperate with the police, and Jules leaves him. He decides to ask Nia for more responsibility, and asks Max to front the cash for a deal, unaware that he is, in fact, an informant. Max tips off his handler, Det. Barnes, to the deal, and is told to find out where it's taking place. Jess, overwhelmed with guilt, admits to cheating on Vanessa on the night of their seven-month anniversary.

Many different kinds of vessels are used in [[Commercial fishing|commercial]], [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] and [[recreational fishing]].\n\nThe total number of fishing vessels in the world in 2016 was estimated to be about 4.6 million, unchanged from 2014. The fleet in Asia was the largest, consisting of 3.5 million vessels, accounting for 75 percent of the global fleet.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/3/ca0191en/ca0191en.pdf|title=In brief, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2018|last=|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> In Africa and North America the estimated number of vessels declined from 2014 by just over 30,000 and by nearly 5,000, respectively. For Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Oceania the numbers all increased, largely as a result of improvements in estimation procedures.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\">FAO 2007</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the number of [[Recreational boat fishing|recreational fishing boats]]. They range in size from small dinghies to large charter cruisers, and unlike commercial fishing vessels, are often not dedicated just to fishing.\n\nPrior to the 1950s there was little standardisation of fishing boats. Designs could vary between ports and boatyards. Traditionally boats were built of wood, but wood is not often used now because of higher maintenance costs and lower durability. Fibreglass is used increasingly in smaller fishing vessels up to 25 metres (100 tons), while steel is usually used on vessels above 25 metres.\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Traditional fishing boats===\n[[File:Gokstadskipet1.jpg|thumb|[[Gokstad ship|Viking boat]] showing clinker planking.]]\n{{Main|Traditional fishing boats}}\nEarly fishing vessels included [[raft]]s, [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoes]], and boats constructed from a frame covered with [[Hide (skin)|hide]] or [[tree bark]], along the lines of a [[coracle]].<ref name=\"McGrail431\">McGrail 2001, page 431</ref> The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are dugout canoes dating back to the [[Neolithic Period]] around 7,000-9,000 years ago.

They were used mainly for [[fishing]] and [[hunting]].\n\nThe development of fishing boats took place in parallel with the development of boats for trade and war. Early navigators began to use animal skins or woven fabrics for [[sail]]s. Affixed to a pole set upright in the boat, these sails gave early boats more range, allowing voyages of exploration.\n\nAround 4000 B.C., [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] were building long narrow boats powered by many oarsmen. Over the next 1,000 years, they made a series of remarkable advances in boat design. They developed cotton-made sails to help their boats go faster with less work. Then they built boats large enough to cross the oceans. These boats had sails and oarsmen, and were used for travel and trade. By [[30th century BC|3000 BC]], the Egyptians knew how to assemble [[wood plank|plank]]s of [[wood]] into a [[hull (ship)|ship hull]].<ref name=\"AIA\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Cheryl |date=May\u2013June 2001 |title=World's Oldest Planked Boats |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages= |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html |doi= }}</ref>  They used woven [[strap]]s to lash [[wood plank|plank]]s together,<ref name=\"AIA\" /> and [[Cyperus papyrus|reeds]] or [[grass]] stuffed between the planks to seal the seams.<ref name=\"AIA\"/> An example of their skill is the [[Khufu ship]], a vessel {{convert|143|ft|m}} in length entombed at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] around 2,500 BC and found intact in 1954.\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Scandinavia]]ns were also building innovative boats. People living near [[Kongens Lyngby]] in Denmark, came up with the idea of segregated hull compartments, which allowed the size of boats to gradually be increased. A crew of some two dozen [[paddle]]d the wooden [[Hjortspring boat]] across the [[Baltic Sea]] long before the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. Scandinavians continued to develop better ships, incorporating [[iron]] and other metal into the design and developing [[oars]] for propulsion.\n\nBy 1000 A.D. the [[Norsemen]] were pre-eminent on the oceans. They were skilled seamen and boat builders, with clinker-built boat designs that varied according to the type of boat. Trading boats, such as the [[knarr]]s, were wide to allow large cargo storage. Raiding boats, such as the [[longship]], were long and narrow and very fast. The vessels they used for fishing were scaled down versions of their cargo boats. The [[Scandinavia]]n innovations influenced fishing boat design long after the Viking period came to an end. For example, [[yole]]s from the Orkney [[Island of Stroma]] were built in the same way as the Norse boats.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Early modern designs===\n[[File:Groenewegen.D3.Buis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herring Buss]] taking aboard its drift net (G. Groenewegen).]]\nIn the 15th century, the Dutch developed a type of seagoing [[herring]] [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]] that became a blueprint for European fishing boats. This was the [[Herring Buss]], used by Dutch herring fishermen until the early 19th centuries. The ship type [[Herring buss|buss]] has a long history. It was known around 1000 AD in Scandinavia as a ''b\u01d8za'', a robust variant of the Viking longship. The first herring buss was probably built in [[Hoorn]] around 1415. The ship was about 20 metres long and displaced between 60 and 100 tons. It was a massive round-[[bilge]]d [[keel]] ship with a bluff [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]], the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The busses used long drifting [[gill net]]s to catch the herring. The nets would be retrieved at night and the crews of eighteen to thirty men<ref name=\"De Vries\">De Vries & Woude (1977), pages 244\u2013245</ref> would set to [[gibbing]], salting and barrelling the catch on the broad deck.\n\n[[File:Dogger (boat).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]] viewed from before the port beam. c. 1675 by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]].]]\nDuring the 17th century, the British developed the [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]], an early type of sailing [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] or [[Longline fishing|longliner]], which commonly operated in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=\"OCSS\">Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 256</ref> Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.<ref name=\"Fagan\">Fagan 2008</ref> Like the herring buss, they were wide-beamed and bluff-bowed, but considerably smaller, about 15 metres long, a maximum beam of 4.5 metres, a draught of 1.5 metres, and displacing about 13 tonnes. They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of fish.<ref name=\"Fagan\"/> Decked areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 metres deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore.<ref name=\"Fagan\"/>\n\nA precursor to the [[dory]] type was the early [[France|French]] [[bateau]] type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\"Gardner18\">Gardner 1987, page 18</ref> The common coastal boat of the time was the [[wherry]] and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified flat bottom of the bateau resulted in the birth of the dory. England, France, Italy, and Belgium have small boats from medieval periods that could reasonably be construed as predecessors of the Dory.<ref name=\"Gardner15\">Gardner 1987, page 15</ref>\n\n[[Dory|Dories]] appeared in [[New England]] fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century.<ref name=\"Chapelle85\">Chapelle, page 85</ref> They were small, shallow-[[draft (hull)|draft]] [[boat]]s, usually about five to seven metres (15 to 22&nbsp;feet) long. Lightweight and versatile, with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows, they were easy and cheap to build. The [[Banks dory|Banks dories]] appeared in the 1830s. They were designed to be carried on [[mother ship]]s and used for fishing [[cod]] at the [[Grand Banks]].<ref name=\"Chapelle85\" />  Adapted almost directly from the low freeboard, French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, such as the ''[[Gazela|Gazela Primeiro]]'', for their trip to the Grand Banks fishing grounds.\n\n===Modern fishing trawler===\n{{main|Fishing trawler}}\n[[File:A Brixham trawler.jpg|thumb|Painting of ''A Brixham trawler'' by [[William Adolphus Knell]]. The painting is now in the [[National Maritime Museum]].]]\nThe British [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]] was an early type of sailing trawler from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of [[Brixham]].\n\nBy the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the [[overfishing|overfished]] waters of [[South Devon]]. The [[Brixham trawler]] that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall [[gaff rig]], which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.\n\nThis revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Grimsby]], [[Harwich]] and [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nThe small village of [[Grimsby]] grew to become the largest fishing port in the world by the mid 19th century.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-20330148 Grimsby heyday of the 'three-day millionaire'] ''BBC'', 15 November 2012</ref><ref name=\"lochist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/grimsby.html |title=A brief history of Grimsby |publisher=localhistories.org}}</ref> With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the [[Grimsby Docks|Grimsby Dock Company]] was formed in 1846. The dock covered {{convert|25|acre|ha}} and was formally opened by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time - the dock gates and cranes were operated by [[hydraulic power network|hydraulic power]], and the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Grimsby Dock Tower]] was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk-genealogy.org.uk/england/Lincolnshire/towns/GreatGrimsby.html |title=Great Grimsby |publisher=UK Genealogy Archives}}</ref>\n\nThe elegant [[Brixham trawler]] spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. Their distinctive sails inspired the song [[Red Sails in the Sunset (song)|Red Sails in the Sunset]], written aboard a Brixham sailing trawler called the ''[[Torbay]] Lass''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kjappeal.org/history.html |title=History of a Brixham trawler |date=2 March 2009 |publisher=JKappeal.org |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202015738/http://kjappeal.org/history.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/112001/27/brixham_trawler.shtml |title=Pilgrim's restoration under full sail |author= |date= |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref> By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sailing trawlers|url=http://issuu.com/tobyrussell/docs/brixham_sailing_trawlers}}</ref>\n\nAlthough fishing vessel designed increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led the development of different types of fishing boats. The [[Lancashire nobby]] was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The [[Manx nobby]] was used around the [[Isle of Man]] as a herring drifter. The [[fifie]] was also used as a herring drifter along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century.\n\n====Advent of steam power====\nThe earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the [[trawl]] system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets.  These were large boats, usually {{convert|80|-|90|ft}} in length with a beam of around {{convert|20|ft}}. They weighed 40-50 tons and travelled at {{convert|9|-|11|kn}}.\n\nThe earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in [[Leith]] in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first [[screw propeller|screw propelled]] [[steamship|steam trawler]] in the world. This vessel was ''Pioneer LH854''. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. ''Pioneer'' is mentioned in ''[[The Shetland Times]]'' of 4 May 1877. In 1878 he completed ''Forward'' and ''Onward'', steam-powered trawlers for sale. Allan built a total of ten boats at [[Leith]] between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]], his last vessel being ''Degrave'' in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, [[Belgium]], [[Spain]] and the [[West Indies]].<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\">{{cite web|url=http://grantontrawlers.com/steam%20trawler.html|title=The Steam Trawler}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seine Net Trawler Hopeman 1958 - geograph.org.uk - 84412.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seine fishing|Seine Net Trawler]], [[Hopeman]] 1958.]]\nThe first [[steam boat]]s were made of wood, but [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s were soon introduced and were divided into [[watertight]] compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] and the [[deckhouse]]. The boats built in the 20th century only had a [[mizzen]] [[sail]], which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a [[crane (machine)|crane]] for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] on the [[foredeck]] near the mast for hauling [[fishing net|net]]s. The boats had narrow, high [[funnel]]s so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck and away from the fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed ''woodbines'' because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a [[skipper (boating)|skipper]], driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\"/>\n\n===== Steam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|longer}} than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from [[weather]], wind and [[tide]]. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch. The main disadvantage of the steam boats, though, was their high operating costs. Their engines were mechanically inefficient and took up much space, while fuel and fitting out costs were very high.  Before the [[First World War|World War I]], building costs were between 3,000 and \u00a34,000, at least three times the cost of the sail boats. To cover these high costs, they needed to fish for longer seasons. The higher expenses meant that more steam drifters were company-owned or jointly owned. As the herring fishing industry declined, steam boats became too expensive.<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\" /> =====\nSteam trawlers were introduced at [[Grimsby]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.\n\n====Further development====\n[[File:HNoMS Honningsv\u00e5g.jpg|thumb|right|Armed trawler {{HNoMS|Honningsv\u00e5g}} off [[Iceland]].]]\nTrawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by [[World War I]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[turbines]] by the end of [[World War II]].\n\nThe first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the [[stern]]. In 1947, the company [[Christian Salvesen]], based in [[Leith]], Scotland, refitted a surplus [[Algerine-class minesweeper|''Algerine''-class minesweeper]] (HMS ''Felicity'') with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|title=HISTORY|access-date=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821172332/http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|archive-date=2013-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first purpose built stern trawler was ''Fairtry'' built in 1953 at [[Aberdeen]]. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. ''Lord Nelson'' followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the [[Torry Research Station]]. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\"/>\n\nIn recent decades, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as [[radio navigation aid]]s and [[Fishfinder|fish finders]]. During the [[Cold War]], some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as [[spy ship]]s to monitor the activities of other countries.\n\n== Global trends ==\nGlobally, the number of engine-powered vessels was estimated to be 2.8 million in 2016, this represents 61 percent of all fishing vessels, down from 64 percent in 2014, as the number of non-motorized vessels increased, probably because of improved estimations.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2016, about 86 percent of the motorized fishing vessels in the world were in the length overall (LOA) class of less than 12 m, the vast majority of which were undecked, and those small vessels dominated in all regions. Conversely, the largest vessels, classified as those with LOA greater than 24 m made up about 2 percent of the total fleet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAbout 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and  40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the [[Deck (ship)|undecked]] boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\" /> These boats are used by [[Artisan fishing|artisan fishers]].\n\n== Commercial vessels ==\n[[File:Deutsche Fischfang Union Schiff Kiel 01.jpg|thumb|right|The German [[factory ship]] ''Kiel NC 105'']]\nThe [[Exclusive economic zone|200-mile fishing limit]] has changed fishing patterns and, in recent times, fishing boats are becoming more specialised and standardised. In the United States and Canada more use is made of large [[Factory ship|factory trawlers]], while the huge blue water fleets operated by Japan and the Soviet-bloc countries have contracted. In western Europe, fishing vessel design is focused on compact boats with high catching power.\n\n[[Commercial fishing]] is a high risk industry, and countries are introducing regulations governing the construction and operation of fishing vessels. The [[International Maritime Organization]], convened in 1959 by the [[United Nations]], is responsible for devising measures aimed at the prevention of accidents, including standards for ship design, construction, equipment, operation and manning.\n\nAccording to the [[FAO]], in 2004 the world's fishing fleet consisted of 4 million vessels. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas. The rest were open vessels, of which two-thirds were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> By contrast, nearly all decked vessels were mechanized. Of the decked vessels, 86 percent are found in Asia, 7.8 percent in Europe, 3.8 percent in North and Central America, 1.3 percent in Africa, 0.6 percent in South America and 0.4 percent in Oceania.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> Most commercial fishing boats are small, usually less than {{convert|30|m|ft}} but up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} for a large [[purse seiner]] or [[factory ship]].\n\nCommercial fishing vessels can be classified by architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The following classification follows the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/search/en |title=Technology Fact Sheets: Fishing Vessel type |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[FAO]] |accessdate=}}</ref> who classify commercial fishing vessels by the gear they use.\n\n===Fishing gear===\n<gallery>\nFile:Irish fishing boat.jpg|Drum winches mounted at the stern of an Irish  trawler\nImage:Puretic Block.jpg|[[Puretic power block]]\n\n\n\n===Trawlers===\n[[File:Drawing of a large trawler.gif|right]]\n{{main|Fishing trawler}}\nA [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] is a fishing vessel designed to use [[trawl]] nets in order to catch large volumes of fish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/10/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trawlers |author= |date= |website= |publisher= FAO|accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n* [[Fishing trawler#Outrigger trawlers|Outrigger trawlers]] \u2013 use outriggers to tow the trawl.

The seiner circles the shoal with a deep curtain of netting, possibly using [[bow thruster]]s for better manoeuvrability. Then the bottom of the net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The most important part of the fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]]; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net.

These dredges are towed in a manner similar to beam trawlers, and large dredgers can work three or more dredges on each side.  (b) Heavy mechanical dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. Dredgers don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/440/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Dredgers |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7988 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Drawing of a gill netter.gif|thumb|right]]\n[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|right|Lobster fishing boats]]\n[[File:French Fishing Vessel 'Alf' in the Irish Sea MOD 45155246.jpg|thumb|Fishing boat in a heavy sea]]\n[[File:RV Celtic Explorer, Galway Bay, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|The fisheries research vessel RV ''Celtic Explorer'']]\n\n* Gillnetters \u2013 On inland waters and inshore, [[gillnet]]s can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which can have their wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the [[high seas]], medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifters]], and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is more a matter of the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/200/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Gillnetters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7943 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Set netters \u2013 also operate gillnets. However, during fishing operations the vessel is not attached to the nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the [[high seas]]. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/1000/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Set netters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* Lift netters \u2013 are equipped to operate lift nets, which are held from the vessel's side and raised and lowered by means of outriggers. Lift netters range from open boats about 10 metres long to larger vessels with open ocean capability. Decked vessels usually have the bridge amidships. Larger vessels are often equipped with winches and derricks for handling the lifting lines, as well as outriggers and light booms. They can be fitted with powerful lights to attract and aggregate the fish to the surface. Open boats are usually unmechanized or use hand-operated winches. Electronic equipment, such as [[fishfinder]]s, [[sonar]] and [[echo sounder]]s are used extensively on larger boats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/480/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Lift netters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7994 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Fish traps|Trap setters]] \u2013 are used to set [[Lobster trap|pots]] or [[Fish trap|traps]] for catching fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters range in size from open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/230/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trap setters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Handline fishing|Handliners]] \u2013 are normally undecked vessels used for handlining (fishing with a [[Fishing line|line]] and [[Fishing hook|hook]]). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres [[o/a]], and do not have special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of special electronic equipment. Non traditional handliners can set and haul using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels are normally fastened to the [[gunwale]] or set on [[stanchion]]s close to or overhanging the gunwale. They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/340/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Handliners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* Multipurpose vessels \u2013 are vessels which are designed so they can deploy more than one type of fishing gear without major modifications to the vessels. The fish detection equipment present on board also changes according to which fishing gear is being used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/380/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Multipurpose vessels |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Trawler/Purse seiners \u2013 are designed so the deck arrangement and equipment, including a suitable combination winch, can be used for both methods. Rollers, blocks, trawl gallows and purse davits need to be arranged so they control the lead of warps and pursing lines in such a way as to reduce the time needed to convert from one type to the other. Typical fish detection equipment includes a sonar and an echosounder. These vessels are usually designed as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/400/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trawler-purse seiners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Research vessel]]s \u2013 a [[Fisheries science|fisheries research]] vessel (FRV) requires platforms which are capable of towing different types of [[fishing net]]s, collecting [[plankton]] or water samples from a range of depths, and carrying [[Sonar|acoustic]] fish-finding equipment. Fisheries research vessels are often designed and built along the same lines as a large fishing vessel, but with space given over to [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and equipment storage, as opposed to storage of the catch. An example of a fisheries research vessel is [[Fisheries Research Services|FRV ''Scotia'']].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Artisan vessels==\n{{Main|Traditional fishing boats}}\n[[Artisan fishing]] is small-scale [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] fishing, particularly practices involving coastal or island ethnic groups using traditional [[fishing techniques]] and traditional boats. This may also include heritage groups involved in customary fishing practices.\n\nAccording to the [[FAO]], at the end of 2004, the world fishing fleet consisted of about 4 million vessels, of which 2.7 million were undecked (open) boats. While nearly  all decked vessels were mechanized, only one-third of the undecked fishing boats were powered, usually with outboard engines. The remaining 1.8 million boats were traditional craft of various types, operated by sail and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/>\n\nThese figures for small fishing vessels are probably under reported. The [[FAO]] compiles these figures largely from national registers. These records often omit smaller boats where registration is not required or where fishing licences are granted by provincial or municipal authorities.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fisherman Seychelles.jpg|Fisherman landing his catch in the [[Seychelles]].\nFile:Catamaran india.jpg|Indian split-log fishing canoe\nFile:Gambian fishing boats.jpg|Fishing boats in Gambia.\nFile:Vietnamese fishing boat 05.jpg|Traditional Vietnamese fishing boat\nFile:First known photo of Koreans 1871.jpg|Fishing junk, 1871\n</gallery>\n\nArtisan fishing boats are usually small [[traditional fishing boats]], appropriately designed for use on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities around the world have developed their own traditional types of fishing boats, adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the [[Fishery|fisheries]] and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan fishing boats are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, [[Indonesia]] has reported about 700,000 fishing boats, 25 percent of which are [[dugout canoe]]s, and half of which are without motors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_ID |title=Country Profile: Indonesia |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref> The [[Philippines]] have reported a similar number of small fishing boats. Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as ''[[jukung]]'' in Indonesia and ''banca'' in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_PH |title=Country Profile: Philippines |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:ManamocBoats.JPG|A small [[Philippine]] ''[[basnigan]]'' with the characteristic poles used for anchoring nets and holding gas-powered lamps for attracting fish\nFile:Madagascar - Traditional fishing pirogue.jpg|Traditional fishing ''[[lakana]]'' with a [[crab claw sail]] from [[Madagascar]]\nFile:Jangada-Tibau.jpg|The elegant ''[[jangada]]'' on the coast off [[Mossor\u00f3]] in Brazil\nFile:Jantar.jpg|Indian [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]] fishing boats\nFile:Baleteshore.JPG|Traditional Philippine fishing [[outrigger canoe]]s (''bangka'')\n</gallery>\n\n==Recreational vessels==\n{{see also|Recreational boat fishing}}\n[[File:Drawing of a sport fishing boat.gif|left]]\nRecreational fishing is done for pleasure or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a [[Fisherman|fisher]] periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Usually some form of [[fishing tackle]] is brought on board, such as [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]] or [[Fishing nets|nets]]. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from [[dugout canoe]]s, [[kayaks]], [[raft]]s, [[pontoon boat]]s and small [[Dinghy|dinghies]] to [[Runabout (boat)|runabouts]], [[cabin cruiser]]s and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious [[Big-game fishing|big game]] rigs.<ref>[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/speciesid/fish_page/fish51a.html Sport fishing boat]</ref> Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open [[Cockpit (sailing)|cockpit]]s at the [[stern]], designed for convenient fishing.\n\n[[Big game fishing]] started as a sport after the invention of the motorized boat. [[Charles Frederick Holder]], a [[marine biologist]] and early conservationist, is credited with founding the sport in 1898.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boot.de/cipp/md_boot/custom/pub/content,lang,2/oid,8067/ticket,g_u_e_s_t |title=The history of game fishing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Boot.de |accessdate= }}</ref> Purpose built game fishing boats appeared shortly after. An example is the ''Crete'', in use at Catalina Island, [[California]], in 1915, and shipped to [[Hawaii]] the following year. According to a newspaper report at that time, the  ''Crete'' had \"a deep cockpit, a chair fitted for landing big fish and leather pockets for placing the pole.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/krauss/Pages/viewtext.php?s=browse&tid=21108&doctype=28&route=browseby.php&start=9136&by=doctype&view=list&s=browse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719210836/http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/krauss/Pages/viewtext.php?s=browse&tid=21108&doctype=28&route=browseby.php&start=9136&by=doctype&view=list&s=browse |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 July 2011 |title=First game fishing boat arrives in Hawaii |date=13 March 1916 |publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] }}</ref>\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing.\n\n[[File:bassboat1.jpg|thumb|right|Standard aluminum [[bass boat]], with [[trolling motor]]]]\n* [[Kayak fishing|Fishing kayaks]] have gained popularity in recent years. The [[kayak]] has long been a means of accessing fishing grounds.\n* [[Pontoon boat]]s have also become popular in recent years. These boats allow one or two fishermen to get into small rivers or lakes that would have difficulty accommodating larger boats. Typically 8\u201312&nbsp;ft in length, these inflatable craft can be assembled quickly and easily. Some feature rigid frames derived from the [[white water rafting]] industry.\n* [[Bass boat]]s are small aluminium or fibreglass boats used in lakes and rivers in the U.S. for fishing [[bass fishing|bass]] and other [[panfish]]. They have swivel chairs for the anglers, storage bins for fishing tackle, and a tank with recirculating water for caught fish. They are usually fitted with an [[outboard motor]] and a [[trolling motor]].\n* Charter boats are often privately operated, purpose-built fishing boats, and host fishing trips for paying clients. Their size can range widely depending on the type of trips run and the geographical location.\n* Freshwater fishing boats account for approximately one third of all registered boats in the USA. Most other types of boats end up being used for fishing on occasion.\n* Saltwater fishing boats vary widely in size and can be specialized for certain species of fish. Flounder boats, for example, have flat bottoms for a shallow draft and are used in protected, shallow waters. Sport fishing boats range from 25 to 80 feet or more, and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Boats used for fishing in cold climates may have space dedicated to a [[cuddy cabin]] or enclosed wheelhouse, while boats in warmer climates are more likely to be open.\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flyfishing - Winslow Homer.jpg|[[Fly fishing]] from a [[dinghy]]\nFile:Saint-Cassien pecheur.jpg|[[Angling]] from a small [[Inflatable boat|inflatable]] on [[Saint-Cassien, Dordogne|Saint-Cassien's]] lake, [[France]]\nFile:Small sport fishing boat.jpg|Small sport fishing boat\nFile:Coming in...two blues!

They range in size from small dinghies to large charter cruisers, and unlike commercial fishing vessels, are often not dedicated just to fishing.\n\nPrior to the 1950s there was little standardisation of fishing boats. Designs could vary between ports and boatyards. Traditionally boats were built of wood, but wood is not often used now because of higher maintenance costs and lower durability. Fibreglass is used increasingly in smaller fishing vessels up to 25 metres (100 tons), while steel is usually used on vessels above 25 metres.\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n== History ==\n\n===Traditional fishing boats===\n[[File:Gokstadskipet1.jpg|thumb|[[Gokstad ship|Viking boat]] showing clinker planking.]]\n{{Main|Traditional fishing boats}}\nEarly fishing vessels included [[raft]]s, [[Dugout (boat)|dugout canoes]], and boats constructed from a frame covered with [[Hide (skin)|hide]] or [[tree bark]], along the lines of a [[coracle]].<ref name=\"McGrail431\">McGrail 2001, page 431</ref> The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are dugout canoes dating back to the [[Neolithic Period]] around 7,000-9,000 years ago.

They were used mainly for [[fishing]] and [[hunting]].\n\nThe development of fishing boats took place in parallel with the development of boats for trade and war. Early navigators began to use animal skins or woven fabrics for [[sail]]s. Affixed to a pole set upright in the boat, these sails gave early boats more range, allowing voyages of exploration.\n\nAround 4000 B.C., [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] were building long narrow boats powered by many oarsmen. Over the next 1,000 years, they made a series of remarkable advances in boat design. They developed cotton-made sails to help their boats go faster with less work. Then they built boats large enough to cross the oceans. These boats had sails and oarsmen, and were used for travel and trade. By [[30th century BC|3000 BC]], the Egyptians knew how to assemble [[wood plank|plank]]s of [[wood]] into a [[hull (ship)|ship hull]].<ref name=\"AIA\">\n{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=Cheryl |date=May\u2013June 2001 |title=World's Oldest Planked Boats |journal=[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]] |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages= |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0105/abstracts/abydos3.html |doi= }}</ref>  They used woven [[strap]]s to lash [[wood plank|plank]]s together,<ref name=\"AIA\" /> and [[Cyperus papyrus|reeds]] or [[grass]] stuffed between the planks to seal the seams.<ref name=\"AIA\"/> An example of their skill is the [[Khufu ship]], a vessel {{convert|143|ft|m}} in length entombed at the foot of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] around 2,500 BC and found intact in 1954.\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Scandinavia]]ns were also building innovative boats. People living near [[Kongens Lyngby]] in Denmark, came up with the idea of segregated hull compartments, which allowed the size of boats to gradually be increased. A crew of some two dozen [[paddle]]d the wooden [[Hjortspring boat]] across the [[Baltic Sea]] long before the rise of the [[Roman Empire]]. Scandinavians continued to develop better ships, incorporating [[iron]] and other metal into the design and developing [[oars]] for propulsion.\n\nBy 1000 A.D. the [[Norsemen]] were pre-eminent on the oceans. They were skilled seamen and boat builders, with clinker-built boat designs that varied according to the type of boat. Trading boats, such as the [[knarr]]s, were wide to allow large cargo storage. Raiding boats, such as the [[longship]], were long and narrow and very fast. The vessels they used for fishing were scaled down versions of their cargo boats. The [[Scandinavia]]n innovations influenced fishing boat design long after the Viking period came to an end. For example, [[yole]]s from the Orkney [[Island of Stroma]] were built in the same way as the Norse boats.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Early modern designs===\n[[File:Groenewegen.D3.Buis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Herring Buss]] taking aboard its drift net (G. Groenewegen).]]\nIn the 15th century, the Dutch developed a type of seagoing [[herring]] [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]] that became a blueprint for European fishing boats. This was the [[Herring Buss]], used by Dutch herring fishermen until the early 19th centuries. The ship type [[Herring buss|buss]] has a long history. It was known around 1000 AD in Scandinavia as a ''b\u01d8za'', a robust variant of the Viking longship. The first herring buss was probably built in [[Hoorn]] around 1415. The ship was about 20 metres long and displaced between 60 and 100 tons. It was a massive round-[[bilge]]d [[keel]] ship with a bluff [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[stern]], the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The busses used long drifting [[gill net]]s to catch the herring. The nets would be retrieved at night and the crews of eighteen to thirty men<ref name=\"De Vries\">De Vries & Woude (1977), pages 244\u2013245</ref> would set to [[gibbing]], salting and barrelling the catch on the broad deck.\n\n[[File:Dogger (boat).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]] viewed from before the port beam. c. 1675 by [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]].]]\nDuring the 17th century, the British developed the [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]], an early type of sailing [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] or [[Longline fishing|longliner]], which commonly operated in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=\"OCSS\">Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 256</ref> Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.<ref name=\"Fagan\">Fagan 2008</ref> Like the herring buss, they were wide-beamed and bluff-bowed, but considerably smaller, about 15 metres long, a maximum beam of 4.5 metres, a draught of 1.5 metres, and displacing about 13 tonnes. They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of fish.<ref name=\"Fagan\"/> Decked areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 metres deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore.<ref name=\"Fagan\"/>\n\nA precursor to the [[dory]] type was the early [[France|French]] [[bateau]] type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\"Gardner18\">Gardner 1987, page 18</ref> The common coastal boat of the time was the [[wherry]] and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified flat bottom of the bateau resulted in the birth of the dory. England, France, Italy, and Belgium have small boats from medieval periods that could reasonably be construed as predecessors of the Dory.<ref name=\"Gardner15\">Gardner 1987, page 15</ref>\n\n[[Dory|Dories]] appeared in [[New England]] fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century.<ref name=\"Chapelle85\">Chapelle, page 85</ref> They were small, shallow-[[draft (hull)|draft]] [[boat]]s, usually about five to seven metres (15 to 22&nbsp;feet) long. Lightweight and versatile, with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows, they were easy and cheap to build. The [[Banks dory|Banks dories]] appeared in the 1830s. They were designed to be carried on [[mother ship]]s and used for fishing [[cod]] at the [[Grand Banks]].<ref name=\"Chapelle85\" />  Adapted almost directly from the low freeboard, French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, such as the ''[[Gazela|Gazela Primeiro]]'', for their trip to the Grand Banks fishing grounds.\n\n===Modern fishing trawler===\n{{main|Fishing trawler}}\n[[File:A Brixham trawler.jpg|thumb|Painting of ''A Brixham trawler'' by [[William Adolphus Knell]]. The painting is now in the [[National Maritime Museum]].]]\nThe British [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]] was an early type of sailing trawler from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of [[Brixham]].\n\nBy the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the [[overfishing|overfished]] waters of [[South Devon]]. The [[Brixham trawler]] that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall [[gaff rig]], which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.\n\nThis revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Grimsby]], [[Harwich]] and [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nThe small village of [[Grimsby]] grew to become the largest fishing port in the world by the mid 19th century.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-humber-20330148 Grimsby heyday of the 'three-day millionaire'] ''BBC'', 15 November 2012</ref><ref name=lochist>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/grimsby.html |title=A brief history of Grimsby |publisher=localhistories.org}}</ref> With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the [[Grimsby Docks|Grimsby Dock Company]] was formed in 1846. The dock covered {{convert|25|acre|ha}} and was formally opened by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time - the dock gates and cranes were operated by [[hydraulic power network|hydraulic power]], and the {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Grimsby Dock Tower]] was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk-genealogy.org.uk/england/Lincolnshire/towns/GreatGrimsby.html |title=Great Grimsby |publisher=UK Genealogy Archives}}</ref>\n\nThe elegant [[Brixham trawler]] spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. Their distinctive sails inspired the song [[Red Sails in the Sunset (song)|Red Sails in the Sunset]], written aboard a Brixham sailing trawler called the ''[[Torbay]] Lass''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kjappeal.org/history.html |title=History of a Brixham trawler |date=2 March 2009 |publisher=JKappeal.org |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202015738/http://kjappeal.org/history.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/112001/27/brixham_trawler.shtml |title=Pilgrim's restoration under full sail |author= |date= |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref> By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]]. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sailing trawlers|url=http://issuu.com/tobyrussell/docs/brixham_sailing_trawlers}}</ref>\n\nAlthough fishing vessel designed increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led the development of different types of fishing boats. The [[Lancashire nobby]] was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The [[Manx nobby]] was used around the [[Isle of Man]] as a herring drifter. The [[fifie]] was also used as a herring drifter along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century.\n\n====Advent of steam power====\nThe earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the [[trawl]] system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets.  These were large boats, usually {{convert|80|-|90|ft}} in length with a beam of around {{convert|20|ft}}. They weighed 40-50 tons and travelled at {{convert|9|-|11|kn}}.\n\nThe earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in [[Leith]] in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first [[screw propeller|screw propelled]] [[steamship|steam trawler]] in the world. This vessel was ''Pioneer LH854''. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. ''Pioneer'' is mentioned in ''[[The Shetland Times]]'' of 4 May 1877. In 1878 he completed ''Forward'' and ''Onward'', steam-powered trawlers for sale. Allan built a total of ten boats at [[Leith]] between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]], his last vessel being ''Degrave'' in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]] and the [[West Indies]].<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\">{{cite web|url=http://grantontrawlers.com/steam%20trawler.html|title=The Steam Trawler}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seine Net Trawler Hopeman 1958 - geograph.org.uk - 84412.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seine fishing|Seine Net Trawler]], [[Hopeman]] 1958.]]\nThe first [[steam boat]]s were made of wood, but [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s were soon introduced and were divided into [[watertight]] compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the [[Bridge (nautical)|wheelhouse]] and the [[deckhouse]]. The boats built in the 20th century only had a [[mizzen]] [[sail]], which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a [[crane (machine)|crane]] for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] on the [[foredeck]] near the mast for hauling [[fishing net|net]]s. The boats had narrow, high [[funnel]]s so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck and away from the fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed ''woodbines'' because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a [[skipper (boating)|skipper]], driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\"/>\n\nSteam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|longer}} than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from [[weather]], wind and [[tide]]. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch. The main disadvantage of the steam boats, though, was their high operating costs. Their engines were mechanically inefficient and took up much space, while fuel and fitting out costs were very high.  Before the [[First World War]], building costs were between \u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000, at least three times the cost of the sail boats. To cover these high costs, they needed to fish for longer seasons. The higher expenses meant that more steam drifters were company-owned or jointly owned. As the herring fishing industry declined, steam boats became too expensive.<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\"/>\n\nSteam trawlers were introduced at [[Grimsby]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.\n\n====Further development====\n[[File:HNoMS Honningsv\u00e5g.jpg|thumb|right|Armed trawler {{HNoMS|Honningsv\u00e5g}} off [[Iceland]].]]\nTrawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by [[World War I]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[turbines]] by the end of [[World War II]].\n\nThe first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the [[stern]]. In 1947, the company [[Christian Salvesen]], based in [[Leith]], Scotland, refitted a surplus [[Algerine-class minesweeper|''Algerine''-class minesweeper]] (HMS ''Felicity'') with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|title=HISTORY|access-date=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821172332/http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|archive-date=2013-08-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe first purpose built stern trawler was ''Fairtry'' built in 1953 at [[Aberdeen]]. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. ''Lord Nelson'' followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the [[Torry Research Station]]. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\"/>\n\nIn recent decades, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as [[radio navigation aid]]s and [[Fishfinder|fish finders]]. During the [[Cold War]], some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as [[spy ship]]s to monitor the activities of other countries.\n\n== Global trends ==\nGlobally, the number of engine-powered vessels was estimated to be 2.8 million in 2016, this represents 61 percent of all fishing vessels, down from 64 percent in 2014, as the number of non-motorized vessels increased, probably because of improved estimations.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2016, about 86 percent of the motorized fishing vessels in the world were in the length overall (LOA) class of less than 12 m, the vast majority of which were undecked, and those small vessels dominated in all regions. Conversely, the largest vessels, classified as those with LOA greater than 24 m made up about 2 percent of the total fleet.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAbout 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and  40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the [[Deck (ship)|undecked]] boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\" /> These boats are used by [[Artisan fishing|artisan fishers]].\n\n== Commercial vessels ==\n[[File:Deutsche Fischfang Union Schiff Kiel 01.jpg|thumb|right|The German [[factory ship]] ''Kiel NC 105'']]\nThe [[Exclusive economic zone|200-mile fishing limit]] has changed fishing patterns and, in recent times, fishing boats are becoming more specialised and standardised. In the United States and Canada more use is made of large [[Factory ship|factory trawlers]], while the huge blue water fleets operated by Japan and the Soviet-bloc countries have contracted. In western Europe, fishing vessel design is focused on compact boats with high catching power.\n\n[[Commercial fishing]] is a high risk industry, and countries are introducing regulations governing the construction and operation of fishing vessels. The [[International Maritime Organization]], convened in 1959 by the [[United Nations]], is responsible for devising measures aimed at the prevention of accidents, including standards for ship design, construction, equipment, operation and manning.\n\nAccording to the [[FAO]], in 2004 the world's fishing fleet consisted of 4 million vessels. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas. The rest were open vessels, of which two-thirds were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> By contrast, nearly all decked vessels were mechanized. Of the decked vessels, 86 percent are found in Asia, 7.8 percent in Europe, 3.8 percent in North and Central America, 1.3 percent in Africa, 0.6 percent in South America and 0.4 percent in Oceania.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> Most commercial fishing boats are small, usually less than {{convert|30|m|ft}} but up to {{convert|100|m|ft}} for a large [[purse seiner]] or [[factory ship]].\n\nCommercial fishing vessels can be classified by architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The following classification follows the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/search/en |title=Technology Fact Sheets: Fishing Vessel type |author= |date= |website= |publisher=[[FAO]] |accessdate=}}</ref> who classify commercial fishing vessels by the gear they use.\n\n===Fishing gear===\n<gallery>\nFile:Irish fishing boat.jpg|Drum winches mounted at the stern of an Irish  trawler\nImage:Puretic Block.jpg|[[Puretic power block]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Trawlers===\n[[File:Drawing of a large trawler.gif|right]]\n{{main|Fishing trawler}}\nA [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] is a fishing vessel designed to use [[trawl]] nets in order to catch large volumes of fish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/10/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trawlers |author= |date= |website= |publisher= FAO|accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n* [[Fishing trawler#Outrigger trawlers|Outrigger trawlers]] \u2013 use outriggers to tow the trawl. These are commonly used to catch [[shrimp]]. One or two otter trawls can be towed from each side. Beam trawlers, employed in the North sea for catching flatfish, are another form of outrigger trawler. Medium-sized and high powered vessels, these tow a beam trawl on each side at speeds up to 8 knots.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/90/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Outrigger trawlers |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7867 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** [[Fishing trawler#Beam trawlers|Beam trawlers]] \u2013 use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp on each side.

They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/120/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Beam trawlers |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=8032 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Otter trawler]]s \u2013 deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using [[Beam trawling|otter boards]].

The seiner circles the shoal with a deep curtain of netting, possibly using [[bow thruster]]s for better manoeuvrability. Then the bottom of the net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The most important part of the fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]]; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks.

Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines  handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as [[tuna]]. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid [[incidental catch]]es of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/260/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Longliners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7957 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Bottom longliners \u2013 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/970/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Bottom longliners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Midwater longliners \u2013 are usually medium-sized vessels which operate worldwide, purpose built to catch large [[pelagic]]s. The line hauler is usually forward starboard, where the fish are hauled through a gate in the rail. The lines are set from the stern where a baiting table and chute are located. These boats need adequate speed to reach distant fishing grounds, enough endurance for continued fishing, adequate freezing storage, suitable mechanisms for shooting and hauling longlines quickly, and proper storage for fishing gears and accessories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/990/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Midwater longliners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Freezer longliners \u2013 are outfitted with freezing equipment.

The fish is stored in boxes and covered with ice, or stored with ice in the fish hold.

The fishers stand at the railing or on special platforms and fish with [[Fishing line|poles]] and [[Fishing line|lines]]. The lines have [[Fishing hook|hooks]] which are [[Fishing bait|baited]], preferably with [[Bait fish|live bait]]. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook when they hit the deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres [[Length overall|o/a]]. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.<ref name=\"pole\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/350/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Pole and line vessels |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** American style \u2013 fishers stand on platforms arranged over the side abaft amidships and around the stern.

A trolling line is a [[fishing line]] with [[Bait fish|natural]] or [[Fishing lure|artificial baited]] [[Fishing hook|hooks]] trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed at the same time using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical [[Artisan fishing|artisanal fisheries]], trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching [[tuna]], [[mackerel]] and other [[pelagic]] fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/360/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trawler |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7979 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | width1    = 200\n | image1    = Long liner in Cook Strait, New Zealand 1988.jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Japanese [[Jigging|squid jigger]]\n | width2    = 170\n | image2    = Squid jigger electric lamps.JPG\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = Electric lamps on squid jigger\n}}\n\n* Jiggers \u2013 there are two types of jiggers: specialised [[squid]] jiggers which work mostly in the southern hemisphere and smaller vessels using jigging techniques in the northern hemisphere mainly for catching [[cod]].<ref name=\"jigger\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/330/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Jigger vessels |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Squid jiggers \u2013 have single or double drum jigger winches lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, are used to attract the squid. These are arranged 50\u201360 centimetres apart, either as one row in the centre of the vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel. The jigging motion can be produced mechanically by the shape of the drum or electronically by adjustment to the winch motor. Squid jiggers are often used during the day as midwater trawlers and during the night as jiggers.<ref name=\"jigger\"/>\n** Cod jiggers \u2013 use single jigger machines and do not use lights to attract the fish. The fish are attracted by the jigging motion and artificial bait.<ref name=\"jigger\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other vessels===\n* [[Fishing dredge|Dredgers]] \u2013 use a dredge for collecting [[mollusc]]s from the seafloor. There are three types of dredges: (a) The dredge can be dragged along the seabed, scooping the shellfish from the ground. These dredges are towed in a manner similar to beam trawlers, and large dredgers can work three or more dredges on each side.  (b) Heavy mechanical dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. Dredgers don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/440/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Dredgers |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7988 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Drawing of a gill netter.gif|thumb|right]]\n[[File:YarmouthNS FishingBoats.jpg|thumb|right|Lobster fishing boats]]\n[[File:French Fishing Vessel 'Alf' in the Irish Sea MOD 45155246.jpg|thumb|Fishing boat in a heavy sea]]\n[[File:RV Celtic Explorer, Galway Bay, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|The fisheries research vessel RV ''Celtic Explorer'']]\n\n* Gillnetters \u2013 On inland waters and inshore, [[gillnet]]s can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which can have their wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the [[high seas]], medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifters]], and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is more a matter of the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/200/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Gillnetters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7943 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Set netters \u2013 also operate gillnets. However, during fishing operations the vessel is not attached to the nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the [[high seas]]. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/1000/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Set netters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* Lift netters \u2013 are equipped to operate lift nets, which are held from the vessel's side and raised and lowered by means of outriggers. Lift netters range from open boats about 10 metres long to larger vessels with open ocean capability. Decked vessels usually have the bridge amidships. Larger vessels are often equipped with winches and derricks for handling the lifting lines, as well as outriggers and light booms. They can be fitted with powerful lights to attract and aggregate the fish to the surface. Open boats are usually unmechanized or use hand-operated winches. Electronic equipment, such as [[fishfinder]]s, [[sonar]] and [[echo sounder]]s are used extensively on larger boats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/480/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Lift netters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/IRS?iid=7994 |title=Drawing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Fish traps|Trap setters]] \u2013 are used to set [[Lobster trap|pots]] or [[Fish trap|traps]] for catching fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters range in size from open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/230/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trap setters |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Handline fishing|Handliners]] \u2013 are normally undecked vessels used for handlining (fishing with a [[Fishing line|line]] and [[Fishing hook|hook]]). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres [[o/a]], and do not have special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of special electronic equipment. Non traditional handliners can set and haul using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels are normally fastened to the [[gunwale]] or set on [[stanchion]]s close to or overhanging the gunwale. They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/340/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Handliners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* Multipurpose vessels \u2013 are vessels which are designed so they can deploy more than one type of fishing gear without major modifications to the vessels. The fish detection equipment present on board also changes according to which fishing gear is being used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/380/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Multipurpose vessels |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n** Trawler/Purse seiners \u2013 are designed so the deck arrangement and equipment, including a suitable combination winch, can be used for both methods. Rollers, blocks, trawl gallows and purse davits need to be arranged so they control the lead of warps and pursing lines in such a way as to reduce the time needed to convert from one type to the other. Typical fish detection equipment includes a sonar and an echosounder. These vessels are usually designed as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/vesseltype/400/en |title=Fishing Vessel type: Trawler-purse seiners |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n* [[Research vessel]]s \u2013 a [[Fisheries science|fisheries research]] vessel (FRV) requires platforms which are capable of towing different types of [[fishing net]]s, collecting [[plankton]] or water samples from a range of depths, and carrying [[Sonar|acoustic]] fish-finding equipment. Fisheries research vessels are often designed and built along the same lines as a large fishing vessel, but with space given over to [[Laboratory|laboratories]] and equipment storage, as opposed to storage of the catch. An example of a fisheries research vessel is [[Fisheries Research Services|FRV ''Scotia'']].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Artisan vessels==\n{{Main|Traditional fishing boats}}\n[[Artisan fishing]] is small-scale [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] fishing, particularly practices involving coastal or island ethnic groups using traditional [[fishing techniques]] and traditional boats. This may also include heritage groups involved in customary fishing practices.\n\nAccording to the [[FAO]], at the end of 2004, the world fishing fleet consisted of about 4 million vessels, of which 2.7 million were undecked (open) boats. While nearly  all decked vessels were mechanized, only one-third of the undecked fishing boats were powered, usually with outboard engines. The remaining 1.8 million boats were traditional craft of various types, operated by sail and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/>\n\nThese figures for small fishing vessels are probably under reported. The [[FAO]] compiles these figures largely from national registers. These records often omit smaller boats where registration is not required or where fishing licences are granted by provincial or municipal authorities.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fisherman Seychelles.jpg|Fisherman landing his catch in the [[Seychelles]].\nFile:Catamaran india.jpg|Indian split-log fishing canoe\nFile:Gambian fishing boats.jpg|Fishing boats in Gambia.\nFile:Vietnamese fishing boat 05.jpg|Traditional Vietnamese fishing boat\nFile:First known photo of Koreans 1871.jpg|Fishing junk, 1871\n</gallery>\n\nArtisan fishing boats are usually small [[traditional fishing boats]], appropriately designed for use on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities around the world have developed their own traditional types of fishing boats, adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the [[Fishery|fisheries]] and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan fishing boats are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, [[Indonesia]] has reported about 700,000 fishing boats, 25 percent of which are [[dugout canoe]]s, and half of which are without motors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_ID |title=Country Profile: Indonesia |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref> The [[Philippines]] have reported a similar number of small fishing boats. Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as ''[[jukung]]'' in Indonesia and ''banca'' in the Philippines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_PH |title=Country Profile: Philippines |author= |date= |website= |publisher=FAO |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:ManamocBoats.JPG|A small [[Philippine]] ''[[basnigan]]'' with the characteristic poles used for anchoring nets and holding gas-powered lamps for attracting fish\nFile:Madagascar - Traditional fishing pirogue.jpg|Traditional fishing ''[[lakana]]'' with a [[crab claw sail]] from [[Madagascar]]\nFile:Jangada-Tibau.jpg|The elegant ''[[jangada]]'' on the coast off [[Mossor\u00f3]] in Brazil\nFile:Jantar.jpg|Indian [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]] fishing boats\nFile:Baleteshore.JPG|Traditional Philippine fishing [[outrigger canoe]]s (''bangka'')\n</gallery>\n\n==Recreational vessels==\n{{see also|Recreational boat fishing}}\n[[File:Drawing of a sport fishing boat.gif|left]]\nRecreational fishing is done for pleasure or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a [[Fisherman|fisher]] periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Usually some form of [[fishing tackle]] is brought on board, such as [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]] or [[Fishing nets|nets]]. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from [[dugout canoe]]s, [[kayaks]], [[raft]]s, [[pontoon boat]]s and small [[Dinghy|dinghies]] to [[Runabout (boat)|runabouts]], [[cabin cruiser]]s and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious [[Big-game fishing|big game]] rigs.<ref>[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/speciesid/fish_page/fish51a.html Sport fishing boat]</ref> Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open [[Cockpit (sailing)|cockpit]]s at the [[stern]], designed for convenient fishing.\n\n[[Big game fishing]] started as a sport after the invention of the motorized boat. [[Charles Frederick Holder]], a [[marine biologist]] and early conservationist, is credited with founding the sport in 1898.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boot.de/cipp/md_boot/custom/pub/content,lang,2/oid,8067/ticket,g_u_e_s_t |title=The history of game fishing |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Boot.de |accessdate= }}</ref> Purpose built game fishing boats appeared shortly after. An example is the ''Crete'', in use at Catalina Island, [[California]], in 1915, and shipped to [[Hawaii]] the following year. According to a newspaper report at that time, the  ''Crete'' had \"a deep cockpit, a chair fitted for landing big fish and leather pockets for placing the pole.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/krauss/Pages/viewtext.php?s=browse&tid=21108&doctype=28&route=browseby.php&start=9136&by=doctype&view=list&s=browse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719210836/http://digicoll.manoa.hawaii.edu/krauss/Pages/viewtext.php?s=browse&tid=21108&doctype=28&route=browseby.php&start=9136&by=doctype&view=list&s=browse |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 July 2011 |title=First game fishing boat arrives in Hawaii |date=13 March 1916 |publisher=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] }}</ref>\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing.\n\n[[File:bassboat1.jpg|thumb|right|Standard aluminum [[bass boat]], with [[trolling motor]]]]\n* [[Kayak fishing|Fishing kayaks]] have gained popularity in recent years. The [[kayak]] has long been a means of accessing fishing grounds.\n* [[Pontoon boat]]s have also become popular in recent years. These boats allow one or two fishermen to get into small rivers or lakes that would have difficulty accommodating larger boats. Typically 8\u201312&nbsp;ft in length, these inflatable craft can be assembled quickly and easily. Some feature rigid frames derived from the [[white water rafting]] industry.\n* [[Bass boat]]s are small aluminium or fibreglass boats used in lakes and rivers in the U.S. for fishing [[bass fishing|bass]] and other [[panfish]]. They have swivel chairs for the anglers, storage bins for fishing tackle, and a tank with recirculating water for caught fish. They are usually fitted with an [[outboard motor]] and a [[trolling motor]].\n* Charter boats are often privately operated, purpose-built fishing boats, and host fishing trips for paying clients. Their size can range widely depending on the type of trips run and the geographical location.\n* Freshwater fishing boats account for approximately one third of all registered boats in the USA. Most other types of boats end up being used for fishing on occasion.\n* Saltwater fishing boats vary widely in size and can be specialized for certain species of fish. Flounder boats, for example, have flat bottoms for a shallow draft and are used in protected, shallow waters. Sport fishing boats range from 25 to 80 feet or more, and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Boats used for fishing in cold climates may have space dedicated to a [[cuddy cabin]] or enclosed wheelhouse, while boats in warmer climates are more likely to be open.\n{{clear}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flyfishing - Winslow Homer.jpg|[[Fly fishing]] from a [[dinghy]]\nFile:Saint-Cassien pecheur.jpg|[[Angling]] from a small [[Inflatable boat|inflatable]] on [[Saint-Cassien, Dordogne|Saint-Cassien's]] lake, [[France]]\nFile:Small sport fishing boat.jpg|Small sport fishing boat\nFile:Coming in...two blues!

There is disagreement on how many different categories these may be put into. Kanin (1994) put them in three: revenge, producing an alibi or to get sympathy/attention.<ref name=\"Zutter2017\"/> Author [[Sandra Newman]] listed four categories in 2017.<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/ |title=What kind of person makes false rape accusations? |author=Sandra Newman |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=11 May 2017 |accessdate=2 December 2018|author-link=Sandra Newman }}</ref> According to De Zutter et al. (2017), Kanin's division is inadequate and one should recognise eight distinct categories in total:<ref name=\"Zutter2017\"/>\n* Material gain: to receive money, [[Promotion (rank)|professional promotion]] or other material benefits.\n* Producing an [[alibi]]: a false allegation is used to cover up other behaviour, such as being late or absent to an appointment. \n* Revenge: to retaliate against a disliked person by damaging the reputation, freedom or finances.\n* Attention: an attempt to receive any kind of attention, positive or negative, by anyone.\n* Sympathy: a special kind of attention-seeking whereby the complainant tries to improve a personal relationship with a specific individual.\n* 'A disturbed mental state'; this may include false memories (\"sexual hallucinations\") or pathologic lying.\n* Relabeling: consensual sex is relabeled 'rape' to the police, because of its 'disappointing or shameful character'. De Zutter et al. argue that a distinction should be made between some acts during a consensual sexual encounter that a participant did not want or had no desire to engage in but nonetheless gave consent to (e.g., to please their partner) on the one hand, and rape (nonconsensual sex) on the other, but that many lay people and even some scholars do not make this distinction and confuse the two. It is often when accounts of such 'unwanted consensual sex' are told to friends and family that the latter interpret it as rape, and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.\n* Regret: after having had consensual sex, a complainant experiences negative feelings such as disgust, shame, and sorrow; when others notice this and ask about the source of these negative feelings, they are prone to view the encounter as rape and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.\n\n==='Don't know'===\nAccording to De Zutter et al.

A thorough investigation would involve, potentially, multiple interviews of the alleged perpetrator, the victim, and other witnesses, and where applicable, the collection of other forensic evidence (e.g., medical records, security camera records). For example, if key elements of a victim's account of an assault were internally inconsistent and directly contradicted by multiple witnesses and if the victim then altered those key elements of his or her account, investigators might conclude that the report was false. That conclusion would have been based not on a single interview, or on intuitions about the credibility of the victim, but on a \"preponderance\" of evidence gathered over the course of a thorough investigation.\"<ref name=\"VAW\">{{cite journal |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=16 |issue=12 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assualt &#91;sic&#93;: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote |year=2010 | doi = 10.1177/1077801210387747 | pages = 1318&ndash;1334 |pmid=21164210}}</ref>\n\n=== Burman, Lovett & Kelly (2009)  ===\nIn a study of the first 100 rape reports after April 1, 2004, in [[Scotland]], researchers found that about 4% of reports were designated by police to be false.<ref name=\"Lovett\"/> In a separate report by the same researchers that year which studied primary data from several countries in Europe, including Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland, Sweden, and Wales, found the average proportion of reports designated by police as false was about 4%, and wasn't higher than 9% in any country they studied.

First, the police continue to misapply the \"no-crime\" or \"unfounding\" criteria.  Studies by Kelly ''et al''. (2005), Lea ''et al''. (2003), HMCPSI/HMIC (2002), Harris and Grace (1999), Smith (1989), and others found that police decisions to no-crime were frequently dubious and based entirely on the officer's personal judgment.  Rumney notes that some officers seem to \"have fixed views and expectations about how genuine rape victims should react to their victimization\".  He adds that \"qualitative research also suggests that some officers continue to exhibit an unjustified scepticism of rape complainants, while others interpret such things as lack of evidence or complaint withdrawal as 'proof' of a false allegation\".\n\nRumney's second conclusion is that it is impossible to \"discern with any degree of certainty the actual rate of false allegations\" because many of the studies of false allegations have adopted unreliable or untested research methodologies. He argues, for instance, that in addition to their small sample size, the studies by Maclean (1979) and Stewart (1981) used questionable criteria to judge an allegation to be false. MacLean deemed reports \"false\" if, for instance, the victim did not appear \"dishevelled\" and Stewart, in one instance, considered a case disproved, stating that \"it was totally impossible to have removed her extremely tight undergarments from her extremely large body against her will\".<ref>Stewart (1981) quoted in {{cite journal | last1 = Rumney | first1 = Philip N.S. | year = 2006 | title = False Allegations of Rape | journal = [[Cambridge Law Journal]] | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 128\u2013158 | doi=10.1017/s0008197306007069}}</ref>\n\n=== In Canada ===\nAccording to [[Statistics Canada]], respectively 19% and 14% of sexual assault allegations were deemed unfounded in 2016 and 2017<ref>https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2018024-eng.htm</ref>.

Third, in 55 cases (33%), the police considered the complaint to be false. Fourth, in 13 cases (8%), the complainant stated that their allegations were false.

The authors found 68 reports of forcible rape, of which in 22 cases (32%) the complainants admitted that their reports were false. Similar to the Kanin study, most of these false reports served as an alibi (15 out of 22, 68% of the false reports). Diverging from the Kanin study, revenge was rarely cited as a reason (1 out of 22, 5% of the false reports). The remaining cases were cited to attention-seeking (6 out of 22, 27% of false reports).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Daniel |last2=Witkowski |first2=Michael |title=False allegations of rape revisited: A replication of the Kanin study |journal=Journal of Security Administration |date=June 2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201346}}</ref>\n\n=== FBI statistics (1995\u20131997) ===\nIn the US, [[FBI]] reports from 1995, 1996, and 1997 consistently put the number of \"unfounded\" forcible rape accusations around 8%.

''The Forensic Examiner''</ref>\n\n===Kanin (1994)===\nIn 1994, Eugene J. Kanin of [[Purdue University]] investigated the incidences of false rape allegations made to the police in one small urban community in the Midwest United States (population 70,000) between 1978 and 1987. He states that unlike in many larger jurisdictions, this police department had the resources to \"seriously record and pursue to closure all rape complaints, regardless of their merits\". He further states each investigation \"always involves a serious offer to [[polygraph]] the complainants and the suspects\" and \"the complainant must admit that no rape had occurred. She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false\".\n\nThe number of false rape allegations in the studied period was 45; this was 41% of the 109 total complaints filed in this period.<ref>Kanin, Eugene J., \"{{cite journal|url=http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf|title=False Rape Allegations|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=23|pages=81\u201392|issue=1|date=February 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303082400/http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|doi=10.1007/bf01541619 |pmid=8135653| last1 = Kanin | first1 = Eugene J.}}</ref>  The researchers verified, whenever possible, for all of the complainants who recanted their allegations, that their new account of the events matched the accused's version of events.\n\nAfter reviewing the police files, Kanin categorized the false accusations into three broad motivations: alibis, revenge, and [[attention-seeking]]. These motivations were assigned prevalence of roughly 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively. This categorization was supported by the details of complainant recantations and other documentation of their cases.\n\nKanin also investigated the combined police records of two large Midwestern universities over a three-year period (1986\u20131988), and found that 50% of the reported forcible rapes were determined to be false accusations (32 of the total 64). No polygraphs were used, the investigations were the sole responsibility of a ranking female officer, and a rape charge was only counted as false under complainant recantation. In this sample, the motivations mentioned above were roughly evenly split between alibi and revenge, with only one case characterized as attention-seeking.\n\n==== Criticism ====\nCritics of Kanin's report include [[David Lisak]], an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. He states, \"Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape. It certainly should never be used to assert a scientific foundation for the frequency of false allegations.\"<ref name=\"SAR\">{{cite journal |journal=Sexual Assault Report |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=David |last=Lisak |date=September\u2013October 2007 |title=False allegations of rape: a critique of Kanin}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Lisak, Kanin's study lacked any kind of systematic methodology and did not independently define a false report, instead recording as false any report which the police department classified as false, whereas Kanin stated that the women filing the false allegations of rape had recanted. The department classified reports as false which the complainant later said were false, but Lisak points out that Kanin's study did not scrutinize the police's processes or employ independent checkers to protect results from bias.<ref name=\"VAW\"/>\n\nKanin, Lisak writes, took his data from a police department which used investigation procedures (polygraphs) that are discouraged by the U.S. Justice Department and denounced by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. These procedures include the \"serious offer\", in this department, of polygraph testing of complainants, which is viewed as a tactic of intimidation that leads victims to avoid the justice process<ref name=\"VAW\"/> and which, Lisak says, is \"based on the misperception that a significant percentage of sexual assault reports are false\".<ref name=\"SAR\"/> The police department's \"biases...were then echoed in Kanin's unchallenged reporting of their findings\".<ref name=\"SAR\"/> While also noting some of the same criticisms of Kanin, Rumney's 2006 metastudy of US and UK false rape allegation studies adds that \"if, indeed, officers did abide by this policy then the 41% could, in fact, be an underestimate given the restrictive definition of false complaints offered by the police in this study. The reliability of these findings may be somewhat bolstered by the fact that the police appeared to record the details and circumstances of the fabrications.\"<ref name=rumney />\n\nBruce Gross writes in the ''Forensic Examiner'' that Kanin's study is an example of the limitations of existing studies on false rape accusations. \"Small sample sizes and non-representative samples preclude generalizability.\"<ref name=\"AAOJ\"/> Philip N.S. Rumney questions the reliability of Kanin's study stating that it \"must be approached with caution\". He argues that the study's most significant problem is Kanin's assumption \"that police officers abided by departmental policy in only labeling as false those cases where the complainant admitted to fabrication. He does not consider that actual police practice, as other studies have shown, might have departed from guidelines.\"<ref name=rumney/>\n\n==Police handling of rape reports==\nSurveys of police and prosecutors find that many in law enforcement consistently over-estimate the prevalence of false accusations, leading to what some researchers have characterized as a culture of skepticism toward accusers in sexual assault cases.<ref name=\"Lovett\"/>\n\n== Possible effects of media representation ==\nThere are studies about the extent which the media affects the public perception of false rape accusations.

Some behaviors associated with lying by juries is actually typical of true rapes, including kissing or a previous relationship with the rapist.

Wells]] published ''The Red Record'' which documented lynchings from 1892 and their causes. She compiled statistics of 241 lynchings which showed that rape and murder were the two most common reasons used to justify lynchings. Wells found little evidence that victims were lynched because they had committed rape or some other offense. Instead she found that African American businesses were competing with white-owned businesses and in some cases African American men had consensual sexual relationships with white women and were lynched after the relationships were discovered by other people. Subsequent analyses have confirmed Wells' argument that economic competition led to lynchings and found that lynchings increased during difficult economic times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brundage |first1=William Fitzhugh |title=Under sentence of death : lynching in the South |date=1997 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0807846360 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XzHVqJV-U9gC |accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.

The riot began over an allegation that a black man had attempted to rape a white 17 year-old elevator operator.\n\nThe [[Rosewood massacre]] of 1923 began after a white woman in nearby Sumner claimed she had been raped by a black man from Rosewood. An angry mob surrounded a house with black residents and a standoff ensued. The mob killed several people inside and two white people were killed outside. This attracted additional angry mobs who razed Rosewood. Black residents fled into the forest, escaped in cars, and on a train. At a minimum, eight black people and two white people were killed but it is possible that as many 150 black residents were killed.\n\nTwo white women falsely accused the [[Scottsboro Boys]], a group of nine African American boys and young men, of rape on a train in 1931. Eight of the boys were found guilty and the case was appealed to the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] and then twice to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In [[Powell v. Alabama]] the Supreme Court reversed the Alabama Supreme Court decision because the Court found that the defendants had inadequate counsel. In [[Patterson v. Alabama]] the Supreme Court sent the case back to Alabama for retrial because the jury the pool had excluded African-Americans, a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Five of the nine Scottsboro boys were ultimately found guilty and sentenced to prison.  In 2013, Alabama's [[parole board]] voted to grant posthumous pardons to all the Scottsboro Boys who had not been pardoned or had their convictions overturned.<ref>{{Citation|title=Scottsboro Boys|date=2020-03-14|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scottsboro_Boys&oldid=945534543|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\nRacially charged allegations of rape continue to the present time. In the [[Central Park jogger case]], one Hispanic and four black teens were found guilty of raping a white woman in 1989. Their cases were vacated in 2002 and they received a $41 million settlement in 2014.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*\"[[A Rape on Campus]]\" \u2013 a fabricated story about an alleged rape near the campus of the [[University of Virginia]]\n*[[Brian Banks (American football)#Sexual assault case|Brian Banks]] \u2013 an example from 2002\n*[[Central Park jogger case]] - vacated convictions for rape\n*[[Centurion Ministries]] \u2013 advocacy\n*[[Death of Eleanor de Freitas]]\n*[[Duke lacrosse case]] \u2013 an example from 2006\n*[[False allegation of child sexual abuse]]\n*[[Families Advocating for Campus Equality (FACE)]]\n*[[Hofstra University rape case]]\n*[[Innocence Project]] \u2013 advocacy\n*[[Joseph (Genesis)#Potiphar.27s house|Joseph (Genesis)]]\n*[[List of abuse allegations made via facilitated communication]]\n*[[Recovered memory therapy]]\n*[[Runaway bride case]]\n*[[Scottsboro Boys]] \u2013 an example from 1931\n*[[Tawana Brawley rape allegations]] \u2013 an example from 1987\n*[[Treva Throneberry]]\n*[[Satanic ritual abuse]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last=Belknap |first=Joanne |date=December 2010 |title=Rape: Too Hard to Report and Too Easy to Discredit Victims |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=16 |number=12 |pages=1335\u20131344 |pmid=21164211 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387749 }}\n*{{cite book |last1=Gilmore |first1=Leigh |title=TAINTED WITNESS : why we doubt what women say about their lives. |publisher=COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PRESS |isbn=9780231177153|date=2018-08-04 }}\n*{{cite journal |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=16 |issue=12 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assualt &#91;sic&#93;: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote |year=2010|doi = 10.1177/1077801210387747 |pmid=21164210 |pages=1318\u201334}}\n*{{cite book |title=A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America |year=2018 |last=Miller |first=T.

There is disagreement on how many different categories these may be put into. Kanin (1994) put them in three: revenge, producing an alibi or to get sympathy/attention.<ref name=\"Zutter2017\"/> Author [[Sandra Newman]] listed four categories in 2017.<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite news |url=https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/ |title=What kind of person makes false rape accusations? |author=Sandra Newman |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=11 May 2017 |accessdate=2 December 2018|author-link=Sandra Newman }}</ref> According to De Zutter et al. (2017), Kanin's division is inadequate and one should recognise eight distinct categories in total:<ref name=\"Zutter2017\"/>\n* Material gain: to receive money, [[Promotion (rank)|professional promotion]] or other material benefits.\n* Producing an [[alibi]]: a false allegation is used to cover up other behaviour, such as being late or absent to an appointment. \n* Revenge: to retaliate against a disliked person by damaging the reputation, freedom or finances.\n* Attention: an attempt to receive any kind of attention, positive or negative, by anyone.\n* Sympathy: a special kind of attention-seeking whereby the complainant tries to improve a personal relationship with a specific individual.\n* 'A disturbed mental state'; this may include false memories (\"sexual hallucinations\") or pathologic lying.\n* Relabeling: consensual sex is relabeled 'rape' to the police, because of its 'disappointing or shameful character'. De Zutter et al. argue that a distinction should be made between some acts during a consensual sexual encounter that a participant did not want or had no desire to engage in but nonetheless gave consent to (e.g., to please their partner) on the one hand, and rape (nonconsensual sex) on the other, but that many lay people and even some scholars do not make this distinction and confuse the two. It is often when accounts of such 'unwanted consensual sex' are told to friends and family that the latter interpret it as rape, and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.\n* Regret: after having had consensual sex, a complainant experiences negative feelings such as disgust, shame, and sorrow; when others notice this and ask about the source of these negative feelings, they are prone to view the encounter as rape and put the complainant under pressure to file an allegation.\n\n==='Don't know'===\nAccording to De Zutter et al.

For example, if key elements of a victim's account of an assault were internally inconsistent and directly contradicted by multiple witnesses and if the victim then altered those key elements of his or her account, investigators might conclude that the report was false.

First, the police continue to misapply the \"no-crime\" or \"unfounding\" criteria.  Studies by Kelly ''et al''. (2005), Lea ''et al''. (2003), HMCPSI/HMIC (2002), Harris and Grace (1999), Smith (1989), and others found that police decisions to no-crime were frequently dubious and based entirely on the officer's personal judgment.  Rumney notes that some officers seem to \"have fixed views and expectations about how genuine rape victims should react to their victimization\".  He adds that \"qualitative research also suggests that some officers continue to exhibit an unjustified scepticism of rape complainants, while others interpret such things as lack of evidence or complaint withdrawal as 'proof' of a false allegation\".\n\nRumney's second conclusion is that it is impossible to \"discern with any degree of certainty the actual rate of false allegations\" because many of the studies of false allegations have adopted unreliable or untested research methodologies. He argues, for instance, that in addition to their small sample size, the studies by Maclean (1979) and Stewart (1981) used questionable criteria to judge an allegation to be false. MacLean deemed reports \"false\" if, for instance, the victim did not appear \"dishevelled\" and Stewart, in one instance, considered a case disproved, stating that \"it was totally impossible to have removed her extremely tight undergarments from her extremely large body against her will\".<ref>Stewart (1981) quoted in {{cite journal | last1 = Rumney | first1 = Philip N.S. | year = 2006 | title = False Allegations of Rape | journal = [[Cambridge Law Journal]] | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 128\u2013158 | doi=10.1017/s0008197306007069}}</ref>\n\n=== In Canada ===\nAccording to [[Statistics Canada]], respectively 19% and 14% of sexual assault allegations were deemed unfounded in 2016 and 2017<ref>https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2018024-eng.htm</ref>.

First, in 34 cases (21%), the police considered the complaint to be genuine. Second, in 62 cases (38%), the police were unsure if the complaint was true or false. Third, in 55 cases (33%), the police considered the complaint to be false. Fourth, in 13 cases (8%), the complainant stated that their allegations were false. For the cases in this fourth category, 8 of these 13 cases (62%) had another party calling the police on the complainant's behalf, or another party pressuring the complainant to contact the police.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jordan |first1=Jan |title=Beyond belief?

They recorded data from the period of 1988 to 1997 in an unnamed suburb of around 100,000, situated close to [[Detroit]] in the American state of [[Michigan]]. The authors found 68 reports of forcible rape, of which in 22 cases (32%) the complainants admitted that their reports were false. Similar to the Kanin study, most of these false reports served as an alibi (15 out of 22, 68% of the false reports). Diverging from the Kanin study, revenge was rarely cited as a reason (1 out of 22, 5% of the false reports). The remaining cases were cited to attention-seeking (6 out of 22, 27% of false reports).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Daniel |last2=Witkowski |first2=Michael |title=False allegations of rape revisited: A replication of the Kanin study |journal=Journal of Security Administration |date=June 2000 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=41\u201346}}</ref>\n\n=== FBI statistics (1995\u20131997) ===\nIn the US, [[FBI]] reports from 1995, 1996, and 1997 consistently put the number of \"unfounded\" forcible rape accusations around 8%.

''The Forensic Examiner''</ref>\n\n===Kanin (1994)===\nIn 1994, Eugene J. Kanin of [[Purdue University]] investigated the incidences of false rape allegations made to the police in one small urban community in the Midwest United States (population 70,000) between 1978 and 1987. He states that unlike in many larger jurisdictions, this police department had the resources to \"seriously record and pursue to closure all rape complaints, regardless of their merits\". He further states each investigation \"always involves a serious offer to [[polygraph]] the complainants and the suspects\" and \"the complainant must admit that no rape had occurred. She is the sole agent who can say that the rape charge is false\".\n\nThe number of false rape allegations in the studied period was 45; this was 41% of the 109 total complaints filed in this period.<ref>Kanin, Eugene J., \"{{cite journal|url=http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf|title=False Rape Allegations|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=23|pages=81\u201392|issue=1|date=February 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303082400/http://sf-criminaldefense.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/KaninFalseRapeAllegations.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|doi=10.1007/bf01541619 |pmid=8135653| last1 = Kanin | first1 = Eugene J.}}</ref>  The researchers verified, whenever possible, for all of the complainants who recanted their allegations, that their new account of the events matched the accused's version of events.\n\nAfter reviewing the police files, Kanin categorized the false accusations into three broad motivations: alibis, revenge, and [[attention-seeking]]. These motivations were assigned prevalence of roughly 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively. This categorization was supported by the details of complainant recantations and other documentation of their cases.\n\nKanin also investigated the combined police records of two large Midwestern universities over a three-year period (1986\u20131988), and found that 50% of the reported forcible rapes were determined to be false accusations (32 of the total 64). No polygraphs were used, the investigations were the sole responsibility of a ranking female officer, and a rape charge was only counted as false under complainant recantation. In this sample, the motivations mentioned above were roughly evenly split between alibi and revenge, with only one case characterized as attention-seeking.\n\n==== Criticism ====\nCritics of Kanin's report include [[David Lisak]], an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. He states, \"Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape. It certainly should never be used to assert a scientific foundation for the frequency of false allegations.\"<ref name=\"SAR\">{{cite journal |journal=Sexual Assault Report |volume=11 |issue=1 |first=David |last=Lisak |date=September\u2013October 2007 |title=False allegations of rape: a critique of Kanin}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Lisak, Kanin's study lacked any kind of systematic methodology and did not independently define a false report, instead recording as false any report which the police department classified as false, whereas Kanin stated that the women filing the false allegations of rape had recanted. The department classified reports as false which the complainant later said were false, but Lisak points out that Kanin's study did not scrutinize the police's processes or employ independent checkers to protect results from bias.<ref name=\"VAW\"/>\n\nKanin, Lisak writes, took his data from a police department which used investigation procedures (polygraphs) that are discouraged by the U.S. Justice Department and denounced by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. These procedures include the \"serious offer\", in this department, of polygraph testing of complainants, which is viewed as a tactic of intimidation that leads victims to avoid the justice process<ref name=\"VAW\"/> and which, Lisak says, is \"based on the misperception that a significant percentage of sexual assault reports are false\".<ref name=\"SAR\"/> The police department's \"biases...were then echoed in Kanin's unchallenged reporting of their findings\".<ref name=\"SAR\"/> While also noting some of the same criticisms of Kanin, Rumney's 2006 metastudy of US and UK false rape allegation studies adds that \"if, indeed, officers did abide by this policy then the 41% could, in fact, be an underestimate given the restrictive definition of false complaints offered by the police in this study. The reliability of these findings may be somewhat bolstered by the fact that the police appeared to record the details and circumstances of the fabrications.\"<ref name=rumney />\n\nBruce Gross writes in the ''Forensic Examiner'' that Kanin's study is an example of the limitations of existing studies on false rape accusations. \"Small sample sizes and non-representative samples preclude generalizability.\"<ref name=\"AAOJ\"/> Philip N.S. Rumney questions the reliability of Kanin's study stating that it \"must be approached with caution\". He argues that the study's most significant problem is Kanin's assumption \"that police officers abided by departmental policy in only labeling as false those cases where the complainant admitted to fabrication. He does not consider that actual police practice, as other studies have shown, might have departed from guidelines.\"<ref name=rumney/>\n\n==Police handling of rape reports==\nSurveys of police and prosecutors find that many in law enforcement consistently over-estimate the prevalence of false accusations, leading to what some researchers have characterized as a culture of skepticism toward accusers in sexual assault cases.<ref name=\"Lovett\"/>\n\n== Possible effects of media representation ==\nThere are studies about the extent which the media affects the public perception of false rape accusations.

Some behaviors associated with lying by juries is actually typical of true rapes, including kissing or a previous relationship with the rapist.

Wells]] published ''The Red Record'' which documented lynchings from 1892 and their causes. She compiled statistics of 241 lynchings which showed that rape and murder were the two most common reasons used to justify lynchings. Wells found little evidence that victims were lynched because they had committed rape or some other offense. Instead she found that African American businesses were competing with white-owned businesses and in some cases African American men had consensual sexual relationships with white women and were lynched after the relationships were discovered by other people. Subsequent analyses have confirmed Wells' argument that economic competition led to lynchings and found that lynchings increased during difficult economic times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brundage |first1=William Fitzhugh |title=Under sentence of death : lynching in the South |date=1997 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-0807846360 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XzHVqJV-U9gC |accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=E.

The riot began over an allegation that a black man had attempted to rape a white 17 year-old elevator operator.\n\nThe [[Rosewood massacre]] of 1923 began after a white woman in nearby Sumner claimed she had been raped by a black man from Rosewood. An angry mob surrounded a house with black residents and a standoff ensued. The mob killed several people inside and two white people were killed outside. This attracted additional angry mobs who razed Rosewood. Black residents fled into the forest, escaped in cars, and on a train. At a minimum, eight black people and two white people were killed but it is possible that as many 150 black residents were killed.\n\nTwo white women falsely accused the [[Scottsboro Boys]], a group of nine African American boys and young men, of rape on a train in 1931. Eight of the boys were found guilty and the case was appealed to the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] and then twice to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. In [[Powell v. Alabama]] the Supreme Court reversed the Alabama Supreme Court decision because the Court found that the defendants had inadequate counsel. In [[Patterson v. Alabama]] the Supreme Court sent the case back to Alabama for retrial because the jury the pool had excluded African-Americans, a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Five of the nine Scottsboro boys were ultimately found guilty and sentenced to prison.
