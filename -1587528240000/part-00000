The caprice, in the key of [[A minor]], consists of a [[theme (music)|theme]], 11 [[variation (music)|variations]], and a finale. His 24 Caprices were probably composed in 1807, while he was in the service of the [[Elisa Bonaparte|Baciocchi]] court.\n\nIt is widely considered one of the most difficult pieces ever written for the solo violin. It requires many highly advanced techniques such as [[parallel octaves]] and rapid shifting covering many [[Interval (music)|intervals]], extremely fast [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[arpeggio]]s including [[minor scale]]s, left hand [[pizzicato]], high positions, and quick string crossings. Also, there are many double stops, including thirds and tenths.\n\n==Variations on the theme==\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Paganini Caprice-24.ogg\n| title       = Caprice No. 24\n| description = viola with piano accompaniment\n}}\nThe caprice has provided a rich seam of material for works by subsequent composers.
