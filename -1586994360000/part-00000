The game is known in several countries under different names.\n\nPlayers alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n==Origin==\nGomoku has existed in Japan since the [[Meiji Restoration]].<ref name=\"hzx\">{{cite book |author=Huang Zunxian, Chen Zheng|title=\u300a\u9ec4\u9075\u5baa\u5168\u96c6\u300b\u7b2c2\u5377|date=2005|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=China|language=zh-cn |isbn=9787101044904}}</ref> The name \"Gomoku\" is from the [[Japanese language]], in which it is referred to as {{nihongo|''gomokunarabe''|\u4e94\u76ee\u4e26\u3079}}. ''Go'' means [[5|five]], ''moku'' is a [[Japanese counter word|counter word]] for [[Go stone|piece]]s and ''narabe'' means ''line-up''. The game is also popular in [[Korea]], where it is called ''omok'' (\uc624\ubaa9 [\u4e94\u76ee]) which has the same structure and origin as the Japanese name.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the game was introduced to Britain where it was known as '''Go Bang''', said to be a corruption of the Japanese word ''[[Go board|goban]]'', said to be adapted from Chinese ''k'i pan (q\u00ed p\u00e1n)'' \"go-board.\"<ref>OED citations: '''1886''' GUILLEMARD ''Cruise \u2018Marchesa\u2019'' I. 267 Some of the games are purely Japanese..as ''go-ban''. ''Note'', This game is the one lately introduced into England under the misspelt name of Go Bang. '''1888''' ''Pall Mall Gazette'' 1. Nov. 3/1 These young persons...played go-bang and cat's cradle.\nThe board below shows the three types of winning arrangements as they might appear on an 8x8 Petteia board. Obviously the cramped conditions would result in a draw most of the time, depending on the rules. Play would be easier on a larger Latrunculi board of 12x8 or even 10x11.\n.</ref>\n\n==Official rules==\nBesides many variations around the world, the '''Swap2''' rule (based on \"swap\" from [[Renju]]) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players, including Gomoku World Championships.\n\nIn Swap2 rule, the first player starts by placing three stones (2 black and 1 white, if black goes first) on the board.  The second player then selects one of three options: play black, play white and place one more stone, or place two more stones to and let the first player choose the color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://renju.net/media/showrule.php?rule=11|title=Gomoku - swap2 rule|last=|first=|date=|website=renju.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-09}}</ref><ref>http://gomokuworld.com/gomoku/2</ref> This is essentially a slightly more elaborate [[pie rule]].\n\nSwap2 solved the low complexity problem<ref name=\":0\" /> and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.\n\n==Variations==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2007}}\nMost variations are based on either '''Free-style gomoku''' or '''Standard gomoku'''.\n\n* '''Free-style gomoku''' requires a row of five or more stones for a win.\n* '''Standard gomoku''' requires a row of exactly five stones for a win: rows of six or more, called '''overlines''', do not count.\n\n===Optional (\"house\") rules===\nBlack (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, even before L. Victor Allis proved that black could force a win (see below). So a number of variations are played with extra rules that aimed to reduce black's advantage.\n\n* The rule of '''three and three''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).\n* The rule of '''four and four''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two rows of four stones (open or not).\n* Alternatively, a handicap may be given such that after the first \"three and three\" play has been made, the opposing player may place two stones as their next turn. These stones must block an opponent's row of three.\n* Efforts to improve fairness by reducing first-move advantage include the rule of '''swap''', generalizable as \"swap-(''x'',''y'',''z'')\" and characterizable as a partially compounded and partially iterated version of the [[pie rule]] (\"one person slices; the other chooses\"):  One player places on the board ''x'' stones of the first-moving color and a lesser number ''y'' stones of the second-moving color (\"slicing\" in the pie metaphor); the other player is entitled to choose between ''a'') playing from the starting position, in which case the selecting player is also entitled to choose which color to play, and ''b'') placing ''z'' (usually [(x - y) + 1]) more stones on the board at locations of that player's choice (\"reslicing\" in the pie metaphor, with limitations created by the board's existing setup akin to limitations arising from the existing slices in the pie), in which case the former player is entitled to choose which color side to play on.\n\n===Specific variations===\n* '''[[Renju]]''' is played on a 15\u00d715 board, with the rules of three and three, four and four, and overlines applied to Black only and with opening rules, some of which are following the ''swap'' pattern.\n* In '''Caro''' (also called Gomoku+, popular among Vietnamese), the winner must have an overline or an unbroken row of five stones that must not be blocked at '''both''' ends (overlines are immuned to this rule). This makes Gomoku more balanced and provides more power for White to defend.\n* '''Omok''' is played the same as Standard Gomoku; however, it is played on a 19\u00d719 board and include the rule of ''three and three''. The '''overlines''' rules, do not count.\n* '''Ninuki-renju''' or '''Wu''' is a variant which adds capturing to the game; it was published in the US in a slightly simplified form under the name renju.\n\n===Theoretical generalizations===\n* [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-games]] are a [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''\u00d7''n'' intersections, and ''k'' in a row needed to win.\n* Connect(''m'',''n'',''k'',''p'',''q'') games are another [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''\u00d7''n'' intersections, ''k'' in a row needed to win, ''p'' stones for each player to place, and ''q'' stones for the first player to place for the first move only. Each player may play only at the lowest unoccupied place in a column. In particular, Connect(''m'',''n'',6,2,1) is called [[Connect6]].\n\n==Example game==\n[[File:Gomoku-game-1.svg|thumb|300px|right|First game]]\nThis game on the 15\u00d715 board is adapted from the paper \"Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search\".<ref>Allis, L. V., Herik, H. J., & Huntjens, M. P. H. (1993). ''Go-moku and threat-space search''. University of Limburg, Department of Computer Science.</ref>\n\nThe opening moves show clearly black's advantage. An open row of three (one that is not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end) has to be blocked immediately, or countered with a threat elsewhere on the board. If not blocked or countered, the open row of three will be extended to an open row of four, which threatens to win in two ways.\n\nWhite has to block open rows of three at moves 10, 14, 16 and 20, but black only has to do so at move 9.\nMove 20 is a blunder for white (it should have been played next to black 19). Black can now force a win against any defence by white, starting with move 21.\n\n[[File:Gomoku-game-3.svg|thumb|300px|right|Second game (continuation from first game)]]\nThere are two forcing sequences for black, depending on whether white 22 is played next to black 15 or black 21. The diagram on the right shows the first sequence. All the moves for white are forced. Such long forcing sequences are typical in gomoku, and expert players can read out forcing sequences of 20 to 40 moves rapidly and accurately.\n\n[[File:Gomoku-game-2.svg|thumb|300px|right|Other second game]]\nThe diagram on the right shows the second forcing sequence. This diagram shows why white 20 was a blunder; if it had been next to black 19 (at the position of move 32 in this diagram) then black 31 would not be a threat and so the forcing sequence would fail.\n\n==World championships==\nWorld Championships in Gomoku have occurred 2 times in 1989, 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renju.net/media/gwc.php |title=The Renju International Federation portal - RenjuNet |publisher=Renju.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\nSince 2009 the tournament resumed, the opening rule being played was changed and now is swap2.\n\nList of the tournaments occurred and title holders follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ World Championship\n|-\n!Title year\n!Hosting city, country\n!Gold\n!Silver\n!Bronze\n!Opening rule\n|-\n|1989\n|{{flagdeco|Japan}} [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Sergey Chernov]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Yuriy Tarannikov]]\n|{{flagicon|Japan}} [[Hirouji Sakamoto]]\n|Pro\n|-\n|1991\n|{{flagdeco|Soviet Union}} [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Yuriy Tarannikov]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[Ando Meritee]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Sergey Chernov]]\n|Pro\n|-\n|2009\n|{{flagdeco|Czech Republic}} [[Pardubice]], [[Czech Republic]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Artur Tamio\u0142a]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Attila Demj\u00e1n]]\n|{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Pavel Laube]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2011\n|{{flagdeco|Sweden}} [[Huskvarna]], [[Sweden]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Attila Demj\u00e1n]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Artur Tamio\u0142a]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2013\n|{{flagdeco|Estonia}} [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Attila Demj\u00e1n]]\n|{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Pavel Laube]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Mikhail Kozhin]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2015\n|{{flagdeco|Russia}} [[Suzdal]], [[Russia]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Rudolf Dupszki]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Gerg\u0151 T\u00f3th]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Mikhail Kozhin]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2017\n|{{flagdeco|Czech Republic}} [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Zolt\u00e1n L\u00e1szl\u00f3]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Rudolf Dupszki]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Denis Osipov (gomoku player)|Denis Osipov]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2019\n|{{flagdeco|Estonia}} [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]\n|{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Martin Muzika]]\n|{{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Oleg Bulatowsky]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski]]\n|Swap2\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <\n|+ Team World Championship\n|-\n!Title year\n!Hosting city, country\n!Gold\n!Silver\n!Bronze\n!Opening rule\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|2016\n|{{flagdeco|Estonia}} [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]\n|{{flag|Poland}} <br/> Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski <br/> Micha\u0142 Zajk <br/> \u0141ukasz Majksner <br/> Piotr Ma\u0142owiejski\n|{{flag|Czech Republic}} <br/> Pavel Laube <br/> Igor Eged <br/> \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Tesa\u0159\u00edk <br/> Marek Hanzl\n|{{flag|Chinese Taipei}} <br/> Lu Wei-Yuan <br/> Chen Ko-Han <br/> Chang Yi-Feng <br/> Sung Pei-Jung\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2018\n|{{flagdeco|Poland}} [[P\u0142ock]], [[Poland]]\n|{{flag|Russia}}-1 <br/> Edvard Rizvanov <br/> Denis Osipov <br/> Ilya Muratov <br/> Maksim Karasev <br/> Mikhail Kozhin\n|{{flag|Hungary}} <br/> Zolt\u00e1n L\u00e1szl\u00f3 <br/>  Gerg\u0151 T\u00f3th <br/>  M\u00e1rk Horv\u00e1th <br/> G\u00e1bor Gyenes <br/>  Attila Heged\u0171s\n|{{flag|Poland}} <br/> \u0141ukasz Majksner <br/> Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski <br/> Micha\u0142 Zajk <br/> Marek Gorzecki <br/> Pawe\u0142 Tarasi\u0144ski\n|Swap2\n|}\n\n== Computers and Gomoku ==\nPeople have been applying [[artificial intelligence]] techniques on playing gomoku for several decades. In 1994, [[L.

In any size of a board, freestyle gomoku is an [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-game]], hence it is known that the first player can enforce a win or a draw. In 2001, Allis' winning strategy was also approved for renju, a variation of gomoku, when there was no limitation on the opening stage.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0cc4/0a7750b14ccf417faa39ac292e8d096617bc.pdf | author=J.

Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a [[paper-and-pencil game]]. The game is known in several countries under different names.\n\nPlayers alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n==Origin==\nGomoku has existed in Japan since the [[Meiji Restoration]].<ref name=\"hzx\">{{cite book |author=Huang Zunxian, Chen Zheng|title=\u300a\u9ec4\u9075\u5baa\u5168\u96c6\u300b\u7b2c2\u5377|date=2005|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company|location=China|language=zh-cn |isbn=9787101044904}}</ref> The name \"Gomoku\" is from the [[Japanese language]], in which it is referred to as {{nihongo|''gomokunarabe''|\u4e94\u76ee\u4e26\u3079}}. ''Go'' means [[5|five]], ''moku'' is a [[Japanese counter word|counter word]] for [[Go stone|piece]]s and ''narabe'' means ''line-up''. The game is also popular in [[Korea]], where it is called ''omok'' (\uc624\ubaa9 [\u4e94\u76ee]) which has the same structure and origin as the Japanese name.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the game was introduced to Britain where it was known as '''Go Bang''', said to be a corruption of the Japanese word ''[[Go board|goban]]'', said to be adapted from Chinese ''k'i pan (q\u00ed p\u00e1n)'' \"go-board.\"<ref>OED citations: '''1886''' GUILLEMARD ''Cruise \u2018Marchesa\u2019'' I. 267 Some of the games are purely Japanese..as ''go-ban''. ''Note'', This game is the one lately introduced into England under the misspelt name of Go Bang. '''1888''' ''Pall Mall Gazette'' 1.

Obviously the cramped conditions would result in a draw most of the time, depending on the rules. Play would be easier on a larger Latrunculi board of 12x8 or even 10x11.\n.</ref>\n\n==Official rules==\nBesides many variations around the world, the '''Swap2''' rule (based on \"swap\" from [[Renju]]) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players, including Gomoku World Championships.\n\nIn Swap2 rule, the first player starts by placing three stones (2 black and 1 white, if black goes first) on the board.  The second player then selects one of three options: play black, play white and place one more stone, or place two more stones to and let the first player choose the color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://renju.net/media/showrule.php?rule=11|title=Gomoku - swap2 rule|last=|first=|date=|website=renju.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-09}}</ref><ref>http://gomokuworld.com/gomoku/2</ref> This is essentially a slightly more elaborate [[pie rule]].\n\nSwap2 solved the low complexity problem<ref name=\":0\" /> and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.\n\n==Variations==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2007}}\nMost variations are based on either '''Free-style gomoku''' or '''Standard gomoku'''.\n\n* '''Free-style gomoku''' requires a row of five or more stones for a win.\n* '''Standard gomoku''' requires a row of exactly five stones for a win: rows of six or more, called '''overlines''', do not count.\n\n===Optional (\"house\") rules===\nBlack (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, even before L. Victor Allis proved that black could force a win (see below). So a number of variations are played with extra rules that aimed to reduce black's advantage.\n\n* The rule of '''three and three''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).\n* The rule of '''four and four''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two rows of four stones (open or not).\n* Alternatively, a handicap may be given such that after the first \"three and three\" play has been made, the opposing player may place two stones as their next turn. These stones must block an opponent's row of three.\n* Efforts to improve fairness by reducing first-move advantage include the rule of '''swap''', generalizable as \"swap-(''x'',''y'',''z'')\" and characterizable as a partially compounded and partially iterated version of the [[pie rule]] (\"one person slices; the other chooses\"):  One player places on the board ''x'' stones of the first-moving color and a lesser number ''y'' stones of the second-moving color (\"slicing\" in the pie metaphor); the other player is entitled to choose between ''a'') playing from the starting position, in which case the selecting player is also entitled to choose which color to play, and ''b'') placing ''z'' (usually [(x - y) + 1]) more stones on the board at locations of that player's choice (\"reslicing\" in the pie metaphor, with limitations created by the board's existing setup akin to limitations arising from the existing slices in the pie), in which case the former player is entitled to choose which color side to play on.\n\n===Specific variations===\n* '''[[Renju]]''' is played on a 15\u00d715 board, with the rules of three and three, four and four, and overlines applied to Black only and with opening rules, some of which are following the ''swap'' pattern.\n* In '''Caro''' (also called Gomoku+, popular among Vietnamese), the winner must have an overline or an unbroken row of five stones that must not be blocked at '''both''' ends (overlines are immuned to this rule). This makes Gomoku more balanced and provides more power for White to defend.\n* '''Omok''' is played the same as Standard Gomoku; however, it is played on a 19\u00d719 board and include the rule of ''three and three''. The '''overlines''' rules, do not count.\n* '''Ninuki-renju''' or '''Wu''' is a variant which adds capturing to the game; it was published in the US in a slightly simplified form under the name renju.\n\n===Theoretical generalizations===\n* [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-games]] are a [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''\u00d7''n'' intersections, and ''k'' in a row needed to win.\n* Connect(''m'',''n'',''k'',''p'',''q'') games are another [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''\u00d7''n'' intersections, ''k'' in a row needed to win, ''p'' stones for each player to place, and ''q'' stones for the first player to place for the first move only. Each player may play only at the lowest unoccupied place in a column. In particular, Connect(''m'',''n'',6,2,1) is called [[Connect6]].\n\n==Example game==\n[[File:Gomoku-game-1.svg|thumb|300px|right|First game]]\nThis game on the 15\u00d715 board is adapted from the paper \"Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search\".<ref>Allis, L. V., Herik, H. J., & Huntjens, M. P. H. (1993). ''Go-moku and threat-space search''. University of Limburg, Department of Computer Science.</ref>\n\nThe opening moves show clearly black's advantage. An open row of three (one that is not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end) has to be blocked immediately, or countered with a threat elsewhere on the board. If not blocked or countered, the open row of three will be extended to an open row of four, which threatens to win in two ways.\n\nWhite has to block open rows of three at moves 10, 14, 16 and 20, but black only has to do so at move 9.\nMove 20 is a blunder for white (it should have been played next to black 19). Black can now force a win against any defence by white, starting with move 21.\n\n[[File:Gomoku-game-3.svg|thumb|300px|right|Second game (continuation from first game)]]\nThere are two forcing sequences for black, depending on whether white 22 is played next to black 15 or black 21. The diagram on the right shows the first sequence. All the moves for white are forced. Such long forcing sequences are typical in gomoku, and expert players can read out forcing sequences of 20 to 40 moves rapidly and accurately.\n\n[[File:Gomoku-game-2.svg|thumb|300px|right|Other second game]]\nThe diagram on the right shows the second forcing sequence. This diagram shows why white 20 was a blunder; if it had been next to black 19 (at the position of move 32 in this diagram) then black 31 would not be a threat and so the forcing sequence would fail.\n\n==World championships==\nWorld Championships in Gomoku have occurred 2 times in 1989, 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renju.net/media/gwc.php |title=The Renju International Federation portal - RenjuNet |publisher=Renju.net |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref>\nSince 2009 the tournament resumed, the opening rule being played was changed and now is swap2.\n\nList of the tournaments occurred and title holders follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ World Championship\n|-\n!Title year\n!Hosting city, country\n!Gold\n!Silver\n!Bronze\n!Opening rule\n|-\n|1989\n|{{flagdeco|Japan}} [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Sergey Chernov]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Yuriy Tarannikov]]\n|{{flagicon|Japan}} [[Hirouji Sakamoto]]\n|Pro\n|-\n|1991\n|{{flagdeco|Soviet Union}} [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0422\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447|Yuriy Tarannikov]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[Ando Meritee]]\n|{{flagicon|Soviet Union}} [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Sergey Chernov]]\n|Pro\n|-\n|2009\n|{{flagdeco|Czech Republic}} [[Pardubice]], [[Czech Republic]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Artur Tamio\u0142a]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Attila Demj\u00e1n]]\n|{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Pavel Laube]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2011\n|{{flagdeco|Sweden}} [[Huskvarna]], [[Sweden]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Attila Demj\u00e1n]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Artur Tamio\u0142a]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2013\n|{{flagdeco|Estonia}} [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Attila Demj\u00e1n]]\n|{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Pavel Laube]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Mikhail Kozhin]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2015\n|{{flagdeco|Russia}} [[Suzdal]], [[Russia]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Rudolf Dupszki]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Gerg\u0151 T\u00f3th]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Mikhail Kozhin]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2017\n|{{flagdeco|Czech Republic}} [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Zolt\u00e1n L\u00e1szl\u00f3]]\n|{{flagicon|Hungary}} [[Rudolf Dupszki]]\n|{{flagicon|Russia}} [[Denis Osipov (gomoku player)|Denis Osipov]]\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2019\n|{{flagdeco|Estonia}} [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]\n|{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Martin Muzika]]\n|{{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Oleg Bulatowsky]]\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski]]\n|Swap2\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <\n|+ Team World Championship\n|-\n!Title year\n!Hosting city, country\n!Gold\n!Silver\n!Bronze\n!Opening rule\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n|2016\n|{{flagdeco|Estonia}} [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]]\n|{{flag|Poland}} <br/> Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski <br/> Micha\u0142 Zajk <br/> \u0141ukasz Majksner <br/> Piotr Ma\u0142owiejski\n|{{flag|Czech Republic}} <br/> Pavel Laube <br/> Igor Eged <br/> \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Tesa\u0159\u00edk <br/> Marek Hanzl\n|{{flag|Chinese Taipei}} <br/> Lu Wei-Yuan <br/> Chen Ko-Han <br/> Chang Yi-Feng <br/> Sung Pei-Jung\n|Swap2\n|-\n|2018\n|{{flagdeco|Poland}} [[P\u0142ock]], [[Poland]]\n|{{flag|Russia}}-1 <br/> Edvard Rizvanov <br/> Denis Osipov <br/> Ilya Muratov <br/> Maksim Karasev <br/> Mikhail Kozhin\n|{{flag|Hungary}} <br/> Zolt\u00e1n L\u00e1szl\u00f3 <br/>  Gerg\u0151 T\u00f3th <br/>  M\u00e1rk Horv\u00e1th <br/> G\u00e1bor Gyenes <br/>  Attila Heged\u0171s\n|{{flag|Poland}} <br/> \u0141ukasz Majksner <br/> Micha\u0142 \u017bukowski <br/> Micha\u0142 Zajk <br/> Marek Gorzecki <br/> Pawe\u0142 Tarasi\u0144ski\n|Swap2\n|}\n\n== Computers and Gomoku ==\nPeople have been applying [[artificial intelligence]] techniques on playing gomoku for several decades.

In any size of a board, freestyle gomoku is an [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-game]], hence it is known that the first player can enforce a win or a draw. In 2001, Allis' winning strategy was also approved for renju, a variation of gomoku, when there was no limitation on the opening stage.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0cc4/0a7750b14ccf417faa39ac292e8d096617bc.pdf | author=J.

It attained district status in 1987. The district headquarters are located at [[Golaghat]]. The district occupies an area of 3502&nbsp;km\u00b2 and lies 100 m above sea level. As of 2001, Golaghat district has a population of 946,279. Hindus are 813,263. World famous Kaziranga National Park is situated in Golaghat district.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name 'Golaghat' originated from the markets established by a business class of people called 'Marwari' (who have their origins in [[Rajasthan]]) during the middle of 19th century at the bank of the river Dhansiri in the vicinity of the district headquarters. \"Gola\"  means market and \"Ghat\" means the port of river transport.\n\n== History ==\n[[Nagajari-Khanikargaon rock inscription|Inscription on rocks]] of Nagajari Khanikar village of Sarupathar, remnants of fortifications, brick structures, monuments, temples, [[Irrigation tank|tanks]], etc. are evidence of a 9th-century kingdom in the Doyang-Dhansiri valley. The Ahoms were the rulers of the Doyang-Dhansiri valley in the 16th century. Earlier, this part was ruled by the [[Kachari Kingdom|Kacharis]] known as [[Herombial]]. The [[Kachari Kingdom|Kacharis]] were pushed back towards west of the Karbi Hills. The Ahom King appointed a ruler entitled 'Morongi-Khowa Gohain', an administrative post with the Rank of a Governor/Minister of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] administration. Under Morongi-Khowa Gohain, large number of people from different parts of Ahom kingdom were settled in erstwhile Kachari Kingdom. An interesting aspect of such settlement was that a large number of people from different castes/communities were mixed up together so that there was remote chance of rebellion in such newly acquired territory. Most of the Morongi-Khowa Gohains were appointed from the [[Burhagohain]] families although there were few exceptions.

The Ahoms were the rulers of the Doyang-Dhansiri valley in the 16th century. Earlier, this part was ruled by the [[Kachari Kingdom|Kacharis]] known as [[Herombial]]. The [[Kachari Kingdom|Kacharis]] were pushed back towards west of the Karbi Hills. The Ahom King appointed a ruler entitled 'Morongi-Khowa Gohain', an administrative post with the Rank of a Governor/Minister of the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] administration. Under Morongi-Khowa Gohain, large number of people from different parts of Ahom kingdom were settled in erstwhile Kachari Kingdom. An interesting aspect of such settlement was that a large number of people from different castes/communities were mixed up together so that there was remote chance of rebellion in such newly acquired territory. Most of the Morongi-Khowa Gohains were appointed from the [[Burhagohain]] families although there were few exceptions. The Numaligarh was a Fort built by Numal Gohain, a young Ahom prince, which served as the administrative headquarters of the 'Morongi-Khowa Gohain' and also as a border trade post with the Nagas, Kacharis, Dimasas and other such [[Hill tribes of Northeast India|hill people]].\n\nLater, when the British took control of Assam, the Doyang-Dhansiri valley was incorporated under the newly formed Golaghat subdivision of the [[Sibsagar]] district in 1846.
