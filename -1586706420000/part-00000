It can be used to detect [[aircraft]], [[Marine radar|ships]], [[spacecraft]], [[guided missiles]], [[motor vehicle]]s, [[Weather radar|weather formations]], and [[terrain-following radar|terrain]]. A radar system consists of a [[transmitter]] producing [[electromagnetic wave]]s in the [[radio spectrum|radio]] or [[microwave]]s domain, a transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a [[radio receiver|receiver]] and [[Data processing system|processor]] to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.\n\nRadar was developed secretly for [[military]] use by several nations in the period before and during [[World War II]]. A key development was the [[cavity magnetron]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. The term ''RADAR'' was coined in 1940 by the [[United States Navy]] as an [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] for '''RA'''dio '''D'''etection '''A'''nd '''R'''anging.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2alpha/alpha-fra.html?lang=fra&i=1&index=ent&__index=ent&srchtxt=radar&comencsrch.x=0&comencsrch.y=0 | title= Radar definition | publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada | author = Translation Bureau | year= 2013 | accessdate= November 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>McGraw-Hill dictionary of scientific and technical terms / Daniel N.

The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, [[radar astronomy]], [[antiaircraft warfare|air-defense systems]], [[close-in weapon system|antimissile systems]], [[marine radar]]s to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anticollision systems, [[Research vessel|ocean surveillance]] systems, outer [[space surveillance]] and [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] systems, [[meteorology|meteorological]] precipitation monitoring, altimetry and [[flight control system]]s, [[Precision-guided munition|guided missile]] target locating systems, and [[ground-penetrating radar]] for geological observations. High tech radar systems are associated with [[digital signal processing]], [[machine learning]] and are capable of extracting useful information from very high [[noise (electronics)|noise]] levels. Radar is a key technology that the self-driving systems are mainly designed to use, along with sonar and other sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nees|first=Michael A.|date=September 2016|title=Acceptance of Self-driving Cars: An Examination of Idealized versus Realistic Portrayals with a Self- driving Car Acceptance Scale|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1449\u20131453|doi=10.1177/1541931213601332|issn=1541-9312|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/087370610f3c97f701728b92e8851f51e90144d0}}</ref>\n\nOther systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

In 1895, [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]], a physics instructor at the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] school in [[Kronstadt]], developed an apparatus using a [[coherer]] tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a [[spark-gap transmitter]]. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the [[Baltic Sea]], he took note of an [[interference beat]] caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation.<ref>Kostenko, A.A., A.I. Nosich, and I.A.

Through his lightning experiments, Watson-Watt became an expert on the use of [[radio direction finding]] before turning his inquiry to [[shortwave]] transmission. Requiring a suitable receiver for such studies, he told the \"new boy\" [[Arnold Frederic Wilkins]] to conduct an extensive review of available shortwave units. Wilkins would select a [[General Post Office]] model after noting its manual's description of a \"fading\" effect (the common term for interference at the time) when aircraft flew overhead.\n\nAcross the Atlantic in 1922, after placing a transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the [[Potomac River]], U.S. Navy researchers [[A. Hoyt Taylor]] and [[Leo C. Young]] discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, [[Lawrence A. Hyland]] at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application<ref>Hyland, L.A, A.H. Taylor, and L.C.

Work there resulted in the design and installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called \"[[Chain Home]]\" along the East and South coasts of England in time for the outbreak of World War II in 1939. This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the [[Battle of Britain]]; without it, significant numbers of fighter aircraft, which Great Britain did not have available, would always need to be in the air to respond quickly. If enemy aircraft detection relied solely on the observations of ground-based individuals, Great Britain may have lost the Battle of Britain. Also vital was the \"[[Dowding system]]\" of reporting and coordination to provide the best use of radar information during the tests of early radar [[Chain Home#Deployment|deployment]] during 1936 and 1937.\n\nGiven all required funding and development support, the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment. By 1936, the first five [[Chain Home]] (CH) systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland. Even by standards of the era, CH was crude; instead of broadcasting and receiving from an aimed antenna, CH broadcast a signal floodlighting the entire area in front of it, and then used one of Watson-Watt's own radio direction finders to determine the direction of the returned echoes. This fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies.\n\n===During World War II===\n{{main|Radar in World War II}}\nA key development was the [[cavity magnetron]] in the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution.

Human activities are detected by classifying the radar return patterns using machine learning algorithms.\n\n==Principles==\n===Radar signal===\n{{further|Radar signal characteristics}}\nA radar system has a [[transmitter]] that emits [[radio wave]]s known as ''radar signals'' in predetermined directions. When these signals contact an object they are usually [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] or [[scattering|scattered]] in many directions, although some of them will be absorbed and penetrate into the target. Radar signals are reflected especially well by materials of considerable [[electrical conductivity]]\u2014such as most metals, [[seawater]], and wet ground. This makes the use of [[radar altimeter]]s possible in certain cases. The radar signals that are reflected back towards the radar receiver are the desirable ones that make radar detection work. If the object is ''moving'' either toward or away from the transmitter, there will be a slight change in the [[frequency]] of the radio waves due to the [[Doppler effect]].\n\nRadar receivers are usually, but not always, in the same location as the transmitter. The reflected radar signals captured by the receiving antenna are usually very weak. They can be strengthened by [[Amplifier|electronic amplifiers]]. More sophisticated methods of [[signal processing]] are also used in order to recover useful radar signals.\n\nThe weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which they pass is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges\u2014ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as [[visible light]], [[infrared light]], and [[ultraviolet light]], are too strongly attenuated. Weather phenomena, such as fog, clouds, rain, falling snow, and sleet, that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or atmospheric gases (especially oxygen) are avoided when designing radars, except when their detection is intended.\n\n=== Illumination ===\n\nRadar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from the [[Sun]] or the [[Moon]], or from [[electromagnetic wave]]s emitted by the target objects themselves, such as infrared radiation (heat). This process of directing artificial radio waves towards objects is called ''illumination'', although radio waves are invisible to the human eye as well as optical cameras.\n\n===Reflection===\n{{main|Reflection (physics)}}\n[[File:weather radar.jpg|thumb|Brightness can indicate reflectivity as in this 1960 [[weather radar]] image (of [[1960 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Abby|Hurricane Abby]]). The radar's frequency, pulse form, polarization, signal processing, and antenna determine what it can observe.]]\n\nIf [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] travelling through one material meet another material, having a different [[dielectric constant]] or [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic constant]] from the first,\nthe waves will reflect or scatter from the boundary between the materials. This means that a solid object in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] or in a [[vacuum]], or a significant change in atomic density between the object and what is surrounding it, will usually scatter radar (radio) waves from its surface. This is particularly true for [[electrical conduction|electrically conductive]] materials such as metal and carbon fibre, making radar well-suited to the detection of aircraft and ships. [[Radar absorbing material]], containing [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] and sometimes [[magnetism|magnetic]] substances, is used on military vehicles to [[stealth technology|reduce radar reflection]]. This is the radio equivalent of painting something a dark colour so that it cannot be seen by the eye at night.\n\nRadar waves scatter in a variety of ways depending on the size (wavelength) of the radio wave and the shape of the target. If the wavelength is much shorter than the target's size, the wave will bounce off in a way similar to the way light is reflected by a [[mirror]]. If the wavelength is much longer than the size of the target, the target may not be visible because of poor reflection. Low-frequency radar technology is dependent on resonances for detection, but not identification, of targets. This is described by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an effect that creates Earth's blue sky and red [[sunset]]s. When the two length scales are comparable, there may be [[resonance]]s. Early radars used very long wavelengths that were larger than the targets and thus received a vague signal, whereas many modern systems use shorter wavelengths (a few [[centimeter|centimetres]] or less) that can image objects as small as a loaf of bread.\n\nShort radio waves reflect from curves and corners in a way similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most reflective targets for short wavelengths have 90\u00b0 angles between the [[reflection (physics)|reflective surfaces]]. A [[corner reflector]] consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the inside corner of a box. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to \"odd\" looking [[stealth aircraft]]. These precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of [[diffraction]], especially at longer wavelengths. Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]], are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its [[radar cross section]].\n\n===Radar range equation===\nThe power ''P<sub>r</sub>'' returning to the receiving antenna is given by the equation:\n\n:<math>P_{r}=\\frac{P_{t}G_{t}A_{r}\\sigma F^{4}}{{(4\\pi )}^{2}R_{t}^{2}R_{r}^{2}}</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''P''<sub>t</sub> = transmitter power\n* ''G''<sub>t</sub> = [[Antenna gain|gain]] of the transmitting antenna\n* ''A''<sub>r</sub> = [[effective aperture]] (area) of the receiving antenna; this can also be expressed as <math>{G_r\\lambda^2}\\over{4\\pi}</math>, where\n:* <math>\\lambda</math> = transmitted wavelength\n:* ''G''<sub>r</sub> = gain of receiving antenna<ref>{{cite book |last= Stimson |first= George |date=1998 |title=Introduction to Airborne Radar |url= |location= |publisher= SciTech Publishing Inc. |page=98 |isbn=978-1-891121-01-2 |access-date= }}</ref>\n* ''\u03c3'' = [[radar cross section]], or scattering coefficient, of the target\n* ''F'' = pattern propagation factor\n* ''R''<sub>t</sub> = distance from the transmitter to the target\n* ''R''<sub>r</sub> = distance from the target to the receiver.\n\nIn the common case where the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location, ''R''<sub>t</sub> = ''R''<sub>r</sub> and the term ''R''<sub>t</sub>\u00b2 ''R''<sub>r</sub>\u00b2 can be replaced by ''R''<sup>4</sup>, where ''R'' is the range.\nThis yields:\n:<math>P_r = {{P_t G_t  A_r \\sigma F^4}\\over{{(4\\pi)}^2 R^4}}.</math>\n\nThis shows that the received power declines as the fourth power of the range, which means that the received power from distant targets is relatively very small.\n\nAdditional filtering and pulse integration modifies the radar equation slightly for [[Pulse-Doppler radar#Performance|pulse-Doppler radar performance]], which can be used to increase detection range and reduce transmit power.\n\nThe equation above with ''F'' = 1 is a simplification for transmission in a [[vacuum]] without interference. The propagation factor accounts for the effects of [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] and shadowing and depends on the details of the environment. In a real-world situation, [[pathloss]] effects should also be considered.\n\n===Doppler effect===\n{{Main|Doppler radar|Pulse-Doppler radar}}\nFrequency shift is caused by motion that changes the number of wavelengths between the reflector and the radar. This can degrade or enhance radar performance depending upon how it affects the detection process. As an example, [[Moving Target Indication]] can interact with Doppler to produce signal cancellation at certain radial velocities, which degrades performance.\n\nSea-based radar systems, [[semi-active radar homing]], [[active radar homing]], [[weather radar]], military aircraft, and [[radar astronomy]] rely on the Doppler effect to enhance performance. This produces information about target velocity during the detection process. This also allows small objects to be detected in an environment containing much larger nearby slow moving objects.\n\nDoppler shift depends upon whether the radar configuration is active or passive. Active radar transmits a signal that is reflected back to the receiver. Passive radar depends upon the object sending a signal to the receiver.\n\nThe Doppler frequency shift for active radar is as follows, where <math>F_D</math> is Doppler frequency, <math>F_T</math> is transmit frequency, <math>V_R</math> is radial velocity, and <math>C</math> is the speed of light:<ref>{{cite news|title=Exploration: The Doppler Effect|author=M. Castelaz|publisher=Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute}}</ref>\n\n:<math>F_D =  2 \\times F_T \\times \\left (\\frac {V_R}{C} \\right)</math>.\n\nPassive radar is applicable to [[electronic countermeasures]] and [[radio astronomy]] as follows:\n\n:<math>F_D = F_T \\times \\left (\\frac {V_R}{C} \\right)</math>.\n\nOnly the radial component of the velocity is relevant. When the reflector is moving at right angle to the radar beam, it has no relative velocity. Vehicles and weather moving parallel to the radar beam produce the maximum Doppler frequency shift.\n\nWhen the transmit frequency (<math>F_T</math>) is pulsed, using a pulse repeat frequency of <math>F_R</math>, the resulting frequency spectrum will contain harmonic frequencies above and below <math>F_T</math> with a distance of <math>F_R</math>. As a result, the Doppler measurement is only non-ambiguous if the Doppler frequency shift is less than half of <math>F_R</math>, called the [[Nyquist frequency]], since the returned frequency otherwise cannot be distinguished from shifting of a harmonic frequency above or below, thus requiring:\n\n:<math>|F_D| < \\frac {F_R}{2}</math>\n\nOr when substituting with <math>F_D</math>:\n\n:<math>|V_R| < \\frac {F_R \\times \\frac {C}{F_T}}{4}</math>\n\nAs an example, a Doppler weather radar with a pulse rate of 2&nbsp;kHz and transmit frequency of 1&nbsp;GHz can reliably measure weather speed up to at most {{convert|150|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}, thus cannot reliably determine radial velocity of aircraft moving {{convert|1,000|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Polarization===\n{{further|Polarization (waves)}}\nIn all [[electromagnetic radiation]], the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the wave. For a transmitted radar signal, the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections. For example, [[circular polarization]] is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. [[Linear polarization]] returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a [[fractal]] surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.\n\n===Limiting factors===\n\n====Beam path and range====\n{{see also|Beam forming|Over-the-horizon radar}}\n[[File:Radar-hauteur-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Echo heights above ground<br/><math>H=\\left (\\sqrt{r^{2}+(k_{e}a_{e})^{2}+2rk_{e}a_{e}sin(\\theta _{e})} \\right )-k_{e}a_{e}+h_{a}</math> <br/>Where : <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;r : distance radar-target <br/>ke : 4/3 <br/>ae : Earth radius <br/>\u03b8e : elevation angle above the radar horizon <br/>ha : height of the feedhorn above ground]]\nA radar beam follows a linear path in vacuum but follows a somewhat curved path in atmosphere due to variation in the [[refractive index]] of air, which is called the [[radar horizon]]. Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, the beam rises above the ground as the [[Figure of the Earth|curvature of the Earth]] sinks below the horizon. Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium the beam crosses, and the beam disperses.\n\nThe maximum range of conventional radar can be limited by a number of factors:\n* Line of sight, which depends on the height above the ground. Without a direct line of sight, the path of the beam is blocked.\n* The maximum non-ambiguous range, which is determined by the [[pulse repetition frequency]]. The maximum non-ambiguous range is the distance the pulse can travel to and return from before the next pulse is emitted.\n* Radar sensitivity and the power of the return signal as computed in the radar equation. This component includes factors such as the environmental conditions and the size (or radar cross section) of the target.\n\n====Noise====\n{{main|Noise (electronics)|Noise (radio)}}\nSignal noise is an internal source of random variations in the signal, which is generated by all electronic components.\n\nReflected signals decline rapidly as distance increases, so noise introduces a radar range limitation. The [[noise floor]] and [[signal to noise ratio]] are two different [[Test and evaluation master plan#Measures of Performance|measures of performance]] that affect range performance. Reflectors that are too far away produce too little signal to exceed the noise floor and cannot be detected. [[Detection]] requires a signal that exceeds the [[noise floor]] by at least the [[signal to noise ratio]].\n\nNoise typically appears as random variations superimposed on the desired echo signal received in the radar receiver. The lower the power of the desired signal, the more difficult it is to discern it from the noise. [[Noise figure]] is a measure of the noise produced by a receiver compared to an ideal receiver, and this needs to be minimized.\n\n[[Shot noise]] is produced by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. Shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be [[flicker noise]] caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using [[heterodyne]] amplification. Another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved range resolution. The one notable exception to heterodyne (downconversion) radar systems is [[ultra-wideband]] radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see [[List of UWB channels]].\n\nNoise is also generated by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation of the background surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so \"cold\" that it generates very little [[thermal noise]]. The thermal noise is given by ''k<sub>B</sub> T B'', where ''T'' is temperature, ''B'' is bandwidth (post matched filter) and ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface it would appear that then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature ([[Planck Spectrum|Plank spectrum]]) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.\n\nNoise is random and target signals are not. Signal processing can take advantage of this phenomenon to reduce the noise floor using two strategies. The kind of signal integration used with [[Moving Target Indication|moving target indication]] can improve noise up to <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> for each stage. The signal can also be split among multiple filters for [[pulse-Doppler signal processing]], which reduces the noise floor by the number of filters. These improvements depend upon [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]].\n\n====Interference====\n{{main|Interference (wave propagation)}}\nRadar systems must overcome unwanted signals in order to focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.\n\n====Clutter====\n{{main|Clutter (radar)}}\nClutter refers to radio frequency (RF) echoes returned from targets which are uninteresting to the radar operators. Such targets include natural objects such as ground, sea, and when not being tasked for meteorological purposes, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (such as rain, snow or hail), [[sand storm]]s, animals (especially birds), atmospheric [[turbulence]], and other atmospheric effects, such as [[ionosphere]] reflections, [[meteor]] trails, and [[Hail spike]]. Clutter may also be returned from man-made objects such as buildings and, intentionally, by radar countermeasures such as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]].\n\nSome clutter may also be caused by a long radar [[waveguide]] between the radar transceiver and the antenna. In a typical [[plan position indicator]] (PPI) radar with a rotating antenna, this will usually be seen as a \"sun\" or \"sunburst\" in the centre of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide. Adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range, since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmit pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna. Clutter is considered a passive interference source, since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar.\n\nClutter is detected and neutralized in several ways. Clutter tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all stationary echoes can be eliminated. Sea clutter can be reduced by using horizontal polarization, while rain is reduced with [[circular polarization]] (meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use [[linear polarization]] to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.\n\nClutter moves with the wind or is stationary. Two common strategies to improve [[Test and evaluation master plan#Measures of Performance|measure or performance]] in a clutter environment are:\n:* Moving target indication, which integrates successive pulses and\n:* Doppler processing, which uses filters to separate clutter from desirable signals.\n\nThe most effective clutter reduction technique is [[pulse-Doppler radar]]. Doppler separates clutter from aircraft and spacecraft using a [[Radar signal characteristics#The radar signal in the frequency domain|frequency spectrum]], so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a [[moving target indicator]] that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as [[Radar signal characteristics#Unambiguous range|time-domain pulse-amplitude radar]].\n\n[[Constant False Alarm Rate|Constant false alarm rate]], a form of [[automatic gain control]] (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.\n\n[[File:Multipath propagation diagram en.svg|thumb|Radar multipath [[Light echo|echoes]] from a target cause ghosts to appear.]]\n\nClutter may also originate from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, [[atmospheric ducting]] or [[ionospheric reflection]]/[[refraction]] (e.g., [[anomalous propagation]]). This clutter type is especially bothersome since it appears to move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it on the basis of [[jitter]] or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA101208 |title= Investigation of Terrain Bounce Electronic Countermeasure |author=Strasser, Nancy C.|publisher=DTIC}}</ref> These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.\n\n====Jamming====\n{{main|Radar jamming and deception}}\nRadar jamming refers to radio frequency signals originating from sources outside the radar, transmitting in the radar's frequency and thereby masking targets of interest. Jamming may be intentional, as with an [[electronic warfare]] tactic, or unintentional, as with friendly forces operating equipment that transmits using the same frequency range. Jamming is considered an active interference source, since it is initiated by elements outside the radar and in general unrelated to the radar signals.\n\nJamming is problematic to radar since the jamming signal only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) and are therefore significantly reduced in power by the time they return to the radar receiver. Jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] from the jammer to the radar (''mainlobe jamming''). Jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receiver's [[sidelobe]]s (''sidelobe jamming'').\n\nMainlobe jamming can generally only be reduced by narrowing the mainlobe [[solid angle]] and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar. Sidelobe jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving sidelobes in the radar antenna design and by using an [[omnidirectional antenna]] to detect and disregard non-mainlobe signals. [[Electronic counter-counter-measures|Other anti-jamming techniques]] are [[frequency hopping]] and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]].\n\n==Radar signal processing==\n\n===Distance measurement===\n\n====Transit time====\n{{further|Time of flight}}\n[[File:Radaroperation.gif|thumb|right|Pulse radar: The round-trip time for the radar pulse to get to the target and return is measured. The distance is proportional to this time.]]\n[[File:Sonar Principle EN.svg|thumb|right|Continuous wave (CW) radar]]\n\nOne way to obtain a [[distance measurement]] is based on the [[time-of-flight]]: transmit a short pulse of radio signal (electromagnetic radiation) and measure the time it takes for the reflection to return. The distance is one-half the round trip time multiplied by the speed of the signal. The factor of one-half comes from the fact that the signal has to travel to the object and back again. Since radio waves travel at the [[speed of light]], accurate distance measurement requires high-speed electronics.\nIn most cases, the receiver does not detect the return while the signal is being transmitted. Through the use of a duplexer, the radar switches between transmitting and receiving at a predetermined rate.\nA similar effect imposes a maximum range as well. In order to maximize range, longer times between pulses should be used, referred to as a pulse repetition time, or its reciprocal, pulse repetition frequency.\n\nThese two effects tend to be at odds with each other, and it is not easy to combine both good short range and good long range in a single radar. This is because the short pulses needed for a good minimum range broadcast have less total energy, making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect. This could be offset by using more pulses, but this would shorten the maximum range. So each radar uses a particular type of signal. Long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them, and short range radars use smaller pulses with less time between them. As electronics have improved many radars now can change their pulse repetition frequency, thereby changing their range. The newest radars fire two pulses during one cell, one for short range (about {{convert|10|km|miles|abbr=on}}) and a separate signal for longer ranges (about {{convert|100|km|miles|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe distance [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and the characteristics of the received signal as compared to noise depends on the shape of the pulse. The pulse is often [[modulation|modulated]] to achieve better performance using a technique known as [[pulse compression]].\n\nDistance may also be measured as a function of time. The '''radar mile''' is the time it takes for a radar pulse to travel one [[nautical mile]], reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852&nbsp;m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458&nbsp;m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36&nbsp;\u03bcs in duration.\n\n====Frequency modulation====\n{{main|Frequency modulation}}\nAnother form of distance measuring radar is based on frequency modulation. Frequency comparison between two signals is considerably more accurate, even with older electronics, than timing the signal. By measuring the frequency of the returned signal and comparing that with the original, the difference can be easily measured.\n\nThis technique can be used in [[continuous wave radar]] and is often found in aircraft [[radar altimeter]]s. In these systems a \"carrier\" radar signal is frequency modulated in a predictable way, typically varying up and down with a [[sine wave]] or sawtooth pattern at audio frequencies. The signal is then sent out from one antenna and received on another, typically located on the bottom of the aircraft, and the signal can be continuously compared using a simple ''beat frequency'' modulator that produces an audio frequency tone from the returned signal and a portion of the transmitted signal.\n\nSince the signal frequency is changing, by the time the signal returns to the aircraft the transmit frequency has changed. The frequency shift is used to measure distance.\n\nThe [[Frequency modulation#Modulation index|modulation index]] riding on the receive signal is proportional to the time delay between the radar and the reflector. The frequency shift becomes greater with greater time delay. The frequency shift is directly proportional to the distance travelled. That distance can be displayed on an instrument, and it may also be available via the [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]]. This signal processing is similar to that used in speed detecting Doppler radar. Example systems using this approach are [[AZUSA]], [[MISTRAM]], and [[UDOP]].\n\nA further advantage is that the radar can operate effectively at relatively low frequencies. This was important in the early development of this type when high frequency signal generation was difficult or expensive.\n\nTerrestrial radar uses low-power FM signals that cover a larger frequency range. The multiple reflections are analyzed mathematically for pattern changes with multiple passes creating a computerized synthetic image. Doppler effects are used which allows slow moving objects to be detected as well as largely eliminating \"noise\" from the surfaces of bodies of water.\n\n===Speed measurement===\n[[Speed]] is the change in distance to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity to see where the target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making [[grease pencil]] marks on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a [[slide rule]]. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.\n\nIf the transmitter's output is coherent (phase synchronized), there is another effect that can be used to make almost instant speed measurements (no memory is required), known as the [[Doppler effect]]. Most modern radar systems use this principle into [[Doppler radar]] and [[pulse-Doppler radar]] systems ([[weather radar]], military radar). The Doppler effect is only able to determine the relative speed of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target. Any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the Doppler effect alone, but it can be determined by tracking the target's [[azimuth]] over time.\n\nIt is possible to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing, known as a [[continuous-wave radar]] (CW radar), by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency. CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a target's velocity. CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure vehicle speed quickly and accurately where range is not important.\n\nWhen using a pulsed radar, the variation between the phase of successive returns gives the distance the target has moved between pulses, and thus its speed can be calculated.\nOther mathematical developments in radar signal processing include [[time-frequency analysis]] (Weyl Heisenberg or [[wavelet]]), as well as the [[chirplet transform]] which makes use of the change of frequency of returns from moving targets (\"chirp\").\n\n===Pulse-Doppler signal processing===\n{{main|Pulse-Doppler signal processing}}\n[[File:Pulse doppler signal processing.png|thumb|Pulse-Doppler signal processing. The ''Range Sample'' axis represents individual samples taken in between each transmit pulse. The ''Range Interval'' axis represents each successive transmit pulse interval during which samples are taken. The Fast Fourier Transform process converts time-domain samples into frequency domain spectra. This is sometimes called the ''bed of nails''.]]\n\nPulse-Doppler signal processing includes frequency filtering in the detection process. The space between each transmit pulse is divided into range cells or range gates. Each cell is filtered independently much like the process used by a [[spectrum analyzer]] to produce the display showing different frequencies. Each different distance produces a different spectrum. These spectra are used to perform the detection process. This is required to achieve acceptable performance in hostile environments involving weather, terrain, and electronic countermeasures.\n\nThe primary purpose is to measure both the amplitude and frequency of the aggregate reflected signal from multiple distances. This is used with [[weather radar]] to measure radial wind velocity and precipitation rate in each different volume of air. This is linked with computing systems to produce a real-time electronic weather map. Aircraft safety depends upon continuous access to accurate weather radar information that is used to prevent injuries and accidents. Weather radar uses a [[Pulse repetition frequency#Low PRF|low PRF]]. Coherency requirements are not as strict as those for military systems because individual signals ordinarily do not need to be separated. Less sophisticated filtering is required, and range ambiguity processing is not normally needed with weather radar in comparison with military radar intended to track air vehicles.\n\nThe alternate purpose is \"[[look-down/shoot-down]]\" capability required to improve military air combat survivability. Pulse-Doppler is also used for ground based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles.<ref name=\"mit1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mit.edu/~lrv/cornell/publications/Ground%20Surveillance%20Radars%20and%20Military%20Intelligence.pdf|title=Ground Surveillance Radars and Military Intelligence|publisher=Syracuse Research Corporation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922174712/http://www.mit.edu/~lrv/cornell/publications/Ground%20Surveillance%20Radars%20and%20Military%20Intelligence.pdf|archivedate=22 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0q1Pgz6Cm8|title=AN/PPS-5 Ground Surveillance Radar|publisher=YouTube; jaglavaksoldier's Channel}}</ref> Pulse-Doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation in close proximity to aircraft pilots, shipboard personnel, infantry, and artillery. Reflections from terrain, water, and weather produce signals much larger than aircraft and missiles, which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using [[nap-of-the-earth]] flying techniques and [[stealth technology]] to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy. Pulse-Doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness. This requires the use of medium pulse-repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range. Military applications require [[Pulse repetition frequency#Medium PRF|medium PRF]] which prevents range from being determined directly, and [[range ambiguity resolution]] processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals. Radial movement is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals. Pulse-Doppler signal processing also produces audible signals that can be used for threat identification.<ref name=\"mit1\"/>\n\n===Reduction of interference effects===\n[[Signal processing]] is employed in radar systems to reduce the [[#Interference|radar interference effects]]. Signal processing techniques include [[moving target indication]], [[Pulse-Doppler signal processing]], moving target detection processors, correlation with [[secondary surveillance radar]] targets, [[space-time adaptive processing]], and [[track-before-detect]]. [[Constant false alarm rate]] and [[digital terrain model]] processing are also used in clutter environments.\n\n===Plot and track extraction===\n{{Main|Track algorithm}}\n\nA Track algorithm is a radar performance enhancement strategy. Tracking algorithms provide the ability to predict future position of multiple moving objects based on the history of the individual positions being reported by sensor systems.\n\nHistorical information is accumulated and used to predict future position for use with air traffic control, threat estimation, combat system doctrine, gun aiming, and missile guidance. Position data is accumulated by radar sensors over the span of a few minutes.\n\nThere are four common track algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aticourses.com/fundamentals_radar_tracking.htm |title=Fundamentals of Radar Tracking |publisher=Applied Technology Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824221707/http://www.aticourses.com/fundamentals_radar_tracking.htm |archivedate=24 August 2011 }}</ref>\n* [[Nearest neighbour algorithm]]\n* [[Probabilistic data association filter|Probabilistic Data Association]]\n* Multiple Hypothesis Tracking\n* Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)\n\nRadar video returns from aircraft can be subjected to a plot extraction process whereby spurious and interfering signals are discarded. A sequence of target returns can be monitored through a device known as a plot extractor.\n\nThe non-relevant real time returns can be removed from the displayed information and a single plot displayed. In some radar systems, or alternatively in the command and control system to which the radar is connected, a [[radar tracker]] is used to associate the sequence of plots belonging to individual targets and estimate the targets' headings and speeds.\n\n==Engineering==\n{{main|Radar engineering details}}\n[[File:Radar composantes.svg|thumb|right|Radar components]]\nA radar's components are:\n* A [[transmitter]] that generates the radio signal with an oscillator such as a [[klystron]] or a [[magnetron]] and controls its duration by a [[modulator]].\n* A [[waveguide]] that links the transmitter and the antenna.\n* A [[duplexer]] that serves as a switch between the antenna and the transmitter or the receiver for the signal when the antenna is used in both situations.\n* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. Knowing the shape of the desired received signal (a pulse), an optimal receiver can be designed using a [[matched filter]].\n* A display processor to produce signals for human readable [[Radar display|output devices]].\n* An electronic section that controls all those devices and the antenna to perform the radar scan ordered by software.\n* A link to end user devices and displays.\n\n===Antenna design===\n{{main|Antenna (radio)}}\n[[File:Electronics Technician - Volume 7 - Figure 2-48.jpg|thumb|AS-3263/SPS-49(V) antenna (US Navy)]]\nRadio signals broadcast from a single antenna will spread out in all directions, and likewise a single antenna will receive signals equally from all directions. This leaves the radar with the problem of deciding where the target object is located.\n\nEarly systems tended to use [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional broadcast antennas]], with directional receiver antennas which were pointed in various directions. For instance, the first system to be deployed, Chain Home, used two straight antennas at [[right angle]]s for reception, each on a different display. The maximum return would be detected with an antenna at right angles to the target, and a minimum with the antenna pointed directly at it (end on). The operator could determine the direction to a target by [[rotation|rotating]] the antenna so one display showed a maximum while the other showed a minimum.\nOne serious limitation with this type of solution is that the broadcast is sent out in all directions, so the amount of energy in the direction being examined is [[inverse-square law|a small part]] of that transmitted. To get a reasonable amount of power on the \"target\", the transmitting aerial should also be directional.\n\n====Parabolic reflector====\n[[File:SPS-10 radar antenna on a Knox class frigate.jpg|thumb|right|Surveillance radar antenna]]\n{{main|Parabolic antenna}}\nMore modern systems use a steerable [[parabola|parabolic]] \"dish\" to create a tight broadcast beam, typically using the same dish as the receiver. Such systems often combine two radar frequencies in the same antenna in order to allow automatic steering, or ''radar lock''.\n\nParabolic reflectors can be either symmetric parabolas or spoiled parabolas:\nSymmetric parabolic antennas produce a narrow \"pencil\" beam in both the X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain. The [[NEXRAD]] [[Pulse-Doppler]] weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere. Spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively wide beam in the other. This feature is useful if target detection over a wide range of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions. Most 2D surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with a narrow azimuthal beamwidth and wide vertical beamwidth. This beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height. Conversely, so-called \"nodder\" height finding radars use a dish with a narrow vertical beamwidth and wide azimuthal beamwidth to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low azimuthal precision.\n\n====Types of scan====\n* Primary Scan: A scanning technique where the main antenna aerial is moved to produce a scanning beam, examples include circular scan, sector scan, etc.\n* Secondary Scan: A scanning technique where the antenna feed is moved to produce a scanning beam, examples include conical scan, unidirectional sector scan, lobe switching, etc.\n* Palmer Scan: A scanning technique that produces a scanning beam by moving the main antenna and its feed. A Palmer Scan is a combination of a Primary Scan and a Secondary Scan.\n* [[Conical scanning]]: The radar beam is rotated in a small circle around the \"boresight\" axis, which is pointed at the target.\n\n====Slotted waveguide====\n[[File:Radar antennas on USS Theodore Roosevelt SPS-64.jpg|right|thumb|Slotted waveguide antenna]]\n{{Main|Slotted waveguide}}\n\nApplied similarly to the parabolic reflector, the slotted waveguide is moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non-tracking surface scan systems, where the vertical pattern may remain constant. Owing to its lower cost and less wind exposure, shipboard, airport surface, and harbour surveillance radars now use this approach in preference to a parabolic antenna.\n\n====Phased array====\n[[File:PAVE PAWS Radar Clear AFS Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phased array]]: Not all radar antennas must rotate to scan the sky.]]\n{{Main|Phased array}}\nAnother method of steering is used in a [[phased array]] radar.\n\nPhased array antennas are composed of evenly spaced similar antenna elements, such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide. Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centreline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is [[antenna gain]]. The amount of cancellation is side-lobe suppression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/mode-s/sidelobe.html|title=Side-Lobe Suppression|publisher=MIT}}</ref>\n\nPhased array radars have been in use since the earliest years of radar in World War II ([[Mammut radar]]), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. Phased array radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example [[Safeguard Program]]). They are the heart of the ship-borne [[Aegis Combat System]] and the [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot Missile System]]. The massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, Phased array radars have been used in [[weather]] [[surveillance]]. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of Multi-Function Phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and flight monitoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mpar/|title=Multi-function Phased Array Radar (MPAR) Project|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=February 8, 2017|author-link=National Severe Storms Laboratory}}</ref>\n\nPhased array antennas can be built to conform to specific shapes, like missiles, infantry support vehicles, ships, and aircraft.\n\nAs the price of electronics has fallen, phased array radars have become more common. Almost all modern military radar systems are based on phased arrays, where the small additional cost is offset by the improved reliability of a system with no moving parts. Traditional moving-antenna designs are still widely used in roles where cost is a significant factor such as air traffic surveillance and similar systems.\n\nPhased array radars are valued for use in aircraft since they can track multiple targets. The first aircraft to use a phased array radar was the [[B-1B Lancer]]. The first fighter aircraft to use phased array radar was the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]]. The MiG-31M's SBI-16 [[Zaslon]] [[Passive electronically scanned array]] radar was considered to be the world's most powerful fighter radar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mig-31.htm|title=MiG-31 FOXHOUND|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org}}</ref> until the [[AN/APG-77]] [[Active electronically scanned array]] was introduced on the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]].\n\nPhased-array [[interferometry]] or [[aperture synthesis]] techniques, using an array of separate dishes that are phased into a single effective aperture, are not typical for radar applications, although they are widely used in [[radio astronomy]]. Because of the [[thinned array curse]], such multiple aperture arrays, when used in transmitters, result in narrow beams at the expense of reducing the total power transmitted to the target. In principle, such techniques could increase spatial resolution, but the lower power means that this is generally not effective.\n\n[[Synthetic aperture radar|Aperture synthesis]] by post-processing motion data from a single moving source, on the other hand, is widely used in space and [[airborne radar system]]s.\n\n===Frequency bands===\n{{Main|Radio spectrum#IEEE}}\n\nThe traditional band names originated as code-names during World War II and are still in military and aviation use throughout the world. They have been adopted in the United States by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] and internationally by the [[International Telecommunication Union]]. Most countries have additional regulations to control which parts of each band are available for civilian or military use.\n\nOther users of the radio spectrum, such as the [[broadcasting]] and [[electronic countermeasures]] industries, have replaced the traditional military designations with their own systems.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Radar frequency bands'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Band name!!Frequency range!!Wavelength range!!Notes\n|-\n|[[High frequency|HF]]||3\u201330 [[Megahertz|MHz]]||10\u2013100 [[metre|m]]||Coastal radar systems, [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]] (OTH) radars; 'high frequency'\n|-\n|[[VHF]]||30\u2013300&nbsp;MHz||1\u201310 m||Very long range, ground penetrating; 'very high frequency'\n|-\n|P||<&nbsp;300&nbsp;MHz||>&nbsp;1&nbsp;m||'P' for 'previous', applied retrospectively to early radar systems; essentially HF + VHF\n|-\n|[[UHF]]||300\u20131000&nbsp;MHz||0.3\u20131 m||Very long range (e.g. [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System|ballistic missile early warning]]), ground penetrating, foliage penetrating; 'ultra high frequency'\n|-\n|[[L band|L]]||1\u20132 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]||15\u201330 [[centimetre|cm]]||Long range air traffic control and [[surveillance]]; 'L' for 'long'\n|-\n|[[S band|S]]||2\u20134&nbsp;GHz||7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm||Moderate range surveillance, Terminal air traffic control, long-range weather, marine radar; 'S' for 'short'\n|-\n|[[C band (IEEE)|C]]||4\u20138&nbsp;GHz||3.75\u20137.5&nbsp;cm||Satellite transponders; a compromise (hence 'C') between X and S bands; weather; long range tracking\n|-\n|[[X band|X]]||8\u201312&nbsp;GHz||2.5\u20133.75&nbsp;cm||[[Missile]] guidance, [[marine radar]], weather, medium-resolution mapping and ground surveillance; in the United States the narrow range 10.525&nbsp;GHz \u00b125&nbsp;MHz is used for [[airport]] radar; short range tracking.

There are two different radar modulator designs:\n* High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu//08.transmitters/Radar%20Modulator.en.html|title=Radar Modulator|work=radartutorial.eu}}</ref> These modulators consist of a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply, a [[pulse forming network]], and a high voltage switch such as a [[thyratron]]. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]], a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as [[pulsed power]]. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.\n* Hybrid mixers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu//08.transmitters/Fully%20Coherent%20Radar.en.html|title=Fully Coherent Radar|work=radartutorial.eu}}</ref> fed by a waveform generator and an exciter for a complex but [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] waveform. This waveform can be generated by low power/low-voltage input signals. In this case the radar transmitter must be a power-amplifier, e.g., a [[klystron]] or a solid state transmitter. In this way, the transmitted pulse is intrapulse-modulated and the radar receiver must use [[pulse compression]] techniques.\n\n===Coolant===\n{{main|Coolant}}\nCoherent microwave amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like [[traveling wave tube|travelling wave tubes]] and [[klystron]]s, require liquid coolant. The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times more power than the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma into the path of the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and deionized water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cientificosaficionados.com/libros/CERN/vacio9-CERN.pdf | author = J.L. de Segovia | title = Physics of Outgassing | publisher = Instituto de F\u00edsica Aplicada, CETEF \"L.

It can be used to detect [[aircraft]], [[Marine radar|ships]], [[spacecraft]], [[guided missiles]], [[motor vehicle]]s, [[Weather radar|weather formations]], and [[terrain-following radar|terrain]]. A radar system consists of a [[transmitter]] producing [[electromagnetic wave]]s in the [[radio spectrum|radio]] or [[microwave]]s domain, a transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]], a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a [[radio receiver|receiver]] and [[Data processing system|processor]] to determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed.\n\nRadar was developed secretly for [[military]] use by several nations in the period before and during [[World War II]]. A key development was the [[cavity magnetron]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution.

Radar is a key technology that the self-driving systems are mainly designed to use, along with sonar and other sensors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nees|first=Michael A.|date=September 2016|title=Acceptance of Self-driving Cars: An Examination of Idealized versus Realistic Portrayals with a Self- driving Car Acceptance Scale|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1449\u20131453|doi=10.1177/1541931213601332|issn=1541-9312|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/087370610f3c97f701728b92e8851f51e90144d0}}</ref>\n\nOther systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].

In 1895, [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]], a physics instructor at the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] school in [[Kronstadt]], developed an apparatus using a [[coherer]] tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a [[spark-gap transmitter]]. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the [[Baltic Sea]], he took note of an [[interference beat]] caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation.<ref>Kostenko, A.A., A.I. Nosich, and I.A.

Through his lightning experiments, Watson-Watt became an expert on the use of [[radio direction finding]] before turning his inquiry to [[shortwave]] transmission. Requiring a suitable receiver for such studies, he told the \"new boy\" [[Arnold Frederic Wilkins]] to conduct an extensive review of available shortwave units. Wilkins would select a [[General Post Office]] model after noting its manual's description of a \"fading\" effect (the common term for interference at the time) when aircraft flew overhead.\n\nAcross the Atlantic in 1922, after placing a transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the [[Potomac River]], U.S. Navy researchers [[A. Hoyt Taylor]] and [[Leo C. Young]] discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, [[Lawrence A. Hyland]] at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application<ref>Hyland, L.A, A.H. Taylor, and L.C.

Work there resulted in the design and installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called \"[[Chain Home]]\" along the East and South coasts of England in time for the outbreak of World War II in 1939. This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the [[Battle of Britain]]; without it, significant numbers of fighter aircraft, which Great Britain did not have available, would always need to be in the air to respond quickly. If enemy aircraft detection relied solely on the observations of ground-based individuals, Great Britain may have lost the Battle of Britain. Also vital was the \"[[Dowding system]]\" of reporting and coordination to provide the best use of radar information during the tests of early radar [[Chain Home#Deployment|deployment]] during 1936 and 1937.\n\nGiven all required funding and development support, the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment. By 1936, the first five [[Chain Home]] (CH) systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland. Even by standards of the era, CH was crude; instead of broadcasting and receiving from an aimed antenna, CH broadcast a signal floodlighting the entire area in front of it, and then used one of Watson-Watt's own radio direction finders to determine the direction of the returned echoes. This fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies.\n\n===During World War II===\n{{main|Radar in World War II}}\nA key development was the [[cavity magnetron]] in the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution.

Human activities are detected by classifying the radar return patterns using machine learning algorithms.\n\n==Principles==\n===Radar signal===\n{{further|Radar signal characteristics}}\nA radar system has a [[transmitter]] that emits [[radio wave]]s known as ''radar signals'' in predetermined directions. When these signals contact an object they are usually [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] or [[scattering|scattered]] in many directions, although some of them will be absorbed and penetrate into the target. Radar signals are reflected especially well by materials of considerable [[electrical conductivity]]\u2014such as most metals, [[seawater]], and wet ground. This makes the use of [[radar altimeter]]s possible in certain cases. The radar signals that are reflected back towards the radar receiver are the desirable ones that make radar detection work. If the object is ''moving'' either toward or away from the transmitter, there will be a slight change in the [[frequency]] of the radio waves due to the [[Doppler effect]].\n\nRadar receivers are usually, but not always, in the same location as the transmitter. The reflected radar signals captured by the receiving antenna are usually very weak. They can be strengthened by [[Amplifier|electronic amplifiers]]. More sophisticated methods of [[signal processing]] are also used in order to recover useful radar signals.\n\nThe weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which they pass is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges\u2014ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as [[visible light]], [[infrared light]], and [[ultraviolet light]], are too strongly attenuated. Weather phenomena, such as fog, clouds, rain, falling snow, and sleet, that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or atmospheric gases (especially oxygen) are avoided when designing radars, except when their detection is intended.\n\n=== Illumination ===\n\nRadar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from the [[Sun]] or the [[Moon]], or from [[electromagnetic wave]]s emitted by the target objects themselves, such as infrared radiation (heat). This process of directing artificial radio waves towards objects is called ''illumination'', although radio waves are invisible to the human eye as well as optical cameras.\n\n===Reflection===\n{{main|Reflection (physics)}}\n[[File:weather radar.jpg|thumb|Brightness can indicate reflectivity as in this 1960 [[weather radar]] image (of [[1960 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Abby|Hurricane Abby]]). The radar's frequency, pulse form, polarization, signal processing, and antenna determine what it can observe.]]\n\nIf [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] travelling through one material meet another material, having a different [[dielectric constant]] or [[diamagnetism|diamagnetic constant]] from the first,\nthe waves will reflect or scatter from the boundary between the materials. This means that a solid object in [[Earth's atmosphere|air]] or in a [[vacuum]], or a significant change in atomic density between the object and what is surrounding it, will usually scatter radar (radio) waves from its surface. This is particularly true for [[electrical conduction|electrically conductive]] materials such as metal and carbon fibre, making radar well-suited to the detection of aircraft and ships. [[Radar absorbing material]], containing [[Electrical resistance|resistive]] and sometimes [[magnetism|magnetic]] substances, is used on military vehicles to [[stealth technology|reduce radar reflection]]. This is the radio equivalent of painting something a dark colour so that it cannot be seen by the eye at night.\n\nRadar waves scatter in a variety of ways depending on the size (wavelength) of the radio wave and the shape of the target. If the wavelength is much shorter than the target's size, the wave will bounce off in a way similar to the way light is reflected by a [[mirror]]. If the wavelength is much longer than the size of the target, the target may not be visible because of poor reflection. Low-frequency radar technology is dependent on resonances for detection, but not identification, of targets. This is described by [[Rayleigh scattering]], an effect that creates Earth's blue sky and red [[sunset]]s. When the two length scales are comparable, there may be [[resonance]]s. Early radars used very long wavelengths that were larger than the targets and thus received a vague signal, whereas many modern systems use shorter wavelengths (a few [[centimeter|centimetres]] or less) that can image objects as small as a loaf of bread.\n\nShort radio waves reflect from curves and corners in a way similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most reflective targets for short wavelengths have 90\u00b0 angles between the [[reflection (physics)|reflective surfaces]]. A [[corner reflector]] consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the inside corner of a box. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to \"odd\" looking [[stealth aircraft]]. These precautions do not completely eliminate reflection because of [[diffraction]], especially at longer wavelengths. Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]], are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its [[radar cross section]].\n\n===Radar range equation===\nThe power ''P<sub>r</sub>'' returning to the receiving antenna is given by the equation:\n\n:<math>P_{r}=\\frac{P_{t}G_{t}A_{r}\\sigma F^{4}}{{(4\\pi )}^{2}R_{t}^{2}R_{r}^{2}}</math>\n\nwhere\n* ''P''<sub>t</sub> = transmitter power\n* ''G''<sub>t</sub> = [[Antenna gain|gain]] of the transmitting antenna\n* ''A''<sub>r</sub> = [[effective aperture]] (area) of the receiving antenna; this can also be expressed as <math>{G_r\\lambda^2}\\over{4\\pi}</math>, where\n:* <math>\\lambda</math> = transmitted wavelength\n:* ''G''<sub>r</sub> = gain of receiving antenna<ref>{{cite book |last= Stimson |first= George |date=1998 |title=Introduction to Airborne Radar |url= |location= |publisher= SciTech Publishing Inc. |page=98 |isbn=978-1-891121-01-2 |access-date= }}</ref>\n* ''\u03c3'' = [[radar cross section]], or scattering coefficient, of the target\n* ''F'' = pattern propagation factor\n* ''R''<sub>t</sub> = distance from the transmitter to the target\n* ''R''<sub>r</sub> = distance from the target to the receiver.\n\nIn the common case where the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location, ''R''<sub>t</sub> = ''R''<sub>r</sub> and the term ''R''<sub>t</sub>\u00b2 ''R''<sub>r</sub>\u00b2 can be replaced by ''R''<sup>4</sup>, where ''R'' is the range.\nThis yields:\n:<math>P_r = {{P_t G_t  A_r \\sigma F^4}\\over{{(4\\pi)}^2 R^4}}.</math>\n\nThis shows that the received power declines as the fourth power of the range, which means that the received power from distant targets is relatively very small.\n\nAdditional filtering and pulse integration modifies the radar equation slightly for [[Pulse-Doppler radar#Performance|pulse-Doppler radar performance]], which can be used to increase detection range and reduce transmit power.\n\nThe equation above with ''F'' = 1 is a simplification for transmission in a [[vacuum]] without interference. The propagation factor accounts for the effects of [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] and shadowing and depends on the details of the environment. In a real-world situation, [[pathloss]] effects should also be considered.\n\n===Doppler effect===\n{{Main|Doppler radar|Pulse-Doppler radar}}\nFrequency shift is caused by motion that changes the number of wavelengths between the reflector and the radar. This can degrade or enhance radar performance depending upon how it affects the detection process. As an example, [[Moving Target Indication]] can interact with Doppler to produce signal cancellation at certain radial velocities, which degrades performance.\n\nSea-based radar systems, [[semi-active radar homing]], [[active radar homing]], [[weather radar]], military aircraft, and [[radar astronomy]] rely on the Doppler effect to enhance performance. This produces information about target velocity during the detection process. This also allows small objects to be detected in an environment containing much larger nearby slow moving objects.\n\nDoppler shift depends upon whether the radar configuration is active or passive. Active radar transmits a signal that is reflected back to the receiver. Passive radar depends upon the object sending a signal to the receiver.\n\nThe Doppler frequency shift for active radar is as follows, where <math>F_D</math> is Doppler frequency, <math>F_T</math> is transmit frequency, <math>V_R</math> is radial velocity, and <math>C</math> is the speed of light:<ref>{{cite news|title=Exploration: The Doppler Effect|author=M. Castelaz|publisher=Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute}}</ref>\n\n:<math>F_D =  2 \\times F_T \\times \\left (\\frac {V_R}{C} \\right)</math>.\n\nPassive radar is applicable to [[electronic countermeasures]] and [[radio astronomy]] as follows:\n\n:<math>F_D = F_T \\times \\left (\\frac {V_R}{C} \\right)</math>.\n\nOnly the radial component of the velocity is relevant. When the reflector is moving at right angle to the radar beam, it has no relative velocity. Vehicles and weather moving parallel to the radar beam produce the maximum Doppler frequency shift.\n\nWhen the transmit frequency (<math>F_T</math>) is pulsed, using a pulse repeat frequency of <math>F_R</math>, the resulting frequency spectrum will contain harmonic frequencies above and below <math>F_T</math> with a distance of <math>F_R</math>. As a result, the Doppler measurement is only non-ambiguous if the Doppler frequency shift is less than half of <math>F_R</math>, called the [[Nyquist frequency]], since the returned frequency otherwise cannot be distinguished from shifting of a harmonic frequency above or below, thus requiring:\n\n:<math>|F_D| < \\frac {F_R}{2}</math>\n\nOr when substituting with <math>F_D</math>:\n\n:<math>|V_R| < \\frac {F_R \\times \\frac {C}{F_T}}{4}</math>\n\nAs an example, a Doppler weather radar with a pulse rate of 2&nbsp;kHz and transmit frequency of 1&nbsp;GHz can reliably measure weather speed up to at most {{convert|150|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}, thus cannot reliably determine radial velocity of aircraft moving {{convert|1,000|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Polarization===\n{{further|Polarization (waves)}}\nIn all [[electromagnetic radiation]], the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of the wave. For a transmitted radar signal, the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections. For example, [[circular polarization]] is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. [[Linear polarization]] returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a [[fractal]] surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.\n\n===Limiting factors===\n\n====Beam path and range====\n{{see also|Beam forming|Over-the-horizon radar}}\n[[File:Radar-hauteur-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Echo heights above ground<br/><math>H=\\left (\\sqrt{r^{2}+(k_{e}a_{e})^{2}+2rk_{e}a_{e}sin(\\theta _{e})} \\right )-k_{e}a_{e}+h_{a}</math> <br/>Where : <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;r : distance radar-target <br/>ke : 4/3 <br/>ae : Earth radius <br/>\u03b8e : elevation angle above the radar horizon <br/>ha : height of the feedhorn above ground]]\nA radar beam follows a linear path in vacuum but follows a somewhat curved path in atmosphere due to variation in the [[refractive index]] of air, which is called the [[radar horizon]]. Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, the beam rises above the ground as the [[Figure of the Earth|curvature of the Earth]] sinks below the horizon. Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium the beam crosses, and the beam disperses.\n\nThe maximum range of conventional radar can be limited by a number of factors:\n* Line of sight, which depends on the height above the ground. Without a direct line of sight, the path of the beam is blocked.\n* The maximum non-ambiguous range, which is determined by the [[pulse repetition frequency]]. The maximum non-ambiguous range is the distance the pulse can travel to and return from before the next pulse is emitted.\n* Radar sensitivity and the power of the return signal as computed in the radar equation. This component includes factors such as the environmental conditions and the size (or radar cross section) of the target.\n\n====Noise====\n{{main|Noise (electronics)|Noise (radio)}}\nSignal noise is an internal source of random variations in the signal, which is generated by all electronic components.\n\nReflected signals decline rapidly as distance increases, so noise introduces a radar range limitation. The [[noise floor]] and [[signal to noise ratio]] are two different [[Test and evaluation master plan#Measures of Performance|measures of performance]] that affect range performance. Reflectors that are too far away produce too little signal to exceed the noise floor and cannot be detected. [[Detection]] requires a signal that exceeds the [[noise floor]] by at least the [[signal to noise ratio]].\n\nNoise typically appears as random variations superimposed on the desired echo signal received in the radar receiver. The lower the power of the desired signal, the more difficult it is to discern it from the noise. [[Noise figure]] is a measure of the noise produced by a receiver compared to an ideal receiver, and this needs to be minimized.\n\n[[Shot noise]] is produced by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. Shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be [[flicker noise]] caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using [[heterodyne]] amplification. Another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved range resolution. The one notable exception to heterodyne (downconversion) radar systems is [[ultra-wideband]] radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see [[List of UWB channels]].\n\nNoise is also generated by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation of the background surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so \"cold\" that it generates very little [[thermal noise]]. The thermal noise is given by ''k<sub>B</sub> T B'', where ''T'' is temperature, ''B'' is bandwidth (post matched filter) and ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface it would appear that then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature ([[Planck Spectrum|Plank spectrum]]) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.\n\nNoise is random and target signals are not. Signal processing can take advantage of this phenomenon to reduce the noise floor using two strategies. The kind of signal integration used with [[Moving Target Indication|moving target indication]] can improve noise up to <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> for each stage. The signal can also be split among multiple filters for [[pulse-Doppler signal processing]], which reduces the noise floor by the number of filters. These improvements depend upon [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]].\n\n====Interference====\n{{main|Interference (wave propagation)}}\nRadar systems must overcome unwanted signals in order to focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.\n\n====Clutter====\n{{main|Clutter (radar)}}\nClutter refers to radio frequency (RF) echoes returned from targets which are uninteresting to the radar operators. Such targets include natural objects such as ground, sea, and when not being tasked for meteorological purposes, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (such as rain, snow or hail), [[sand storm]]s, animals (especially birds), atmospheric [[turbulence]], and other atmospheric effects, such as [[ionosphere]] reflections, [[meteor]] trails, and [[Hail spike]]. Clutter may also be returned from man-made objects such as buildings and, intentionally, by radar countermeasures such as [[Chaff (countermeasure)|chaff]].\n\nSome clutter may also be caused by a long radar [[waveguide]] between the radar transceiver and the antenna. In a typical [[plan position indicator]] (PPI) radar with a rotating antenna, this will usually be seen as a \"sun\" or \"sunburst\" in the centre of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide. Adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range, since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmit pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna. Clutter is considered a passive interference source, since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar.\n\nClutter is detected and neutralized in several ways. Clutter tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all stationary echoes can be eliminated. Sea clutter can be reduced by using horizontal polarization, while rain is reduced with [[circular polarization]] (meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use [[linear polarization]] to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.\n\nClutter moves with the wind or is stationary. Two common strategies to improve [[Test and evaluation master plan#Measures of Performance|measure or performance]] in a clutter environment are:\n:* Moving target indication, which integrates successive pulses and\n:* Doppler processing, which uses filters to separate clutter from desirable signals.\n\nThe most effective clutter reduction technique is [[pulse-Doppler radar]]. Doppler separates clutter from aircraft and spacecraft using a [[Radar signal characteristics#The radar signal in the frequency domain|frequency spectrum]], so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a [[moving target indicator]] that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as [[Radar signal characteristics#Unambiguous range|time-domain pulse-amplitude radar]].\n\n[[Constant False Alarm Rate|Constant false alarm rate]], a form of [[automatic gain control]] (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.\n\n[[File:Multipath propagation diagram en.svg|thumb|Radar multipath [[Light echo|echoes]] from a target cause ghosts to appear.]]\n\nClutter may also originate from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, [[atmospheric ducting]] or [[ionospheric reflection]]/[[refraction]] (e.g., [[anomalous propagation]]). This clutter type is especially bothersome since it appears to move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it on the basis of [[jitter]] or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA101208 |title= Investigation of Terrain Bounce Electronic Countermeasure |author=Strasser, Nancy C.|publisher=DTIC}}</ref> These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar's surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.\n\n====Jamming====\n{{main|Radar jamming and deception}}\nRadar jamming refers to radio frequency signals originating from sources outside the radar, transmitting in the radar's frequency and thereby masking targets of interest. Jamming may be intentional, as with an [[electronic warfare]] tactic, or unintentional, as with friendly forces operating equipment that transmits using the same frequency range. Jamming is considered an active interference source, since it is initiated by elements outside the radar and in general unrelated to the radar signals.\n\nJamming is problematic to radar since the jamming signal only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) and are therefore significantly reduced in power by the time they return to the radar receiver. Jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] from the jammer to the radar (''mainlobe jamming''). Jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receiver's [[sidelobe]]s (''sidelobe jamming'').\n\nMainlobe jamming can generally only be reduced by narrowing the mainlobe [[solid angle]] and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar. Sidelobe jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving sidelobes in the radar antenna design and by using an [[omnidirectional antenna]] to detect and disregard non-mainlobe signals. [[Electronic counter-counter-measures|Other anti-jamming techniques]] are [[frequency hopping]] and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]].\n\n==Radar signal processing==\n\n===Distance measurement===\n\n====Transit time====\n{{further|Time of flight}}\n[[File:Radaroperation.gif|thumb|right|Pulse radar: The round-trip time for the radar pulse to get to the target and return is measured. The distance is proportional to this time.]]\n[[File:Sonar Principle EN.svg|thumb|right|Continuous wave (CW) radar]]\n\nOne way to obtain a [[distance measurement]] is based on the [[time-of-flight]]: transmit a short pulse of radio signal (electromagnetic radiation) and measure the time it takes for the reflection to return. The distance is one-half the round trip time multiplied by the speed of the signal. The factor of one-half comes from the fact that the signal has to travel to the object and back again. Since radio waves travel at the [[speed of light]], accurate distance measurement requires high-speed electronics.\nIn most cases, the receiver does not detect the return while the signal is being transmitted. Through the use of a duplexer, the radar switches between transmitting and receiving at a predetermined rate.\nA similar effect imposes a maximum range as well. In order to maximize range, longer times between pulses should be used, referred to as a pulse repetition time, or its reciprocal, pulse repetition frequency.\n\nThese two effects tend to be at odds with each other, and it is not easy to combine both good short range and good long range in a single radar. This is because the short pulses needed for a good minimum range broadcast have less total energy, making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect. This could be offset by using more pulses, but this would shorten the maximum range. So each radar uses a particular type of signal. Long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them, and short range radars use smaller pulses with less time between them. As electronics have improved many radars now can change their pulse repetition frequency, thereby changing their range. The newest radars fire two pulses during one cell, one for short range (about {{convert|10|km|miles|abbr=on}}) and a separate signal for longer ranges (about {{convert|100|km|miles|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe distance [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and the characteristics of the received signal as compared to noise depends on the shape of the pulse. The pulse is often [[modulation|modulated]] to achieve better performance using a technique known as [[pulse compression]].\n\nDistance may also be measured as a function of time. The '''radar mile''' is the time it takes for a radar pulse to travel one [[nautical mile]], reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852&nbsp;m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458&nbsp;m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36&nbsp;\u03bcs in duration.\n\n====Frequency modulation====\n{{main|Frequency modulation}}\nAnother form of distance measuring radar is based on frequency modulation. Frequency comparison between two signals is considerably more accurate, even with older electronics, than timing the signal. By measuring the frequency of the returned signal and comparing that with the original, the difference can be easily measured.\n\nThis technique can be used in [[continuous wave radar]] and is often found in aircraft [[radar altimeter]]s. In these systems a \"carrier\" radar signal is frequency modulated in a predictable way, typically varying up and down with a [[sine wave]] or sawtooth pattern at audio frequencies. The signal is then sent out from one antenna and received on another, typically located on the bottom of the aircraft, and the signal can be continuously compared using a simple ''beat frequency'' modulator that produces an audio frequency tone from the returned signal and a portion of the transmitted signal.\n\nSince the signal frequency is changing, by the time the signal returns to the aircraft the transmit frequency has changed. The frequency shift is used to measure distance.\n\nThe [[Frequency modulation#Modulation index|modulation index]] riding on the receive signal is proportional to the time delay between the radar and the reflector. The frequency shift becomes greater with greater time delay. The frequency shift is directly proportional to the distance travelled. That distance can be displayed on an instrument, and it may also be available via the [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponder]]. This signal processing is similar to that used in speed detecting Doppler radar. Example systems using this approach are [[AZUSA]], [[MISTRAM]], and [[UDOP]].\n\nA further advantage is that the radar can operate effectively at relatively low frequencies. This was important in the early development of this type when high frequency signal generation was difficult or expensive.\n\nTerrestrial radar uses low-power FM signals that cover a larger frequency range. The multiple reflections are analyzed mathematically for pattern changes with multiple passes creating a computerized synthetic image. Doppler effects are used which allows slow moving objects to be detected as well as largely eliminating \"noise\" from the surfaces of bodies of water.\n\n===Speed measurement===\n[[Speed]] is the change in distance to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity to see where the target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making [[grease pencil]] marks on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a [[slide rule]]. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.\n\nIf the transmitter's output is coherent (phase synchronized), there is another effect that can be used to make almost instant speed measurements (no memory is required), known as the [[Doppler effect]]. Most modern radar systems use this principle into [[Doppler radar]] and [[pulse-Doppler radar]] systems ([[weather radar]], military radar). The Doppler effect is only able to determine the relative speed of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target. Any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the Doppler effect alone, but it can be determined by tracking the target's [[azimuth]] over time.\n\nIt is possible to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing, known as a [[continuous-wave radar]] (CW radar), by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency. CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a target's velocity. CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure vehicle speed quickly and accurately where range is not important.\n\nWhen using a pulsed radar, the variation between the phase of successive returns gives the distance the target has moved between pulses, and thus its speed can be calculated.\nOther mathematical developments in radar signal processing include [[time-frequency analysis]] (Weyl Heisenberg or [[wavelet]]), as well as the [[chirplet transform]] which makes use of the change of frequency of returns from moving targets (\"chirp\").\n\n===Pulse-Doppler signal processing===\n{{main|Pulse-Doppler signal processing}}\n[[File:Pulse doppler signal processing.png|thumb|Pulse-Doppler signal processing. The ''Range Sample'' axis represents individual samples taken in between each transmit pulse. The ''Range Interval'' axis represents each successive transmit pulse interval during which samples are taken. The Fast Fourier Transform process converts time-domain samples into frequency domain spectra. This is sometimes called the ''bed of nails''.]]\n\nPulse-Doppler signal processing includes frequency filtering in the detection process. The space between each transmit pulse is divided into range cells or range gates. Each cell is filtered independently much like the process used by a [[spectrum analyzer]] to produce the display showing different frequencies. Each different distance produces a different spectrum. These spectra are used to perform the detection process. This is required to achieve acceptable performance in hostile environments involving weather, terrain, and electronic countermeasures.\n\nThe primary purpose is to measure both the amplitude and frequency of the aggregate reflected signal from multiple distances. This is used with [[weather radar]] to measure radial wind velocity and precipitation rate in each different volume of air. This is linked with computing systems to produce a real-time electronic weather map. Aircraft safety depends upon continuous access to accurate weather radar information that is used to prevent injuries and accidents. Weather radar uses a [[Pulse repetition frequency#Low PRF|low PRF]]. Coherency requirements are not as strict as those for military systems because individual signals ordinarily do not need to be separated. Less sophisticated filtering is required, and range ambiguity processing is not normally needed with weather radar in comparison with military radar intended to track air vehicles.\n\nThe alternate purpose is \"[[look-down/shoot-down]]\" capability required to improve military air combat survivability. Pulse-Doppler is also used for ground based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles.<ref name=\"mit1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mit.edu/~lrv/cornell/publications/Ground%20Surveillance%20Radars%20and%20Military%20Intelligence.pdf|title=Ground Surveillance Radars and Military Intelligence|publisher=Syracuse Research Corporation; Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922174712/http://www.mit.edu/~lrv/cornell/publications/Ground%20Surveillance%20Radars%20and%20Military%20Intelligence.pdf|archivedate=22 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0q1Pgz6Cm8|title=AN/PPS-5 Ground Surveillance Radar|publisher=YouTube; jaglavaksoldier's Channel}}</ref> Pulse-Doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation in close proximity to aircraft pilots, shipboard personnel, infantry, and artillery. Reflections from terrain, water, and weather produce signals much larger than aircraft and missiles, which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using [[nap-of-the-earth]] flying techniques and [[stealth technology]] to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy. Pulse-Doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness. This requires the use of medium pulse-repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range. Military applications require [[Pulse repetition frequency#Medium PRF|medium PRF]] which prevents range from being determined directly, and [[range ambiguity resolution]] processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals. Radial movement is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals. Pulse-Doppler signal processing also produces audible signals that can be used for threat identification.<ref name=\"mit1\"/>\n\n===Reduction of interference effects===\n[[Signal processing]] is employed in radar systems to reduce the [[#Interference|radar interference effects]]. Signal processing techniques include [[moving target indication]], [[Pulse-Doppler signal processing]], moving target detection processors, correlation with [[secondary surveillance radar]] targets, [[space-time adaptive processing]], and [[track-before-detect]]. [[Constant false alarm rate]] and [[digital terrain model]] processing are also used in clutter environments.\n\n===Plot and track extraction===\n{{Main|Track algorithm}}\n\nA Track algorithm is a radar performance enhancement strategy. Tracking algorithms provide the ability to predict future position of multiple moving objects based on the history of the individual positions being reported by sensor systems.\n\nHistorical information is accumulated and used to predict future position for use with air traffic control, threat estimation, combat system doctrine, gun aiming, and missile guidance. Position data is accumulated by radar sensors over the span of a few minutes.\n\nThere are four common track algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aticourses.com/fundamentals_radar_tracking.htm |title=Fundamentals of Radar Tracking |publisher=Applied Technology Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824221707/http://www.aticourses.com/fundamentals_radar_tracking.htm |archivedate=24 August 2011 }}</ref>\n* [[Nearest neighbour algorithm]]\n* [[Probabilistic data association filter|Probabilistic Data Association]]\n* Multiple Hypothesis Tracking\n* Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)\n\nRadar video returns from aircraft can be subjected to a plot extraction process whereby spurious and interfering signals are discarded. A sequence of target returns can be monitored through a device known as a plot extractor.\n\nThe non-relevant real time returns can be removed from the displayed information and a single plot displayed. In some radar systems, or alternatively in the command and control system to which the radar is connected, a [[radar tracker]] is used to associate the sequence of plots belonging to individual targets and estimate the targets' headings and speeds.\n\n==Engineering==\n{{main|Radar engineering details}}\n[[File:Radar composantes.svg|thumb|right|Radar components]]\nA radar's components are:\n* A [[transmitter]] that generates the radio signal with an oscillator such as a [[klystron]] or a [[magnetron]] and controls its duration by a [[modulator]].\n* A [[waveguide]] that links the transmitter and the antenna.\n* A [[duplexer]] that serves as a switch between the antenna and the transmitter or the receiver for the signal when the antenna is used in both situations.\n* A [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. Knowing the shape of the desired received signal (a pulse), an optimal receiver can be designed using a [[matched filter]].\n* A display processor to produce signals for human readable [[Radar display|output devices]].\n* An electronic section that controls all those devices and the antenna to perform the radar scan ordered by software.\n* A link to end user devices and displays.\n\n===Antenna design===\n{{main|Antenna (radio)}}\n[[File:Electronics Technician - Volume 7 - Figure 2-48.jpg|thumb|AS-3263/SPS-49(V) antenna (US Navy)]]\nRadio signals broadcast from a single antenna will spread out in all directions, and likewise a single antenna will receive signals equally from all directions. This leaves the radar with the problem of deciding where the target object is located.\n\nEarly systems tended to use [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional broadcast antennas]], with directional receiver antennas which were pointed in various directions. For instance, the first system to be deployed, Chain Home, used two straight antennas at [[right angle]]s for reception, each on a different display. The maximum return would be detected with an antenna at right angles to the target, and a minimum with the antenna pointed directly at it (end on). The operator could determine the direction to a target by [[rotation|rotating]] the antenna so one display showed a maximum while the other showed a minimum.\nOne serious limitation with this type of solution is that the broadcast is sent out in all directions, so the amount of energy in the direction being examined is [[inverse-square law|a small part]] of that transmitted. To get a reasonable amount of power on the \"target\", the transmitting aerial should also be directional.\n\n====Parabolic reflector====\n[[File:SPS-10 radar antenna on a Knox class frigate.jpg|thumb|right|Surveillance radar antenna]]\n{{main|Parabolic antenna}}\nMore modern systems use a steerable [[parabola|parabolic]] \"dish\" to create a tight broadcast beam, typically using the same dish as the receiver. Such systems often combine two radar frequencies in the same antenna in order to allow automatic steering, or ''radar lock''.\n\nParabolic reflectors can be either symmetric parabolas or spoiled parabolas:\nSymmetric parabolic antennas produce a narrow \"pencil\" beam in both the X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain. The [[NEXRAD]] [[Pulse-Doppler]] weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere. Spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively wide beam in the other. This feature is useful if target detection over a wide range of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions. Most 2D surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with a narrow azimuthal beamwidth and wide vertical beamwidth. This beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height. Conversely, so-called \"nodder\" height finding radars use a dish with a narrow vertical beamwidth and wide azimuthal beamwidth to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low azimuthal precision.\n\n====Types of scan====\n* Primary Scan: A scanning technique where the main antenna aerial is moved to produce a scanning beam, examples include circular scan, sector scan, etc.\n* Secondary Scan: A scanning technique where the antenna feed is moved to produce a scanning beam, examples include conical scan, unidirectional sector scan, lobe switching, etc.\n* Palmer Scan: A scanning technique that produces a scanning beam by moving the main antenna and its feed. A Palmer Scan is a combination of a Primary Scan and a Secondary Scan.\n* [[Conical scanning]]: The radar beam is rotated in a small circle around the \"boresight\" axis, which is pointed at the target.\n\n====Slotted waveguide====\n[[File:Radar antennas on USS Theodore Roosevelt SPS-64.jpg|right|thumb|Slotted waveguide antenna]]\n{{Main|Slotted waveguide}}\n\nApplied similarly to the parabolic reflector, the slotted waveguide is moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non-tracking surface scan systems, where the vertical pattern may remain constant. Owing to its lower cost and less wind exposure, shipboard, airport surface, and harbour surveillance radars now use this approach in preference to a parabolic antenna.\n\n====Phased array====\n[[File:PAVE PAWS Radar Clear AFS Alaska.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phased array]]: Not all radar antennas must rotate to scan the sky.]]\n{{Main|Phased array}}\nAnother method of steering is used in a [[phased array]] radar.\n\nPhased array antennas are composed of evenly spaced similar antenna elements, such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide. Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centreline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is [[antenna gain]]. The amount of cancellation is side-lobe suppression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/mode-s/sidelobe.html|title=Side-Lobe Suppression|publisher=MIT}}</ref>\n\nPhased array radars have been in use since the earliest years of radar in World War II ([[Mammut radar]]), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. Phased array radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example [[Safeguard Program]]). They are the heart of the ship-borne [[Aegis Combat System]] and the [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot Missile System]]. The massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, Phased array radars have been used in [[weather]] [[surveillance]]. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of Multi-Function Phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and flight monitoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mpar/|title=Multi-function Phased Array Radar (MPAR) Project|author=National Severe Storms Laboratory|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=February 8, 2017|author-link=National Severe Storms Laboratory}}</ref>\n\nPhased array antennas can be built to conform to specific shapes, like missiles, infantry support vehicles, ships, and aircraft.\n\nAs the price of electronics has fallen, phased array radars have become more common. Almost all modern military radar systems are based on phased arrays, where the small additional cost is offset by the improved reliability of a system with no moving parts. Traditional moving-antenna designs are still widely used in roles where cost is a significant factor such as air traffic surveillance and similar systems.\n\nPhased array radars are valued for use in aircraft since they can track multiple targets. The first aircraft to use a phased array radar was the [[B-1B Lancer]]. The first fighter aircraft to use phased array radar was the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]]. The MiG-31M's SBI-16 [[Zaslon]] [[Passive electronically scanned array]] radar was considered to be the world's most powerful fighter radar,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mig-31.htm|title=MiG-31 FOXHOUND|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org}}</ref> until the [[AN/APG-77]] [[Active electronically scanned array]] was introduced on the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]].\n\nPhased-array [[interferometry]] or [[aperture synthesis]] techniques, using an array of separate dishes that are phased into a single effective aperture, are not typical for radar applications, although they are widely used in [[radio astronomy]]. Because of the [[thinned array curse]], such multiple aperture arrays, when used in transmitters, result in narrow beams at the expense of reducing the total power transmitted to the target. In principle, such techniques could increase spatial resolution, but the lower power means that this is generally not effective.\n\n[[Synthetic aperture radar|Aperture synthesis]] by post-processing motion data from a single moving source, on the other hand, is widely used in space and [[airborne radar system]]s.\n\n===Frequency bands===\n{{Main|Radio spectrum#IEEE}}\n\nThe traditional band names originated as code-names during World War II and are still in military and aviation use throughout the world. They have been adopted in the United States by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] and internationally by the [[International Telecommunication Union]]. Most countries have additional regulations to control which parts of each band are available for civilian or military use.\n\nOther users of the radio spectrum, such as the [[broadcasting]] and [[electronic countermeasures]] industries, have replaced the traditional military designations with their own systems.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Radar frequency bands'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!Band name!!Frequency range!!Wavelength range!!Notes\n|-\n|[[High frequency|HF]]||3\u201330 [[Megahertz|MHz]]||10\u2013100 [[metre|m]]||Coastal radar systems, [[over-the-horizon radar|over-the-horizon]] (OTH) radars; 'high frequency'\n|-\n|[[VHF]]||30\u2013300&nbsp;MHz||1\u201310 m||Very long range, ground penetrating; 'very high frequency'\n|-\n|P||<&nbsp;300&nbsp;MHz||>&nbsp;1&nbsp;m||'P' for 'previous', applied retrospectively to early radar systems; essentially HF + VHF\n|-\n|[[UHF]]||300\u20131000&nbsp;MHz||0.3\u20131 m||Very long range (e.g. [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System|ballistic missile early warning]]), ground penetrating, foliage penetrating; 'ultra high frequency'\n|-\n|[[L band|L]]||1\u20132 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]||15\u201330 [[centimetre|cm]]||Long range air traffic control and [[surveillance]]; 'L' for 'long'\n|-\n|[[S band|S]]||2\u20134&nbsp;GHz||7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm||Moderate range surveillance, Terminal air traffic control, long-range weather, marine radar; 'S' for 'short'\n|-\n|[[C band (IEEE)|C]]||4\u20138&nbsp;GHz||3.75\u20137.5&nbsp;cm||Satellite transponders; a compromise (hence 'C') between X and S bands; weather; long range tracking\n|-\n|[[X band|X]]||8\u201312&nbsp;GHz||2.5\u20133.75&nbsp;cm||[[Missile]] guidance, [[marine radar]], weather, medium-resolution mapping and ground surveillance; in the United States the narrow range 10.525&nbsp;GHz \u00b125&nbsp;MHz is used for [[airport]] radar; short range tracking.

There are two different radar modulator designs:\n* High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu//08.transmitters/Radar%20Modulator.en.html|title=Radar Modulator|work=radartutorial.eu}}</ref> These modulators consist of a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply, a [[pulse forming network]], and a high voltage switch such as a [[thyratron]]. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]], a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as [[pulsed power]]. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.\n* Hybrid mixers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu//08.transmitters/Fully%20Coherent%20Radar.en.html|title=Fully Coherent Radar|work=radartutorial.eu}}</ref> fed by a waveform generator and an exciter for a complex but [[Coherence (physics)|coherent]] waveform. This waveform can be generated by low power/low-voltage input signals. In this case the radar transmitter must be a power-amplifier, e.g., a [[klystron]] or a solid state transmitter. In this way, the transmitted pulse is intrapulse-modulated and the radar receiver must use [[pulse compression]] techniques.\n\n===Coolant===\n{{main|Coolant}}\nCoherent microwave amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like [[traveling wave tube|travelling wave tubes]] and [[klystron]]s, require liquid coolant. The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times more power than the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma into the path of the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and deionized water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that utilize Doppler processing.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cientificosaficionados.com/libros/CERN/vacio9-CERN.pdf | author = J.L. de Segovia | title = Physics of Outgassing | publisher = Instituto de F\u00edsica Aplicada, CETEF \"L.

At the age of nine the family, now including a younger sister, moved to the [[Cayman Islands]] where Owen attended Cayman Islands Middle School, while nurturing a life long love of the ocean. Upon returning to the UK the family, missing the warm weather and sea air, moved to [[St_Ives,_Cornwall|St. Ives]] in [[Cornwall]] at the south-western tip of the country. Here Owen attended both [[Mounts_Bay_Academy|Mounts Bay School]] and [[Truro_and_Penwith_College|Penwith Sixth Form College]] before heading to [[University_of_Plymouth|Plymouth University]] in [[Plymouth]], UK, to study for a Bachelor's Degree in Underwater [[Science]]. At various points, Owen has worked as a grocery packer, [[marina]] fuel attendant, [[milkman]], [[Q-Zar|Quasar]] attendant, commercial boatman, pool lifeguard, [[Muay_Thai|thai-boxing]] instructor, and [[Surf_lifesaving|beach lifeguard]].

Composed by [[David Bryan]] from [[Bon Jovi]], and directed by [[Christopher Ashley]], this marked his sixth win/nomination in a row. He also received the prestigious Pro Sound Award for his work on the same production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundawards.com//|title=Pro Sound Award for Best Theatre Sound|work=The Pro Sound

Award-winning/nominated [[sound design]]er specialising in [[musical theatre]] in London's [[West_End_theatre|West End]], on [[Broadway_Theatre|Broadway]] and internationally.\n\n==Early life==\n\nGareth John Owen was born in [[Sheffield]], [[United Kingdom]], a son of two teachers, both of whom specialised in special needs. At the age of nine the family, now including a younger sister, moved to the [[Cayman Islands]] where Owen attended Cayman Islands Middle School, while nurturing a life long love of the ocean. Upon returning to the UK the family, missing the warm weather and sea air, moved to [[St_Ives,_Cornwall|St. Ives]] in [[Cornwall]] at the south-western tip of the country. Here Owen attended both [[Mounts_Bay_Academy|Mounts Bay School]] and [[Truro_and_Penwith_College|Penwith Sixth Form College]] before heading to [[University_of_Plymouth|Plymouth University]] in [[Plymouth]], UK, to study for a Bachelor's Degree in Underwater [[Science]]. At various points, Owen has worked as a grocery packer, [[marina]] fuel attendant, [[milkman]], [[Q-Zar|Quasar]] attendant, commercial boatman, pool lifeguard, [[Muay_Thai|thai-boxing]] instructor, and [[Surf_lifesaving|beach lifeguard]].

''City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College.'' Addison-Wesley, 1984.</ref> A combination [[University-preparatory school|prep school]], [[high school]] / [[secondary school]] and college, it would provide children of immigrants and the poor access to free higher education based on academic merit alone.  It was one of the early public high schools in America following earlier similar institutions being founded in [[English High School of Boston|Boston]] (1829),\n[[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia]] (1838), and [[Baltimore City College|Baltimore]] (1839).\n\nThe Free Academy was the first of what would become a system of municipally-supported colleges \u2013 the second, [[Hunter College]], was founded as a women's institution in 1870; and the third, [[Brooklyn College]], was established as a coeducational institution in 1930.\n\nIn 1847, New York State Governor [[John Young (governor)|John Young]] had given permission to the state Board of Education to found the Free Academy, which was ratified in a statewide referendum. Founder Townsend Harris proclaimed, \"Open the doors to all\u2026 Let the children of the rich and the poor take their seats together and know of no distinction save that of industry, good conduct and intellect.\"\n\nDr. [[Horace Webster]] (1794\u20131871), a [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]] graduate, was the first president of the Free Academy. On the occasion of The Free Academy's formal opening, January 21, 1849, Webster said:\n\n<blockquote>The experiment is to be tried, whether the children of the people, the children of the whole people, can be educated; and whether an institution of the highest grade, can be successfully controlled by the popular will, not by the privileged few.<ref>[[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]], Report of the Commission on the Future of CUNY: Part I Remediation and Access: To Educate the \"Children of the Whole People\", 1999.

The Academy's first graduation took place in 1853 in Niblo's Garden Theatre,<ref>[http://www.musicals101.com/bwaypast4.htm#Niblo's \"Niblo's Garden\"] \u2013 Demolished Theatres, ''musicals101.com''</ref> a large theater and opera house on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], near Houston Street at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street.\n\nEven in its early years, the Free Academy showed tolerance for diversity, especially in comparison to its urban neighbor, [[Columbia University|Columbia College]], which was exclusive to the sons of wealthy families. The Free Academy had a framework of tolerance that extended beyond the admission of students from every social stratum. In 1854, Columbia's trustees denied distinguished chemist and scientist [[Oliver Wolcott Gibbs]] a faculty position because of Gibbs's [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] religious beliefs. Gibbs was a professor and held an appointment at the Free Academy since 1848.<ref>Cf. Bender, pp. 271\u2013273</ref> (In 1863, Gibbs went on to an appointment at [[Harvard University|Harvard College]], the Rumsford Professorship in Chemistry, where he had a distinguished career. In 1873, he was awarded an honorary degree from Columbia with a unanimous vote by its Trustees with the strong urging of Columbia president [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]].<ref>Cf.

The names City College of New York and City College, however, remain in general use.\n\nWith the name change in 1866, lavender was chosen as the college's color. In 1867, the academic senate, the first student government in the nation, was formed. Having struggled over the issue for ten years, in 1895, the [[New York Legislature|New York state Legislature]] voted to let the City College build a new campus. A four-square block site was chosen, located in [[Manhattanville, Manhattan|Manhattanville]], within the area which was enclosed by the [[City College of New York#North Campus|North Campus Arches]]; the College, however, quickly expanded north of the Arches.\n\nLike President Webster, the second president of the newly renamed City College was a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate.  The second president, General [[Alexander S. Webb]] (1835-1911), assumed office in 1869, serving for almost the next three decades.  One of the [[Union Army]]'s heroes at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], General Webb was the commander of the Philadelphia Brigade.  In 1891, while still president of the City College, he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor|Congressional Medal of Honor]] for heroism at Gettysburg.  A full-length statue of Webb, in full military uniform, stands in his honor at the heart of the campus.<ref>The statue is on the east side of Convent Avenue near both Shepherd Hall and the Administration Building.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bookplate-College of the City of New York.jpg|thumb|right|250px|College [[library]] [[bookplate]] with an early version of the college seal from the era when the institution was named the College of the City of New York, 1866\u20131929]]\n\nThe college's curriculum under Webster and Webb combined classical training in [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] with more practical subjects like [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. One of the outstanding Nineteenth Century graduates of City College was the Brooklyn-born [[George Washington Goethals]], who put himself through the college in three years before going on to West Point. He later became the chief engineer on the [[Panama Canal]] project (1903\u20131914) with one of the excavation cuts named for him. General Webb was succeeded by [[John Huston Finley]] (1863\u20131940), as third president in 1903. Finley relaxed some of the West Point-like discipline that characterized the college, including compulsory religious chapel attendance.<ref name=\"bender2\"/>\n\n[[Phi Sigma Kappa]] placed its sixth oldest chapter on the campus in 1896, flourishing until 1973, and whose alumni still provide scholarships to new students entering the CCNY system.<ref name=\"ATPS\">{{Citation | last = Rand | first = Frank Prentice | author2 = Ralph Watts |author3=James E.

It was the first national organization of its type to accept members without regard to religion, race, color or creed.<ref name=\"Delta Sigma Phi 1899\"/> The chapter flourished at the college until 1932 when it closed as a result of the [[Great Depression]]. The founding of another national fraternity, [[Zeta Beta Tau]], took place at City College on December 1898 by Dr. [[Richard Gottheil]] who aimed at establishing a [[Jewish]] fraternity with [[Zionist]] ideals. This chapter, however, has become defunct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zeta Beta Tau Homepage|url=http://www.zbt.org/|publisher=ZBT|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nEducation courses were first offered in 1897 in response to a city law that prohibited the hiring of teachers who lacked a proper academic background. The School of Education was established in 1921. The college newspaper, ''[[The Campus (CCNY)|The Campus]]'', published its first issue in 1907, and the first degree-granting evening session in the United States was started.\n\nSeparate Schools of Business and Civic Administration and of Technology (Engineering) were established in 1919. Students were also required to sign a loyalty oath. In 1947, the College celebrated its centennial year, awarding honorary degrees to [[Bernard Baruch]] (class of 1889) and [[Robert F. Wagner]] (class of 1898). A 100-year time capsule was buried in North Campus.\n\nUntil 1929, City College had been an all-male institution. During that time, specifically in 1909, the first chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Mu]] fraternity was founded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sam.org/ |title=Historical Information |publisher=Sigma Alpha Mu |accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref> In 1930, CCNY admitted women for the first time, but only to graduate programs. In 1951, the entire institution became coeducational.\n\nIn the years when top-flight private schools were restricted to the children of the Protestant establishment, thousands of brilliant individuals (including Jewish students) attended City College because they had no other option. CCNY's academic excellence and status as a working-class school earned it the titles \"[[Harvard University|Harvard]] of the [[Proletariat]]\", the \"poor man's Harvard\", and \"Harvard-on-the-Hudson\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_n2041_v40/ai_16036295 | title=Review of ''City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College'' by James Traub | author= Robert Sobel | publisher=Electronic News |date=November 21, 1994 | accessdate=2007-12-12}}</ref>\n\nEven today, after three decades of controversy over its academic standards,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} no other public college has produced as many [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates who have studied and graduated with a degree from a particular public college (all graduated between 1935 and 1963).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">see article [[Nobel Prize laureates by university affiliation]]</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2016}} CCNY's official quote on this is \"Nine Nobel laureates claim CCNY as their Alma Mater, the most from any public college in the United States.\"<ref name=\"www1.ccny.cuny.edu\">{{Update inline|date=March 2016}}[http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/pr/presskit/ \"CCNY \u2013 An Experiment in Democracy Going Strong Over 160 Years Later\"] \u2013 CCNY website press information</ref><ref>[http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/advancement/pr/presskit/nobel/index.cfm \"Nine graduates of City College have won the Nobel Prize\"], CCNY website press information</ref>{{Update inline|date=March 2016}} This should not be confused with Nobel laureates who teach at a public university; [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] boasts 19.{{Update inline|date=March 2016}} Many City College Alumni also served in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] during the [[Second World War]] (1939/41\u20131945).

It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria in the basement of Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, was the only place in the world where a fair debate between [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] could take place.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.pbs.org/arguing/ \"Arguing the World\"] \u2013 PBS documentary, 1997.</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/arguing/about_essays_1.html \"Finding My Way to the Alcoves\"] \u2013 Joseph Dorman, film director of \"Arguing the World\".</ref> Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, [[Irving Howe]] reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class. When he returned to the cafeteria late in the day, he would find that the same debate had continued but with an entirely different cast of students.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Alumnus|Alumni]] who were at City College in the mid-20th century said that City College in those days made the famous radicalism at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]] in the 1960s look like a school of conformity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe municipality of New York was considerably more conformist than CCNY students and faculty. The Philosophy Department, at the end of the 1939/40 academic year, invited the British mathematician and philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] to become a professor at CCNY. Members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] protested Russell's appointment. A woman named Jean Kay filed suit against the state Board of Higher Education to block Russell's appointment on the grounds that his views on marriage and sex would adversely affect her daughter's virtue, although her daughter was not a CCNY student. Russell wrote \"a typical American witch-hunt was instituted against me.\"<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: The Middle Years: 1914\u20131944''.

In a long pr\u00e9cis that detailed Russell's accomplishments including medals awarded by Columbia University and the Royal Society and faculty appointments at Oxford, Cambridge, UCLA, Harvard, the Sorbonne, Peking (the name used in that era), the LSE, Chicago, and so forth, Russell added, \"Judicially pronounced unworthy to be Professor of Philosophy at the College of the City of New York.\"\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn 1945, Professor William E.

Designed by architect [[John Carl Warnecke]], the building has received criticism for its lack of design and outsize scale in comparison to the surrounding neighborhood.

This expanded the campus to include many of the buildings in the area between 140th Street to 130th Street, from St. Nicholas Terrace in the east to [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] in the west. Former buildings of the Manhattanville College campus to be used by CCNY were renamed for City College's purposes: Stieglitz Hall; Downer Hall; Wagner Hall, the prominent Finley Student Center, which contained the very active Buttenweiser Lounge; Eisner Hall; Park Gym; Mott Hall; and others.\n\nAs a result of this expansion, the South Campus of CCNY primarily contained the liberal arts classes and departments of the College. The North Campus, also as a result of this expansion, mostly housed classes and departments for the sciences and engineering, as well as Klapper Hall (School of Education), and the Administration Building.\n\nIn 1957, a new library building was erected in the middle of the campus, near 135th Street on the South Campus, and named Cohen Library, after [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], an alumnus (Class of 1900) and celebrated professor of philosophy at the College from 1912 to 1938. When the Cohen Library moved to the North Academic Complex in the early 1980s, the structure was renamed the 'Y' building, and housed offices, supplies, the mail room, etc. The building was eventually gutted and renovated to become the home of the School of Architecture in 2009 (see below).\n\nIn the 1970s, many of the old buildings of the South Campus<ref>[http://origin.admin.ccny.cuny.edu/library/exhibitions/lostworld/airview.html \"Aerial view of the South Campus, or Manhattanville Campus, taken prior to 1952\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612085655/http://origin.admin.ccny.cuny.edu/library/exhibitions/lostworld/airview.html |date=June 12, 2010 }}</ref> were demolished, some that had been used by the Academy of the Sacred Heart.

Finley wanted the college to have a stadium to replace the existing inadequate facilities. New York City did not provide the money needed to build a stadium, but donated two city blocks south of the campus which were open park land. In 1912, businessman and philanthropist [[Adolph Lewisohn]] donated $75,000 for the stadium's construction and Finley commissioned architect [[Arnold W. Brunner]] to design Lewisohn Stadium.<ref>[http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/library/exhibitions/images/full/CCNYpostcard12.jpg \"Old Postcard: (Lewisohn) Stadium of the City College of New York\"], CCNY Libraries exhibitions website</ref>\n\nLewisohn Stadium was built as a 6,000-seat stadium, with thousands more seats available on the infield during concerts, and was dedicated on May 29, 1915, two years after Dr. Finley had left his post at the college. College graduation services were held in Lewisohn for many years, with the last graduation held in 1973 shortly before it was demolished. Deep under the grandstand seats was the college rifle range, used by ROTC students for basic handling of firearms.\n\n====Other demolished buildings====\nA separate library building originally planned in 1912 for the campus was never built but ground was broken on March 25, 1927 for a free-standing library to be built on St. Nicholas Terrace, between St. Nicholas and 141st Streets. Only 1/5 of the original library plan was constructed at a cost of $850,000, far above the $150,000 alumni had collected to establish a library at the original Amsterdam Avenue and 140th Street site.

The scandal led to the decline of CCNY from a national powerhouse in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] basketball to a member of [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and damaged the national profile of college basketball in general.\n\nFrom 1934 until 1941, future NFL Hall of Famer [[Benny Friedman]] was the football coach at City College.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ben Friedman Signs To Coach City College|newspaper=Plainfield, N.J., Courier News|date=February 5, 1934|page=16|url=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 future four-time Olympican [[Daniel Bukantz]] was the intercollegiate foil champion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/073108/sptFencingBukantz.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307154149/http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/073108/sptFencingBukantz.html |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Future Olympian [[James Strauch]] fenced for CCNY, graduating in 1942.

The collection contains roughly one thousand eight hundred works of art ranging from the historical to the contemporary. There were two major points in the college's history when most of the artwork in the collection was obtained; the first was at the founding of the institution and the second was in the 1970s when much of the campus underwent renovation and expansion. Also a larger portion of the collection was obtained through donations and the ''Percent for Arts'' program. This is a government program which helps institutions acquire art for their campuses. Often when new buildings are under construction at City College funding is provided through the Percent for Arts for new artwork, which is usually large sculpture or installation.\n\nThere is currently no art museum at City College, thus much of the collection is not on view for the student population or public. Works in the collection which can always be seen are the public sculptures and installations spread throughout the campus. The drawings, prints and photos which comprise the collection are housed within the libraries as a part of the City College archive, where individuals can make appointments to view the works. Some notable works from the collection include several [[Keith Haring]] prints and [[Edward S. Curtis|Edward Curtis's]] ''The North American Indian''.\n\nStudent involvement with the collection is minimum but there is some. At the moment graduate students in museum studies are working to develop an inventory of the collection. There are times when they host small exhibitions of works in the collection but there is no allotted gallery space for this. Undergraduate students mostly interact with the collection through their classes; aside from that most of their experiences with this collection come from the public sculptures around campus.\n\n==In media==\n* The central character in [[Woody Allen]]'s short story \"The Kugelmass Episode\" is a lovesick City College humanities professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyallen.art.pl/eng/kugelmass_episode.php|title=The Kugelmass Episode - Side Effects :: Woody Allen|website=www.woodyallen.art.pl}}</ref>\n* In ''World of Our Fathers'', [[Irving Howe]] writes about the intellectual life of Jewish immigrants' children attending City College.<ref>Howe, Irving.

''City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College.'' Addison-Wesley, 1984.</ref> A combination [[University-preparatory school|prep school]], [[high school]] / [[secondary school]] and college, it would provide children of immigrants and the poor access to free higher education based on academic merit alone.  It was one of the early public high schools in America following earlier similar institutions being founded in [[English High School of Boston|Boston]] (1829),\n[[Central High School (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia]] (1838), and [[Baltimore City College|Baltimore]] (1839).\n\nThe Free Academy was the first of what would become a system of municipally-supported colleges \u2013 the second, [[Hunter College]], was founded as a women's institution in 1870; and the third, [[Brooklyn College]], was established as a coeducational institution in 1930.\n\nIn 1847, New York State Governor [[John Young (governor)|John Young]] had given permission to the state Board of Education to found the Free Academy, which was ratified in a statewide referendum. Founder Townsend Harris proclaimed, \"Open the doors to all\u2026 Let the children of the rich and the poor take their seats together and know of no distinction save that of industry, good conduct and intellect.\"\n\nDr. [[Horace Webster]] (1794\u20131871), a [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]] graduate, was the first president of the Free Academy. On the occasion of The Free Academy's formal opening, January 21, 1849, Webster said:\n\n<blockquote>The experiment is to be tried, whether the children of the people, the children of the whole people, can be educated; and whether an institution of the highest grade, can be successfully controlled by the popular will, not by the privileged few.<ref>[[Association of the Bar of the City of New York]], Report of the Commission on the Future of CUNY: Part I Remediation and Access: To Educate the \"Children of the Whole People\", 1999.

The Academy's first graduation took place in 1853 in Niblo's Garden Theatre,<ref>[http://www.musicals101.com/bwaypast4.htm#Niblo's \"Niblo's Garden\"] \u2013 Demolished Theatres, ''musicals101.com''</ref> a large theater and opera house on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], near Houston Street at the corner of Broadway and Prince Street.\n\nEven in its early years, the Free Academy showed tolerance for diversity, especially in comparison to its urban neighbor, [[Columbia University|Columbia College]], which was exclusive to the sons of wealthy families. The Free Academy had a framework of tolerance that extended beyond the admission of students from every social stratum. In 1854, Columbia's trustees denied distinguished chemist and scientist [[Oliver Wolcott Gibbs]] a faculty position because of Gibbs's [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] religious beliefs. Gibbs was a professor and held an appointment at the Free Academy since 1848.<ref>Cf. Bender, pp. 271\u2013273</ref> (In 1863, Gibbs went on to an appointment at [[Harvard University|Harvard College]], the Rumsford Professorship in Chemistry, where he had a distinguished career.

The names City College of New York and City College, however, remain in general use.\n\nWith the name change in 1866, lavender was chosen as the college's color. In 1867, the academic senate, the first student government in the nation, was formed. Having struggled over the issue for ten years, in 1895, the [[New York Legislature|New York state Legislature]] voted to let the City College build a new campus. A four-square block site was chosen, located in [[Manhattanville, Manhattan|Manhattanville]], within the area which was enclosed by the [[City College of New York#North Campus|North Campus Arches]]; the College, however, quickly expanded north of the Arches.\n\nLike President Webster, the second president of the newly renamed City College was a [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate.  The second president, General [[Alexander S. Webb]] (1835-1911), assumed office in 1869, serving for almost the next three decades.  One of the [[Union Army]]'s heroes at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], General Webb was the commander of the Philadelphia Brigade.  In 1891, while still president of the City College, he was awarded the [[Medal of Honor|Congressional Medal of Honor]] for heroism at Gettysburg.

One of the outstanding Nineteenth Century graduates of City College was the Brooklyn-born [[George Washington Goethals]], who put himself through the college in three years before going on to West Point. He later became the chief engineer on the [[Panama Canal]] project (1903\u20131914) with one of the excavation cuts named for him. General Webb was succeeded by [[John Huston Finley]] (1863\u20131940), as third president in 1903. Finley relaxed some of the West Point-like discipline that characterized the college, including compulsory religious chapel attendance.<ref name=\"bender2\"/>\n\n[[Phi Sigma Kappa]] placed its sixth oldest chapter on the campus in 1896, flourishing until 1973, and whose alumni still provide scholarships to new students entering the CCNY system.<ref name=\"ATPS\">{{Citation | last = Rand | first = Frank Prentice | author2 = Ralph Watts |author3=James E.

It was the first national organization of its type to accept members without regard to religion, race, color or creed.<ref name=\"Delta Sigma Phi 1899\"/> The chapter flourished at the college until 1932 when it closed as a result of the [[Great Depression]]. The founding of another national fraternity, [[Zeta Beta Tau]], took place at City College on December 1898 by Dr. [[Richard Gottheil]] who aimed at establishing a [[Jewish]] fraternity with [[Zionist]] ideals. This chapter, however, has become defunct.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zeta Beta Tau Homepage|url=http://www.zbt.org/|publisher=ZBT|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nEducation courses were first offered in 1897 in response to a city law that prohibited the hiring of teachers who lacked a proper academic background. The School of Education was established in 1921. The college newspaper, ''[[The Campus (CCNY)|The Campus]]'', published its first issue in 1907, and the first degree-granting evening session in the United States was started.\n\nSeparate Schools of Business and Civic Administration and of Technology (Engineering) were established in 1919. Students were also required to sign a loyalty oath. In 1947, the College celebrated its centennial year, awarding honorary degrees to [[Bernard Baruch]] (class of 1889) and [[Robert F. Wagner]] (class of 1898). A 100-year time capsule was buried in North Campus.\n\nUntil 1929, City College had been an all-male institution.

It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria in the basement of Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, was the only place in the world where a fair debate between [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] could take place.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[https://www.pbs.org/arguing/ \"Arguing the World\"] \u2013 PBS documentary, 1997.</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/arguing/about_essays_1.html \"Finding My Way to the Alcoves\"] \u2013 Joseph Dorman, film director of \"Arguing the World\".</ref> Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, [[Irving Howe]] reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class.

The Philosophy Department, at the end of the 1939/40 academic year, invited the British mathematician and philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] to become a professor at CCNY. Members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] protested Russell's appointment. A woman named Jean Kay filed suit against the state Board of Higher Education to block Russell's appointment on the grounds that his views on marriage and sex would adversely affect her daughter's virtue, although her daughter was not a CCNY student. Russell wrote \"a typical American witch-hunt was instituted against me.\"<ref>Bertrand Russell, ''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: The Middle Years: 1914\u20131944''.

Beginning in 1970, the program opened doors to college to many who would not otherwise have been able to attend college.

This expanded the campus to include many of the buildings in the area between 140th Street to 130th Street, from St. Nicholas Terrace in the east to [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Amsterdam Avenue]] in the west. Former buildings of the Manhattanville College campus to be used by CCNY were renamed for City College's purposes: Stieglitz Hall; Downer Hall; Wagner Hall, the prominent Finley Student Center, which contained the very active Buttenweiser Lounge; Eisner Hall; Park Gym; Mott Hall; and others.\n\nAs a result of this expansion, the South Campus of CCNY primarily contained the liberal arts classes and departments of the College. The North Campus, also as a result of this expansion, mostly housed classes and departments for the sciences and engineering, as well as Klapper Hall (School of Education), and the Administration Building.\n\nIn 1957, a new library building was erected in the middle of the campus, near 135th Street on the South Campus, and named Cohen Library, after [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], an alumnus (Class of 1900) and celebrated professor of philosophy at the College from 1912 to 1938. When the Cohen Library moved to the North Academic Complex in the early 1980s, the structure was renamed the 'Y' building, and housed offices, supplies, the mail room, etc. The building was eventually gutted and renovated to become the home of the School of Architecture in 2009 (see below).\n\nIn the 1970s, many of the old buildings of the South Campus<ref>[http://origin.admin.ccny.cuny.edu/library/exhibitions/lostworld/airview.html \"Aerial view of the South Campus, or Manhattanville Campus, taken prior to 1952\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612085655/http://origin.admin.ccny.cuny.edu/library/exhibitions/lostworld/airview.html |date=June 12, 2010 }}</ref> were demolished, some that had been used by the Academy of the Sacred Heart.

Finley wanted the college to have a stadium to replace the existing inadequate facilities. New York City did not provide the money needed to build a stadium, but donated two city blocks south of the campus which were open park land. In 1912, businessman and philanthropist [[Adolph Lewisohn]] donated $75,000 for the stadium's construction and Finley commissioned architect [[Arnold W.

College graduation services were held in Lewisohn for many years, with the last graduation held in 1973 shortly before it was demolished.

The collection contains roughly one thousand eight hundred works of art ranging from the historical to the contemporary. There were two major points in the college's history when most of the artwork in the collection was obtained; the first was at the founding of the institution and the second was in the 1970s when much of the campus underwent renovation and expansion. Also a larger portion of the collection was obtained through donations and the ''Percent for Arts'' program. This is a government program which helps institutions acquire art for their campuses. Often when new buildings are under construction at City College funding is provided through the Percent for Arts for new artwork, which is usually large sculpture or installation.\n\nThere is currently no museum at City College, thus much of the collection is not on view for the student population of public. Works that are in the collection which can always be seen are the public sculptures and installations spread throughout the campus. The drawings, prints and photos which comprise the collection are housed within the libraries as a part of the City College archive, where individuals can make appointments to view the works. Some notable works from the collection include several [[Keith Haring]] prints and [[Edward S. Curtis|Edward Curtis's]] ''The North American Indian''.\n\nStudent involvement with the collection is minimum but there is some. At the moment graduate students in museum studies are working to develop an inventory of the collection. There are times when they host small exhibitions of works in the collection but there is no allotted gallery space for this. Undergraduate students mostly interact with the collection through their classes; aside from that most of their experiences with this collection come from the public sculptures around campus.\n\n==In media==\n* The central character in [[Woody Allen]]'s short story \"The Kugelmass Episode\" is a lovesick City College humanities professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyallen.art.pl/eng/kugelmass_episode.php|title=The Kugelmass Episode - Side Effects :: Woody Allen|website=www.woodyallen.art.pl}}</ref>\n* In ''World of Our Fathers'', [[Irving Howe]] writes about the intellectual life of Jewish immigrants' children attending City College.<ref>Howe, Irving.

Now with a permanent singer Lisa Taylor, the album yielded three singles: \u201cBe Yourself\u201d which charted in the top 40 in Japan; \u201cIf it\u2019s all Good\u201dand \u201cPearls.\u201d\n\nThe third and final Colour Club record, \u201cSexuality,\u201d was released in 1997 on JVC/Vertex and the single \u201cTenderness\u201d was issued. The accompanying video was released and six weeks later JVC America closed its doors. The album never got a chance.\n\n==Discography==\n[[Image:Colour Club Skipper & Les.jpg|thumb|Skipper Wise & Les Pierce, Colour Club]]\n[[File:Colour Club Les & Skipper.jpg|thumb|Les Pierce & Skipper Wise]]\n[[File:Colour Club Skipper,Les & Lisa.jpg|thumb|Skipper, Les & Lisa]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
