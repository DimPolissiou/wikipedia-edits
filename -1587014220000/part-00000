His earliest film appearance was a brief cameo as an effeminate hotel employee in the [[Eddie Murphy]] film of 1984, ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. From 1985 to 1986, he appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a featured performer, before getting fired after just eleven episodes for improvising during a live sketch, playing his character as a flamboyant gay cop instead of a straight cop. \n\n(Damon continued this sketch character in his family created show ''In Living Color'' on Fox Television, in 1990, as the flamboyant gay character, Blaine Edwards, an obvious hat tip to Blake Edwards of movies starring ''The Pink Panther''.)\n\nWayans later claimed that he wanted to be fired due to lack of creative freedom and screen time. Wayans further explained that [[Lorne Michaels]] did not want Wayans to do too much too soon and begin drawing comparisons to Eddie Murphy who had just left the show.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=Sean L.|title=What Damon Wayans said in 2015 about getting fired at SNL, In Living Color, Kevin Hart, social media, and yes, Bill Cosby|url=http://thecomicscomic.com/2015/09/08/what-damon-wayans-said-in-2015-about-getting-fired-at-snl-in-living-color-kevin-hart-social-media-and-yes-bill-cosby/|accessdate=October 12, 2017|work=The Comic's Comic|date=September 8, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013064820/http://thecomicscomic.com/2015/09/08/what-damon-wayans-said-in-2015-about-getting-fired-at-snl-in-living-color-kevin-hart-social-media-and-yes-bill-cosby/|archivedate=October 13, 2017}}</ref> He also appeared in the syndicated television series ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' during the 1980s as a comedian.\n\nWith his brother Keenen, Wayans created the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sketch comedy series ''[[In Living Color]]'', which had a mostly African-American cast.

His earliest film appearance was a brief cameo as an effeminate hotel employee in the [[Eddie Murphy]] film of 1984, ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. From 1985 to 1986, he appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as a featured performer, before getting fired after just eleven episodes for improvising during a live sketch, playing his character as a flamboyant gay cop instead of a straight cop. \n\n(Damon continued this sketch character in his family created show ''In Living Color'' on Fox Television, in 1990, as the flamboyant gay character, Blaine Edwards, an obvious hat tip to Blake Edwards of movies starring ''The Pink Panther''.)\n\nWayans later claimed that he wanted to be fired due to lack of creative freedom and screen time.

The show went on the air in April 1990. It continued running until May 1994, although Wayans left the show in 1992 to pursue a film career.\n\nAfter ''In Living Color'', he starred in films such as ''[[Mo' Money]]'', ''[[The Last Boy Scout]]'', ''[[Major Payne]]'', ''[[Celtic Pride]]'', ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'', and ''[[The Great White Hype]]'', and wrote and starred in the film ''[[Blankman]]''. He also appeared in [[Janet Jackson]]'s video \"[[The Best Things in Life Are Free]]\" and was considered for the role of [[The Riddler]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (the role went to [[Jim Carrey]], his co star from ''In Living Color'' and ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'').\n\nIn October 1996, he produced ''[[Waynehead]]'', a short lived cartoon for the [[The WB Television Network|WB]], loosely based on his own childhood growing up in a large family, starring a poor boy with a club foot. The show only lasted a season due to poor ratings.

The theoretical complexity of the problem is a significant factor in the development of various software solutions. This is because systems must take into account many different forms of schedules that could be worked, and allocate employees to the correct schedule.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Patten | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Shoring Up for Efficiency | url = | journal = Health Management Technology | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 34\u201336 }}</ref> Ultimately, optimization of scheduling is to minimize costs, but also often requires a reciprocal approach from management instead of complete reliance on software.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Transitioning to employee scheduling software ==\nPrior to employee scheduling software companies would use physical mediums for tracking employee hours and work schedule. This then gave rise to data storage forms that later by the 80s were compatible with computer programs and software. These forms however never actually scheduled the employees, it just kept track of the employees work week, hours, and prior work schedules. This then gave way to the idea of employee scheduling software, which would be an all-inclusive system that would store and track employee work history, along with actually scheduling the employee's work week.\n\n===Punch cards===\n\nThe earliest form of automated employee scheduling and managing of employee hours was the Punch Card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. [[Herman Hollerith]] improved the design.<ref>Trogemann, Georg (eds.); et al. (2001). Computing in Russia. Verlag. pp. 47\u201349. The article is by Gellius N. Povarov, titled Semen Nikolayevich Korsakov- Machines for the Comparison of Philosophical Ideas</ref> IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.<ref>Essinger, James (2004). Jacquard's Web: How a hand-loom led to the birth of the information age. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280577-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Magnetic tape===\n\nDuring the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape, as better, more capable computers became available. Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful, but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage, and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well.<ref>Aspray (ed.), W.

In the last decade, many software solutions have sprung up to make the lives of business owners and managers easier and less burdensome.\n\nThe first wave of solutions helped small business owners to schedule, manage, and communicate with their employees in a more streamlined way.

This then gave rise to data storage forms that later by the 80s were compatible with computer programs and software. These forms however never actually scheduled the employees, it just kept track of the employees work week, hours, and prior work schedules. This then gave way to the idea of employee scheduling software, which would be an all-inclusive system that would store and track employee work history, along with actually scheduling the employee's work week.\n\n===Punch cards===\n\nThe earliest form of automated employee scheduling and managing of employee hours was the Punch Card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. [[Herman Hollerith]] improved the design.<ref>Trogemann, Georg (eds.); et al. (2001). Computing in Russia. Verlag. pp. 47\u201349. The article is by Gellius N. Povarov, titled Semen Nikolayevich Korsakov- Machines for the Comparison of Philosophical Ideas</ref> IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.<ref>Essinger, James (2004). Jacquard's Web: How a hand-loom led to the birth of the information age. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280577-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Magnetic tape===\n\nDuring the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape, as better, more capable computers became available. Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful, but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage, and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well.<ref>Aspray (ed.), W.

The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road.

The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa.

In the late 19th century, railroads were extended on a north\u2013south axis through the city, making Wuhan an important [[transshipment]] point between rail and river traffic. Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities.

During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei. It brought an area of {{convert|30.53|km2|sp=us}} along the Yangtze River (from latter-day Jianghan Road to Hezuo Road) to become a British Concession and permitted [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to set up its consulate in the concession.\n\n[[File:Wuhan 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Wuhan in 1864]]\n[[File:Hankow Bund c. 1900.jpg|thumb|Foreign concessions along the Hankow Bund c. 1900.]]\nIn 1889, [[Zhang Zhidong]] was transferred from [[Viceroy of Liangguang]] ([[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] provinces) to [[Viceroy of Huguang]] ([[Hunan]] and [[Hubei]] provinces). He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education. Furthermore, he trained a modern military and organized a modern army including a ''zhen'' and a ''xie'' (both ''zhen'' and ''xie'' are military units in the Qing dynasty) in Hubei.\n\nOriginally known as the Hubei Arsenal, the [[Hanyang Arsenal]] was founded in 1891 by [[Qing]] official [[Zhang Zhidong]], who diverted funds from the [[Nanyang Fleet]] in [[Guangdong]] to build the arsenal.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away.

Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts.

During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei.

He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education.

Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/news.jsp?fileId=117667|title=HOME-CCTVPLUS|website=newscontent.cctv.com}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAs a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210230/http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |archive-date=February 18, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city.<ref name=\"Fenby, Jonathan page 447\">Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York: Carroll & Graf, 2004 page 447.</ref> For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city.

From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan. \n\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862}}}}) in name and in fact.\n\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui|last2=1917-|first2=\u674e\u9510|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas W.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away.
