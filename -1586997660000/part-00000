The story is about a faithful wife who is ready to undergo all kinds of troubles that would come her way while seeking her beloved husband who was separated from  her by the rivals.<ref>{{cite book| title=Popular Folk Stories:Sassui Punhun|author=Dr.Nabi Bux Khan Baloach|publisher=Sindhi Adabi Board| place=Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan| year=1976 }}</ref>\n\nThe story also appears in [[Shah Jo Risalo]] and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]].

King Hoth was son of [[Mir Jalal Khan]], ruler of today's [[Balochistan]] (Pakistan) region in the 12th Century, and father of [[Rind (Baloch tribe)|Rind]], Lashari, [[Hoth]], [[Korai]], [[Talpur]] and [[Jatoi (Baloch tribe)|Jatoi]].\n\n== Sassi ==\n'''Sassi''' was the daughter of the '''Raja of [[Bhambore]]''' in [[Sindh]] (now in Pakistan). Upon  Sassui's birth, astrologers predicted that she was a curse for the royal family\u2019s prestige. The Raja ordered that the child be put in a wooden box and thrown in the [[River Indus|Sindhu]]. A washerman of the [[Bhambore]] village found the wooden box and the child inside. The washerman believed the child was a blessing from God and took her home. As he had no child of his own, he decided to adopt her.\n\nWhen Sassui became a young girl, she was as beautiful as the fairies of heaven. Stories of her beauty reached Punhun and he became desperate to meet Sassi. The handsome young Prince therefore travelled to Bhambore. He sent his clothes to Sassi's father (a washerman) so that he could catch a glimpse of Sassi. When he visited the washerman's house, they fell in love at first sight. Sassui's father was dispirited, hoping that Sassi would marry a washerman and no one else. He asked Punnhun to prove that he was worthy of Sassui by passing the test as a washerman. Punnhun agreed to prove his love. While washing, he tore all the clothes as, being a prince, he had never washed any clothes; he thus failed the agreement. But before he returned those clothes, he hid gold coins in the pockets of all the clothes, hoping this would keep the villagers quiet. The trick worked, and Sassui's father agreed to the marriage.\n\n==Punnhun's brothers==\nPunnhun\u2019s father and brothers were against his marriage to Sassi (Punnhun being a prince and she being a washerman's daughter) and so, for their father's sake, Punnhun's brothers traveled to Bhambore. First they threatened Punnhun but when he didn't relent, they tried more devious methods. Punnhun was surprised to see his brothers supporting his marriage and on the first night, they pretended to enjoy and participate in the marriage celebrations and forced Punnhun to drink different types of wines. When he was intoxicated they carried him on a camel\u2019s back and returned to their hometown of Kech.\n\n== The lovers meet their end ==\nThe next morning, when Sassui got up, she realized that she was cheated. She became mad with the grief of separation from her lover and ran barefoot towards the town of Kech Makran. To reach it, she had to cross miles of desert. Alone, she continued her journey until her feet were blistered and her lips were parched from crying \"Punnhun, Punnhun!\". The journey was full of dangerous hazards. Punnhun\u2019s name was on Sassui's lips throughout the journey. She was thirsty, there she saw a shepherd coming out of a hut. He gave her some water to drink. Seeing her incredible beauty, he tried to force himself on Sassui. Sassui ran away and prayed to God to hide her and when God listened to her prayers, land shook and split and Sassui found herself buried in the valley of mountains. When Punhun woke in [[Makran]] he could not stop himself from running back to Bhambore. On the way he called out \"Sassui, Sassui!\" to which the shepherd told Punnhun the whole story. Then Punnhun also lamented the same prayer, the land shook and split again and he was also buried in the same mountain valley as Sassui. The legendary grave still exists in this valley. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] sings this historic tale in his sufi poetry as an example of eternal love and union with Divine.But according to the famous tale by [[Hashim (poet)]] (hashim shah) Sassui dies while crossing the desert.\n\n==Kech Makran==\nThe [[Kech District|Kech Makran]] is located along the Makran Coastal Highway in [[Baluchistan]], [[Pakistan]].

First they threatened Punnhun but when he didn't relent, they tried more devious methods. Punnhun was surprised to see his brothers supporting his marriage and on the first night, they pretended to enjoy and participate in the marriage celebrations and forced Punnhun to drink different types of wines. When he was intoxicated they carried him on a camel\u2019s back and returned to their hometown of Kech.\n\n== The lovers meet their end ==\nThe next morning, when Sassui got up, she realized that she was cheated. She became mad with the grief of separation from her lover and ran barefoot towards the town of Kech Makran. To reach it, she had to cross miles of desert. Alone, she continued her journey until her feet were blistered and her lips were parched from crying \"Punnhun, Punnhun!\". The journey was full of dangerous hazards. Punnhun\u2019s name was on Sassui's lips throughout the journey. She was thirsty, there she saw a shepherd coming out of a hut. He gave her some water to drink. Seeing her incredible beauty, he tried to force himself on Sassui. Sassui ran away and prayed to God to hide her and when God listened to her prayers, land shook and split and Sassui found herself buried in the valley of mountains. When Punhun woke in [[Makran]] he could not stop himself from running back to Bhambore. On the way he called out \"Sassui, Sassui!\" to which the shepherd told Punnhun the whole story. Then Punnhun also lamented the same prayer, the land shook and split again and he was also buried in the same mountain valley as Sassui. The legendary grave still exists in this valley. [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] sings this historic tale in his sufi poetry as an example of eternal love and union with Divine.But according to the famous tale by [[Hashim (poet)]] (hashim shah) Sassui dies while crossing the desert.\n\n==Kech Makran==\nThe [[Kech District|Kech Makran]] is located along the Makran Coastal Highway in [[Baluchistan]], [[Pakistan]].

(A second garage now faces it across 24th Street.)\n\nThe central transfer point for most bus routes has always been the block of 23rd Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and the neighbouring corners on 2nd and 3rd Avenues.  In 1984, this block was permanently closed to regular traffic and a \"Transit Terminal\" constructed, consisting of widened sidewalks, heated shelters, and angled curbs to provide three \"bays\" on each side of the block.  The 23rd Street Transit Terminal was opened on November 2, 1984.<ref name=archive/>  This terminal area is perceived by many as unsafe, and most of the businesses along this block have relocated; however, Saskatoon Transit has made some recent improvements, including a constant security guard presence and a Customer Service Centre where tickets, passes and schedules may be obtained.  The 2005 Strategic Plan Study recommended that major improvements be carried out to the downtown terminal, but {{As of|2007|lc=on}} no changes have been made.\n\nDiesel buses supplemented the streetcar service from at least 1938.  In the 1940s a decision was made to replace streetcar service with [[trolleybus|trolley buses]]; the first trolley bus ran on November 22, 1948, starting a three-year transition period, and the last streetcar ran on November 10, 1951.  With the demise of the streetcars, Saskatoon Municipal Railway was renamed Saskatoon Transit System on August 15, 1949.  The trolley buses were in turn phased out and ran for the last time on May 10, 1974.<ref name=history/>\n\nAlthough the official name is now Saskatoon Transit Services (as of 1998), it is generally known simply as ''Saskatoon Transit'', which is what appears on their Web page, logo, and all their brochures.\n\nTwo of the original Saskatoon streetcars are on display and being restored at the [[Saskatchewan Railway Museum]].\n\n===2005 Strategic Plan Study===\n[[File:Saskatoon transit customer service 23d St.JPG|thumb|Customer Services Centre at 23d Street transit terminal]]\n[[File:Saskatoon 23d St transit terminal 2.JPG|thumb|23d Street transit terminal, looking toward Third Avenue]]\n[[File:Saskatoon 23d St transit terminal 1.JPG|thumb|23d Street terminal, looking toward Second Avenue]]\n[[File:City bus interior.jpg|thumb|Interior view of a typical bus in August 2014]]\n\nA comprehensive study<ref name=study>IBI Group.

Transit ridership had fallen from 12.4 million passengers in 1987 to 7.2 million passengers in 2005, while the city's population increased from 182,000 to 214,000.  The conclusions of the study were summarised in a Short Term Plan and a Long Term Plan.  Most of the recommendations of the Short Term Plan have been implemented, and the Long Term Plan is being carried out, subject of course to funding and other considerations.\n\nThe main recommendations of the Short Term Plan were to re-orient the current regular service network to better serve the [[University of Saskatchewan]] and other key destinations, to introduce higher-order \"DART\" service on four corridors interlined into two routes, and to construct a new bus terminal at [[Market Mall (Saskatoon)|Market Mall]], as well as to make major improvements to the terminals downtown and at the University.\n\nThe routes in place prior to 2006 had not been substantially modified since the 1970s, and some since the 1950s, with the result that many neighbourhoods, particularly the newer suburbs, had poor service.  Some areas such as [[Montgomery Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Montgomery Place]] and [[Briarwood, Saskatoon|Briarwood]] had no bus service at all on weekends.  Many outlying neighbourhoods (e.g., [[Dundonald, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Dundonald]], [[Silverspring, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Silverspring]], Briarwood) had \"stub routes\" that deposited riders at a suburban mall transfer point, necessitating a transfer, and often two or three, to get anywhere in the city.  Post-secondary institutions were under-served relative to the number of students using the buses; [[Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology|SIAST Kelsey Campus]] had only one major route serving it, so that trips to SIAST from most places in Saskatoon involved a transfer onto an overcrowded bus.  Due to extreme congestion at the [[University of Saskatchewan]], several routes bypassed the campus altogether, forcing students to cross College Drive on foot.  Service to the airport was nonexistent, and service to industrial areas was extremely poor.  Demand in these areas was also extremely low, at least in part due to the poor service.\n\nThe Market Mall terminal has been built, and a temporary terminal with car traffic prohibited has been built at the University, pending a longer-term solution.  Work has yet to begin on improving or relocating the downtown terminal.\n\nThe Long Term Plan is a 10-year plan that focuses on the infrastructure needed to maintain the improvements to the system implemented in the Short Term Plan and expansion needed to keep up with the expected increases in ridership that the improvements will generate.  Issues include staffing, fleet replacement, refurbishing older buses, maintenance, new technologies such as emissions reduction and \"smart\" fare collection.  Critical items include:\n* Rejuvenating the fleet.  The industry standard is to replace buses on an 18-year cycle; by this standard, Saskatoon Transit's fleet is quite old.  The plan recommends replacing 6 buses a year through 2010, and 7 buses a year for the remaining years of the plan, as well as expanding the fleet by 12 buses.\n* New transit garage.  The current transit garage is too small for the fleet and surrounded by residential properties that make it undesirable if not impossible to expand the facility.  A satellite facility or entirely new facility in a different location, probably an industrial park, is recommended within the next 5 years.\n* More bus shelters.  The plan recommends a target number of 215 bus shelters (30% of stops), or 22 per year over the course of the plan, up from 3 or 4 per year that are currently installed.  \n* Fare technology.  A review of fare collection options, and in particular smart card technology, should be undertaken within a year.\n* Transit-oriented development.  Work with urban planners to design neighbourhoods that work with public transit and discourage use of private vehicles.\n* Signal priority and queue-jump lanes.  Allow buses to avoid congestion by \"turning the lights green\" for them, and providing bus-only lanes where needed, for instance at the approaches to University Bridge.\n\n[[File:Saskatoon Transit bus shelter.jpg|thumb|New design bus shelter]]\n\n===2015 Lockout===\n\nAfter failing to arrive at a mutual agreement upon a new contract (which bus drivers have not had since 2012), the City of Saskatoon locked out the bus drivers while negotiations continued.\n\n==Fares==\n[[File:Articulated bus.jpg|thumb|Saskatoon Transit articulated bus]]\nFares may be paid by the Go-Pass smart card, or cash (coins only effective February 2010).  The adult cash fare is currently $3.00 (as of Feb 2016), which includes unlimited transfers for 90 minutes from time of payment.  Primary and secondary school students pay reduced fares.\n\nSeniors are eligible for discounted passes lasting 3 months to a year.  Riders on social assistance are also eligible for discounted monthly passes.\n\n===Post-secondary students===\n\n[[University of Saskatchewan]] undergraduate students pay a mandatory U-PASS fee (currently $69.50 per term) for a universal transit pass, in the form of a validation sticker on their student card.  Students living in on-campus residences and others with special circumstances may apply for an exemption.\n\nOther post-secondary students may purchase a 4-month semester pass at a slightly reduced price compared to the adult monthly pass.\n\n===Go-Pass===\n\nEffective February 2010, Saskatoon Transit has upgraded its fare system to use a [[smart card]] system called Go-Pass. The card has replaced tickets, day passes and monthly passes, respectively with a refillable fare card and unlimited-fare cards that expire after a day or month. The system cost Saskatoon Transit $2.9 million. The system's roll-out date was delayed to February 2010 in order to avoid problems with the new system during the [[2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].\n\nSmart cards have been adopted to limit [[fraud]]\u2014such as [[forgery|forged]] monthly passes and short-changed fares\u2014and to reduce the potential for conflict between driver and passenger. Rather than showing the card to the driver, the card is swiped across the reader and may remain inside a wallet. Transfers are [[barcode]]d and scanned when a passenger boards. The new fare boxes do not accept [[banknote|bills]], but [[coin]]s are accepted and the values displayed to both rider and driver.\n\n==Routes==\n\n===Route names===\n[[File:Saskatoon Transit downtown terminal 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Downtown transit terminal in Saskatoon]]\nThe names next to each route number are displayed on the front of each bus. \n* 101 University Direct\n* 102 University Direct\n* 1 [[Exhibition, Saskatoon|Exhibition]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 2/10 [[Meadowgreen, Saskatoon|Meadowgreen]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 3 [[Hudson Bay Park, Saskatoon|Hudson Bay Park]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 4/43 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]] \u2013 [[Evergreen, Saskatoon|Evergreen]]\n* 4/44 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]] - [[Willowgrove, Saskatoon|Willowgrove]]\n* 4/45 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]] - [[Arbor Creek, Saskatoon|Arbor Creek]]\n* 5 [[Parkridge, Saskatoon|McCormack]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 6 [[Broadway Avenue (Saskatoon)|Broadway]] \n* 6 [[Market Mall (Saskatoon)|Market Mall]]\n* 7 [[Dundonald, Saskatoon|Dundonald]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 8/81 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] \u2013 [[University of Saskatchewan|University]]\n* 8/82 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] - [[University of Saskatchewan|University]]\n* 8/83 [[Stonebridge, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Stonebridge]] - [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 8/84 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] - [[Briarwood, Saskatoon|Briarwood]]\n* 8/86 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] - [[Rosewood, Saskatoon|Rosewood]]\n* 82 [[University of Saskatchewan|U of S]]\n* 9 [[Riversdale, Saskatoon|Riversdale]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 11 [[Saskatoon John G.

This interface will take the routes and city schedules currently available and google maps will then calculate for the website viewer the optimal connection for transport between two addresses and the time to be at the designated bus stop for bus service.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Noakes\n  | first =Darrell\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Google Transit Coming Bus Routes Soon Available Via Google Maps\n  | publisher = VerbNews.com\n  | date = March 19\u201325, 2010\n  | url =\n  | format = page 2\n  | doi =\n  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://transit.saskatoon.ca/2016-route-change/2016-schedules-and-routes | title=Routes & Schedules &#124; Transit.Saskatoon.ca}}</ref>\n\n===DART (Direct Access Rapid Transit)===\nDART is Saskatoon Transit's planned [[bus rapid transit]] service.  The four DART routes will interline in the central sections to form two corridors with extremely frequent service.  Along this portion of their routes, bus stops will be widely spaced to increase speed, and there will be \"express\" sections on each route with no stops for over a kilometre.  The interlined routes 50/60 will run from [[Confederation Mall]] to [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|The Centre]] via downtown and the [[University of Saskatchewan]], and routes 70/80 will run from [[The Mall at Lawson Heights]] to the [[University Heights Suburban Centre, Saskatoon|University Heights Suburban Centre]] via [[SIAST]] Kelsey Campus, downtown and the University.  The routes will continue past these points, each serving a residential loop at either end (a total of 8 loops). [[Low floor]] buses will be used on the DART routes.  Some of these buses will be air-conditioned and all will have bicycle racks on the front. Construction is planned to begin 2022.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.saskatoon.ca/engage/transit-plan |title = Transit Plan|date = 2017-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Regular and commuter routes===\nThere are 46 bus routes serving Saskatoon, 32 of which are full service.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://transit.saskatoon.ca/route-and-schedules | title=Routes & Schedules &#124; Transit.Saskatoon.ca}}</ref> About a third of the buses serving the city are now [[low-floor bus|low-floor]].  Most have a blue livery. Many routes meet at the downtown terminal (except 13, 17, 21, and 25, all of which serve the [[University of Saskatchewan|University]] Terminal.) As well as full service routes there are also peak only routes.  Some only operate in one direction at a time, either towards the downtown or the University in the morning, or towards their respective terminals in the afternoon. Others run both directions, but hourly during the peak hours only.\n\n===Combined routes===\nSome buses change their route number at their terminals, which is also known as a \"stay-in-seat transfer\" because the passengers do not have to leave the bus when it changes to the different route.  The list of these \"transfers\" is as follows:\n* 1 Exhibition becomes 7 Dundonald at Downtown Terminal\n* 9 Riversdale becomes 3 Hudson Bay Park at Downtown Terminal\n* 3 Hudson Bay Park becomes 9 Riversdale at Downtown Terminal\n* 7 Dundonald becomes 1 Exhibition at Downtown Terminal\n* 12 River Heights becomes 19 Centre Mall via Lorne Avenue at Downtown Terminal\n* 19 City Centre via Market Mall becomes 12 River Heights at Downtown Terminal\n* 5 McCormack becomes 15 Civic Operations Centre at Downtown Terminal\n* 15 Civic Operations Centre becomes either 10 Pleasant Hill or 5 McCormack (every 15 mins alternately)\n* 18 College Park becomes 55 Lakeridge at Place Riel\n* 55 Lakeridge becomes 18 College Park at Place Riel\n* 50 Lakeview becomes 17 Stonebridge at Place Riel (ONLY DURING PEAK HOURS)\n* 86 Rosewood becomes 84 Briarwood at Centre Mall Terminal. 84 Briarwood completes one full ride from Centre Mall then becomes 8 City Centre again\n* 60 Confederation becomes 63 Hampton Village at Place Riel \n* 63 Hampton Village becomes 65 Kensington at Place Riel\n* 65 Kensington becomes 60 Confederation at Place Riel\n* (On weekends and holidays only): Route 65/63 approach Confederation Terminal, then ride through Kensington, Confederation, Hampton Village, Blairmore areas before coming back to Confederation Terminal and ride back to Downtown.\n\n==Other services==\n\n===School service, special events, charter===\n\nSaskatoon Transit operates special morning and afternoon service to many of the city's schools, and also serves events at [[SaskTel Centre]].  Buses are also available for [[renting|charter]] trips within 40&nbsp;km of the city centre. Special routes which are available to the general public have route numbers in the 300-series, with route 399 being the SaskTel Centre special from the downtown terminal. SaskTel Centre sometimes offers charter service from locations other than the downtown, but because these are charter services which regular fare, passes and transfers do not apply, these do not have route numbers.\n\n===Access Transit===\n\nAccess Transit is a shared-ride door-to-door service for people who are unable to use regular transit services.  Passengers are required to register in the system and book their trips in advance, either on a per-trip basis or as a regularly scheduled \"subscription trip\".  Fares and payment are the same as for regular transit service.  Access Transit in Saskatoon has been used as a model for other cities in Canada and the United States.\n\n==Fleet==\nSaskatoon Transit's fleet consists almost exclusively of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} diesel buses, of which there are approximately 120 in service.  Saskatoon also has 3, {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} articulated buses made by [[Nova Bus]]. The 76 buses acquired since 1995 are [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] [[low-floor bus]]es; these now make up more than half the fleet.  Eight of the low-floor buses are [[hybrid electric bus|hybrid electric]].  90 buses are required for peak hour service commitments.<ref name=study/>\n\nIn fall 2009, a tender for 3 articulated buses was awarded to [[Nova Bus]]. These buses were delivered in April 2010 and officially unveiled at a press conference in front of city hall in June 2010. In 2014, several buses were taken in for maintenance. in September, just before the buses was re-entering service (while the bus driver was getting coffee) he/she left one of them running when a kid discovered it and took it on a 10-meter joyride before hitting another bus that was also re-entering service, causing both to go back into maintenance.\n\nSaskatoon Transit announced that a 100% low-floor fleet would be achieved by the end of 2018, meaning the retirement of the 6 remaining [[Classic (transit bus)|Classic]] high-floor buses. 371 (New Look) and 449 (Classic) are preserved and restored.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Saskatoon transit bus 2.JPG|A [[Classic (transit bus)|Classic]] style, built by [[General Motors Diesel Division|GM]] between 1982 and 1987 in the late 90s/early 2000s paint scheme.\nFile:Saskatoon Transit bus429.jpg|A [[Classic (transit bus)|Classic]] style, built by [[Motor Coach Industries|MCI]] between 1987 and 1990.\nFile:Saskatoon transit bus 3.JPG|A [[Classic (transit bus)|Classic]] style, built by [[Motor Coach Industries|MCI]] between 1987 and 1990 in the 80s/early 90s paint scheme.\nFile:Saskatoon transit bus 1.JPG|A [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] D40LFR, painted in Saskatoon Transit's DART paint scheme, with bike carrier, received in 2006.\nFile:Saskatoon Transit hybrid bus.JPG|A [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] DE40LFR, a diesel-electric hybrid, painted in the current paint scheme, with bike carrier, received in 2008.\n</gallery>\n\n==Transit Terminal==\n[[File:ProposedNewTerminal.jpg|thumb|right|Location of new terminal featuring island as well for raised platform stops near the building]]\nOn July 16, 2008, Saskatoon city council authorised a $4.2 million transit terminal to be constructed on a parking lot adjacent to the current on-street terminal.

(A second garage now faces it across 24th Street.)\n\nThe central transfer point for most bus routes has always been the block of 23rd Street between 2nd and 3rd Avenues and the neighbouring corners on 2nd and 3rd Avenues.  In 1984, this block was permanently closed to regular traffic and a \"Transit Terminal\" constructed, consisting of widened sidewalks, heated shelters, and angled curbs to provide three \"bays\" on each side of the block.  The 23rd Street Transit Terminal was opened on November 2, 1984.<ref name=archive/>  This terminal area is perceived by many as unsafe, and most of the businesses along this block have relocated; however, Saskatoon Transit has made some recent improvements, including a constant security guard presence and a Customer Service Centre where tickets, passes and schedules may be obtained.  The 2005 Strategic Plan Study recommended that major improvements be carried out to the downtown terminal, but {{As of|2007|lc=on}} no changes have been made.\n\nDiesel buses supplemented the streetcar service from at least 1938.  In the 1940s a decision was made to replace streetcar service with [[trolleybus|trolley buses]]; the first trolley bus ran on November 22, 1948, starting a three-year transition period, and the last streetcar ran on November 10, 1951.  With the demise of the streetcars, Saskatoon Municipal Railway was renamed Saskatoon Transit System on August 15, 1949.  The trolley buses were in turn phased out and ran for the last time on May 10, 1974.<ref name=history/>\n\nAlthough the official name is now Saskatoon Transit Services (as of 1998), it is generally known simply as ''Saskatoon Transit'', which is what appears on their Web page, logo, and all their brochures.\n\nTwo of the original Saskatoon streetcars are on display and being restored at the [[Saskatchewan Railway Museum]].\n\n===2005 Strategic Plan Study===\n[[File:Saskatoon transit customer service 23d St.JPG|thumb|Customer Services Centre at 23d Street transit terminal]]\n[[File:Saskatoon 23d St transit terminal 2.JPG|thumb|23d Street transit terminal, looking toward Third Avenue]]\n[[File:Saskatoon 23d St transit terminal 1.JPG|thumb|23d Street terminal, looking toward Second Avenue]]\n[[File:City bus interior.jpg|thumb|Interior view of a typical bus in August 2014]]\n\nA comprehensive study<ref name=study>IBI Group.

Transit ridership had fallen from 12.4 million passengers in 1987 to 7.2 million passengers in 2005, while the city's population increased from 182,000 to 214,000.  The conclusions of the study were summarised in a Short Term Plan and a Long Term Plan.  Most of the recommendations of the Short Term Plan have been implemented, and the Long Term Plan is being carried out, subject of course to funding and other considerations.\n\nThe main recommendations of the Short Term Plan were to re-orient the current regular service network to better serve the [[University of Saskatchewan]] and other key destinations, to introduce higher-order \"DART\" service on four corridors interlined into two routes, and to construct a new bus terminal at [[Market Mall (Saskatoon)|Market Mall]], as well as to make major improvements to the terminals downtown and at the University.\n\nThe routes in place prior to 2006 had not been substantially modified since the 1970s, and some since the 1950s, with the result that many neighbourhoods, particularly the newer suburbs, had poor service.  Some areas such as [[Montgomery Place, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Montgomery Place]] and [[Briarwood, Saskatoon|Briarwood]] had no bus service at all on weekends.  Many outlying neighbourhoods (e.g., [[Dundonald, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Dundonald]], [[Silverspring, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Silverspring]], Briarwood) had \"stub routes\" that deposited riders at a suburban mall transfer point, necessitating a transfer, and often two or three, to get anywhere in the city.  Post-secondary institutions were under-served relative to the number of students using the buses; [[Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology|SIAST Kelsey Campus]] had only one major route serving it, so that trips to SIAST from most places in Saskatoon involved a transfer onto an overcrowded bus.  Due to extreme congestion at the [[University of Saskatchewan]], several routes bypassed the campus altogether, forcing students to cross College Drive on foot.  Service to the airport was nonexistent, and service to industrial areas was extremely poor.  Demand in these areas was also extremely low, at least in part due to the poor service.\n\nThe Market Mall terminal has been built, and a temporary terminal with car traffic prohibited has been built at the University, pending a longer-term solution.  Work has yet to begin on improving or relocating the downtown terminal.\n\nThe Long Term Plan is a 10-year plan that focuses on the infrastructure needed to maintain the improvements to the system implemented in the Short Term Plan and expansion needed to keep up with the expected increases in ridership that the improvements will generate.  Issues include staffing, fleet replacement, refurbishing older buses, maintenance, new technologies such as emissions reduction and \"smart\" fare collection.  Critical items include:\n* Rejuvenating the fleet.  The industry standard is to replace buses on an 18-year cycle; by this standard, Saskatoon Transit's fleet is quite old.  The plan recommends replacing 6 buses a year through 2010, and 7 buses a year for the remaining years of the plan, as well as expanding the fleet by 12 buses.\n* New transit garage.  The current transit garage is too small for the fleet and surrounded by residential properties that make it undesirable if not impossible to expand the facility.  A satellite facility or entirely new facility in a different location, probably an industrial park, is recommended within the next 5 years.\n* More bus shelters.  The plan recommends a target number of 215 bus shelters (30% of stops), or 22 per year over the course of the plan, up from 3 or 4 per year that are currently installed.  \n* Fare technology.  A review of fare collection options, and in particular smart card technology, should be undertaken within a year.\n* Transit-oriented development.  Work with urban planners to design neighbourhoods that work with public transit and discourage use of private vehicles.\n* Signal priority and queue-jump lanes.  Allow buses to avoid congestion by \"turning the lights green\" for them, and providing bus-only lanes where needed, for instance at the approaches to University Bridge.\n\n[[File:Saskatoon Transit bus shelter.jpg|thumb|New design bus shelter]]\n\n===2015 Lockout===\n\nAfter failing to arrive at a mutual agreement upon a new contract (which bus drivers have not had since 2012), the City of Saskatoon locked out the bus drivers while negotiations continued.\n\n==Fares==\n[[File:Articulated bus.jpg|thumb|Saskatoon Transit articulated bus]]\nFares may be paid by the Go-Pass smart card, or cash (coins only effective February 2010).  The adult cash fare is currently $3.00 (as of Feb 2016), which includes unlimited transfers for 90 minutes from time of payment.  Primary and secondary school students pay reduced fares.\n\nSeniors are eligible for discounted passes lasting 3 months to a year.  Riders on social assistance are also eligible for discounted monthly passes.\n\n===Post-secondary students===\n\n[[University of Saskatchewan]] undergraduate students pay a mandatory U-PASS fee (currently $69.50 per term) for a universal transit pass, in the form of a validation sticker on their student card.  Students living in on-campus residences and others with special circumstances may apply for an exemption.\n\nOther post-secondary students may purchase a 4-month semester pass at a slightly reduced price compared to the adult monthly pass.\n\n===Go-Pass===\n\nEffective February 2010, Saskatoon Transit has upgraded its fare system to use a [[smart card]] system called Go-Pass. The card has replaced tickets, day passes and monthly passes, respectively with a refillable fare card and unlimited-fare cards that expire after a day or month. The system cost Saskatoon Transit $2.9 million. The system's roll-out date was delayed to February 2010 in order to avoid problems with the new system during the [[2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships]].\n\nSmart cards have been adopted to limit [[fraud]]\u2014such as [[forgery|forged]] monthly passes and short-changed fares\u2014and to reduce the potential for conflict between driver and passenger. Rather than showing the card to the driver, the card is swiped across the reader and may remain inside a wallet. Transfers are [[barcode]]d and scanned when a passenger boards. The new fare boxes do not accept [[banknote|bills]], but [[coin]]s are accepted and the values displayed to both rider and driver.\n\n==Routes==\n\n===Route names===\n[[File:Saskatoon Transit downtown terminal 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Downtown transit terminal in Saskatoon]]\nThe names next to each route number are displayed on the front of each bus. \n* 101 University Direct\n* 102 University Direct\n* 1 [[Exhibition, Saskatoon|Exhibition]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 2/10 [[Meadowgreen, Saskatoon|Meadowgreen]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 3 [[Hudson Bay Park, Saskatoon|Hudson Bay Park]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 4/43 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]] \u2013 [[Evergreen, Saskatoon|Evergreen]]\n* 4/44 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]] - [[Willowgrove, Saskatoon|Willowgrove]]\n* 4/45 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]] - [[Arbor Creek, Saskatoon|Arbor Creek]]\n* 5 [[Parkridge, Saskatoon|McCormack]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 6 [[Broadway Avenue (Saskatoon)|Broadway]] \n* 6 [[Market Mall (Saskatoon)|Market Mall]]\n* 7 [[Dundonald, Saskatoon|Dundonald]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 8/81 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] \u2013 [[University of Saskatchewan|University]]\n* 8/82 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] - [[University of Saskatchewan|University]]\n* 8/83 [[Stonebridge, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Stonebridge]] - [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 8/84 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] - [[Briarwood, Saskatoon|Briarwood]]\n* 8/86 [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|Centre Mall]] - [[Rosewood, Saskatoon|Rosewood]]\n* 82 [[University of Saskatchewan|U of S]]\n* 9 [[Riversdale, Saskatoon|Riversdale]] \u2013 [[Central Business District, Saskatoon|City Centre]]\n* 11 [[Saskatoon John G.

This interface will take the routes and city schedules currently available and google maps will then calculate for the website viewer the optimal connection for transport between two addresses and the time to be at the designated bus stop for bus service.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Noakes\n  | first =Darrell\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Google Transit Coming Bus Routes Soon Available Via Google Maps\n  | publisher = VerbNews.com\n  | date = March 19\u201325, 2010\n  | url =\n  | format = page 2\n  | doi =\n  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://transit.saskatoon.ca/2016-route-change/2016-schedules-and-routes | title=Routes & Schedules &#124; Transit.Saskatoon.ca}}</ref>\n\n===DART (Direct Access Rapid Transit)===\nDART is Saskatoon Transit's planned [[bus rapid transit]] service.  The four DART routes will interline in the central sections to form two corridors with extremely frequent service.  Along this portion of their routes, bus stops will be widely spaced to increase speed, and there will be \"express\" sections on each route with no stops for over a kilometre.  The interlined routes 50/60 will run from [[Confederation Mall]] to [[The Centre (Saskatoon)|The Centre]] via downtown and the [[University of Saskatchewan]], and routes 70/80 will run from [[The Mall at Lawson Heights]] to the [[University Heights Suburban Centre, Saskatoon|University Heights Suburban Centre]] via [[SIAST]] Kelsey Campus, downtown and the University.  The routes will continue past these points, each serving a residential loop at either end (a total of 8 loops). [[Low floor]] buses will be used on the DART routes.  Some of these buses will be air-conditioned and all will have bicycle racks on the front. Construction is planned to begin 2022<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.saskatoon.ca/engage/transit-plan |title = Transit Plan|date = 2017-10-12}}</ref>.\n\n===Regular and commuter routes===\nThere are 46 bus routes serving Saskatoon, 32 of which are full service.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://transit.saskatoon.ca/route-and-schedules | title=Routes & Schedules &#124; Transit.Saskatoon.ca}}</ref> About a third of the buses serving the city are now [[low-floor bus|low-floor]].  Most have a blue livery. Many routes meet at the downtown terminal (except 13, 17, 21, and 25, all of which serve the [[University of Saskatchewan|University]] Terminal.) As well as full service routes there are also peak only routes.  Some only operate in one direction at a time, either towards the downtown or the University in the morning, or towards their respective terminals in the afternoon. Others run both directions, but hourly during the peak hours only.\n\n===Combined routes===\nSome buses change their route number at their terminals, which is also known as a \"stay-in-seat transfer\" because the passengers do not have to leave the bus when it changes to the different route.  The list of these \"transfers\" is as follows:\n* 1 Exhibition becomes 7 Dundonald at Downtown Terminal\n* 9 Riversdale becomes 3 Hudson Bay Park at Downtown Terminal\n* 3 Hudson Bay Park becomes 9 Riversdale at Downtown Terminal\n* 7 Dundonald becomes 1 Exhibition at Downtown Terminal\n* 12 River Heights becomes 19 Centre Mall via Lorne Avenue at Downtown Terminal\n* 19 City Centre via Market Mall becomes 12 River Heights at Downtown Terminal\n* 5 McCormack becomes 15 Civic Operations Centre at Downtown Terminal\n* 15 Civic Operations Centre becomes either 10 Pleasant Hill or 5 McCormack (every 15 mins alternately)\n* 18 College Park becomes 55 Lakeridge at Place Riel\n* 55 Lakeridge becomes 18 College Park at Place Riel\n* 50 Lakeview becomes 17 Stonebridge at Place Riel (ONLY DURING PEAK HOURS)\n* 86 Rosewood becomes 84 Briarwood at Centre Mall Terminal. 84 Briarwood completes one full ride from Centre Mall then becomes 8 City Centre again\n* 60 Confederation becomes 63 Hampton Village at Place Riel \n* 63 Hampton Village becomes 65 Kensington at Place Riel\n* 65 Kensington becomes 60 Confederation at Place Riel\n* (On weekends and holidays only): Route 65/63 approach Confederation Terminal, then ride through Kensington, Confederation, Hampton Village, Blairmore areas before coming back to Confederation Terminal and ride back to Downtown.\n\n==Other services==\n\n===School service, special events, charter===\n\nSaskatoon Transit operates special morning and afternoon service to many of the city's schools, and also serves events at [[SaskTel Centre]].  Buses are also available for [[renting|charter]] trips within 40&nbsp;km of the city centre. Special routes which are available to the general public have route numbers in the 300-series, with route 399 being the SaskTel Centre special from the downtown terminal. SaskTel Centre sometimes offers charter service from locations other than the downtown, but because these are charter services which regular fare, passes and transfers do not apply, these do not have route numbers.\n\n===Access Transit===\n\nAccess Transit is a shared-ride door-to-door service for people who are unable to use regular transit services.  Passengers are required to register in the system and book their trips in advance, either on a per-trip basis or as a regularly scheduled \"subscription trip\".  Fares and payment are the same as for regular transit service.  Access Transit in Saskatoon has been used as a model for other cities in Canada and the United States.\n\n==Fleet==\nSaskatoon Transit's fleet consists almost exclusively of {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} diesel buses, of which there are approximately 120 in service.  Saskatoon also has 3, {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} articulated buses made by [[Nova Bus]]. The 76 buses acquired since 1995 are [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] [[low-floor bus]]es; these now make up more than half the fleet.  Eight of the low-floor buses are [[hybrid electric bus|hybrid electric]].  90 buses are required for peak hour service commitments.<ref name=study/>\n\nIn fall 2009, a tender for 3 articulated buses was awarded to [[Nova Bus]]. These buses were delivered in April 2010 and officially unveiled at a press conference in front of city hall in June 2010.

The filmmakers were also able to capture many candid moments with colleagues such as [[Dave Grohl]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] conversing with Lemmy in bars and recording studios.\n\nThe film reveals that Lemmy spends much of his life either on tour with Mot\u00f6rhead or hanging out at the [[Rainbow Bar and Grill]] in [[Los Angeles]], with well-known musicians such as Sixx joking that they bump into Lemmy every single time they go to the Rainbow. Lemmy is shown living alone in a small rent-controlled apartment, which he refuses to give up due to its cheap rent relative to other places in Los Angeles and its close proximity to the Rainbow. He reveals that he has never married and is close to his son, Paul, a guitarist who occasionally joins him on stage.\n\n==Production==\nThe film includes footage shot in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Russia.

Lemmy is shown living alone in a small rent-controlled apartment, which he refuses to give up due to its cheap rent relative to other places in Los Angeles and its close proximity to the Rainbow.

With the clouds of war beginning to form over Europe and the personal memory of how young men with only a few hours of training had been sent into air combat only to fall victim to well-trained enemy aviators, he conceived the idea of an aviation cadet corps.\n\n===Air Defence Cadet Corps===\n{{See also|Air Defence Cadet Corps}}\n[[File:Air cadets learn the basics of flight at RNAS St Merryn in Cornwall, February 1944.

In 1941, in order to provide the means of giving part-time air training to teenagers and young men who might later join the Royal Air Force, the ADCC was formally established as the Air Training Corps by Royal Warrant.\n\n===Air Training Corps===\n[[File:Slingsby (1249888545).jpg|right|thumb|[[Slingsby Tandem Tutor|Slingsby Cadet TX.3]] glider used by the ATC from 1953 to 1986.]]\nOn 5 February 1941, the Air Training Corps (ATC) was officially established, with [[King George VI]] agreeing to be the Air Commodore-in-Chief, and issuing a [[Warrant (law)|Royal Warrant]] setting out the Corps' aims. Within the first month of its existence, the size of the old ADCC, now the ATC, virtually doubled to more than 400 squadrons and continued to grow thereafter. A new badge was designed for the ATC and, once approved by the King, was distributed in August 1941. The motto ' ''Venture Adventure'' ', devised by Air Commodore Chamier, was adopted by the ATC and incorporated into the badge.\n\nThe new ATC squadrons adopted training programmes to prepare young men for entry to the Royal Air Force. Squadrons arranged visits to RAF and [[Fleet Air Arm]] stations as part of the cadets' training, where a flight might be a possibility. Such opportunities were not widely available, however, and many cadets were disappointed. One solution was to introduce opportunities for [[Aviation|flying]], as a way to allow a cadet to get the feel of an aircraft in flight and to handle an aircraft's controls whilst airborne. After the end of the Second World War, gliding lessons became available.<ref name=\"ACP_31\">{{citation\n| year=2000\n| title=Air Cadet Publication 31: General Service Training\n| volume=Section 1 - The Air Training Corps\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n| pages=1\u20133/4/5\n}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1980s, females were unable to join the ATC, although they were able to join an attached unit of the [[Girls Venture Corps]] (GVC) which had been formed in the early years of the [[Second World War]], if one was available at that location.<ref name=\"GVCAC\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.gvcac.org.uk/\n| title=The Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets\n| accessdate=28 September 2008\n| author=GVCAC HQ website\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921003109/http://www.gvcac.org.uk/\n| archivedate=21 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> As of 2013, the GVCAC still exists, although in greatly reduced numbers due to competition from the ATC, and the two organisations no longer share a site.\n\nBefore May 2008, cadets would spend a lot of time in the classroom before obtaining First Class classification, studying the following subjects: The Air Training Corps, The Royal Air Force, History of Flight, Initial Expedition Training, Basic Communications and Airmanship I. After a number of lectures and when the cadet felt ready, they would take a multiple choice examination, either on paper or on a computer. Some wings ran courses that would involve the cadet spending a few solid days learning and then awarded the appropriate classification if successful in their exams. In May 2008, HQAC decided to change the training programme for junior and second class cadets, sensing that new recruits were being deterred by exams. In March 2016, after a review of the then current training syllabus, the new \"Progressive Training Syllabus\" was introduced, which provided for four levels of each badge (blue, bronze, silver, and gold).<ref name=\"Progressive Training Syllabus\">{{cite web\n| url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/news/new-progressive-training-syllabus-launched/\n| title=New Progressive Training Syllabus Launched\n| date= 2 March 2017\n| accessdate=11 April 2017\n| author=Royal Air Force Air Cadets\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PTS\">{{cite web\n| url=http://42fkingslynnatc.org.uk/images/Progressive%20Training%20Guide.pdf\n| title=New Progressive Training Syllabus PDF\n| accessdate=17 November 2017\n| author=Royal Air Force Air Cadets - 42F (King's Lynn) Squadron Air Training Corps\n}}</ref> \n[[File:RAF Air Cadet Progressive Training Syllabus.jpg|thumb|RAF Air Cadet Progressive Training Syllabus]]\n\n===Air Cadet Organisation===\n{{main|Royal Air Force Air Cadets}}\n\nUntil October 2017, advertising material such as leaflets and official websites branded the Air Training Corps and [[Combined Cadet Force]] collectively as the Air Cadet Organisation (ACO).

Each region is sub-divided into a number of [[wing (air force unit)|wings]]. There were historically six wings per region, however, as of 2013 there were 34 wings, most named after the one or two [[Counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] of the United Kingdom that they operate in. Wings are further sub-divided into sectors. Within the sectors lie squadrons, and it is the squadron that is the focal point for the majority of members of the Corps. As of 2019 there were 952 ATC squadrons and detached flights, each assigned to a wing.\n\nThe ATC is the largest part of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), along with the RAF sections of the Combined Cadet Force. The RAFAC forms one of the seven functional areas of [[No 22 Group RAF]], which is responsible for the recruitment and selection of all RAF personnel and for the policy and delivery of RAF non-operational training (including flying training).\n\n===Regions===\n[[File:Air Training Corps, Rothes - geograph.org.uk - 1528243.jpg|thumb|Air Training Corps, Rothes]]\n[[File:Albion Road, London N16 - Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force - geograph.org.uk - 1061053.jpg|thumb|Albion Road, London N16 - Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force These premises have been used by the Air Training Corps (ATC) and Army Cadets for training since at least 1940]]\n[[File:The HQ of 1465 (Gwynedd) Air Training Corps in Dale Street. - geograph.org.uk - 864764.jpg|thumb|The HQ of 1465 (Gwynedd) Air Training Corps in Dale Street]]\n[[File:ATC 300 (Axholme) Sqn. - geograph.org.uk - 917529.jpg|thumb|ATC 300 (Axholme) Sqn.

There are subordinate headquarters at region and wing levels, staffed by adult officers <ref group=note>Although previously [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)|Royal Air Force Volunteer branch officers]], ATC officers now come under the [[Cadet Forces Commission]]</ref> and civil servants. HQAC controls two Air Cadet National Adventure Training Centres &ndash; at [[Llanbedr|Llanbedr, Gwynedd]], Wales and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere, Cumbria]], England, which provide a range of adventure training courses and accommodation for squadron and wing expeditions. HQAC also controls ({{As of|2018|lc=y}}) ten [[Volunteer Gliding Squadron]]s around the UK, through the Air Cadet Central Gliding School at [[RAF Syerston]], and twelve [[Air Experience Flight]]s.\n\n===Local===\n{{further|List of Air_Training Corps squadrons}}\nATC Squadrons are established in most large towns in the United Kingdom. There are also units in Cyprus, Germany, [[Gibraltar]] and [[the Channel Islands]]. In towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, or as a supplement to an existing squadron in a larger town or city, a Detached Flight (DF) may be formed. A detached flight operates much like any other unit, but is technically a component part of a nearby, larger squadron. {{As of|2019|April|df=UK}} there were over 912 ATC squadrons and 40 detached flights.<ref name=\"squadron-finder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.air-cadets-squadron-finder.org/all-air-cadets-squadrons/|title=Air Cadets (ATC) Squadron Finder & contact details|publisher=Air-cadets-squadron-finder.org|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nCommanding Officers receive a Cadet Forces commission, introduced in 2017 and restated in 2018.<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 62208\n| date = 20 February 2018\n| page = 3146-3147\n| supp = 1\n}}</ref> Squadrons were previously commanded by a [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)]] RAFVR(T) officer, or sometimes a warrant officer. The commanding officer has a good deal of autonomy in running his or her unit, along with the responsibility that goes with it. Where a unit has other members of staff, the commanding officer allocates duties and provides recommendations on appointments, retentions and promotions. A Commanding Officer of an ATC Squadron can appoint Cadets up to the rank of Cadet Flight Sergeant (Cdt FS) without any external approval. Further Cadet promotion to the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer (CWO) requires recommendation being sent to their Squadron's Wing HQ.\n\nThe Squadron [[Warrant Officer]] (Sqn WO) commonly holds the rank of warrant officer, or may be a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO) if no warrant officer is available, and will typically have spent many years working within the squadron or at least within the ATC. In the case where no commissioned officers are present, the Sqn WO or SNCO will take charge of the unit. The squadron warrant officer usually has a closer relationship with the cadets than the commanding officer.\n\nThe establishment of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], WOs, senior NCOs and cadet NCOs is dependent on the size of the squadron or detached flight and this basic structure has many permutations &ndash; varying with the number of cadets and staff, accommodation and facilities. A typical small detached flight may consist only of the Officer Commanding and fifteen cadets and is often housed in rented accommodation. At the other end of the scale, a large squadron can consist of 120 cadets or more, four commissioned officers, two non-commissioned officers and a half-dozen civilian instructors. Civilian instructors (many of whom are retired RAF regulars) form the backbone of the ACO.\n\n=== Civilian committees ===\n{{more citations needed| section|date=July 2019}}{{tone|section|date=July 2019}}\nA Civilian Committee (or Civcom) underpins all local funding that the RAF cannot provide beyond core services for the squadron. Each is an independent charity and operates to meet the funding needs of the local squadron which is under the control of the commanding officer. Since the uniformed officers and civilian instructors in the ATC have no financial responsibilities, but still need money to manage and provide cadet activities such as annual and overseas camps and adventure training, the civilian committee is entirely responsible for these finances and provides them to the squadron for use. There is no rank structure in civilian committees, nor are its members beholden to anyone. Serving as trustees, they are unpaid volunteers who support the cadet activities financially leaving the paid uniformed officers to deliver the cadet experience.\n\nThe RAFAC (ATC) is itself not a charitable organisation and is not itself a legal entity and so has no legal status. That defers to the MOD. For this and other reasons, the trustees within each Civilian Committee are required to be responsible for, and accountable for, the charitable fundraising of the squadron. As with any charity, three officers (Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer) are elected at an AGM, possibly with the addition of a deputy Chairperson, and then exist as an independent group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-charities-with-a-connection-to-a-non-charity|title=Guidance for charities with a connection to a non-charity|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref> to raise and manage funds in a lawful manner in accordance with the Charities Act. They do this under the status of an 'excepted charity' which requires that they conduct themselves wholly to the [[Charities Act 2011]] but are excepted from sending in annual reports to the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]].\n\nThe squadron commander and chaplain are ''ex-officio'' members of their civilian committee and have no voting rights, however common-sense determines they may advise in squadron-related matters. While co-operation between the squadron and the civilian committee is desirable at all times, there is no line of command or authority of anyone other than the trustees of the Civilian Committee. This includes any uniformed personnel up to, and including, the Commandant Air Cadets.\n\nA Civilian Committee is responsible for overseeing the initial unit formation and direction and will monitor the welfare of cadets. Civilian committees often include parents of cadets and retired ATC staff. Many squadron charities decide to operate against the RAFAC document known as ACP-11<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/490101/20151218-FOI-ACO-Charity-Commission-Attachment.pdf|title=ACP-11}}</ref> which has been the traditional constitution. However, there is no requirement to do so as long as the civilian committee establishes a constitution with acceptable charitable object statements; these may be similar to those in ACP-11 but offers the advantage of more local definition in deciding the use of funds. The Charity Commission has helpfully produced downloadable model constitutions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/setting-up-a-charity-model-governing-documents|title=Charity Commission Constitutions}}</ref> of which the 'Model Constitution for a Small Charity' is ideal for the purpose of registering a charity at squadron level and indeed this has been the route required for all squadrons in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe most recent revision of ACP-11 was conceived as a means of retaining control for the organisation over civilian committees through what is known as the Association Model of trusteeship. The document is controversial and has been questioned by experienced trustees in charitable work on the basis that it is confused and almost certainly contradicts charity law. Furthermore, to be a lawful and binding constitution for a squadron, it must be adopted autonomously by the trustees of each civilian committee and not released as an automatic update in the manner of all other ACP documents which relate to governance of the uniform cadre.\n\nAlthough there is no hierarchy, there are links that tie the organisation together structurally. Those that form the uniformed chain of command are self-explanatory. For civilians however, these links are formed of upward provision of trustees. So, from the civilian committees within a number of squadrons is elected a Wing chairperson to serve as a trustee of the Wing charity. In theory, the same happens from Wing to Region however, there has been a change in recent years where these positions have been appointed rather than by bona-fide election.\n\nAny civilian committee in England and Wales that has an annual income that exceeds \u00a35,000 in any one year, may register their charity with the Charity Commission. The charity commissions of Scotland and Northern Ireland require committees located in those countries to register and have done so for several years.\n\nThe role of a civilian committee also extends to cadet welfare and this can be a sensitive area at times. Cadets who feel unhappy or experience bullying, or who have safeguarding issues should be able to approach members of the civilian committee in confidence to discuss their concerns. Depending on the nature of the issue at hand, relationships may become strained where it is felt that commanding officers are not implementing the set procedure in such matters as the rule book (another ACP) prescribes.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Aims and motto===\n[[File:Remembrance Day Ripon.jpg|thumb|Cadets from the Air Training Corps and Army Cadet Force during [[Remembrance Sunday]], 2006]]\nThe Aims of the Air Training Corps, as set out in the Royal Warrant and approved by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM the Queen]], the British sovereign, are:\n\n* To promote and encourage among young men and women a practical interest in [[aviation]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).\n* To provide training which will be useful in both the services and civilian life.\n* To foster a spirit of adventure and to develop the qualities of leadership and good citizenship.<ref name=\"horizons\">{{citation\n| year=2007\n| title=Expand Your Horizons: Adult Volunteers\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n}}</ref>\n\nThe corps [[motto]] is \"Venture, Adventure\".<ref name=\"Air Cadet Organization\">{{citation\n| year=2000\n| title=Air Cadet Publication 31: General Service Training\n| volume=Section 1 - The Air Training Corps\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n| pages=1\n}}</ref>\n\nIn late December, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] resigned from his role as honorary [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]] - having served in this role since 1953.

I further promise to be a good citizen and to do my duty to (God and^) the Queen, my Country and my Flag.\"<ref name=\"Form_3822\">{{citation\n| year=2004\n| title=RAF Form 3822: Cadet Record of Service\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n}}</ref>\n\nThis promise is recorded by the cadet's signature in the cadet's Cadet Record of Service Book (RAF Form 3822)\nThe promise has recently been rewritten to accommodate everyone, whether or not they are religious.\n\n===Ensign===\n[[File:Ensign of the Air Training Corps.svg|thumb|Air Training Corps Ensign]]\nThe Air Training Corps Ensign is hoisted for every parade in the summer and hauled-down at dusk. It is expected that it should be treated with the same respect and dignity afforded to the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]]. In the event of poor weather conditions e.g. heavy rain or snowfall, the ensign would not be raised. If poor weather conditions are present whilst the ensign is raised, it would be hauled down at the soonest possible point. This is to avoid damage to the ensign and also as a mark of respect and discipline.\n\nThe ATC ensign is raised and lowered by a nominated member of the squadron, sometimes a cadet [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO), member of staff, or simply a cadet who has been chosen, with the salute being taken by any [[commissioned officer]], normally the squadron's [[Officer Commanding]]. All officers within view or earshot of the ensign are expected to salute during the hoisting and hauling down.\n\nMost ATC wings and squadrons also have a banner, in addition to an ensign, which is paraded on formal occasions. The ATC also has a Corps Banner, which is afforded the same courtesies as an RAF Squadron Standard or the RAF Queens Colour, although its status is different.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[File:Cadets Saint Peter Port 2012 b.jpg|thumb|Parade and church service in Saint Peter Port, featuring ATC and [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] cadets, [[Guernsey]], 16 September 2012]]\nAll cadets are issued with a uniform that is similar to [[Uniforms of the Royal Air Force|that worn by RAF personnel]] and are regulated by similar dress regulations to the RAF. The Air Training Corps' dress regulations can be found in AP1358C. Occasionally alterations have been made to the dress regulations as the organisation has developed over the years. One such example being the authorisation for [[Army Cadet Force|CFAVs]] and Cadets to wear [[Multi-Terrain Pattern]] (MTP) uniform in 2014.\n\nThe standard uniform consists of a dark blue shirt and [[brassard]], blue-grey trousers (male cadets) or skirt/slacks (female cadets), a v-neck blue-grey jumper and an RAF blue beret with an Air Training Corps cap badge.\n\nSome Squadrons differentiate themselves from each other at a local level. One such example would be different coloured pieces of cloth behind the cap badges on the beret. This allowed Cadet NCOs and CFAV to distinguish between Cadets of differing Flights. This practice, however, is not officially authorised from HQAC and therefore is not officially allowed in the ATC. All uniform except black parade shoes and combat boots are provided at the expense of the ATC. Girls are also expected to provide their own hair nets, hair spray, hair ties etc. In order to keep it neat as well as 15 denier, matt, tights in the shade barely black. Boys hair must be kept short and tidy, above the collar and clear of the ears, although some squadrons are now allowing long male hair to be tied in the same fashion as the girls, however, this is not widespread. Plain black socks are also required.\n\nCadets are also issued with a light blue shirt and tie for formal occasions, and are usually either issued with or privately acquire a camouflage uniform, also known as a [[disruptive pattern material]] (DPM) uniform and more recently have been authorised to wear the modern [[Multi-Terrain Pattern]] (MTP). Cadets may be allowed or obliged to wear other specialist uniforms, such as [[flight suit]]s or other forms of protective clothing, when required.\n\n===Squadron Insignia===\nThe first 50 squadrons that were formed retain an F to show they are \"founder\" squadrons, e.g. 10F (Luton) Squadron or 1F (City of Leicester) Squadron. Only 30 of these are still in existence; the other 20 have disbanded over time. Some founder squadrons have reformed under [[Roman numerals]], having been refused permission to re-assume the F; the first Squadron to do so was XIX (19 Crawley) Squadron, Sussex Wing. Although Brooklands Squadron was the first Squadron to be established, it was given the Squadron number of 11F due to a clerical error.\n\nA Detached Flight uses its parent squadron number followed by the letters DF to show that it is a detached flight e.g. No 1408DF for No 1408 (Cranleigh) Detached Flight, raised by No 1408 (Dorking) Squadron.\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:Air Training Corps Formation - RIAT 2011 (5979714424).jpg|thumb|An Air Training Corps Formation - RIAT 2011]]\n{{Main|Activities of the Air Training Corps}}There are also opportunities for band music and many camps offer teenagers the chance to spend a week away from parents practicing fieldcraft or receiving instruction in gliding and other outdoor pursuits. Many of these activities, including gliding, have a well-defined scale of achievement that a cadet can work to build up; this includes the leadership qualities reflected in an NCO structure.[[File:Grob g109b zh268 motorglider arp.jpg|thumb|[[Grob G 109|Grob Vigilant T1]] motor-glider]]\n\n=== Annual camps ===\n[[File:ATC Band York.jpg|thumb|An Air Training Corps Marching Band from City of York Squadron]]The ATC runs numerous annual camps each year, run on RAF stations so that cadets may get a taste of service life. Annual camps are organised at wing level with place for all squadrons, so that every cadet who wishes to and who has achieved at least the First Class qualification may take part. Cadets usually stay in RAF barrack blocks and eat in the station's mess facilities. The itinerary is always packed with typical ATC activities such as air experience flying, shooting, adventure training and, of course, drill. Cadets also have the opportunity to visit various sections of the station and meet the people who work there.\n\nCadets may also have the opportunity to attend other sorts of annual camp, such as a locally (i.e. wing- or squadron-) organised camp based around adventure training or [[Air Training Corps Activities#Fieldcraft|fieldcraft]], or as guests on a camp run by one of the other cadet forces such as the [[Army Cadet Force]] or the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]]. There are also [[Air Training Corps Activities#Music camps|Music camps]] for band members.\n\nThe largest camp of all is the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] (RIAT) camp held annually in July at [[RAF Fairford]]. Each year more than 1,500 cadets and their staff spend between 1 and 3 weeks doing essential work in the preparation and the taking-down of the infrastructure of RIAT.<ref>https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/raf-aircadets/assets/File/Air%20Cadet%20magazine%20Autumn%202016.pdf</ref> On display days cadets have jobs to do and after the show weekend they are able to meet the crews and see the aeroplanes at close range.[[File:Air Cadets stall, Southport.JPG|thumb|Air Cadets stall at the 2009 Southport Air Show, [[Merseyside]], England]]\n\n===Work experience camps===\nAnother option for more senior cadets are work experience camps. Whilst annual camps aim to give cadets a general taste of service life, the work experience camps cater for cadets who are interested in a specific trade, such as the RAF Regiment or RAF Police. However, in recent years, the opportunities for work experience placements have decreased. Cadets can, however, contact their local Armed Forces Careers Office (AFCO).\n\n===Overseas camps===\nFor older and more experienced cadets who have achieved the Leading Cadet qualification and have attended a UK Annual Camp, the corps also offers overseas camps. These are generally more relaxed and seen as a reward for hard-working and long-serving cadets. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and the closure of RAF stations in Germany, the number of overseas camp opportunities has decreased. As of 2007 the destinations for overseas camps are:\n\n* [[RAF Akrotiri]] on [[Cyprus]]. A 7-day camp over the Easter school holiday period and at select other times of the year.\n* [[RAF Gibraltar]] in [[Gibraltar]].\n* Sennelager Training Area in Germany\n* JHQ [[RAF Rheindahlen|Rheindahlen]] in Germany.\n* [[Ramstein Air Base|USAF Ramstein]] in Germany. A camp at the base during the summer.\n* [[International Four Days Marches Nijmegen|International Four Days Marches]] in [[Nijmegen]], The Netherlands, annually in July, where cadets complete a {{convert|165|km|mi|adj=on}} walk over 4 days.\n\nFormer RAF bases that hosted overseas camps included [[RAF Laarbruch]], [[RAF G\u00fctersloh]], and [[RAF Gatow]].\n\n===Corps-wide Trophies===\nATC squadrons each have a chance annually to win the two most prized trophies in the corps. The Sir [[Alan Lees]] trophy is awarded by the ATC commandant to the squadron with the best statistics and overall impression when inspected. The Morris Trophy is awarded to one of the 6 regional candidates upon inspection by the commandant.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sir Alan Lees Trophy\n|-\n|1952\n|No. 187 (Worcestershire) Squadron, West Mercian Wing\n|[[Squadron Leader|Sqn Ldr]] Charles Baynton-Hughes MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1971\n|No. 187 (City of Worcester) Squadron, West Mercian Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Charles Baynton-Hughes MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1976\n|176 (Hove) Squadron, Sussex Wing\n|[[Flight Lieutenant|Flt Lt]] F P Le Duc MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1979 \n|93 (City of Bath) Squadron, Somerset Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Brian T Higgins RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1981\n|2427 (Biggin Hill) Squadron, Kent Wing\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|93 (City of Bath) Squadron, Somerset Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Brian T Higgins MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1983\n|93 (City of Bath) Squadron, Somerset Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Brian T Higgins MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1993\n|No. 424 (Southampton) Squadron, Hampshire & Isle of Wight\n|Sqn Ldr A Jones MBE  RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1994\n|No. 111 (Sunderland) Squadron, Durham & Northumberland Wing\n|Flt Lt David Harris RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1995\n|No. 1145 (Dunfermline) Squadron, Dundee & Central Scotland Wing\n|Flt Lt Ross Mitchell RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2000\n|No. 230 (Congleton) Squadron, Staffordshire Wing\n|Flt Lt Rod Goodier RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2001\n|No. 215 (City of Swansea) Squadron, No.3 Welsh Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Phillip Flower MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2005\n|No. 215 (City of Swansea) Squadron, No.3 Welsh Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Phillip Flower MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2007\n|No. 1145 (Dunfermline) Squadron, Dundee & Central Scotland Wing\n|Flt Lt Ross Mitchell RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2008\n|No. 241 (Wanstead and Woodford) Squadron, London Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Jerry Godden RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2009\n|No. 610 (Chester) Squadron, Merseyside Wing\n|Flt Lt John Kendal RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2010\n|No. 1475 (Dulwich) Squadron, London Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Kevin Mehmet MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2011\n|No. 215 (City of Swansea) Squadron, No. 3 Welsh Wing<ref name=\"Air Cadets News\">{{cite web| title=Air Cadets News| url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/newsandevents/index.cfm?topic=1C52325B-F6AD-6C90-D1AD0277EBE01144&storyid=CD2175F1-5056-A318-A8F353F500BF7334| work=Best of the best...

In addition, there are also trophies presented annually by the [[Royal Air Forces Association]]. These trophies include the \"Sir Douglas Bader Wings Appeal Trophy\" for the ATC squadron collecting the most money on a per capita basis, The squadron achieving second place is awarded the \"Sir Augustus Walker Trophy\". The \"Sir Robert Saundby Trophy\" is awarded for collecting the highest net Wings Appeal amount.\n\nThe Quinton Memorial Trophy is a national award presented annually to the adult non-commissioned officer who has gained the top academic results in the senior non-commissioned officer initial courses held at the Air Cadet Adult Training Facility, Royal Air Force College, Cranwell. This trophy is named in honour of Flight Lieutenant [[John Quinton]].<ref group=note>Flight Lieutenant John Alan Quinton was an RAF navigator on a Wellington aircraft, which was flying an air cadet on an Air Experience Flight in 1951. During the flight, the aircraft was involved in a mid-air collision and Flight Lieutenant Quinton gave the only parachute within reach to the cadet, pushing him out of the aircraft. His quick thinking and heroic action saved the life of the cadet but cost him his own, for which he was posthumously awarded the George Cross.</ref>\n\n==Cadet Ranks==\n{{see also|List of United Kingdom Cadet Force by Rank}}\n\n===Cadets===\nYoung people who have begun their 2nd year of Secondary School (Year 8) and are under 16 3/4 years old can join the ATC. They are initially given the title 'recruit' and can go along to most meetings to get a feel for the ATC. Enrolment confers the status of Second Class Cadet<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/who-we-are/ranks/|title=Ranks|website=RAF Air Cadets|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> and upon completion of the First Class syllabus, they become First Class Cadets and receive their First Class badge to be worn on their brassard. First class classification can take 3 to 6 months to reach, depending upon the squadron's activities and schedule. Once cadets have successfully completed lessons in a number of subjects and achieved first class classification, they are able to take part in almost all ATC activities. Those who stay on beyond 18 are known as Staff Cadets and wear rank slides denoting such. All cadets over the age of 18 must complete AVIP (Adult Volunteer Induction Programme) prior to their 18th birthday and must be [[Disclosure and Barring Service|DBS]] cleared. Once a Cadet has completed the AVIP, and subject to approval from the Cadet's Wing Commander their Cadet service is extended to their 20th birthday. After this point Cadet service is terminated.\n\nAll cadets are issued with a uniform and must each pay a small amount in subscriptions (or 'subs' as they are commonly known), usually around \u00a350&ndash;\u00a3100 per year, although this can vary widely from squadron to squadron. Activities such as smallbore and fullbore target rifle shooting, flying and gliding are paid for from the budget of the Royal Air Force.\n\n===Cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs)===\nAs cadets become more experienced, and if suitable, they can be promoted by their squadron's commanding officer (CO) to the status of cadet [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]. Promotion to the rank of corporal, sergeant and flight sergeant is at the discretion of the Commanding Officer. They (or a representative) will make a decision based on merit and leadership potential &ndash; many squadrons have formal selection procedures including interviews, whilst others select by observing potential during normal training. All cadets, regardless of rank, must leave by age 20.\n\nThe NCO ranks within the ATC mirror those of the RAF's non-technical/flying trades and are, in ascending order of seniority:\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | '''Cadet ranks and insignia'''\n| {{Ranks and Insignia of UK/CDT/ATC}}\n|}\n\nIt is common within the ATC to abbreviate these ranks by dropping the prefix \"cadet\". Cadet Warrant Officers are not addressed as Sir/Ma'am but as \"Cadet Warrant\" or \"Warrant Officer\", the former being preferred. Commonly referred to informally as, \"CWO ''(pronounced si: w\u0259\u028a)''. This is the only rank in the Corps to accommodate the \"Cadet\" prefix upon being referred to by members of the Corps.<ref>{{cite journal|title=General Service Training|journal=Air Cadet Publication|date=2000|volume=31|issue=Section 1 \u2013 the air training corps|page=31.1.3\u20139 Methods of Address}}</ref> This is to distinguish them from the adult staff, as they are at least 18 years of age and could easily be confused with an adult member of staff, or a serving member of the RAF.\n\nPromotion to Cadet Warrant Officer is decided by a panel at wing level once a recommendation form has been submitted by the Officer Commanding of the prospective candidate's Squadron. Prospective candidates will be a Staff Cadet Flight Sergeant, preferably holding the Master Cadet classification (see below) and will be required to attend an interview with the wing commander or his/her representative. Once the Wing Commander approves the promotion to Cadet Warrant Officer, the recommendation is sent to HQAC at RAFC Cranwell. The recommendation will then receive final approval and a certificate of appointment will be issued to the successful candidate.\n\n===Staff cadets===\nAll cadets who are over the age of 18 must complete an \"AVIP\" (Adult Volunteer Induction programme) and will have the prefix \"Staff Cadet\" before their rank. These cadets wear a rank slide with the words 'STAFF CADET' embroidered below their rank insignia (or on plain slides for those of cadet rank). A staff cadet has extra responsibilities over cadets who are under the age of 18, including a duty of care to younger cadets and NCOs. These cadets have also hold enhanced [[Disclosure and Barring Service]] Certificates in the same way as adult staff.\n\nStaff cadets are considered adult members of staff to some extent. Their washing facilities and accommodation is however segregated from both adult staff and cadets.\n\n==Cadet Classification Syllabus==\nNot all cadets who join the ATC can expect to receive promotion. However, all cadets can progress through the training system and, by passing exams, achieve different classifications. The classification levels are '''Junior Cadet''', '''Second Class Cadet''' (this is automatically achieved on enrolment), '''First Class Cadet''', '''Leading Cadet''', '''Senior Cadet''' and '''Master Air Cadet'''. In order to achieve these qualifications, cadets study a variety of subjects through tuition from the instructors and/or self-study from Ultilearn. Each successive qualification generally allows a cadet greater participation in ATC activities. Cadets who have achieved the Master air cadet classification have completed their academic training and could formerly attain a [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] Level 2 in Aviation Studies (equivalent to 2 [[GCSE]]s A*\u2013C) via [[CVQO]].\n\nInstructor Cadet is not a classification as such, but rather a qualification. Cadets need to be at least 16 years of age to take part in this one-day course, which allows them to teach other cadets. Although this is not compulsory, ATC Wings ordinarily feed this hand-in-hand with the Staff Cadet Course (see below). Upon successful completion of this course, the cadet will be awarded a yellow lanyard to distinguish them. This is worn over the left shoulder and fastened to a small black Royal Air Force button or the left shirt pocket button when not wearing a jumper.\n\n===Marking methodology===\n\nLeading Cadet, Senior Cadet and Master Cadet exams consist of assessment criteria each containing two questions. A cadet must achieve either 1 or 2 marks (50% or 100%) for each module in order to pass. All exams are now taken online on a system called Ultilearn.\n\n===First Class Cadet===\n\nFirst Class is also commonly referred to as 'Basic Training'. A variety of methods are used to test a cadet's understanding of the subject, including practical tests and exercises to test ability, and interviews/quizzes to test knowledge.\nAll junior cadets also have to pass a practical Drill Test to become first class. The drill test is a sequence of simple drill manoeuvres essential for forming squads and a good foundation to build on for more advanced drill.\n\n===Leading Cadet===\n\nFor a cadet to become a leading cadet, they must have already gained first-class status. They will then have to complete 3 examinations: Navigation on Land using a map and compass, Principles of Flight and Airmanship Knowledge.\n\n===Senior and Staff Cadet (old syllabus)===\n\n[[File:MOIC.jpg|thumb|150px|An \"Instructor Cadet\" yellow lanyard]]\nPrior to September 2010, for a cadet to become a senior cadet, they had already to have gained leading cadet status and taken 2 exams from a choice of 8 subjects, examined in the same way as for the Leading cadet syllabus. The 8 subjects were: Air Navigation, Pilot Navigation, Satellite Communications, Propulsion, Airframes, Advanced Radio and Radar, Aircraft Handling and Operational Flying.\n\nThe highest academic classification was Staff Cadet. For a cadet to become a staff cadet, they had to have already gained Senior Cadet status, be 15 years old, and to have sat and passed two more exams from the same subject list as for Senior classification, along with an interview with a wing staff officer and an assessment of teaching a lesson they would then be awarded their yellow lanyard.\n\n===Senior and Master (new syllabus)===\n\nIn September 2010, a new classification structure, syllabus and examination process came into force. The following subjects are available: Piston Engine Propulsion, Jet Engine Propulsion, Rocketry, Aircraft Handling and Flying Techniques, Air Power, Airframes, Avionics and Aircraft Electrical Systems, Military Aircraft Systems, Basic Air Navigation, Basic Principles of Pilot Navigation, Advanced Radio and Radar, and Data Communications. For each level, cadets must pass three of the subjects. Master Air Cadet has its own new badge for the brassard which shows an ATC Falcon surrounded by laurel leaves.\n\n===Specialist Instructor and Leadership Qualifications===\n\n[[File:QAIC.jpg|thumb|150px|A Qualified Aerospace Instructor Cadet wearing the blue QAI Lanyard]]\n[[File:Junior-leader-e1429811098300.jpg|thumb|150px|Qualified Junior Leaders wearing the maroon JL Lanyard]]\nWith the change of the classification structure in September 2010 the classification of staff cadet changed to become Instructor Cadet. An Instructor Cadet is denoted by a yellow lanyard worn over the left shoulder. Only Master Cadets will be permitted to wear the yellow lanyard. Whilst being a Master Cadet, there must also be a necessary Method of Instruction Course which then grants the ability to wear the lanyard.\n\nAlongside Instructor Cadet there is another lanyard that can be awarded to cadets who are interested in specialising in teaching aerospace subjects. These qualified cadets are known as Qualified Aerospace Instructors (QAIs) and wear a light blue lanyard over the left shoulder. The Qualified Aerospace Instructors Course (QAIC) has been running since September 2008. The course is held at RAF Linton-On-Ouse and as of 2011 also at MOD Boscombe Down. The course is held from early September to Easter of the following year, beginning with a selection weekend in early September, and 7 total weekends (as of QAIC 8, prior to this there were only 6 training weekends) from late September until early March.<ref>{{cite web|title=QAIC 8 Covering Letter|url=http://www.aircadetsnorth.org/userfiles/files/QAIC%208%20-%20Covering%20Letter%20and%20Selection%20Criteria.pdf|website=Air Cadets North|publisher=QAIC Support Admin Centre|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> The course culminates in a 'Graduation Week' which is organised to coincide with the Easter holidays to avoid clashing with school programmes. After completing training in various modules they carry out an assessed lesson, earning the blue QAIC lanyard and flight suit badge. Along the way the achievements of the students have been recognised by the Institute of Leadership and Management who offer an ILM Level 2 Certificate to graduating students and by the Royal Aeronautical Society who offer affiliated membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaic.org/Pages/AboutTheCourse.php |title=About the course |accessdate=18 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327004819/http://www.qaic.org/Pages/AboutTheCourse.php |archivedate=27 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nFor those interested in fieldcraft teaching and leadership there is the Junior Leaders Course. Successful completion of the course awards the participant a maroon lanyard to be worn over the left shoulder and a junior leaders badge to sew on to the left sleeve of their No.3 Service Dress (field uniform) to show they are a qualified Junior Leader. The course runs from September to Easter, involving nine weekend training camps and an assessment week.  The course is aimed at more senior cadets, and as such an age restriction of 17 years applies. Not only this, but the course also requires the participant to hold the rank of Cadet Sergeant or higher. The course is also open to Sea Cadets and Army Cadets {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and culminates in the award of a Level 3 Certificate<ref>{{cite book|title=Junior Leaders Course 18 Calling Letter|date=19 May 2016|publisher=Officer Commanding Junior Leaders|page=13. a.

All uniformed staff must attend training courses run by the RAF at the ATC Adult Training Facility, [[RAF College Cranwell]] (ATF), usually within a year of appointment, with further courses as they progress up the rank structure. Commissioned officers formerly wore a gilt 'VRT' pin upon their rank braid to denote being commissioned officers of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)|Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)]], while Warrant Officers and NCOs wore a gilt 'ATC' pin. Both officers and NCOs wear embroidered rank slides with the lettering 'RAF AIR CADETS', and on No. 1 Service Dress officers and NCOs wear gilt 'RAFAC' pins to reflect the new RAFAC/Cadet Forces Commission.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+Adult Staff Ranks Pre-December 2017\n|-\n!

The RAFVR(T) is non-combatant and there is no training for any form of active duty, or integration into the duties of other full-time or reserve duties. The RAFVR(T) officer is concerned only with the Air Cadets. Unless an officer has previous service, he or she is commissioned as a substantive Pilot Officer, termed Officer Cadet until the Officers Initial Course (OIC) at RAF Cranwell is completed.<ref group=\"note\">Unlike RAF Officer Cadets at the RAF College or RAFVR Officer Cadets of the University Air Squadron, RAFVR(T) Officer Cadets are, in fact, commissioned. In coming years this is likely to change and the non-commissioned Officer Cadet RAFVR(T) rank will be introduced, bringing the RAFVR(T) in line with the RAF and RAFVR.</ref> Promotion to Flying Officer normally occurs after two years. Former regular commissioned officers usually start at Flying Officer, subject to certain conditions being met. Upon becoming [[Officer Commanding]] of a squadron, completing an Officers' Senior Course (OSC) and subject to certain conditions being met, the rank of Flight Lieutenant is bestowed.\n\nAs of December 2017, VRT Officers had their commissions transferred to the new Cadet Forces Commission (CFC) and ranks framework.<ref name=\"AirCadet W2017\"/><ref name=\"RAFAC Ranks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aircadetsnorth.org/information-ranks.html|title=Rank Structure|website=Air Cadets North|access-date=17 November 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/758400/00149.pdf Royal Warrant for Cadet Force commission]</ref> Their liability remains unchanged as under the RAFVR(T) branch.\n\nSquadrons are usually commanded by CFC Flight Lieutenants, who are also found as Wing and Regional staff officers along with Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders. Particularly large squadrons are sometimes commanded by Squadron Leaders (usually when the squadron has 100 or more cadets).\n\nCommonly, the most senior rank in the Cadet Forces Commission is that of Wing Commander, but most recently the ambassador to the Air Cadets will be appointed to the honorary rank of Group Captain in the RAFAC, under a CFC.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | '''Adult Officer Ranks Post-December 2017'''<ref name=\"AC101 Ranks\">{{cite web\n |url=https://aircadet101.weebly.com/cfc-explained.html\n |title=CFC Explained\n |website=Air Cadet 101\n |access-date=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n|-  align=\"center\"\n!

Adult NCOs/WOs are uniformed in the same way as their RAF counterparts with two exceptions: formerly a small gilt ''ATC'' badge was worn on the rank badge, now the embroidered text of \"RAF AIR CADETS\" appears below the rank insignia, and Warrant Officers wear a different rank badge (unless they have previous regular or active reserves warranted service).\n\nThe ranks of Adult NCOs/WOs were Sergeant (ATC), Flight Sergeant (ATC) and Warrant Officer (ATC).<ref group=\"note\">Prior to the 'LaSER (London and South East Region) Review' of 2003, the adult ranks of Sergeant and Flight Sergeant did not exist, meaning that the non-commissioned rank structure of a squadron was more straightforward i.e. Cadet, Cadet Corporal, Cadet Sergeant, Cadet Flight Sergeant, Cadet Warrant Officer, Adult Warrant Officer. This has been disturbed by inserting the ranks of Sgt (ATC) and FS (ATC) and WO (ATC). The rank of Sgt (ATC) is senior to all cadet ranks, including CWO. However, this does allow a wider scope for developing staff who do not wish to become commissioned officers, and brings the ATC's adult rank structure more in line with those of the other cadet forces, whose adult ranks begin at Sergeant or service equivalent.</ref> As of December 2017, ATC SNCOs and WOs had their ranks transferred to the new RAFAC commissions and ranks framework. A gilt RAFAC badge is worn on the lapels when in No.1 dress uniform to denote membership within the cadet forces.<ref name=\"AirCadet W2017\"/><ref name=\"RAFAC Ranks\" />\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | '''[[Non-commissioned officer|Noncommissioned Officers (NCOs)]]'''\n|-  align=\"center\"\n!

Unlike adult NCOs and Officers, CIs do not wear a uniform, although until recently greens were acceptable for fieldcraft and shooting activities, flying suits are still to be worn by those serving on AEF's or VGS', for safety reasons, which override other dress regulations. CI's do not officially form part of the chain of command in the squadron, but they may hold what might be called Command posts. It is expected that any cadet, irrespective of rank, should and will listen to CI's and obey relevant instructions given. A Civilian Instructor's recognised dress consists of a light blue polo shirt and dark blue sweatshirt bearing the name of the corps and \"[[Royal Air Force]]\", in an effort to standardise the means by which CIs are identified. CI's are addressed as Sir or Ma'am by cadets when speaking to them or Mr, Mrs, Miss then surname by staff speaking to them or by anyone who is referring to them when they are not present, neither \"CI\" and surname nor \"staff'\" are correct forms of address. Staff is the term of address for service personnel junior to NCO rank.\n\nMany CIs are ex RAF or ex military or have skills that complement the aims of the ATC.\n\nSome CIs may hold positions such as the Squadron Adjutant or Training Officer within the squadron.\n\nSimilarly, ATC chaplains are usually civilian members of the local clergy (although forces chaplains may join as Service Instructors). The role of an ATC chaplain is to 'provide appropriate pastoral care for all personnel within the Air Cadet Organisation irrespective of religious belief or status<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/want-to-join/join-as-an-adult-volunteer/join-as-a-chaplain/|title=Join as a Chaplain|work=RAF Air Cadets|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref>'. A chaplain's role in the local squadron is to offer guidance and leadership to cadets and members of staff on moral and spiritual matters. The commitment expected of a chaplain is a monthly visit to lead what is termed 'the Padre's hour' and to conduct the formal Enrolment Service when new cadets join. ATC chaplains are supported by the RAF Chaplain's Branch.<ref name=\"auto\"/> ATC Chaplains do not wear uniform but are recognised by a Chaplain's badge on their lapel and a larger version on their preaching scarf.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Even if it is not their custom to do so, ATC chaplains are expected to wear a [[clerical collar]] when on an RAF station.<ref>http://2484aircadets.org/AP%201358C.pdf p132</ref> The equivalent No 2 working dress for a chaplain is a dark sweater with Chaplain's badge and a clerical collar.<ref>http://2484aircadets.org/AP%201358C.pdf p132 - p133</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n!Rank\n!Insignia\n|-\n| Civilian Instructor (CI)\n| None normally worn, although may be seen with a lapel pin or an armband, or may be wearing a sweatshirt or polo shirt with a logo.\n|-\n| [[Chaplain]]\n|Recognised by Chaplain's badge on their lapel or larger badge on their preaching scarf.<ref>http://2484aircadets.org/AP%201358C.pdf Page 126</ref> Expected to wear a clerical collar when on an RAF station.\n|}\n\n===Service instructors===\nMembers of the full-time and part-time (Reserve) Armed Forces often assist at ATC Squadrons in the role of Service Instructor &ndash; they engage in instructional duties which are often related to their serving role. Service Instructors wear the uniform of their parent unit and are addressed appropriately, with ranks junior to NCO being addressed as \"Staff\".\n\n== Investigation into sexual abuse ==\nIn 2012, payouts made to victims of sexual abuse across all Cadet Forces totalled \u00a31,475,844 from the MOD.

As a cadet becomes more experienced with camps and activities, the skills they will acquire will be rewarded with a corresponding badge according to the skill achieved and how advanced the cadet is at that particular skill (e.g. drumming, shooting, leadership, first aid).\n\nService as a cadet ends at the age of 18, although cadets over the age of 18 can be extended until the age of 20 if appointed as a [[Air Training Corps#Staff cadets|Staff Cadet]].\n\nIn April 2019, the ATC numbered 32,850 cadets (30.8% female) and 10,680 adult volunteers (31% female).<ref name=\"statistics\">{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/804484/MOD_Sponsored_Cadet_Forces_Statistics_April_2019.pdf|title=MOD Sponsored Cadet Forces Statistics 2019|date=1 April 2019|website=GOV.UK|access-date=3 August 2019}}</ref> In addition, there were several thousand civilian committee members.\n\nTogether with the RAF contingents of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], the ATC form the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]], formerly known as the Air Cadet Organisation,<ref name=\"AirCadet W2017\">{{cite magazine |date=Winter 2017 |title=HM The Queen Approves New Commission For Cadet Force Volunteers |url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/index.cfm/_api/render/file/?method=inline&fileID=2CE4A3A7-5056-A318-A8C439BBAB127BBA |magazine=Air Cadet |location=Bourne |publisher=Warners Midlands plc |access-date=17 November 2017 }}</ref> part of the [[Community Cadet Forces]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation===\n{{Main|John Adrian Chamier}}\n\nAir Commodore [[John Adrian Chamier|Sir John Chamier]] is affectionately known as the \"father of the air cadet movement\".<ref name=\"Air Cadet Organization\" /> He joined the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (the forerunner of the Royal Air Force) where he served as a pilot in [[World War I]], transferred to the Royal Air Force in 1918 and after retiring from the service in 1929, become Secretary-General of the [[Air League]] - an organisation made up of people who wanted to make the British public aware of the importance of military aviation. With the clouds of war beginning to form over Europe and the personal memory of how young men with only a few hours of training had been sent into air combat only to fall victim to well-trained enemy aviators, he conceived the idea of an aviation cadet corps.\n\n===Air Defence Cadet Corps===\n{{See also|Air Defence Cadet Corps}}\n[[File:Air cadets learn the basics of flight at RNAS St Merryn in Cornwall, February 1944.

In 1941, in order to provide the means of giving part-time air training to teenagers and young men who might later join the Royal Air Force, the ADCC was formally established as the Air Training Corps by Royal Warrant.\n\n===Air Training Corps===\n[[File:Slingsby (1249888545).jpg|right|thumb|[[Slingsby Tandem Tutor|Slingsby Cadet TX.3]] glider used by the ATC from 1953 to 1986.]]\nOn 5 February 1941, the Air Training Corps (ATC) was officially established, with [[King George VI]] agreeing to be the Air Commodore-in-Chief, and issuing a [[Warrant (law)|Royal Warrant]] setting out the Corps' aims. Within the first month of its existence, the size of the old ADCC, now the ATC, virtually doubled to more than 400 squadrons and continued to grow thereafter. A new badge was designed for the ATC and, once approved by the King, was distributed in August 1941. The motto ' ''Venture Adventure'' ', devised by Air Commodore Chamier, was adopted by the ATC and incorporated into the badge.\n\nThe new ATC squadrons adopted training programmes to prepare young men for entry to the Royal Air Force. Squadrons arranged visits to RAF and [[Fleet Air Arm]] stations as part of the cadets' training, where a flight might be a possibility. Such opportunities were not widely available, however, and many cadets were disappointed. One solution was to introduce opportunities for [[Aviation|flying]], as a way to allow a cadet to get the feel of an aircraft in flight and to handle an aircraft's controls whilst airborne. After the end of the Second World War, gliding lessons became available.<ref name=\"ACP_31\">{{citation\n| year=2000\n| title=Air Cadet Publication 31: General Service Training\n| volume=Section 1 - The Air Training Corps\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n| pages=1\u20133/4/5\n}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1980s, females were unable to join the ATC, although they were able to join an attached unit of the [[Girls Venture Corps]] (GVC) which had been formed in the early years of the [[Second World War]], if one was available at that location.<ref name=\"GVCAC\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.gvcac.org.uk/\n| title=The Girls Venture Corps Air Cadets\n| accessdate=28 September 2008\n| author=GVCAC HQ website\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921003109/http://www.gvcac.org.uk/\n| archivedate=21 September 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> As of 2013, the GVCAC still exists, although in greatly reduced numbers due to competition from the ATC, and the two organisations no longer share a site.\n\nBefore May 2008, cadets would spend a lot of time in the classroom before obtaining First Class classification, studying the following subjects: The Air Training Corps, The Royal Air Force, History of Flight, Initial Expedition Training, Basic Communications and Airmanship I. After a number of lectures and when the cadet felt ready, they would take a multiple choice examination, either on paper or on a computer. Some wings ran courses that would involve the cadet spending a few solid days learning and then awarded the appropriate classification if successful in their exams. In May 2008, HQAC decided to change the training programme for junior and second class cadets, sensing that new recruits were being deterred by exams. In March 2016, after a review of the then current training syllabus, the new \"Progressive Training Syllabus\" was introduced, which provided for four levels of each badge (blue, bronze, silver, and gold).<ref name=\"Progressive Training Syllabus\">{{cite web\n| url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/news/new-progressive-training-syllabus-launched/\n| title=New Progressive Training Syllabus Launched\n| date= 2 March 2017\n| accessdate=11 April 2017\n| author=Royal Air Force Air Cadets\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PTS\">{{cite web\n| url=http://42fkingslynnatc.org.uk/images/Progressive%20Training%20Guide.pdf\n| title=New Progressive Training Syllabus PDF\n| accessdate=17 November 2017\n| author=Royal Air Force Air Cadets - 42F (King's Lynn) Squadron Air Training Corps\n}}</ref> \n[[File:RAF Air Cadet Progressive Training Syllabus.jpg|thumb|RAF Air Cadet Progressive Training Syllabus]]\n\n===Air Cadet Organisation===\n{{main|Royal Air Force Air Cadets}}\n\nUntil October 2017, advertising material such as leaflets and official websites branded the Air Training Corps and [[Combined Cadet Force]] collectively as the Air Cadet Organisation (ACO).

Each region is sub-divided into a number of [[wing (air force unit)|wings]]. There were historically six wings per region, however, as of 2013 there were 34 wings, most named after the one or two [[Counties of the United Kingdom|counties]] of the United Kingdom that they operate in. Wings are further sub-divided into sectors. Within the sectors lie squadrons, and it is the squadron that is the focal point for the majority of members of the Corps. As of 2019 there were 952 ATC squadrons and detached flights, each assigned to a wing.\n\nThe ATC is the largest part of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets (RAFAC), along with the RAF sections of the Combined Cadet Force. The RAFAC forms one of the seven functional areas of [[No 22 Group RAF]], which is responsible for the recruitment and selection of all RAF personnel and for the policy and delivery of RAF non-operational training (including flying training).\n\n===Regions===\n[[File:Air Training Corps, Rothes - geograph.org.uk - 1528243.jpg|thumb|Air Training Corps, Rothes]]\n[[File:Albion Road, London N16 - Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force - geograph.org.uk - 1061053.jpg|thumb|Albion Road, London N16 - Air Training Corps, Army Cadet Force These premises have been used by the Air Training Corps (ATC) and Army Cadets for training since at least 1940]]\n[[File:The HQ of 1465 (Gwynedd) Air Training Corps in Dale Street. - geograph.org.uk - 864764.jpg|thumb|The HQ of 1465 (Gwynedd) Air Training Corps in Dale Street]]\n[[File:ATC 300 (Axholme) Sqn. - geograph.org.uk - 917529.jpg|thumb|ATC 300 (Axholme) Sqn.

In towns not large enough to sustain a squadron of 30 cadets, or as a supplement to an existing squadron in a larger town or city, a Detached Flight (DF) may be formed. A detached flight operates much like any other unit, but is technically a component part of a nearby, larger squadron. {{As of|2019|April|df=UK}} there were over 912 ATC squadrons and 40 detached flights.<ref name=\"squadron-finder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.air-cadets-squadron-finder.org/all-air-cadets-squadrons/|title=Air Cadets (ATC) Squadron Finder & contact details|publisher=Air-cadets-squadron-finder.org|accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nCommanding Officers receive a Cadet Forces commission, introduced in 2017 and restated in 2018.<ref>{{London Gazette\n| issue = 62208\n| date = 20 February 2018\n| page = 3146-3147\n| supp = 1\n}}</ref> Squadrons were previously commanded by a [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)]] RAFVR(T) officer, or sometimes a warrant officer. The commanding officer has a good deal of autonomy in running his or her unit, along with the responsibility that goes with it. Where a unit has other members of staff, the commanding officer allocates duties and provides recommendations on appointments, retentions and promotions. A Commanding Officer of an ATC Squadron can appoint Cadets up to the rank of Cadet Flight Sergeant (Cdt FS) without any external approval. Further Cadet promotion to the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer (CWO) requires recommendation being sent to their Squadron's Wing HQ.\n\nThe Squadron [[Warrant Officer]] (Sqn WO) commonly holds the rank of warrant officer, or may be a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO) if no warrant officer is available, and will typically have spent many years working within the squadron or at least within the ATC. In the case where no commissioned officers are present, the Sqn WO or SNCO will take charge of the unit. The squadron warrant officer usually has a closer relationship with the cadets than the commanding officer.\n\nThe establishment of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], WOs, senior NCOs and cadet NCOs is dependent on the size of the squadron or detached flight and this basic structure has many permutations &ndash; varying with the number of cadets and staff, accommodation and facilities. A typical small detached flight may consist only of the Officer Commanding and fifteen cadets and is often housed in rented accommodation. At the other end of the scale, a large squadron can consist of 120 cadets or more, four commissioned officers, two non-commissioned officers and a half-dozen civilian instructors. Civilian instructors (many of whom are retired RAF regulars) form the backbone of the ACO.\n\n=== Civilian committees ===\n{{more citations needed| section|date=July 2019}}{{tone|section|date=July 2019}}\nA Civilian Committee (or Civcom) underpins all local funding that the RAF cannot provide beyond core services for the squadron. Each is an independent charity and operates to meet the funding needs of the local squadron which is under the control of the commanding officer. Since the uniformed officers and civilian instructors in the ATC have no financial responsibilities, but still need money to manage and provide cadet activities such as annual and overseas camps and adventure training, the civilian committee is entirely responsible for these finances and provides them to the squadron for use. There is no rank structure in civilian committees, nor are its members beholden to anyone. Serving as trustees, they are unpaid volunteers who support the cadet activities financially leaving the paid uniformed officers to deliver the cadet experience.\n\nThe RAFAC (ATC) is itself not a charitable organisation and is not itself a legal entity and so has no legal status. That defers to the MOD. For this and other reasons, the trustees within each Civilian Committee are required to be responsible for, and accountable for, the charitable fundraising of the squadron. As with any charity, three officers (Chairperson, Secretary and Treasurer) are elected at an AGM, possibly with the addition of a deputy Chairperson, and then exist as an independent group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-for-charities-with-a-connection-to-a-non-charity|title=Guidance for charities with a connection to a non-charity|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref> to raise and manage funds in a lawful manner in accordance with the Charities Act. They do this under the status of an 'excepted charity' which requires that they conduct themselves wholly to the [[Charities Act 2011]] but are excepted from sending in annual reports to the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]].\n\nThe squadron commander and chaplain are ''ex-officio'' members of their civilian committee and have no voting rights, however common-sense determines they may advise in squadron-related matters. While co-operation between the squadron and the civilian committee is desirable at all times, there is no line of command or authority of anyone other than the trustees of the Civilian Committee. This includes any uniformed personnel up to, and including, the Commandant Air Cadets.\n\nA Civilian Committee is responsible for overseeing the initial unit formation and direction and will monitor the welfare of cadets. Civilian committees often include parents of cadets and retired ATC staff. Many squadron charities decide to operate against the RAFAC document known as ACP-11<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/490101/20151218-FOI-ACO-Charity-Commission-Attachment.pdf|title=ACP-11}}</ref> which has been the traditional constitution. However, there is no requirement to do so as long as the civilian committee establishes a constitution with acceptable charitable object statements; these may be similar to those in ACP-11 but offers the advantage of more local definition in deciding the use of funds. The Charity Commission has helpfully produced downloadable model constitutions<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/setting-up-a-charity-model-governing-documents|title=Charity Commission Constitutions}}</ref> of which the 'Model Constitution for a Small Charity' is ideal for the purpose of registering a charity at squadron level and indeed this has been the route required for all squadrons in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe most recent revision of ACP-11 was conceived as a means of retaining control for the organisation over civilian committees through what is known as the Association Model of trusteeship. The document is controversial and has been questioned by experienced trustees in charitable work on the basis that it is confused and almost certainly contradicts charity law. Furthermore, to be a lawful and binding constitution for a squadron, it must be adopted autonomously by the trustees of each civilian committee and not released as an automatic update in the manner of all other ACP documents which relate to governance of the uniform cadre.\n\nAlthough there is no hierarchy, there are links that tie the organisation together structurally. Those that form the uniformed chain of command are self-explanatory. For civilians however, these links are formed of upward provision of trustees. So, from the civilian committees within a number of squadrons is elected a Wing chairperson to serve as a trustee of the Wing charity. In theory, the same happens from Wing to Region however, there has been a change in recent years where these positions have been appointed rather than by bona-fide election.\n\nAny civilian committee in England and Wales that has an annual income that exceeds \u00a35,000 in any one year, may register their charity with the Charity Commission. The charity commissions of Scotland and Northern Ireland require committees located in those countries to register and have done so for several years.\n\nThe role of a civilian committee also extends to cadet welfare and this can be a sensitive area at times. Cadets who feel unhappy or experience bullying, or who have safeguarding issues should be able to approach members of the civilian committee in confidence to discuss their concerns. Depending on the nature of the issue at hand, relationships may become strained where it is felt that commanding officers are not implementing the set procedure in such matters as the rule book (another ACP) prescribes.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Aims and motto===\n[[File:Remembrance Day Ripon.jpg|thumb|Cadets from the Air Training Corps and Army Cadet Force during [[Remembrance Sunday]], 2006]]\nThe Aims of the Air Training Corps, as set out in the Royal Warrant and approved by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM the Queen]], the British sovereign, are:\n\n* To promote and encourage among young men and women a practical interest in [[aviation]] and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).\n* To provide training which will be useful in both the services and civilian life.\n* To foster a spirit of adventure and to develop the qualities of leadership and good citizenship.<ref name=\"horizons\">{{citation\n| year=2007\n| title=Expand Your Horizons: Adult Volunteers\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n}}</ref>\n\nThe corps [[motto]] is \"Venture, Adventure\".<ref name=\"Air Cadet Organization\">{{citation\n| year=2000\n| title=Air Cadet Publication 31: General Service Training\n| volume=Section 1 - The Air Training Corps\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n| pages=1\n}}</ref>\n\nIn late December, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] resigned from his role as honorary [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]] - having served in this role since 1953.

I further promise to be a good citizen and to do my duty to (God and^) the Queen, my Country and my Flag.\"<ref name=\"Form_3822\">{{citation\n| year=2004\n| title=RAF Form 3822: Cadet Record of Service\n| place=Lincolnshire\n| publisher=Air Cadet Organization\n}}</ref>\n\nThis promise is recorded by the cadet's signature in the cadet's Cadet Record of Service Book (RAF Form 3822)\nThe promise has recently been rewritten to accommodate everyone, whether or not they are religious.\n\n===Ensign===\n[[File:Ensign of the Air Training Corps.svg|thumb|Air Training Corps Ensign]]\nThe Air Training Corps Ensign is hoisted for every parade in the summer and hauled-down at dusk. It is expected that it should be treated with the same respect and dignity afforded to the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]]. In the event of poor weather conditions e.g. heavy rain or snowfall, the ensign would not be raised. If poor weather conditions are present whilst the ensign is raised, it would be hauled down at the soonest possible point. This is to avoid damage to the ensign and also as a mark of respect and discipline.\n\nThe ATC ensign is raised and lowered by a nominated member of the squadron, sometimes a cadet [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO), member of staff, or simply a cadet who has been chosen, with the salute being taken by any [[commissioned officer]], normally the squadron's [[Officer Commanding]]. All officers within view or earshot of the ensign are expected to salute during the hoisting and hauling down.\n\nMost ATC wings and squadrons also have a banner, in addition to an ensign, which is paraded on formal occasions. The ATC also has a Corps Banner, which is afforded the same courtesies as an RAF Squadron Standard or the RAF Queens Colour, although its status is different.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[File:Cadets Saint Peter Port 2012 b.jpg|thumb|Parade and church service in Saint Peter Port, featuring ATC and [[Combined Cadet Force|CCF]] cadets, [[Guernsey]], 16 September 2012]]\nAll cadets are issued with a uniform that is similar to [[Uniforms of the Royal Air Force|that worn by RAF personnel]] and are regulated by similar dress regulations to the RAF. The Air Training Corps' dress regulations can be found in AP1358C. Occasionally alterations have been made to the dress regulations as the organisation has developed over the years. One such example being the authorisation for [[Army Cadet Force|CFAVs]] and Cadets to wear [[Multi-Terrain Pattern]] (MTP) uniform in 2014.\n\nThe standard uniform consists of a dark blue shirt and [[brassard]], blue-grey trousers (male cadets) or skirt/slacks (female cadets), a v-neck blue-grey jumper and an RAF blue beret with an Air Training Corps cap badge.\n\nSome Squadrons differentiate themselves from each other at a local level. One such example would be different coloured pieces of cloth behind the cap badges on the beret. This allowed Cadet NCOs and CFAV to distinguish between Cadets of differing Flights. This practice, however, is not officially authorised from HQAC and therefore is not officially allowed in the ATC. All uniform except black parade shoes and combat boots are provided at the expense of the ATC. Girls are also expected to provide their own hair nets, hair spray, hair ties etc. In order to keep it neat as well as 15 denier, matt, tights in the shade barely black. Boys hair must be kept short and tidy, above the collar and clear of the ears, although some squadrons are now allowing long male hair to be tied in the same fashion as the girls, however, this is not widespread. Plain black socks are also required.\n\nCadets are also issued with a light blue shirt and tie for formal occasions, and are usually either issued with or privately acquire a camouflage uniform, also known as a [[disruptive pattern material]] (DPM) uniform and more recently have been authorised to wear the modern [[Multi-Terrain Pattern]] (MTP). Cadets may be allowed or obliged to wear other specialist uniforms, such as [[flight suit]]s or other forms of protective clothing, when required.\n\n===Squadron Insignia===\nThe first 50 squadrons that were formed retain an F to show they are \"founder\" squadrons, e.g. 10F (Luton) Squadron or 1F (City of Leicester) Squadron. Only 30 of these are still in existence; the other 20 have disbanded over time. Some founder squadrons have reformed under [[Roman numerals]], having been refused permission to re-assume the F; the first Squadron to do so was XIX (19 Crawley) Squadron, Sussex Wing. Although Brooklands Squadron was the first Squadron to be established, it was given the Squadron number of 11F due to a clerical error.\n\nA Detached Flight uses its parent squadron number followed by the letters DF to show that it is a detached flight e.g. No 1408DF for No 1408 (Cranleigh) Detached Flight, raised by No 1408 (Dorking) Squadron.\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:Air Training Corps Formation - RIAT 2011 (5979714424).jpg|thumb|An Air Training Corps Formation - RIAT 2011]]\n{{Main|Activities of the Air Training Corps}}There are also opportunities for band music and many camps offer teenagers the chance to spend a week away from parents practicing fieldcraft or receiving instruction in gliding and other outdoor pursuits. Many of these activities, including gliding, have a well-defined scale of achievement that a cadet can work to build up; this includes the leadership qualities reflected in an NCO structure.[[File:Grob g109b zh268 motorglider arp.jpg|thumb|[[Grob G 109|Grob Vigilant T1]] motor-glider]]\n\n=== Annual camps ===\n[[File:ATC Band York.jpg|thumb|An Air Training Corps Marching Band from City of York Squadron]]The ATC runs numerous annual camps each year, run on RAF stations so that cadets may get a taste of service life. Annual camps are organised at wing level with place for all squadrons, so that every cadet who wishes to and who has achieved at least the First Class qualification may take part. Cadets usually stay in RAF barrack blocks and eat in the station's mess facilities. The itinerary is always packed with typical ATC activities such as air experience flying, shooting, adventure training and, of course, drill. Cadets also have the opportunity to visit various sections of the station and meet the people who work there.\n\nCadets may also have the opportunity to attend other sorts of annual camp, such as a locally (i.e. wing- or squadron-) organised camp based around adventure training or [[Air Training Corps Activities#Fieldcraft|fieldcraft]], or as guests on a camp run by one of the other cadet forces such as the [[Army Cadet Force]] or the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]]. There are also [[Air Training Corps Activities#Music camps|Music camps]] for band members.\n\nThe largest camp of all is the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]] (RIAT) camp held annually in July at [[RAF Fairford]]. Each year more than 1,500 cadets and their staff spend between 1 and 3 weeks doing essential work in the preparation and the taking-down of the infrastructure of RIAT.<ref>https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/raf-aircadets/assets/File/Air%20Cadet%20magazine%20Autumn%202016.pdf</ref> On display days cadets have jobs to do and after the show weekend they are able to meet the crews and see the aeroplanes at close range.[[File:Air Cadets stall, Southport.JPG|thumb|Air Cadets stall at the 2009 Southport Air Show, [[Merseyside]], England]]\n\n===Work experience camps===\nAnother option for more senior cadets are work experience camps. Whilst annual camps aim to give cadets a general taste of service life, the work experience camps cater for cadets who are interested in a specific trade, such as the RAF Regiment or RAF Police. However, in recent years, the opportunities for work experience placements have decreased. Cadets can, however, contact their local Armed Forces Careers Office (AFCO).\n\n===Overseas camps===\nFor older and more experienced cadets who have achieved the Leading Cadet qualification and have attended a UK Annual Camp, the corps also offers overseas camps. These are generally more relaxed and seen as a reward for hard-working and long-serving cadets. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and the closure of RAF stations in Germany, the number of overseas camp opportunities has decreased. As of 2007 the destinations for overseas camps are:\n\n* [[RAF Akrotiri]] on [[Cyprus]]. A 7-day camp over the Easter school holiday period and at select other times of the year.\n* [[RAF Gibraltar]] in [[Gibraltar]].\n* Sennelager Training Area in Germany\n* JHQ [[RAF Rheindahlen|Rheindahlen]] in Germany.\n* [[Ramstein Air Base|USAF Ramstein]] in Germany. A camp at the base during the summer.\n* [[International Four Days Marches Nijmegen|International Four Days Marches]] in [[Nijmegen]], The Netherlands, annually in July, where cadets complete a {{convert|165|km|mi|adj=on}} walk over 4 days.\n\nFormer RAF bases that hosted overseas camps included [[RAF Laarbruch]], [[RAF G\u00fctersloh]], and [[RAF Gatow]].\n\n===Corps-wide Trophies===\nATC squadrons each have a chance annually to win the two most prized trophies in the corps. The Sir [[Alan Lees]] trophy is awarded by the ATC commandant to the squadron with the best statistics and overall impression when inspected. The Morris Trophy is awarded to one of the 6 regional candidates upon inspection by the commandant.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Sir Alan Lees Trophy\n|-\n|1952\n|No. 187 (Worcestershire) Squadron, West Mercian Wing\n|[[Squadron Leader|Sqn Ldr]] Charles Baynton-Hughes MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1971\n|No. 187 (City of Worcester) Squadron, West Mercian Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Charles Baynton-Hughes MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1976\n|176 (Hove) Squadron, Sussex Wing\n|[[Flight Lieutenant|Flt Lt]] F P Le Duc MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1979 \n|93 (City of Bath) Squadron, Somerset Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Brian T Higgins RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1981\n|2427 (Biggin Hill) Squadron, Kent Wing\n|\n|-\n|1982\n|93 (City of Bath) Squadron, Somerset Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Brian T Higgins MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1983\n|93 (City of Bath) Squadron, Somerset Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Brian T Higgins MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1993\n|No. 424 (Southampton) Squadron, Hampshire & Isle of Wight\n|Sqn Ldr A Jones MBE  RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1994\n|No. 111 (Sunderland) Squadron, Durham & Northumberland Wing\n|Flt Lt David Harris RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|1995\n|No. 1145 (Dunfermline) Squadron, Dundee & Central Scotland Wing\n|Flt Lt Ross Mitchell RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2000\n|No. 230 (Congleton) Squadron, Staffordshire Wing\n|Flt Lt Rod Goodier RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2001\n|No. 215 (City of Swansea) Squadron, No.3 Welsh Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Phillip Flower MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2005\n|No. 215 (City of Swansea) Squadron, No.3 Welsh Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Phillip Flower MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2007\n|No. 1145 (Dunfermline) Squadron, Dundee & Central Scotland Wing\n|Flt Lt Ross Mitchell RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2008\n|No. 241 (Wanstead and Woodford) Squadron, London Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Jerry Godden RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2009\n|No. 610 (Chester) Squadron, Merseyside Wing\n|Flt Lt John Kendal RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2010\n|No. 1475 (Dulwich) Squadron, London Wing\n|Sqn Ldr Kevin Mehmet MBE RAFVR(T)\n|-\n|2011\n|No. 215 (City of Swansea) Squadron, No. 3 Welsh Wing<ref name=\"Air Cadets News\">{{cite web| title=Air Cadets News| url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/newsandevents/index.cfm?topic=1C52325B-F6AD-6C90-D1AD0277EBE01144&storyid=CD2175F1-5056-A318-A8F353F500BF7334| work=Best of the best...

These trophies include the \"Sir Douglas Bader Wings Appeal Trophy\" for the ATC squadron collecting the most money on a per capita basis, The squadron achieving second place is awarded the \"Sir Augustus Walker Trophy\". The \"Sir Robert Saundby Trophy\" is awarded for collecting the highest net Wings Appeal amount.\n\nThe Quinton Memorial Trophy is a national award presented annually to the adult non-commissioned officer who has gained the top academic results in the senior non-commissioned officer initial courses held at the Air Cadet Adult Training Facility, Royal Air Force College, Cranwell. This trophy is named in honour of Flight Lieutenant [[John Quinton]].<ref group=note>Flight Lieutenant John Alan Quinton was an RAF navigator on a Wellington aircraft, which was flying an air cadet on an Air Experience Flight in 1951. During the flight, the aircraft was involved in a mid-air collision and Flight Lieutenant Quinton gave the only parachute within reach to the cadet, pushing him out of the aircraft. His quick thinking and heroic action saved the life of the cadet but cost him his own, for which he was posthumously awarded the George Cross.</ref>\n\n==Cadet Ranks==\n{{see also|List of United Kingdom Cadet Force by Rank}}\n\n===Cadets===\nYoung people who have begun their 2nd year of Secondary School (Year 8) and are under 16 3/4 years old can join the ATC. They are initially given the title 'recruit' and can go along to most meetings to get a feel for the ATC. Enrolment confers the status of Second Class Cadet<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/who-we-are/ranks/|title=Ranks|website=RAF Air Cadets|access-date=2 December 2018}}</ref> and upon completion of the First Class syllabus, they become First Class Cadets and receive their First Class badge to be worn on their brassard. First class classification can take 3 to 6 months to reach, depending upon the squadron's activities and schedule. Once cadets have successfully completed lessons in a number of subjects and achieved first class classification, they are able to take part in almost all ATC activities. Those who stay on beyond 18 are known as Staff Cadets and wear rank slides denoting such. All cadets over the age of 18 must complete AVIP (Adult Volunteer Induction Programme) prior to their 18th birthday and must be [[Disclosure and Barring Service|DBS]] cleared. Once a Cadet has completed the AVIP, and subject to approval from the Cadet's Wing Commander their Cadet service is extended to their 20th birthday. After this point Cadet service is terminated.\n\nAll cadets are issued with a uniform and must each pay a small amount in subscriptions (or 'subs' as they are commonly known), usually around \u00a350&ndash;\u00a3100 per year, although this can vary widely from squadron to squadron. Activities such as smallbore and fullbore target rifle shooting, flying and gliding are paid for from the budget of the Royal Air Force.\n\n===Cadet non-commissioned officers (NCOs)===\nAs cadets become more experienced, and if suitable, they can be promoted by their squadron's commanding officer (CO) to the status of cadet [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]]. Promotion to the rank of corporal, sergeant and flight sergeant is at the discretion of the Commanding Officer. They (or a representative) will make a decision based on merit and leadership potential &ndash; many squadrons have formal selection procedures including interviews, whilst others select by observing potential during normal training. All cadets, regardless of rank, must leave by age 20.\n\nThe NCO ranks within the ATC mirror those of the RAF's non-technical/flying trades and are, in ascending order of seniority:\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin:0 12px 12px 0; margin:auto; width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | '''Cadet ranks and insignia'''\n| {{Ranks and Insignia of UK/CDT/ATC}}\n|}\n\nIt is common within the ATC to abbreviate these ranks by dropping the prefix \"cadet\". Cadet Warrant Officers are not addressed as Sir/Ma'am but as \"Cadet Warrant\" or \"Warrant Officer\", the former being preferred. Commonly referred to informally as, \"CWO ''(pronounced si: w\u0259\u028a)''. This is the only rank in the Corps to accommodate the \"Cadet\" prefix upon being referred to by members of the Corps.<ref>{{cite journal|title=General Service Training|journal=Air Cadet Publication|date=2000|volume=31|issue=Section 1 \u2013 the air training corps|page=31.1.3\u20139 Methods of Address}}</ref> This is to distinguish them from the adult staff, as they are at least 18 years of age and could easily be confused with an adult member of staff, or a serving member of the RAF.\n\nPromotion to Cadet Warrant Officer is decided by a panel at wing level once a recommendation form has been submitted by the Officer Commanding of the prospective candidate's Squadron. Prospective candidates will be a Staff Cadet Flight Sergeant, preferably holding the Master Cadet classification (see below) and will be required to attend an interview with the wing commander or his/her representative. Once the Wing Commander approves the promotion to Cadet Warrant Officer, the recommendation is sent to HQAC at RAFC Cranwell. The recommendation will then receive final approval and a certificate of appointment will be issued to the successful candidate.\n\n===Staff cadets===\nAll cadets who are over the age of 18 must complete an \"AVIP\" (Adult Volunteer Induction programme) and will have the prefix \"Staff Cadet\" before their rank. These cadets wear a rank slide with the words 'STAFF CADET' embroidered below their rank insignia (or on plain slides for those of cadet rank). A staff cadet has extra responsibilities over cadets who are under the age of 18, including a duty of care to younger cadets and NCOs. These cadets have also hold enhanced [[Disclosure and Barring Service]] Certificates in the same way as adult staff.\n\nStaff cadets are considered adult members of staff to some extent. Their washing facilities and accommodation is however segregated from both adult staff and cadets.\n\n==Cadet Classification Syllabus==\nNot all cadets who join the ATC can expect to receive promotion. However, all cadets can progress through the training system and, by passing exams, achieve different classifications. The classification levels are '''Junior Cadet''', '''Second Class Cadet''' (this is automatically achieved on enrolment), '''First Class Cadet''', '''Leading Cadet''', '''Senior Cadet''' and '''Master Air Cadet'''. In order to achieve these qualifications, cadets study a variety of subjects through tuition from the instructors and/or self-study from Ultilearn. Each successive qualification generally allows a cadet greater participation in ATC activities. Cadets who have achieved the Master air cadet classification have completed their academic training and could formerly attain a [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] Level 2 in Aviation Studies (equivalent to 2 [[GCSE]]s A*\u2013C) via [[CVQO]].\n\nInstructor Cadet is not a classification as such, but rather a qualification. Cadets need to be at least 16 years of age to take part in this one-day course, which allows them to teach other cadets. Although this is not compulsory, ATC Wings ordinarily feed this hand-in-hand with the Staff Cadet Course (see below). Upon successful completion of this course, the cadet will be awarded a yellow lanyard to distinguish them. This is worn over the left shoulder and fastened to a small black Royal Air Force button or the left shirt pocket button when not wearing a jumper.\n\n===Marking methodology===\n\nLeading Cadet, Senior Cadet and Master Cadet exams consist of assessment criteria each containing two questions. A cadet must achieve either 1 or 2 marks (50% or 100%) for each module in order to pass. All exams are now taken online on a system called Ultilearn.\n\n===First Class Cadet===\n\nFirst Class is also commonly referred to as 'Basic Training'. A variety of methods are used to test a cadet's understanding of the subject, including practical tests and exercises to test ability, and interviews/quizzes to test knowledge.\nAll junior cadets also have to pass a practical Drill Test to become first class. The drill test is a sequence of simple drill manoeuvres essential for forming squads and a good foundation to build on for more advanced drill.\n\n===Leading Cadet===\n\nFor a cadet to become a leading cadet, they must have already gained first-class status. They will then have to complete 3 examinations: Navigation on Land using a map and compass, Principles of Flight and Airmanship Knowledge.\n\n===Senior and Staff Cadet (old syllabus)===\n\n[[File:MOIC.jpg|thumb|150px|An \"Instructor Cadet\" yellow lanyard]]\nPrior to September 2010, for a cadet to become a senior cadet, they had already to have gained leading cadet status and taken 2 exams from a choice of 8 subjects, examined in the same way as for the Leading cadet syllabus. The 8 subjects were: Air Navigation, Pilot Navigation, Satellite Communications, Propulsion, Airframes, Advanced Radio and Radar, Aircraft Handling and Operational Flying.\n\nThe highest academic classification was Staff Cadet. For a cadet to become a staff cadet, they had to have already gained Senior Cadet status, be 15 years old, and to have sat and passed two more exams from the same subject list as for Senior classification, along with an interview with a wing staff officer and an assessment of teaching a lesson they would then be awarded their yellow lanyard.\n\n===Senior and Master (new syllabus)===\n\nIn September 2010, a new classification structure, syllabus and examination process came into force. The following subjects are available: Piston Engine Propulsion, Jet Engine Propulsion, Rocketry, Aircraft Handling and Flying Techniques, Air Power, Airframes, Avionics and Aircraft Electrical Systems, Military Aircraft Systems, Basic Air Navigation, Basic Principles of Pilot Navigation, Advanced Radio and Radar, and Data Communications. For each level, cadets must pass three of the subjects. Master Air Cadet has its own new badge for the brassard which shows an ATC Falcon surrounded by laurel leaves.\n\n===Specialist Instructor and Leadership Qualifications===\n\n[[File:QAIC.jpg|thumb|150px|A Qualified Aerospace Instructor Cadet wearing the blue QAI Lanyard]]\n[[File:Junior-leader-e1429811098300.jpg|thumb|150px|Qualified Junior Leaders wearing the maroon JL Lanyard]]\nWith the change of the classification structure in September 2010 the classification of staff cadet changed to become Instructor Cadet. An Instructor Cadet is denoted by a yellow lanyard worn over the left shoulder. Only Master Cadets will be permitted to wear the yellow lanyard. Whilst being a Master Cadet, there must also be a necessary Method of Instruction Course which then grants the ability to wear the lanyard.\n\nAlongside Instructor Cadet there is another lanyard that can be awarded to cadets who are interested in specialising in teaching aerospace subjects. These qualified cadets are known as Qualified Aerospace Instructors (QAIs) and wear a light blue lanyard over the left shoulder. The Qualified Aerospace Instructors Course (QAIC) has been running since September 2008. The course is held at RAF Linton-On-Ouse and as of 2011 also at MOD Boscombe Down. The course is held from early September to Easter of the following year, beginning with a selection weekend in early September, and 7 total weekends (as of QAIC 8, prior to this there were only 6 training weekends) from late September until early March.<ref>{{cite web|title=QAIC 8 Covering Letter|url=http://www.aircadetsnorth.org/userfiles/files/QAIC%208%20-%20Covering%20Letter%20and%20Selection%20Criteria.pdf|website=Air Cadets North|publisher=QAIC Support Admin Centre|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> The course culminates in a 'Graduation Week' which is organised to coincide with the Easter holidays to avoid clashing with school programmes. After completing training in various modules they carry out an assessed lesson, earning the blue QAIC lanyard and flight suit badge. Along the way the achievements of the students have been recognised by the Institute of Leadership and Management who offer an ILM Level 2 Certificate to graduating students and by the Royal Aeronautical Society who offer affiliated membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qaic.org/Pages/AboutTheCourse.php |title=About the course |accessdate=18 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327004819/http://www.qaic.org/Pages/AboutTheCourse.php |archivedate=27 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\nFor those interested in fieldcraft teaching and leadership there is the Junior Leaders Course. Successful completion of the course awards the participant a maroon lanyard to be worn over the left shoulder and a junior leaders badge to sew on to the left sleeve of their No.3 Service Dress (field uniform) to show they are a qualified Junior Leader. The course runs from September to Easter, involving nine weekend training camps and an assessment week.  The course is aimed at more senior cadets, and as such an age restriction of 17 years applies. Not only this, but the course also requires the participant to hold the rank of Cadet Sergeant or higher. The course is also open to Sea Cadets and Army Cadets {{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and culminates in the award of a Level 3 Certificate<ref>{{cite book|title=Junior Leaders Course 18 Calling Letter|date=19 May 2016|publisher=Officer Commanding Junior Leaders|page=13. a.

All uniformed staff must attend training courses run by the RAF at the ATC Adult Training Facility, [[RAF College Cranwell]] (ATF), usually within a year of appointment, with further courses as they progress up the rank structure. Commissioned officers formerly wore a gilt 'VRT' pin upon their rank braid to denote being commissioned officers of the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)|Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch)]], while Warrant Officers and NCOs wore a gilt 'ATC' pin. Both officers and NCOs wear embroidered rank slides with the lettering 'RAF AIR CADETS', and on No. 1 Service Dress officers and NCOs wear gilt 'RAFAC' pins to reflect the new RAFAC/Cadet Forces Commission.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n|+Adult Staff Ranks Pre-December 2017\n|-\n!

The RAFVR(T) is non-combatant and there is no training for any form of active duty, or integration into the duties of other full-time or reserve duties. The RAFVR(T) officer is concerned only with the Air Cadets. Unless an officer has previous service, he or she is commissioned as a substantive Pilot Officer, termed Officer Cadet until the Officers Initial Course (OIC) at RAF Cranwell is completed.<ref group=\"note\">Unlike RAF Officer Cadets at the RAF College or RAFVR Officer Cadets of the University Air Squadron, RAFVR(T) Officer Cadets are, in fact, commissioned. In coming years this is likely to change and the non-commissioned Officer Cadet RAFVR(T) rank will be introduced, bringing the RAFVR(T) in line with the RAF and RAFVR.</ref> Promotion to Flying Officer normally occurs after two years. Former regular commissioned officers usually start at Flying Officer, subject to certain conditions being met. Upon becoming [[Officer Commanding]] of a squadron, completing an Officers' Senior Course (OSC) and subject to certain conditions being met, the rank of Flight Lieutenant is bestowed.\n\nAs of December 2017, VRT Officers had their commissions transferred to the new Cadet Forces Commission (CFC) and ranks framework.<ref name=\"AirCadet W2017\"/><ref name=\"RAFAC Ranks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aircadetsnorth.org/information-ranks.html|title=Rank Structure|website=Air Cadets North|access-date=17 November 2017}}</ref><ref>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/758400/00149.pdf Royal Warrant for Cadet Force commission]</ref>\n\nSquadrons are usually commanded by CFC Flight Lieutenants, who are also found as Wing and Regional staff officers along with Squadron Leaders and Wing Commanders. Particularly large squadrons are sometimes commanded by Squadron Leaders (usually when the squadron has 100 or more cadets).\n\nCommonly, the most senior rank in the Cadet Forces Commission is that of Wing Commander, but most recently the ambassador to the Air Cadets will be appointed to the honorary rank of Group Captain in the RAFAC, under a CFC.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | '''Adult Officer Ranks Post-December 2017'''<ref name=\"AC101 Ranks\">{{cite web\n |url=https://aircadet101.weebly.com/cfc-explained.html\n |title=CFC Explained\n |website=Air Cadet 101\n |access-date=23 November 2017}}</ref>\n|-  align=\"center\"\n!

I can't wait to meet the cadets, and the adult volunteer staff who give so much of their time to support them. The cadets themselves are a shining example of the best of British youngsters, standing with them on a parade square will be a great privilege.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Carol Vorderman joins the cadets|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/raf-aircadets/assets/File/imported/BAFB29E9_5056_A318_A89557A74471336B.pdf|work=Air Cadet Magazine|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> Vorderman assumed the rank of Honorary Group Captain RAFVR(T) (changed to [[Air Training Corps#Officers|Group Captain RAFAC]] from December 2017) for the duration of her appointment. She is the first female to be appointed Ambassador.\n\n===NCOs and WOs===\nAdults may also be appointed as senior NCOs, these being ranks within the ATC. Adult NCOs/WOs are uniformed in the same way as their RAF counterparts with two exceptions: formerly a small gilt ''ATC'' badge was worn on the rank badge, now the embroidered text of \"RAF AIR CADETS\" appears below the rank insignia, and Warrant Officers wear a different rank badge (unless they have previous regular or active reserves warranted service).\n\nThe ranks of Adult NCOs/WOs were Sergeant (ATC), Flight Sergeant (ATC) and Warrant Officer (ATC).<ref group=\"note\">Prior to the 'LaSER (London and South East Region) Review' of 2003, the adult ranks of Sergeant and Flight Sergeant did not exist, meaning that the non-commissioned rank structure of a squadron was more straightforward i.e. Cadet, Cadet Corporal, Cadet Sergeant, Cadet Flight Sergeant, Cadet Warrant Officer, Adult Warrant Officer. This has been disturbed by inserting the ranks of Sgt (ATC) and FS (ATC) and WO (ATC). The rank of Sgt (ATC) is senior to all cadet ranks, including CWO. However, this does allow a wider scope for developing staff who do not wish to become commissioned officers, and brings the ATC's adult rank structure more in line with those of the other cadet forces, whose adult ranks begin at Sergeant or service equivalent.</ref> As of December 2017, ATC SNCOs and WOs had their ranks transferred to the new RAFAC commissions and ranks framework. A gilt RAFAC badge is worn on the lapels when in No.1 dress uniform to denote membership within the cadet forces.<ref name=\"AirCadet W2017\"/><ref name=\"RAFAC Ranks\" />\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | '''[[Non-commissioned officer|Noncommissioned Officers (NCOs)]]'''\n|-  align=\"center\"\n!

Unlike adult NCOs and Officers, CIs do not wear a uniform, although until recently greens were acceptable for fieldcraft and shooting activities, flying suits are still to be worn by those serving on AEF's or VGS', for safety reasons, which override other dress regulations. CI's do not officially form part of the chain of command in the squadron, but they may hold what might be called Command posts. It is expected that any cadet, irrespective of rank, should and will listen to CI's and obey relevant instructions given. A Civilian Instructor's recognised dress consists of a light blue polo shirt and dark blue sweatshirt bearing the name of the corps and \"[[Royal Air Force]]\", in an effort to standardise the means by which CIs are identified. CI's are addressed as Sir or Ma'am by cadets when speaking to them or Mr, Mrs, Miss then surname by staff speaking to them or by anyone who is referring to them when they are not present, neither \"CI\" and surname nor \"staff'\" are correct forms of address. Staff is the term of address for service personnel junior to NCO rank.\n\nMany CIs are ex RAF or ex military or have skills that complement the aims of the ATC.\n\nSome CIs may hold positions such as the Squadron Adjutant or Training Officer within the squadron.\n\nSimilarly, ATC chaplains are usually civilian members of the local clergy (although forces chaplains may join as Service Instructors). The role of an ATC chaplain is to 'provide appropriate pastoral care for all personnel within the Air Cadet Organisation irrespective of religious belief or status<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/want-to-join/join-as-an-adult-volunteer/join-as-a-chaplain/|title=Join as a Chaplain|work=RAF Air Cadets|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-GB}}</ref>'. A chaplain's role in the local squadron is to offer guidance and leadership to cadets and members of staff on moral and spiritual matters. The commitment expected of a chaplain is a monthly visit to lead what is termed 'the Padre's hour' and to conduct the formal Enrolment Service when new cadets join.
