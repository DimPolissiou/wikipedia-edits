Another feature of the N700 is that it accelerates quicker than the older [[700 Series Shinkansen|700 series]] Shinkansen trains, with a maximum acceleration rate of 2.6&nbsp;km/h/s (0.72&nbsp;m/s/s). This enables it to reach {{Convert|270|km/h|abbr=on}} in only three minutes. Further advancements led to the development of the N700A, an incremental evolution of the N700. N700A trains can reach 285&nbsp;km/h on 3,000 m curves, allowing the maximum operating speed on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to be raised to 285&nbsp;km/h. All N700 series sets have been retrofitted with most of the improvements added to the N700A series, and are now classified as \"N700<small>A</small>\".\n\nBecause of these improvements, trains can travel between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] on a ''[[Nozomi (train)|Nozomi]]'' run in as little as 2 hours and 22 minutes on the fastest service (8 minutes faster than before).\n\nCurrently, a second revision to the N700 series, the N700S, is undergoing testing and evaluation, with plans to begin replacing all other models from 2020.\n\n==Operations==\nN700 series trains gradually replaced 300, 500 and 700 series sets on ''Nozomi'' services, and by the end of February 2009, the N700 series were responsible for 74 ''Nozomi'' services per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jr-central.co.jp/news/release/_pdf/000003300.pdf |title=Winter 2008/2009 Train Schedule Update (JR Central) |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=17 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220150023/http://jr-central.co.jp/news/release/_pdf/000003300.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}</ref> All ''Nozomi'' through runs (over the full route between Tokyo and Hakata) were scheduled to use the N700 series exclusively by 2009.

Another feature of the N700 is that it accelerates quicker than the older [[700 Series Shinkansen|700 series]] Shinkansen trains, with a maximum acceleration rate of 2.6&nbsp;km/h/s (0.72&nbsp;m/s/s). This enables it to reach {{Convert|270|km/h|abbr=on}} in only three minutes. Further advancements led to the development of the N700A, an incremental evolution of the N700. N700A trains can reach 285&nbsp;km/h on 3,000 m curves, allowing the maximum operating speed on the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to be raised to 285&nbsp;km/h. All N700 series sets have been retrofitted with most of the improvements added to the N700A series, and are now classified as \"N700<small>A</small>\".\n\nBecause of these improvements, trains can travel between [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] on a ''[[Nozomi (train)|Nozomi]]'' run in as little as 2 hours and 22 minutes on the fastest service (8 minutes faster than before).\n\nCurrently, a second revision to the N700 series, the N700S, is undergoing testing and evaluation, with plans to begin replacing all other models from 2020.\n\n==Operations==\nN700 series trains gradually replaced 300, 500 and 700 series sets on ''Nozomi'' services, and by the end of February 2009, the N700 series were responsible for 74 ''Nozomi'' services per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jr-central.co.jp/news/release/_pdf/000003300.pdf |title=Winter 2008/2009 Train Schedule Update (JR Central) |accessdate=2008-10-20 |date=17 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220150023/http://jr-central.co.jp/news/release/_pdf/000003300.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2008 }}</ref> All ''Nozomi'' through runs (over the full route between Tokyo and Hakata) were scheduled to use the N700 series exclusively by 2009.

In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by [[John Hunyadi]] after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce [[Peace of Szeged]]. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople.\n\nAt the age of 21, he [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] [[Constantinople]] (modern-day [[Istanbul]]) and brought an end to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. After the conquest Mehmed claimed the title \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]\" of the [[Roman Empire]] (''Qayser-i R\u00fbm''), based on the fact that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern [[Roman Empire]] since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I. The claim was only recognized by the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as \"continuing\" the Empire rather than \"replacing\" it. This assertion was eventually abandoned by his successors. \n\nMehmed continued his conquests in [[Anatolia]] with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as [[Bosnia]]. At home he made many political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed the city into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a hero in modern-day [[Turkey]] and parts of the wider [[Muslim world]]. Among other things, Istanbul's [[Fatih]] district, [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] and [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]] are named after him.\n\n== Early reign ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Hunername accession Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Accession of Mehmed II in [[Edirne]], 1451]]\nMehmed II was born on 30 March 1432, in [[Edirne]], then the capital city of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman state]]. His father was Sultan [[Murad II]] (1404\u20131451) and his mother [[H\u00fcma Hatun|H\u00fcma Valide Hatun]], born in the town of [[Devrekani]], [[Kastamonu]].\n\nWhen Mehmed II was eleven years old he was sent to [[Amasya]] to govern and thus gain experience, per the custom of Ottoman rulers before his time. Sultan Murad II also sent a number of teachers for him to study under. This Islamic education had a great impact in molding Mehmed's mindset and reinforcing his Muslim beliefs. He was influenced in his practice of Islamic [[Wiktionary:epistemology#Noun|epistemology]] by practitioners of science, particularly by his mentor, Molla G\u00fcrani, and he followed their approach. The influence of [[Akshamsaddin]] in Mehmed's life became predominant from a young age, especially in the imperative of fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine empire by conquering Constantinople.\n\nAfter Murad II made peace with the [[Karamanids]] in [[Anatolia]] in August 1444, he abdicated the throne to his 12-year-old son Mehmed II.\n\nIn Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by [[John Hunyadi]] after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce [[Peace of Szeged]]. Cardinal [[Julian Cesarini]], the representative of the Pope, had convinced the king of Hungary that breaking the truce with Muslims was not a betrayal. At this time Mehmed II asked his father Murad II to reclaim the throne, but Murad II refused. Angry at his father, who had long since retired to a contemplative life in southwestern Anatolia, Mehmed II wrote, \"If you are the sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the sultan I hereby order you to come and lead my armies.\" It was only after receiving this letter that Murad II led the Ottoman army and won the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444.\n\nMurad II's return to the throne was forced by [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha the Younger|\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pa\u015fa]], the [[grand vizier]] at the time, who was not fond of Mehmed II's rule, because Mehmed II's influential [[lala (title)|lala]] (royal teacher), Akshamsaddin, had a rivalry with \u00c7andarl\u0131.\n\n== Conquest of Constantinople ==\n{{Main|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:OttomanEmpire1451.png|thumb|The Ottoman Empire at the beginning of Mehmed II's second reign.]]\n[[File:Turkey-1290.jpg|thumb|[[Roumeli Hissar Castle]], built by Sultan Mehmed II between 1451 and 1452, before the [[Fall of Constantinople]]<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8836/|title= Bosphorus (i.e. Bosporus), View from Kuleli, Constantinople, Turkey|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1890\u20131900 |accessdate = 2013-12-12 }}</ref>]]\n\nWhen Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he devoted himself to strengthening the Ottoman navy and made preparations for an attack on Constantinople. In the narrow [[Bosphorus|Bosphorus Straits]], the fortress [[Anadoluhisar\u0131]] had been built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]] on the Asian side; Mehmed erected an even stronger fortress called [[Rumelihisar\u0131]] on the European side, and thus gained complete control of the strait. Having completed his fortresses, Mehmed proceeded to levy a toll on ships passing within reach of their cannon. A [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] vessel ignoring signals to stop was sunk with a single shot and all the surviving sailors beheaded,<ref name=\"Silburn1912\">Silburn, P. A. B. (1912).</ref> except for the captain, who was impaled and mounted as a human scarecrow as a warning to further sailors on the strait.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03l2shc|title=Byzantium: A Tale of Three Cities |website=BBC Four|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref>\n\n[[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]], the companion and standard bearer of Muhammad, had died during the first [[Siege of Constantinople (674\u2013678)]]. As Mehmed II's army approached Constantinople, Mehmed's sheikh [[Akshamsaddin]]{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=23}} discovered the tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. After the conquest, Mehmed built [[Ey\u00fcp Sultan Mosque]] at the site to emphasize the importance of the conquest to the Islamic world and highlight his role as [[Ghazi warriors|ghazi]].{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=23}}\n\nIn 1453 Mehmed commenced the siege of Constantinople with an army between 80,000 and 200,000 troops, an artillery train of over seventy large field pieces,{{sfn|Arnold|2001|p=111}} and a navy of 320 vessels, the bulk of them transports and storeships. The city was surrounded by sea and land; the fleet at the entrance of the [[Bosphorus]] stretched from shore to shore in the form of a crescent, to intercept or repel any assistance for Constantinople from the sea.<ref name=\"Silburn1912\"/> In early April, the [[Fall of Constantinople|Siege of Constantinople]] began. At first, the city's walls held off the Turks, even though Mehmed's army used the new bombard designed by [[Orban]], a giant cannon similar to the [[Dardanelles Gun]]. The harbor of the [[Golden Horn]] was blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] and defended by twenty-eight [[warship]]s.\n\nOn 22 April, Mehmed transported his lighter warships overland, around the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Genoese colonies|colony]] of [[Galata]], and into the Golden Horn's northern shore; eighty galleys were transported from the Bosphorus after paving a route, little over one mile, with wood. Thus the Byzantines stretched their troops over a longer portion of the walls. About a month later, Constantinople fell, on 29 May, following a fifty-seven-day siege.<ref name=\"Silburn1912\"/> After this conquest, Mehmed moved the Ottoman capital from Adrianople to Constantinople.\n\nWhen Sultan Mehmed II stepped into the ruins of the [[Boukoleon Palace|Boukoleon]], known to the Ottomans and Persians as the Palace of the Caesars, probably built over a thousand years before by [[Theodosius II]], he uttered the famous lines of [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]]:<ref>''The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare'', Jim Bradbury, p. 68</ref>{{sfn|Stavrides|2001|p=22}}<ref>''East and West in the Crusader States'': Krijna Nelly Ciggaar, Adelbert Davids, Herman G.

The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became admiral of the Ottoman fleet and [[sanjak-bey]] of the [[Sanjak of Gelibolu|Gallipoli]].

The last two vestiges of Byzantine rule were thus absorbed by the Ottoman Empire. The conquest of Constantinople bestowed immense glory and prestige on the country.

The Ottoman ruler had a connection with the [[Serbian Despotate]] \u2013 one of [[Murad II]]'s wives was [[Mara Brankovi\u0107]] \u2013 and he used that fact to claim some Serbian islands. That [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] had recently made an alliance with the Hungarians, and had paid the tribute irregularly, may have been important considerations. When Serbia refused these demands, the Ottoman army set out from [[Edirne]] towards Serbia in 1454. [[Smederevo]] was besieged, as was [[Novo Brdo]], the most important Serbian metal mining and smelting center. Ottomans and Hungarians fought during the years till 1456.\n\nThe Ottoman army advanced as far as [[Belgrade]], where it attempted but failed to conquer the city from [[John Hunyadi]] at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], on 14 July 1456. A period of relative peace ensued in the region until the [[Siege of Belgrade 1521|Fall of Belgrade]] in 1521, during the reign of Mehmed's great-grandson, known as Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The sultan retreated to Edirne, and [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] regained possession of some parts of Serbia. Before the end of the year, however, the 79-year-old Brankovi\u0107 died. Serbian independence survived him for only two years, when the Ottoman Empire formally annexed his lands following dissension among his widow and three remaining sons. Lazar, the youngest, poisoned his mother and exiled his brothers, but he died soon afterwards. In the continuing turmoil the oldest brother [[Stefan Brankovi\u0107]] gained the throne but was ousted in March 1459. After that the Serbian throne was offered to [[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]], the future king of Bosnia, which infuriated Sultan Mehmed. He sent his army, which captured [[Smederevo]] in June 1459, ending the existence of the [[Serbian Despotate]].<ref name=Miller1>{{cite book |title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro |last=Miller |first=William |authorlink= |year=1896 |publisher=G.P.

Demetrios ended up a prisoner of the Ottomans and his younger brother Thomas fled. By the end of the summer, the Ottomans had achieved the submission of virtually all cities possessed by the Greeks.\n\nA few holdouts remained for a time. The island of [[Monemvasia]] refused to surrender, and it was ruled for a brief time by a Catalan corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to submit to the Pope's protection before the end of 1460.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|pp=173\u2013175}} The [[Mani Peninsula]], on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of local clans, and the area then came under the rule of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. The very last holdout was [[Salmeniko]], in the Morea's northwest. [[Graitzas Palaiologos]] was the military commander there, stationed at [[Salmeniko Castle]] (also known as Castle Orgia). While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n== Conquest of Trebizond (1460\u20131461) ==\n\nEmperors of Trebizond formed alliances through royal marriages with various Muslim rulers. Emperor [[John IV of Trebizond]] married his daughter to the son of his brother-in-law, [[Uzun Hasan]], khan of the [[Ak Koyunlu]], in return for his promise to defend Trebizond. He also secured promises of support from the Turkish [[bey]]s of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] and [[Karamanid|Karamania]], and from the king and princes of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The Ottomans were motivated to capture Trebizond or to get an annual tribute. In the time of Murad II they first attempted to take the capital by sea in 1442, but high surf made the landings difficult and the attempt was repulsed. While Mehmed II was away laying siege to [[Belgrade]] in 1456, the Ottoman governor of [[Amasya]] attacked Trebizond, and although he was defeated, he took many prisoners and extracted a heavy tribute.\n\nAfter John's death in 1459, his brother [[David of Trebizond|David]] came to power and intrigued with various European powers for help against the Ottomans, speaking of wild schemes that included the conquest of [[Jerusalem]]. Mehmed II eventually heard of these intrigues and was further provoked to action by David's demand that Mehmed remit the tribute imposed on his brother.\n\nMehmed the Conqueror's response came in the summer of 1461. He led a sizable army from [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]] by land and the Ottoman navy by sea, first to [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], joining forces with Ismail's brother Ahmed (the Red). He captured Sinope and ended the official reign of the Jandarid dynasty, although he appointed Ahmed as the governor of Kastamonu and Sinope, only to revoke the appointment the same year. Various other members of the Jandarid dynasty were offered important functions throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire. During the march to Trebizond, [[Uzun Hasan]] sent his mother Sara Khatun as an ambassador; while they were climbing the steep heights of [[Zigana Pass|Zigana]] on foot, she asked Sultan Mehmed why he was undergoing such hardship for the sake of Trebizond. Mehmed replied:\n\n{{quote|Mother, in my hand is the sword of Islam, without this hardship I should not deserve the name of ''[[Ghazi warriors|ghazi]]'', and today and tomorrow I should have to cover my face in shame before [[Allah]].{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=193}}}}\n\nHaving isolated Trebizond, Mehmed quickly swept down upon it before the inhabitants knew he was coming, and he placed it [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|under siege]]. The city held out for a month before the emperor David surrendered on 15 August 1461.\n\n== Submission of Wallachia (1459\u20131462) ==\n[[File:Vlad Tepes 002.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad (Dracula) the Impaler]], Prince of [[Wallachia]], 1460]]\n\nThe Ottomans since the early 15th century tried to bring Wallachia ({{lang-ota|\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u0627}}) under their control by putting their own candidate on the throne, but each attempt ended in failure. The Ottomans regarded Wallachia as a buffer zone between them and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and for a yearly tribute did not meddle in their internal affairs. The two primary Balkan powers, Hungary and the Ottomans, maintained an enduring struggle to make Wallachia their own vassal. To prevent Wallachia from falling into the Hungarian fold, the Ottomans freed young [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III]] (Dracula), who had spent four years as a prisoner of Murad, together with his brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], so that Vlad could claim the throne of Wallachia. His rule was short-lived, however, as Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and restored his ally [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav II]], of the [[House of D\u0103ne\u0219ti|D\u0103ne\u0219ti]] clan, to the throne.\n\nVlad III Dracula fled to Moldavia, where he lived under the protection of his uncle, [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]]. In October 1451, Bogdan was assassinated and Vlad fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire, as well as his hatred towards the Turks and new Sultan Mehmed II, Hunyadi reconciled with his former enemy and tried to make Vlad III his own adviser, but Vlad refused.\n\nIn 1456, three years after the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, they threatened Hungary by besieging [[Belgrade]]. Hunyadi began a concerted counter-attack in [[Serbia]]: while he himself moved into Serbia and relieved the siege (before dying of the plague), Vlad III Dracula led his own contingent into Wallachia, reconquered his native land, and killed the impostor Vladislav II.\n\n[[File:AtaculdeNoapte.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Night Attack of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte]], which resulted in the victory of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad (Dracula) the Impaler]].]]\n\nIn 1459, Mehmed II sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay a delayed [[tribute]]{{sfn|Babinger|1992}} of 10,000 ducats and 500 recruits into the Ottoman forces. Vlad III Dracula refused and had the Ottoman envoys killed by nailing their [[turban]]s to their heads, on the pretext that they had refused to raise their \"hats\" to him, as they only removed their headgear before Allah.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sultan sent the Bey of Nicopolis, [[Hamza Bey|Hamza Pasha]], to make peace and, if necessary, eliminate Vlad III.<ref name=explore>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringromania.com/vlad-the-impaler-3.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608112020/http://www.exploringromania.com/vlad-the-impaler-3.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-06-08 |title=Vlad the Impaler second rule [3&#93; |publisher=Exploringromania.com |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Vlad III set an ambush; the Ottomans were surrounded and almost all of them caught and impaled, with Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, as befit his rank.<ref name=explore/>{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the winter of 1462, Vlad III crossed the Danube and scorched the entire Bulgarian land in the area between [[Serbia]] and the [[Black Sea]]. Allegedly disguising himself as a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Sipahi]] and utilizing his command of the Turkish language and customs, Vlad III infiltrated Ottoman camps, ambushed, massacred or captured several Ottoman forces. In a letter to Corvinus dated 2 February, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I have killed peasants men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea, up to [[Rahova]], which is located near Chilia, from the lower Danube up to such places as Samovit and Ghighen.

However, Vlad's policy of staunch resistance against the Ottomans was not a popular one, and he was betrayed by the boyars's (local aristocracy) appeasing faction, most of them also pro-D\u0103ne\u015fti (a rival princely branch). His best friend and ally [[Stephen III of Moldavia]], who had promised to help him, seized the chance and instead attacked him trying to take back the fortress of Chilia. Vlad III had to retreat to the mountains. After this, the Ottomans captured the Wallachian capital [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] and Mehmed II withdrew, having left Radu as ruler of Wallachia. [[Turahano\u011flu \u00d6mer Bey]], who served with distinction and wiped out a force 6,000 Wallachians and deposited 2,000 of their heads at the feet of Mehmed II, was also reinstated, as a reward, in his old gubernatorial post in Thessaly.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=207}} Vlad eventually escaped to Hungary, where he was imprisoned on a false accusation of treason against his overlord, [[Matthias Corvinus]].\n\n== Conquest of Bosnia (1463) ==\n[[File:Mehmed II ferman.jpg|thumb|Mehmed II's [[ahidn\u00e2me]] to the Catholic monks of the recently conquered Bosnia issued in 1463, granting them full religious freedom and protection.]]\n\nThe despot of Serbia, [[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]], died in 1458, and a civil war broke out among his heirs that resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in 1459. [[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]], son of the king of Bosnia, tried to bring Serbia under his control, but Ottoman expeditions forced him to give up his plan and Stephen fled to Bosnia, seeking refuge at the court of his father.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=575\u2013581}} After some battles Bosnia became tributary kingdom to the Ottomans.\n\nOn 10 July 1461, [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia|Stephen Thomas]] died, and Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 succeeded him as King of Bosnia. In 1461, Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 made an alliance with the Hungarians and asked [[Pope Pius II]] for help in the face of an impending Ottoman invasion. In 1463, after a dispute over the tribute paid annually by the [[Bosnian Kingdom]] to the Ottomans, he sent for help from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. However, none ever reached Bosnia. In 1463, Sultan Mehmed II led an army into the country. The royal city of [[Bobovac]] soon fell, leaving Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 to retreat to [[Jajce]] and later to [[Klju\u010d, Una-Sana Canton|Klju\u010d]]. Mehmed invaded Bosnia and conquered it very quickly, executing Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 and his uncle [[Radivoj of Bosnia|Radivoj]]. Bosnia officially fell in 1463 and became the westernmost province of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n==Ottoman-Venetian War (1463\u20131479)==\n{{Main|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u201379)}}\nAccording to the Byzantine historian [[Michael Critobulus]], hostilities broke out after an Albanian slave of the Ottoman commander of Athens fled to the Venetian fortress of Coron ([[Koroni]]) with 100,000 silver aspers from his master's treasure. The fugitive then converted to Christianity, so Ottoman demands for his rendition were refused by the Venetian authorities.<ref name=\"Setton241\">{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=241}}</ref> Using this as a pretext in November 1462, the Ottoman commander in central Greece, [[Turahano\u011flu \u00d6mer Bey]], attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto ([[Nafpaktos]]). On 3 April 1463, however, the governor of the Morea, Isa Beg, took the Venetian-held town of [[Argos]] by treason.<ref name=\"Setton241\"/>\n\nThe new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the Captain General of the Sea [[Alvise Loredan]], landed in the Morea, while [[Matthias Corvinus]] invaded Bosnia.<ref name=\"Finkel63\">{{harvnb|Finkel|2007|p=63}}</ref> At the same time, [[Pius II]] began assembling an army at [[Ancona]], hoping to lead it in person.<ref name=\"Shaw65\">{{harvnb|Shaw|1976|p=65}}</ref> Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as [[Karamanids]], [[Uzun Hassan]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]].<ref name=\"Shaw65\"/>\n\nIn early August, the Venetians retook [[Argos]] and refortified the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], restoring the [[Hexamilion wall]] and equipping it with many cannons.<ref name=\"Setton248\">{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=248}}</ref> They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the [[Acrocorinth]], which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese.

To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the [[Golden Horn]] (named after the \"kadirga\" type of [[galley]]), and of two forts to guard the Straits, [[Kilitbahir Castle|Kilidulbahr]] and [[\u00c7anakkale|Sultaniye]].<ref name=\"Crusades326\">Setton, Hazard & Norman (1969), p. 326</ref> The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans; they razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea.

Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia.<ref name=\"Crusades326\"/> However, the Sultan's attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus' approaching army.

Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while \u00d6mer Bey's army roamed the countryside.\n\nIn the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the Venetians tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital [[Mytilene]] for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced them to withdraw.<ref name=\"Setton251\">{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=251}}</ref> Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed.

[[Karamanids]] initially centred around the modern provinces of [[Karaman Province|Karaman]] and [[Konya Province|Konya]], the most important power in Anatolia. But towards the end of the 14th century, Ottomans began to dominate on most of Anatolia, reducing the Karaman influence and prestige.\n\n[[\u0130brahim II of Karaman]] was the ruler of Karaman, and during his last years, his sons began struggling for the throne. His heir apparent was [[\u0130shak of Karaman]], the governor of [[Silifke]]. But [[Pir Ahmet of Karaman|Pir Ahmet]], a younger son, declared himself as the bey of Karaman in [[Konya]]. \u0130brahim escaped to a small city in western territories where he died in 1464. The competing claims to the throne resulted in an interregnum in the ''beylik''. Nevertheless, with the help of [[Uzun Hasan]], the sultan of the [[Akkoyunlu]] (White Sheep) [[Oghuz Turks|Turkmens]], \u0130shak was able to ascend to the throne. His reign was short, however, as Pir Ahmet appealed to Sultan Mehmet II for help, offering Mehmet some territory that \u0130shak refused to cede. With Ottoman help, Pir Ahmet defeated \u0130shak in the battle of [[Da\u011fpazar\u0131, Mut|Da\u011fpazar\u0131]]. \u0130shak had to be content with Silifke up to an unknown date.<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi'' Cilt I, Akdtykttk Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 pp. 256\u2013257</ref> Pir Ahmet kept his promise and ceded a part of the ''beylik'' to the Ottomans, but he was uneasy about the loss. So during the Ottoman campaign in the West, he recaptured his former territory. Mehmet returned, however, and captured both Karaman (Larende) and Konya in 1466. Pir Ahmet barely escaped to the East. A few years later, Ottoman [[vizier]] (later [[grand vizier]]) [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]] captured the coastal region of the ''beylik''.<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi'' Cilt I, Akdtyttk Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 pp. 256\u2013258 {{Citation not found|reason=Unable to locate source origin}}</ref>{{Citation not found|date=April 2017}}\n\nPir Ahmet as well as his brother [[Kas\u0131m of Karaman|Kas\u0131m]] escaped to Uzun Hasan's territory. This gave Uzun Hasan a chance to interfere. In 1472, the Akkoyunlu army invaded and raided most of Anatolia (this was the reason behind the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]] in 1473). But then Mehmed led a successful campaign against Uzun Hasan in 1473 that resulted in the decisive victory of the Ottoman Empire in the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]]. Before that, Pir Ahmet with Akkoyunlu help had captured Karaman. However Pir Ahmet couldn't enjoy another term. Because immediately after the capture of Karaman, the Akkoyunlu army was defeated by the Ottomans near [[Bey\u015fehir]] and Pir Ahmet had to escape once more. Although he tried to continue his struggle, he learned that his family members had been transferred to [[\u0130stanbul]] by Gedik Ahmet Pasha, so he finally gave up. Demoralized, he escaped to Akkoyunlu territory where he was given a ''[[t\u0131mar]]'' (fief) in [[Bayburt]]. He died in 1474.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enfal.de/starih40.htm |title=Karamanogullari Beyligi |publisher=Enfal.de |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is a non-English, unreliable website; there must be more scholarly sources available to support this.|date=April 2017}}\n\nUniting the Anatolian ''beylik''s was first accomplished by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], more than fifty years before Mehmed II but after the destructive [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, the newly formed unification was gone. Mehmed II recovered Ottoman power over the other Turkish states, and these conquests allowed him to push further into Europe.\n\nAnother important political entity that shaped the Eastern policy of Mehmed II were the [[Ak Koyunlu|White Sheep Turcomans]]. Under the leadership of [[Uzun Hasan]], this kingdom gained power in the East; but because of their strong relations with the Christian powers like the Empire of Trebizond and the [[Republic of Venice]], and the alliance between the Turcomans and the Karamanid tribe, Mehmed saw them as a threat to his own power.\n\n== War with Moldavia (1475\u20131476) ==\n[[File:Paolo Veronese 022.jpg|thumb|Mehmed the Second, portrait by [[Paolo Veronese]]]]\n\nIn 1456, [[Peter III Aaron]] agreed to pay the Ottomans an annual tribute of 2,000 gold ducats to ensure his southern borders, thus becoming the first Moldavian ruler to accept the Turkish demands.<ref>The A to Z of Moldova, Andrei Brezianu, Vlad Sp\u00e2nu, p. 273, 2010</ref> His successor [[Stephen the Great]] rejected Ottoman suzerainty and a series of fierce wars ensued.<ref>The A to Z of Moldova, Andrei Brezianu, Vlad Sp\u00e2nu, p. 242, 2010</ref> Stephen tried to bring Wallachia under his sphere of influence and so supported his own choice for the Wallachian throne.

An Ottoman army under Hadim Pasha (governor of Rumelia) was sent in 1475 to punish Stephen for his meddling in Wallachia; however, the Ottomans suffered a great defeat at the [[Battle of Vaslui]]. Stephen inflicted a decisive defeat on the Ottomans, described as \"the greatest ever secured by the Cross against Islam,\" with casualties, according to Venetian and Polish records, reaching beyond 40,000 on the Ottoman side. Mara Brankovic (Mara Hatun), the former younger wife of Murad II, told a Venetian envoy that the invasion had been worst ever defeat for the Ottomans. Stephen was later awarded the title \"Athleta Christi\" (Champion of Christ) by Pope Sixtus IV, who referred to him as \"verus christianae fidei athleta\" (\"the true defender of the Christian faith\").\nMehmed II assembled a large army and entered Moldavia in June 1476.

Skanderbeg had united the [[Albanian Principalities]] in a fight against the Empire in the [[League of Lezh\u00eb]] in 1444. Mehmed II couldn't subjugate [[Albania]] while Skanderbeg was alive, even though he twice (1466 and 1467) led the Ottoman armies himself against [[Kruj\u00eb]]. After Skanderbeg died in 1468, the Albanians couldn't find a leader to replace him, and Mehmed II eventually conquered Kruj\u00eb and Albania in 1478.\n\nIn spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians and their leader, Skenderbeg, who had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy.<ref name=\"Finkel63\"/> For the Albanians, the outbreak of the Ottoman\u2013Venetian War offered a golden opportunity to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, the Albanians provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] and [[Shkod\u00ebr|Scutari]]. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of [[Elbasan]], allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south.<ref name=\"Finkel64\">{{harvnb|Finkel|2007|p=64}}</ref> However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid.

After the conquest of Constantinople, Genoese communications were disrupted, and when the Crimean Tatars asked for help from the Ottomans, they responded with an invasion of the Genoese towns, led by [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]] in 1475, bringing [[Feodosiya|Kaffa]] and the other trading towns under their control.<ref name=\"Subtelny\">{{Cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|location=|page=[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/78 78]|author=Subtelny, Orest|authorlink=Orest Subtelny|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/78}}</ref> After the capture of the Genoese towns, the Ottoman Sultan held [[Me\u00f1li I Giray]] captive,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Soldier_Khan.php |title=Soldier Khan |publisher=Avalanchepress.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> later releasing him in return for accepting Ottoman suzerainty over the Crimean Khans and allowing them to rule as [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary princes of the Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=\"Subtelny\"/><ref name=\"blacksea-crimea/hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html |title=History |accessdate=28 March 2007 |work=blacksea-crimea.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404102214/http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html |archive-date=4 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Unreliable website; there must be more scholarly sources available to support this.|date=April 2017}} However, the Crimean khans still had a large amount of autonomy from the Ottoman Empire, while the Ottomans directly controlled the southern coast.\n\n== Expedition to Italy (1480) ==\n{{main|Ottoman invasion of Otranto}}[[File:Mehmed II (1432-1481).jpg|thumb|A [[bronze medal]] of Mehmed II the Conqueror by [[Bertoldo di Giovanni]], 1480<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O142648/mehmed-ii-medal-bellini-gentile/|title=Mehmed II {{!}} Bellini, Gentile {{!}} V&A Search the Collections|website=collections.vam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-04-09}}</ref>|alt=A bronze medal of Mehmed II the Conqueror]]\n\nAn Ottoman army under [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha]] invaded [[Italy]] in 1480, capturing [[Otranto]]. Because of lack of food, Gedik Ahmed Pasha returned with most of his troops to [[Albania]], leaving a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 cavalry behind to defend Otranto in Italy. It was assumed he would return after the winter. Since it was only 28 years after the fall of Constantinople, there was some fear that [[Rome]] would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and citizens of Rome to evacuate the city. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] repeated his 1481 call for a [[crusade]]. Several Italian city-states, Hungary, and France responded positively to the appeal. The [[Republic of Venice]] did not, however, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.\n\nIn 1481 king [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] raised an army to be led by his son [[Alphonso II of Naples]]. A contingent of troops was provided by king [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary. The city was besieged starting 1 May 1481. After the death of Mehmed on 3 May, ensuing quarrels about his succession possibly prevented the Ottomans from sending reinforcements to Otranto. So the Turkish occupation of Otranto ended by negotiation with the Christian forces, permitting the Turks to withdraw to Albania, and Otranto was retaken by Papal forces in 1481.\n\n==Repopulation of Constantinople (1453\u20131478)==\n\n{{further|History of Istanbul}}\n[[File:Fatih Camii 1888-1910 y\u0131llar\u0131.jpg|thumb|left|Historical photo of [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]], built by order of Sultan Mehmed II in Constantinople, the first [[imperial mosque]] built in the city after the Ottoman conquest.]]\n\nAfter conquering Constantinople, when Mehmed II finally entered the city through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]], he immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]], where he ordered the building to be protected.

In addition he founded, and encouraged his viziers to found, a number of Muslim institutions and commercial installations in the main districts of Constantinople, such as the [[Rum Mehmed Pasha Mosque]] built by the Grand Vizier [[Rum Mehmed Pasha]]. From these nuclei, the metropolis developed rapidly. According to a survey carried out in 1478, there were then in Constantinople and neighboring Galata 16,324 households, 3,927 shops, and an estimated population of 80,000.<ref>''The Ottomans and the Balkans'': Fikret Adan\u0131r, Suraiya Faroqhi, p. 358, 2002</ref> The population was about 60% Muslim, 20% Christian, and 10% Jewish.<ref>''A History of Islamic Societies'', Ira M.

Even today, many quarters of [[Istanbul]], such as [[Aksaray, Istanbul|Aksaray]] and [[\u00c7ar\u015famba, Istanbul|\u00c7ar\u015famba]], bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.<ref name=mw28/> However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmed allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.<ref name=mw28/> This measure apparently had no great success, since [[French people|French]] voyager [[Pierre Gilles]] writes in the middle of the 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to name any of the ancient Byzantine churches that had been transformed into mosques or abandoned.

Mehmed invited Muslim scientists and astronomers such as [[Ali Qushji]] and artists to his court in Constantinople, started a University, built mosques (for example, the [[Fatih Mosque]]), waterways, and Istanbul's [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]] and the [[Tiled Kiosk]].\nAround the [[Fatih Mosque|grand mosque]] that he constructed, he erected [[Sahn-\u0131 Seman Medrese|eight madrasas]], which, for nearly a century, kept their rank as the highest teaching institutions of the Islamic sciences in the empire.\n\nMehmed II allowed his subjects a considerable degree of religious freedom, provided they were obedient to his rule. After his conquest of Bosnia in 1463 he issued the [[Ahdname of Milodra\u017e]] to the [[Bosnian Franciscans]], granting them freedom to move freely within the [[Empire]], offer worship in their churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], and to practice their religion free from official and unofficial persecution, insult or disturbance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/ahd.html |title=Croatia and Ottoman Empire, Ahdnama, Sultan Mehmet II |publisher=Croatianhistory.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightmillennium.org/2004_14th_issue/eihsanoglu_stevens.html |title=A Culture of Peaceful Coexistence: The Ottoman Turkish Example; by Prof. Dr. Ekmeleddin IHSANOGLU |publisher=Light Millennium |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref> However, his standing army was recruited from the ''[[Devshirme]]'', a group that took first-born Christian subjects at a young age and destined them for the sultan's court. The less able, but physically strong, were instead put into the army or the sultan's personal guard, the [[Janissaries]].\n\nWithin Constantinople, Mehmed established a ''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' or an autonomous religious community, and appointed the former Patriarch [[Gennadius Scholarius]] as religious leader for the Orthodox Christians<ref>''Renaissance and Reformation'': James Patrick, p. 170, 2007</ref> of the city. His authority extended to all Ottoman Orthodox Christians, and this excluded the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] settlements in the suburbs, and excluded Muslim and [[Jewish]] settlers entirely. This method allowed for an indirect rule of the Christian Byzantines and allowed the occupants to feel relatively autonomous even as Mehmed II began the Turkish remodeling of the city, turning it into the Turkish capital, which it remained until the 1920s.\n\n== Patronage of Renaissance artists ==\nAside from his efforts to expand Ottoman dominion throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Mehmed II also cultivated a large collection of Western art and literature, many of which were produced by Renaissance artists. From a young age, Mehmed had shown interest in Renaissance art and Classical literature and histories, with his school books having caricaturistic illustrations of ancient coins and portraiture sketched in distinctly European styles. Furthermore, he reportedly had two tutors, one trained in Greek and another in Latin, reading to him Classical histories including those of Laertius, Livy, and Herodotus in the days leading up to the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Raby|first=J.|date=1982-01-01|title=A Sultan of Paradox: Mehmed the Conqueror as a Patron of the Arts|journal=Oxford Art Journal|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3\u20138|doi=10.1093/oxartj/5.1.3|issn=0142-6540}}</ref>\n\nFrom early on in his reign, Mehmed invested in the patronage of Italian Renaissance artists. His first documented request in 1461 was a commission from artist Matteo de' Pasti, who resided in the court of the lord of Remini, Sigismondo Malatesta. This first attempt was unsuccessful, though, as Pasti was arrested in Crete by Venetian authorities accusing him of being an Ottoman spy. Later attempts would prove more fruitful, with some notable artists including Costanzo da Ferrara and Gentile Bellini both being invited to the Ottoman court.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAside from his patronage of Renaissance artists, Mehmed was also an avid scholar of contemporary and Classical literature and history. This interest culminated in Mehmed\u2019s work on building a massive multilingual library that contained over 8000 manuscripts in Persian, Ottoman Turkish, Arabic, Latin, and Greek, among other languages.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Necipo\u011flu|first=G\u00fclru|title=Visual Cosmopolitanism and Creative Translation: Artistic Conversations with Renaissance Italy in Mehmed Ii's Constantinople|date=2012-01-01|journal=Muqarnas Online|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1\u201381|doi=10.1163/22118993-90000183|issn=0732-2992}}</ref> Of note in this large collection was Mehmed\u2019s Greek scriptorium, which included copies of Arrians\u2019 Anabasis of Alexander the Great and Homer\u2019s Iliad.<ref name=\":0\" /> His interest in Classical works extended in many directions, including the patronage of the Greek writer Kritiboulos of Imbros, who produced the Greek manuscript History of Mehmed the Conqueror, alongside his efforts to salvage and rebind Greek manuscripts acquired after his conquest of Constantinople.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Raby|first=Julian|date=1983|title=Mehmed the Conqueror's Greek Scriptorium|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=37|pages=15\u201334|doi=10.2307/1291474|jstor=1291474}}</ref>\n\nHistorians believe that Mehmed\u2019s widespread cultural and artistic tastes, especially those aimed towards the West, served various important diplomatic and administrative functions.

This was accomplished through various means, including the invocation of Mehmed\u2019s image as an Oritenal neo-Alexandrian figure, which is seen through shared helmet ornaments in depictions of Mehmed and Alexander on medallion portraits produced during Mehmed\u2019s reign, as well as being a leitmotiv in Kritiboulous\u2019 work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akkoc|first=Yunus|last2=Gozuacik|first2=Devrim|date=2018-10-18|title=Autophagy and liver cancer|journal=The Turkish Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=29|issue=3|pages=270\u2013282|doi=10.5152/tjg.2018.150318|pmid=29755011|pmc=6284658|issn=1300-4948}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|chapter=Circular Definitions|date=1998|pages=17\u201344|publisher=Duke University Press|doi=10.1215/9780822399896-002|isbn=978-0-8223-2155-2|title=Ladies Errant}}</ref> Additionally, his commissioning of Renaissance artwork was, itself, possibly an attempt to break down Western-Orietnal cultural binaries in order for Mehmed to present himself as a Western-oriented ruler, among the ranks of contemporary European Christian monarchs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMehmed\u2019s affinity towards the Renaissance arts, and his strong initiative in its creation and collection, did not have a large base of support within his own court.

In Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by [[John Hunyadi]] after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce [[Peace of Szeged]]. When Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he strengthened the Ottoman navy and made preparations to attack Constantinople.\n\nAt the age of 21, he [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered]] [[Constantinople]] (modern-day [[Istanbul]]) and brought an end to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. After the conquest Mehmed claimed the title \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]\" of the [[Roman Empire]] (''Qayser-i R\u00fbm''), based on the fact that Constantinople had been the seat and capital of the surviving Eastern [[Roman Empire]] since its consecration in 330 AD by Emperor Constantine I. The claim was only recognized by the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. Nonetheless, Mehmed II viewed the Ottoman state as a continuation of the Roman Empire for the remainder of his life, seeing himself as \"continuing\" the Empire rather than \"replacing\" it. This assertion was eventually abandoned by his successors. \n\nMehmed continued his conquests in [[Anatolia]] with its reunification and in Southeast Europe as far west as [[Bosnia]]. At home he made many political and social reforms, encouraged the arts and sciences, and by the end of his reign, his rebuilding program had changed the city into a thriving imperial capital. He is considered a hero in modern-day [[Turkey]] and parts of the wider [[Muslim world]]. Among other things, Istanbul's [[Fatih]] district, [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] and [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]] are named after him.\n\n== Early reign ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Hunername accession Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Accession of Mehmed II in [[Edirne]], 1451]]\nMehmed II was born on 30 March 1432, in [[Edirne]], then the capital city of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman state]]. His father was Sultan [[Murad II]] (1404\u20131451) and his mother [[H\u00fcma Hatun|H\u00fcma Valide Hatun]], born in the town of [[Devrekani]], [[Kastamonu]].\n\nWhen Mehmed II was eleven years old he was sent to [[Amasya]] to govern and thus gain experience, per the custom of Ottoman rulers before his time. Sultan Murad II also sent a number of teachers for him to study under. This Islamic education had a great impact in molding Mehmed's mindset and reinforcing his Muslim beliefs. He was influenced in his practice of Islamic [[Wiktionary:epistemology#Noun|epistemology]] by practitioners of science, particularly by his mentor, Molla G\u00fcrani, and he followed their approach. The influence of [[Akshamsaddin]] in Mehmed's life became predominant from a young age, especially in the imperative of fulfilling his Islamic duty to overthrow the Byzantine empire by conquering Constantinople.\n\nAfter Murad II made peace with the [[Karamanids]] in [[Anatolia]] in August 1444, he abdicated the throne to his 12-year-old son Mehmed II.\n\nIn Mehmed II's first reign, he defeated the crusade led by [[John Hunyadi]] after the Hungarian incursions into his country broke the conditions of the truce [[Peace of Szeged]]. Cardinal [[Julian Cesarini]], the representative of the Pope, had convinced the king of Hungary that breaking the truce with Muslims was not a betrayal. At this time Mehmed II asked his father Murad II to reclaim the throne, but Murad II refused. Angry at his father, who had long since retired to a contemplative life in southwestern Anatolia, Mehmed II wrote, \"If you are the sultan, come and lead your armies. If I am the sultan I hereby order you to come and lead my armies.\" It was only after receiving this letter that Murad II led the Ottoman army and won the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444.\n\nMurad II's return to the throne was forced by [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha the Younger|\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pa\u015fa]], the [[grand vizier]] at the time, who was not fond of Mehmed II's rule, because Mehmed II's influential [[lala (title)|lala]] (royal teacher), Akshamsaddin, had a rivalry with \u00c7andarl\u0131.\n\n== Conquest of Constantinople ==\n{{Main|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:OttomanEmpire1451.png|thumb|The Ottoman Empire at the beginning of Mehmed II's second reign.]]\n[[File:Turkey-1290.jpg|thumb|[[Roumeli Hissar Castle]], built by Sultan Mehmed II between 1451 and 1452, before the [[Fall of Constantinople]]<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8836/|title= Bosphorus (i.e. Bosporus), View from Kuleli, Constantinople, Turkey|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1890\u20131900 |accessdate = 2013-12-12 }}</ref>]]\n\nWhen Mehmed II ascended the throne again in 1451 he devoted himself to strengthening the Ottoman navy and made preparations for an attack on Constantinople.

Having completed his fortresses, Mehmed proceeded to levy a toll on ships passing within reach of their cannon.

At first, the city's walls held off the Turks, even though Mehmed's army used the new bombard designed by [[Orban]], a giant cannon similar to the [[Dardanelles Gun]]. The harbor of the [[Golden Horn]] was blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] and defended by twenty-eight [[warship]]s.\n\nOn 22 April, Mehmed transported his lighter warships overland, around the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] [[Genoese colonies|colony]] of [[Galata]], and into the Golden Horn's northern shore; eighty galleys were transported from the Bosphorus after paving a route, little over one mile, with wood. Thus the Byzantines stretched their troops over a longer portion of the walls.

The Ottoman ruler had a connection with the [[Serbian Despotate]] \u2013 one of [[Murad II]]'s wives was [[Mara Brankovi\u0107]] \u2013 and he used that fact to claim some Serbian islands. That [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] had recently made an alliance with the Hungarians, and had paid the tribute irregularly, may have been important considerations. When Serbia refused these demands, the Ottoman army set out from [[Edirne]] towards Serbia in 1454. [[Smederevo]] was besieged, as was [[Novo Brdo]], the most important Serbian metal mining and smelting center. Ottomans and Hungarians fought during the years till 1456.\n\nThe Ottoman army advanced as far as [[Belgrade]], where it attempted but failed to conquer the city from [[John Hunyadi]] at the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], on 14 July 1456. A period of relative peace ensued in the region until the [[Siege of Belgrade 1521|Fall of Belgrade]] in 1521, during the reign of Mehmed's great-grandson, known as Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The sultan retreated to Edirne, and [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] regained possession of some parts of Serbia. Before the end of the year, however, the 79-year-old Brankovi\u0107 died. Serbian independence survived him for only two years, when the Ottoman Empire formally annexed his lands following dissension among his widow and three remaining sons. Lazar, the youngest, poisoned his mother and exiled his brothers, but he died soon afterwards. In the continuing turmoil the oldest brother [[Stefan Brankovi\u0107]] gained the throne but was ousted in March 1459. After that the Serbian throne was offered to [[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]], the future king of Bosnia, which infuriated Sultan Mehmed. He sent his army, which captured [[Smederevo]] in June 1459, ending the existence of the [[Serbian Despotate]].<ref name=Miller1>{{cite book |title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Servia, and Montenegro |last=Miller |first=William |authorlink= |year=1896 |publisher=G.P.

The Ottomans had already invaded the region under [[Murad II]], destroying the Byzantine defenses&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Hexamilion wall]]&nbsp;\u2013 at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in 1446. Before the final siege of [[Constantinople]] Mehmed ordered Ottoman troops to attack the Morea. The despots, [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] and [[Thomas Palaiologos]], brothers of the last emperor, failed to send any aid. Their own incompetence resulted in an [[Morea revolt of 1453\u20131454|Albanian-Greek revolt]] against them, during which they invited in Ottoman troops to help put down the revolt.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|pp=125\u2013126}} At this time, a number of influential Moreote Greeks and Albanians made private peace with Mehmed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://angiolello.net/ARCHONS.pdf |title=Contemporary Copy of the Letter of Mehmet II to the Greek Archons 26 December 1454 (ASV Documenti Turchi B.1/11) |publisher=Angiolello.net |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727041148/http://angiolello.net/ARCHONS.pdf |archivedate=27 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After more years of incompetent rule by the despots, their failure to pay their annual tribute to the Sultan, and finally their own revolt against Ottoman rule, Mehmed entered the Morea in May 1460. Demetrios ended up a prisoner of the Ottomans and his younger brother Thomas fled. By the end of the summer, the Ottomans had achieved the submission of virtually all cities possessed by the Greeks.\n\nA few holdouts remained for a time. The island of [[Monemvasia]] refused to surrender, and it was ruled for a brief time by a Catalan corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to submit to the Pope's protection before the end of 1460.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|pp=173\u2013175}} The [[Mani Peninsula]], on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of local clans, and the area then came under the rule of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. The very last holdout was [[Salmeniko]], in the Morea's northwest. [[Graitzas Palaiologos]] was the military commander there, stationed at [[Salmeniko Castle]] (also known as Castle Orgia). While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|pp=176\u2013177}}\n\n== Conquest of Trebizond (1460\u20131461) ==\n\nEmperors of Trebizond formed alliances through royal marriages with various Muslim rulers. Emperor [[John IV of Trebizond]] married his daughter to the son of his brother-in-law, [[Uzun Hasan]], khan of the [[Ak Koyunlu]], in return for his promise to defend Trebizond. He also secured promises of support from the Turkish [[bey]]s of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] and [[Karamanid|Karamania]], and from the king and princes of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The Ottomans were motivated to capture Trebizond or to get an annual tribute. In the time of Murad II they first attempted to take the capital by sea in 1442, but high surf made the landings difficult and the attempt was repulsed. While Mehmed II was away laying siege to [[Belgrade]] in 1456, the Ottoman governor of [[Amasya]] attacked Trebizond, and although he was defeated, he took many prisoners and extracted a heavy tribute.\n\nAfter John's death in 1459, his brother [[David of Trebizond|David]] came to power and intrigued with various European powers for help against the Ottomans, speaking of wild schemes that included the conquest of [[Jerusalem]]. Mehmed II eventually heard of these intrigues and was further provoked to action by David's demand that Mehmed remit the tribute imposed on his brother.\n\nMehmed the Conqueror's response came in the summer of 1461. He led a sizable army from [[Bursa, Turkey|Bursa]] by land and the Ottoman navy by sea, first to [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], joining forces with Ismail's brother Ahmed (the Red). He captured Sinope and ended the official reign of the Jandarid dynasty, although he appointed Ahmed as the governor of Kastamonu and Sinope, only to revoke the appointment the same year. Various other members of the Jandarid dynasty were offered important functions throughout the history of the Ottoman Empire. During the march to Trebizond, [[Uzun Hasan]] sent his mother Sara Khatun as an ambassador; while they were climbing the steep heights of [[Zigana Pass|Zigana]] on foot, she asked Sultan Mehmed why he was undergoing such hardship for the sake of Trebizond. Mehmed replied:\n\n{{quote|Mother, in my hand is the sword of Islam, without this hardship I should not deserve the name of ''[[Ghazi warriors|ghazi]]'', and today and tomorrow I should have to cover my face in shame before [[Allah]].{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=193}}}}\n\nHaving isolated Trebizond, Mehmed quickly swept down upon it before the inhabitants knew he was coming, and he placed it [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|under siege]]. The city held out for a month before the emperor David surrendered on 15 August 1461.\n\n== Submission of Wallachia (1459\u20131462) ==\n[[File:Vlad Tepes 002.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad (Dracula) the Impaler]], Prince of [[Wallachia]], 1460]]\n\nThe Ottomans since the early 15th century tried to bring Wallachia ({{lang-ota|\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0686\u06cc\u0627}}) under their control by putting their own candidate on the throne, but each attempt ended in failure. The Ottomans regarded Wallachia as a buffer zone between them and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and for a yearly tribute did not meddle in their internal affairs. The two primary Balkan powers, Hungary and the Ottomans, maintained an enduring struggle to make Wallachia their own vassal. To prevent Wallachia from falling into the Hungarian fold, the Ottomans freed young [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III]] (Dracula), who had spent four years as a prisoner of Murad, together with his brother [[Radu cel Frumos|Radu]], so that Vlad could claim the throne of Wallachia. His rule was short-lived, however, as Hunyadi invaded Wallachia and restored his ally [[Vladislav II of Wallachia|Vladislav II]], of the [[House of D\u0103ne\u0219ti|D\u0103ne\u0219ti]] clan, to the throne.\n\nVlad III Dracula fled to Moldavia, where he lived under the protection of his uncle, [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]]. In October 1451, Bogdan was assassinated and Vlad fled to Hungary. Impressed by Vlad's vast knowledge of the mindset and inner workings of the Ottoman Empire, as well as his hatred towards the Turks and new Sultan Mehmed II, Hunyadi reconciled with his former enemy and tried to make Vlad III his own adviser, but Vlad refused.\n\nIn 1456, three years after the Ottomans had conquered Constantinople, they threatened Hungary by besieging [[Belgrade]]. Hunyadi began a concerted counter-attack in [[Serbia]]: while he himself moved into Serbia and relieved the siege (before dying of the plague), Vlad III Dracula led his own contingent into Wallachia, reconquered his native land, and killed the impostor Vladislav II.\n\n[[File:AtaculdeNoapte.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Night Attack of T\u00e2rgovi\u015fte]], which resulted in the victory of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad (Dracula) the Impaler]].]]\n\nIn 1459, Mehmed II sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay a delayed [[tribute]]{{sfn|Babinger|1992}} of 10,000 ducats and 500 recruits into the Ottoman forces. Vlad III Dracula refused and had the Ottoman envoys killed by nailing their [[turban]]s to their heads, on the pretext that they had refused to raise their \"hats\" to him, as they only removed their headgear before Allah.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sultan sent the Bey of Nicopolis, [[Hamza Bey|Hamza Pasha]], to make peace and, if necessary, eliminate Vlad III.<ref name=explore>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploringromania.com/vlad-the-impaler-3.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608112020/http://www.exploringromania.com/vlad-the-impaler-3.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-06-08 |title=Vlad the Impaler second rule [3&#93; |publisher=Exploringromania.com |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Vlad III set an ambush; the Ottomans were surrounded and almost all of them caught and impaled, with Hamza Pasha impaled on the highest stake, as befit his rank.<ref name=explore/>{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the winter of 1462, Vlad III crossed the Danube and scorched the entire Bulgarian land in the area between [[Serbia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

In a letter to Corvinus dated 2 February, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|I have killed peasants men and women, old and young, who lived at Oblucitza and Novoselo, where the Danube flows into the sea, up to [[Rahova]], which is located near Chilia, from the lower Danube up to such places as Samovit and Ghighen.

However, Vlad's policy of staunch resistance against the Ottomans was not a popular one, and he was betrayed by the boyars's (local aristocracy) appeasing faction, most of them also pro-D\u0103ne\u015fti (a rival princely branch). His best friend and ally [[Stephen III of Moldavia]], who had promised to help him, seized the chance and instead attacked him trying to take back the fortress of Chilia. Vlad III had to retreat to the mountains. After this, the Ottomans captured the Wallachian capital [[T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te]] and Mehmed II withdrew, having left Radu as ruler of Wallachia. [[Turahano\u011flu \u00d6mer Bey]], who served with distinction and wiped out a force 6,000 Wallachians and deposited 2,000 of their heads at the feet of Mehmed II, was also reinstated, as a reward, in his old gubernatorial post in Thessaly.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=207}} Vlad eventually escaped to Hungary, where he was imprisoned on a false accusation of treason against his overlord, [[Matthias Corvinus]].\n\n== Conquest of Bosnia (1463) ==\n[[File:Mehmed II ferman.jpg|thumb|Mehmed II's [[ahidn\u00e2me]] to the Catholic monks of the recently conquered Bosnia issued in 1463, granting them full religious freedom and protection.]]\n\nThe despot of Serbia, [[Lazar Brankovi\u0107]], died in 1458, and a civil war broke out among his heirs that resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Serbia in 1459. [[Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107]], son of the king of Bosnia, tried to bring Serbia under his control, but Ottoman expeditions forced him to give up his plan and Stephen fled to Bosnia, seeking refuge at the court of his father.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=575\u2013581}} After some battles Bosnia became tributary kingdom to the Ottomans.\n\nOn 10 July 1461, [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia|Stephen Thomas]] died, and Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 succeeded him as King of Bosnia. In 1461, Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 made an alliance with the Hungarians and asked [[Pope Pius II]] for help in the face of an impending Ottoman invasion. In 1463, after a dispute over the tribute paid annually by the [[Bosnian Kingdom]] to the Ottomans, he sent for help from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]]. However, none ever reached Bosnia. In 1463, Sultan Mehmed II led an army into the country. The royal city of [[Bobovac]] soon fell, leaving Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 to retreat to [[Jajce]] and later to [[Klju\u010d, Una-Sana Canton|Klju\u010d]]. Mehmed invaded Bosnia and conquered it very quickly, executing Stephen Toma\u0161evi\u0107 and his uncle [[Radivoj of Bosnia|Radivoj]].

The fugitive then converted to Christianity, so Ottoman demands for his rendition were refused by the Venetian authorities.<ref name=\"Setton241\">{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=241}}</ref> Using this as a pretext in November 1462, the Ottoman commander in central Greece, [[Turahano\u011flu \u00d6mer Bey]], attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto ([[Nafpaktos]]). On 3 April 1463, however, the governor of the Morea, Isa Beg, took the Venetian-held town of [[Argos]] by treason.<ref name=\"Setton241\"/>\n\nThe new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the Captain General of the Sea [[Alvise Loredan]], landed in the Morea, while [[Matthias Corvinus]] invaded Bosnia.<ref name=\"Finkel63\">{{harvnb|Finkel|2007|p=63}}</ref> At the same time, [[Pius II]] began assembling an army at [[Ancona]], hoping to lead it in person.<ref name=\"Shaw65\">{{harvnb|Shaw|1976|p=65}}</ref> Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as [[Karamanids]], [[Uzun Hassan]] and the [[Crimean Khanate]].<ref name=\"Shaw65\"/>\n\nIn early August, the Venetians retook [[Argos]] and refortified the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], restoring the [[Hexamilion wall]] and equipping it with many cannons.<ref name=\"Setton248\">{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=248}}</ref> They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the [[Acrocorinth]], which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese.

To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the [[Dardanelles]] Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the [[Golden Horn]] (named after the \"kadirga\" type of [[galley]]), and of two forts to guard the Straits, [[Kilitbahir Castle|Kilidulbahr]] and [[\u00c7anakkale|Sultaniye]].<ref name=\"Crusades326\">Setton, Hazard & Norman (1969), p. 326</ref> The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans; they razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea. Argos fell, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance.\n\nSultan Mehmed II, who was following Mahmud Pasha with another army to reinforce him, had reached Zeitounion ([[Lamia (city)|Lamia]]) before being apprised of his Vizier's success. Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia.<ref name=\"Crusades326\"/> However, the Sultan's attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus' approaching army. A new Ottoman army under Mahmud Pasha then forced Corvinus to withdraw, but Jajce was not retaken for many years after.<ref name=\"Setton250\"/> However, the death of Pope Pius II on 15 August in Ancona spelled the end of the Crusade.<ref name=\"Shaw65\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=270}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Venetian Republic had appointed [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Sigismondo Malatesta]] for the upcoming campaign of 1464. He launched attacks against Ottoman forts and engaged in a failed siege of [[Mistra]] in August through October. Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while \u00d6mer Bey's army roamed the countryside.\n\nIn the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], the Venetians tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital [[Mytilene]] for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced them to withdraw.<ref name=\"Setton251\">{{harvnb|Setton|1978|p=251}}</ref> Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed.

Thenceforth the Venetians paid an annual tribute for permission to trade in the Black Sea.\"</ref>\n\n== Anatolian conquests (1464\u20131473) ==\nDuring the post-[[Sultanate of Roum|Seljuks]] era in the second half of the [[middle ages]], numerous [[Oghuz Turk|Turkmen]] principalities collectively known as [[Anatolian beyliks]] emerged in Anatolia. [[Karamanids]] initially centred around the modern provinces of [[Karaman Province|Karaman]] and [[Konya Province|Konya]], the most important power in Anatolia. But towards the end of the 14th century, Ottomans began to dominate on most of Anatolia, reducing the Karaman influence and prestige.\n\n[[\u0130brahim II of Karaman]] was the ruler of Karaman, and during his last years, his sons began struggling for the throne. His heir apparent was [[\u0130shak of Karaman]], the governor of [[Silifke]]. But [[Pir Ahmet of Karaman|Pir Ahmet]], a younger son, declared himself as the bey of Karaman in [[Konya]]. \u0130brahim escaped to a small city in western territories where he died in 1464. The competing claims to the throne resulted in an interregnum in the ''beylik''. Nevertheless, with the help of [[Uzun Hasan]], the sultan of the [[Akkoyunlu]] (White Sheep) [[Oghuz Turks|Turkmens]], \u0130shak was able to ascend to the throne. His reign was short, however, as Pir Ahmet appealed to Sultan Mehmet II for help, offering Mehmet some territory that \u0130shak refused to cede. With Ottoman help, Pir Ahmet defeated \u0130shak in the battle of [[Da\u011fpazar\u0131, Mut|Da\u011fpazar\u0131]]. \u0130shak had to be content with Silifke up to an unknown date.<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi'' Cilt I, Akdtykttk Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 pp. 256\u2013257</ref> Pir Ahmet kept his promise and ceded a part of the ''beylik'' to the Ottomans, but he was uneasy about the loss. So during the Ottoman campaign in the West, he recaptured his former territory. Mehmet returned, however, and captured both Karaman (Larende) and Konya in 1466. Pir Ahmet barely escaped to the East. A few years later, Ottoman [[vizier]] (later [[grand vizier]]) [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]] captured the coastal region of the ''beylik''.<ref>Prof. Ya\u015far Y\u00fcce-Prof. Ali Sevim: ''T\u00fcrkiye tarihi'' Cilt I, Akdtyttk Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, \u0130stanbul, 1991 pp. 256\u2013258 {{Citation not found|reason=Unable to locate source origin}}</ref>{{Citation not found|date=April 2017}}\n\nPir Ahmet as well as his brother [[Kas\u0131m of Karaman|Kas\u0131m]] escaped to Uzun Hasan's territory. This gave Uzun Hasan a chance to interfere. In 1472, the Akkoyunlu army invaded and raided most of Anatolia (this was the reason behind the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]] in 1473). But then Mehmed led a successful campaign against Uzun Hasan in 1473 that resulted in the decisive victory of the Ottoman Empire in the [[Battle of Otlukbeli]]. Before that, Pir Ahmet with Akkoyunlu help had captured Karaman. However Pir Ahmet couldn't enjoy another term. Because immediately after the capture of Karaman, the Akkoyunlu army was defeated by the Ottomans near [[Bey\u015fehir]] and Pir Ahmet had to escape once more. Although he tried to continue his struggle, he learned that his family members had been transferred to [[\u0130stanbul]] by Gedik Ahmet Pasha, so he finally gave up. Demoralized, he escaped to Akkoyunlu territory where he was given a ''[[t\u0131mar]]'' (fief) in [[Bayburt]]. He died in 1474.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enfal.de/starih40.htm |title=Karamanogullari Beyligi |publisher=Enfal.de |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is a non-English, unreliable website; there must be more scholarly sources available to support this.|date=April 2017}}\n\nUniting the Anatolian ''beylik''s was first accomplished by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], more than fifty years before Mehmed II but after the destructive [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402, the newly formed unification was gone. Mehmed II recovered Ottoman power over the other Turkish states, and these conquests allowed him to push further into Europe.\n\nAnother important political entity that shaped the Eastern policy of Mehmed II were the [[Ak Koyunlu|White Sheep Turcomans]]. Under the leadership of [[Uzun Hasan]], this kingdom gained power in the East; but because of their strong relations with the Christian powers like the Empire of Trebizond and the [[Republic of Venice]], and the alliance between the Turcomans and the Karamanid tribe, Mehmed saw them as a threat to his own power.\n\n== War with Moldavia (1475\u20131476) ==\n[[File:Paolo Veronese 022.jpg|thumb|Mehmed the Second, portrait by [[Paolo Veronese]]]]\n\nIn 1456, [[Peter III Aaron]] agreed to pay the Ottomans an annual tribute of 2,000 gold ducats to ensure his southern borders, thus becoming the first Moldavian ruler to accept the Turkish demands.<ref>The A to Z of Moldova, Andrei Brezianu, Vlad Sp\u00e2nu, p. 273, 2010</ref> His successor [[Stephen the Great]] rejected Ottoman suzerainty and a series of fierce wars ensued.<ref>The A to Z of Moldova, Andrei Brezianu, Vlad Sp\u00e2nu, p. 242, 2010</ref> Stephen tried to bring Wallachia under his sphere of influence and so supported his own choice for the Wallachian throne. This resulted in an enduring struggle between different Wallachian rulers backed by Hungarians, Ottomans, and Stephen. An Ottoman army under Hadim Pasha (governor of Rumelia) was sent in 1475 to punish Stephen for his meddling in Wallachia; however, the Ottomans suffered a great defeat at the [[Battle of Vaslui]]. Stephen inflicted a decisive defeat on the Ottomans, described as \"the greatest ever secured by the Cross against Islam,\" with casualties, according to Venetian and Polish records, reaching beyond 40,000 on the Ottoman side. Mara Brankovic (Mara Hatun), the former younger wife of Murad II, told a Venetian envoy that the invasion had been worst ever defeat for the Ottomans. Stephen was later awarded the title \"Athleta Christi\" (Champion of Christ) by Pope Sixtus IV, who referred to him as \"verus christianae fidei athleta\" (\"the true defender of the Christian faith\").\nMehmed II assembled a large army and entered Moldavia in June 1476. Meanwhile, groups of [[Tartars]] from the [[Crimean Khanate]] (the Ottomans' recent ally) were sent to attack Moldavia. Romanian sources may state that they were repelled.<ref name=\"ir\">M.

Soon they were also confronted with starvation, a situation made worse by an outbreak of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], and the Ottoman army returned to Ottoman lands.

Skanderbeg had united the [[Albanian Principalities]] in a fight against the Empire in the [[League of Lezh\u00eb]] in 1444. Mehmed II couldn't subjugate [[Albania]] while Skanderbeg was alive, even though he twice (1466 and 1467) led the Ottoman armies himself against [[Kruj\u00eb]]. After Skanderbeg died in 1468, the Albanians couldn't find a leader to replace him, and Mehmed II eventually conquered Kruj\u00eb and Albania in 1478.\n\nIn spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians and their leader, Skenderbeg, who had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy.<ref name=\"Finkel63\"/> For the Albanians, the outbreak of the Ottoman\u2013Venetian War offered a golden opportunity to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, the Albanians provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of [[Durr\u00ebs|Durazzo]] and [[Shkod\u00ebr|Scutari]]. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of [[Elbasan]], allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old ''[[Via Egnatia]]'', cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south.<ref name=\"Finkel64\">{{harvnb|Finkel|2007|p=64}}</ref> However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid.

Because of lack of food, Gedik Ahmed Pasha returned with most of his troops to [[Albania]], leaving a garrison of 800 infantry and 500 cavalry behind to defend Otranto in Italy. It was assumed he would return after the winter. Since it was only 28 years after the fall of Constantinople, there was some fear that [[Rome]] would suffer the same fate. Plans were made for the Pope and citizens of Rome to evacuate the city. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] repeated his 1481 call for a [[crusade]]. Several Italian city-states, Hungary, and France responded positively to the appeal. The [[Republic of Venice]] did not, however, as it had signed an expensive peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1479.\n\nIn 1481 king [[Ferdinand I of Naples]] raised an army to be led by his son [[Alphonso II of Naples]]. A contingent of troops was provided by king [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary. The city was besieged starting 1 May 1481. After the death of Mehmed on 3 May, ensuing quarrels about his succession possibly prevented the Ottomans from sending reinforcements to Otranto. So the Turkish occupation of Otranto ended by negotiation with the Christian forces, permitting the Turks to withdraw to Albania, and Otranto was retaken by Papal forces in 1481.\n\n==Repopulation of Constantinople (1453\u20131478)==\n\n{{further|History of Istanbul}}\n[[File:Fatih Camii 1888-1910 y\u0131llar\u0131.jpg|thumb|left|Historical photo of [[Fatih Mosque, Istanbul|Fatih Mosque]], built by order of Sultan Mehmed II in Constantinople, the first [[imperial mosque]] built in the city after the Ottoman conquest.]]\n\nAfter conquering Constantinople, when Mehmed II finally entered the city through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]], he immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]], where he ordered the building to be protected.

In addition he founded, and encouraged his viziers to found, a number of Muslim institutions and commercial installations in the main districts of Constantinople, such as the [[Rum Mehmed Pasha Mosque]] built by the Grand Vizier [[Rum Mehmed Pasha]]. From these nuclei, the metropolis developed rapidly.

His authority extended to all Ottoman Orthodox Christians, and this excluded the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] settlements in the suburbs, and excluded Muslim and [[Jewish]] settlers entirely. This method allowed for an indirect rule of the Christian Byzantines and allowed the occupants to feel relatively autonomous even as Mehmed II began the Turkish remodeling of the city, turning it into the Turkish capital, which it remained until the 1920s.\n\n== Patronage of Renaissance artists ==\nAside from his efforts to expand Ottoman dominion throughout the Eastern Mediterranean, Mehmed II also cultivated a large collection of Western art and literature, many of which were produced by Renaissance artists. From a young age, Mehmed had shown interest in Renaissance art and Classical literature and histories, with his school books having caricaturistic illustrations of ancient coins and portraiture sketched in distinctly European styles. Furthermore, he reportedly had two tutors, one trained in Greek and another in Latin, reading to him Classical histories including those of Laertius, Livy, and Herodotus in the days leading up to the fall of Constantinople.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Raby|first=J.|date=1982-01-01|title=A Sultan of Paradox: Mehmed the Conqueror as a Patron of the Arts|journal=Oxford Art Journal|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3\u20138|doi=10.1093/oxartj/5.1.3|issn=0142-6540}}</ref>\n\nFrom early on in his reign, Mehmed invested in the patronage of Italian Renaissance artists. His first documented request in 1461 was a commission from artist Matteo de' Pasti, who resided in the court of the lord of Remini, Sigismondo Malatesta. This first attempt was unsuccessful, though, as Pasti was arrested in Crete by Venetian authorities accusing him of being an Ottoman spy. Later attempts would prove more fruitful, with some notable artists including Costanzo da Ferrara and Gentile Bellini both being invited to the Ottoman court.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAside from his patronage of Renaissance artists, Mehmed was also an avid scholar of contemporary and Classical literature and history.

This was accomplished through various means, including the invocation of Mehmed\u2019s image as an Oritenal neo-Alexandrian figure, which is seen through shared helmet ornaments in depictions of Mehmed and Alexander on medallion portraits produced during Mehmed\u2019s reign, as well as being a leitmotiv in Kritiboulous\u2019 work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akkoc|first=Yunus|last2=Gozuacik|first2=Devrim|date=2018-10-18|title=Autophagy and liver cancer|journal=The Turkish Journal of Gastroenterology|volume=29|issue=3|pages=270\u2013282|doi=10.5152/tjg.2018.150318|pmid=29755011|pmc=6284658|issn=1300-4948}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|chapter=Circular Definitions|date=1998|pages=17\u201344|publisher=Duke University Press|doi=10.1215/9780822399896-002|isbn=978-0-8223-2155-2|title=Ladies Errant}}</ref> Additionally, his commissioning of Renaissance artwork was, itself, possibly an attempt to break down Western-Orietnal cultural binaries in order for Mehmed to present himself as a Western-oriented ruler, among the ranks of contemporary European Christian monarchs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMehmed\u2019s affinity towards the Renaissance arts, and his strong initiative in its creation and collection, did not have a large base of support within his own court.

According to historian [[Franz Babinger]], Mehmed was regarded as a bloodthirsty tyrant by the Christian world and by a part of his subjects.{{sfn|Babinger|1992|p=432}} Istanbul's [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]] (completed 1988), which crosses the Bosporus Straits, is named after him, and his name and picture appeared on the Turkish 1000 [[Turkish lira|lira]] note from 1986 to 1992.<ref>\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629\u060c \u062a\u0623\u0644\u064a\u0641: \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0630 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0645\u064a\u060c \u062a\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u0625\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u062d\u0642\u064a\u060c \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0641\u0627\u0626\u0633\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0634\u0631\u0629: 1427 \u0647\u0640 \u2013 2006 \u0645\u060c \u0635\u0641\u062d\u0629:178\u2013177 {{ISBN|9953-18-084-9}} {{Better source|reason=Citation is not in English making difficult to verify; there must be a better English source available|date=April 2017}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is not in English making difficult to verify; there must be a better English source available|date=April 2017}}<ref>[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5hFIaQq0J?url=http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ |date=3 June 2009 }}.

By 1201 he held the Manor of Codnor in [[Derbyshire]], and in 1216 had been further granted the Manor of Grimston.
