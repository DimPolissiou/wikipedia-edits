In reference to the photo, B.B. King stated, \n\"Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they\u2019d hold up. They had tubes, and they\u2019d get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn\u2019t being made anymore. I fell in love with it, because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin.

King Lucille model, a ES-355 with stereo options, a varitone selector and fine tuners (neither of which were actually utilized by B.B.) and, at King's direct request, no f-holes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the \"80th Birthday Lucille\", the first prototype of which was given as a birthday gift to King, and which he used thereafter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |title=One Customer's Pawnshop Treasure |publisher=Guitarcenterblog.com |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618045219/http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nKing used a Lab Series L5 2\u00d712\" combo amplifier and had been using this amplifier for a long time.

Carlton Books Limited, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85868-529-X}}</ref> However, he was best known for playing variants of the [[Gibson ES-355]]. \n \nIn the September edition 1995 of ''[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]'' magazine, early photos show him playing a [[Gibson ES-5]] through a [[Fender tweed]] amp. In reference to the photo, B.B. King stated, \n\"Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they\u2019d hold up. They had tubes, and they\u2019d get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn\u2019t being made anymore. I fell in love with it, because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin.

King Lucille model, a ES-355 with stereo options, a varitone selector and fine tuners (neither of which were actually utilized by B.B.) and, at King's direct request, no f-holes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the \"80th Birthday Lucille\", the first prototype of which was given as a birthday gift to King, and which he used thereafter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |title=One Customer's Pawnshop Treasure |publisher=Guitarcenterblog.com |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618045219/http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nKing used a Lab Series L5 2\u00d712\" combo amplifier and had been using this amplifier for a long time.

And how it has a bad reputation as well.\n\n==Significance==\nThe deities of the Greek pantheon swore all their oaths upon the river Styx because, according to [[Greek mythology|classical mythology]], during the [[Titanomachy|Titan war]], Styx, the goddess of the river, sided with Zeus. After the war, Zeus declared that every oath must be sworn upon her.<ref>[[Hesiod]], Theogony 383 ff (trans. Evelyn-White)</ref> [[Zeus]] swore to give [[Semele]] whatever she wanted and was then obliged to follow through when he realized to his horror that her request would lead to her death. [[Helios]] similarly promised his son [[Phaethon|Pha\u00ebton]] whatever he desired, also resulting in the boy's death. Myths related to such early deities did not survive long enough to be included in historic records, but tantalizing references exist among those that have been discovered.\n\nAccording to some versions,{{which|date=June 2019}} Styx had miraculous powers and could make someone invulnerable. According to one tradition, [[Achilles]] was dipped in the waters of the river by his mother during his childhood, acquiring invulnerability, with exception of his heel, by which his mother held him. The only spot where Achilles was vulnerable was therefore that heel, where he was struck and killed by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris's arrow]] during the Trojan War. This is the source of the expression ''[[Achilles' heel]]'', a metaphor for a vulnerable spot.\n\nStyx was primarily a feature in the [[Afterlife|afterworld]] of classical Greek mythology, similar to the [[Christianity|Christian]] area of [[Hell]] in texts such as ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. The ferryman [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] often is described as having transported the souls of the newly dead across this river into the underworld. [[Dante]] put [[Phlegyas]] as ferryman over the Styx and made it the fifth circle of Hell, where the wrathful and sullen are punished by being drowned in the muddy waters for eternity, with the wrathful fighting each other. \nIn ancient times some believed that a coin ([[Charon's obol]]) placed in the mouth of a dead person<ref>No ancient source says that the coins were placed on the dead person's eyes; see [[Charon's obol#Coins on the eyes?]].</ref>  would pay the toll for the ferry across the river to the entrance of the underworld. It was said that if someone could not pay the fee, they would never be able to cross the river. The ritual was performed by the relatives of the dead.\n\nThe variant spelling '''Stix''' was sometimes used in translations of Classical Greek before the 20th century.<ref>[[Iliad]](1-3), [[Homer]];  H.

''A Chorus Line'' provides a glimpse into the personalities of the performers and the choreographer, as they describe the events that have shaped their lives and their decisions to become dancers.\n\nFollowing several workshops and an [[Off-Broadway]] production, ''A Chorus Line'' opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (New York City)|Shubert Theatre]] on Broadway July 25, 1975. An unprecedented box office and critical hit, the musical received twelve [[Tony Award]] nominations and won nine, in addition to the 1976 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].\n\nThe original Broadway production ran for 6,137 performances, becoming the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest-running production in Broadway history]] until surpassed by ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1997, and the longest-running Broadway musical originally produced in the US, until surpassed in 2011 by the revival of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. It remains the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|seventh longest-running Broadway show]] ever. ''A Chorus Line''{{'}}s success has spawned many successful productions worldwide. It began a lengthy run in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1976 and was revived on Broadway in 2006, and in the West End in 2013.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show opens in the middle of an audition for an upcoming Broadway production. The formidable director Zach and his assistant choreographer Larry put the dancers through their paces. Every dancer is desperate for work (\"I Hope I Get It\"). After the next round of cuts, 17 dancers remain. Zach tells them he is looking for a strong dancing chorus of four boys and four girls. He wants to learn more about them, and asks the dancers to introduce themselves. With reluctance, the dancers reveal their pasts. The stories generally progress chronologically from early life experiences through adulthood to the end of a career.\n\nThe first candidate, Mike, explains that he is the youngest of 12 children. He recalls his first experience with dance, watching his sister's dance class when he was a pre-schooler (\"I Can Do That\"). Mike took her place one day when she refused to go to class\u2014and he stayed. Bobby tries to hide the unhappiness of his childhood by making jokes. As he speaks, the other dancers have misgivings about this strange audition process and debate what they should reveal to Zach (\"And...\"), but since they all need the job, the session continues.\n\nZach is angered when he feels that the streetwise Sheila is not taking the audition seriously. Opening up, she reveals that her mother married at a young age and her father neither cared about nor loved them. When she was six she realized, as had Bebe and Maggie, that [[ballet]] provided relief from her unhappy family life (\"At the Ballet\"). The scatterbrained Kristine is [[tone deafness|tone-deaf]], and her lament that she could never sing is interrupted by her husband Al finishing her phrases in tune (\"Sing\").\n\nMark, the youngest of the dancers, relates his first experiences with pictures of the female anatomy and his first [[Nocturnal emission|wet dream]], while the other dancers share memories of adolescence (\"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love\"). The 4'10\" Connie laments the problems of being short, and Diana Morales recollects her horrible high-school acting class ([[Nothing (A Chorus Line song)|\"Nothing\"]]). Don remembers his first job at a [[nightclub]] and Judy reflects on her problematic childhood while some of the auditioners talk about their opinion of their parents (\"Mother\"). Greg speaks about his discovery of his [[homosexuality]] and Richie recounts how he nearly became a [[kindergarten]] teacher (\"Gimme the Ball\"). Finally, the newly-[[buxom]] Val explains that talent alone doesn't count for everything with casting directors, and silicone and [[plastic surgery]] can really help (\"Dance: Ten; Looks: Three\").\n\nThe dancers go downstairs to learn a song for the audition's next section, but Cassie stays onstage to talk to Zach. She is a veteran dancer who has had notable successes as a soloist. They have a history together: Zach had previously cast her in a featured part, and they had lived together for several years. Zach tells Cassie that she is too good for the chorus and shouldn't be at this audition. But she hasn't been able to find solo work and is willing to \"come home\" to the chorus where she can at least express her passion for dance (\"The Music and the Mirror\"). Zach sends her downstairs to learn the dance combination.\n\nZach calls Paul, who has been reluctant to share his past, on stage for a private talk, and he emotionally relives his childhood and high-school experience, his early career in a [[drag (clothing)|drag]] act, coming to terms with his manhood and his homosexuality, and his parents' ultimate reaction to finding out about his lifestyle. Paul breaks down and is comforted by Zach. Cassie and Zach's complex relationship resurfaces during a run-through of the number created to showcase an unnamed star (\"One\"). Zach confronts Cassie, feeling that she is \"dancing down,\" and they rehash what went wrong in their relationship and her career. Zach points to the machine-like dancing of the rest of the cast\u2014the other dancers who have all blended together, and who will probably never be recognized individually\u2014and mockingly asks if this is what she wants. Cassie defiantly defends the dancers: \"I\u2019d be proud to be one of them. They\u2019re wonderful....They\u2019re all special. I\u2019d be happy to be dancing in that line. Yes, I would....\"\n\nDuring a [[tap dance|tap]] sequence, Paul falls and injures his knee that recently underwent surgery. After Paul is carried off to the hospital, all at the audition stand in disbelief, realizing that their careers can also end in an instant. Zach asks the remaining dancers what they will do when they can no longer dance. Led by Diana, they reply that whatever happens, they will be free of regret (\"[[What I Did for Love (A Chorus Line)|What I Did for Love]]\"). The final eight dancers are selected: Mike, Cassie, Bobby, Judy<!-- Note that Bebe was selected in the film, but this article refers to the stage version -->, Richie, Val, Mark, and Diana.\n\n\"One\" (reprise/finale) begins with an individual bow for each of the 19 characters, their hodgepodge rehearsal clothes replaced by identical spangled gold costumes. As each dancer joins the group, it is suddenly difficult to distinguish one from the other: [[irony|ironically]], each character who was an individual to the audience seems now to be an anonymous member of a neverending [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]].<ref>Synopsis adapted from [http://www.musicals101.com/chorus2.htm \"Michael Bennett's ''A Chorus Line''\"].</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"[[I Hope I Get It]]\" \u2013 Company\n* \"[[I Can Do That (A Chorus Line song)|I Can Do That]]\" \u2013 Mike\n* \"And...\" \u2013 Bobby, Richie, Val, and Judy\n* \"[[At the Ballet]]\" \u2013 Sheila, Bebe, and Maggie\n* \"[[Sing!

The sessions were originally hosted by dancers Michon Peacock and Tony Stevens.  The first taped session occurred at the Nickolaus Exercise Center January 26, 1974.  They hoped that they would form a professional dance company to make workshops for Broadway dancers.\n\nMichael Bennett was invited to join the group primarily as an observer, but quickly took control of the proceedings. Although Bennett's involvement has been challenged, there has been no question about Kirkwood and Dante's authorship. In later years, Bennett's claim that ''A Chorus Line'' had been his brainchild resulted in not only hard feelings but a number of lawsuits as well.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/theater/02chor.html Those First in \u2018Chorus Line\u2019 Gain a Continuing Stake] New York Times February 2, 2008</ref> During the workshop sessions, random characters would be chosen at the end for the chorus jobs based on their performance quality, resulting in genuine surprise among the cast.  However, several costumers protested this ending, mainly due to the stress of having to change random actors in time for the finale. This resulted in the ending being cut in exchange for the same set of characters winning the slots.<ref name=mckay>McKay, William.

Bennett changed it so that Cassie would always win the part.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.madisonavenuejournal.com/2009/03/24/kurt_brokaws_new_directorsnew_film| title=Kurt Brokaw's New Directors/Film, Part Three| work=Madison Avenue Journal| date=March 24, 2009| accessdate=March 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Original production===\n''A Chorus Line'' opened [[Off Broadway]] at [[The Public Theater]] on April 15, 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iobdb.com/Production/1107| title=A Chorus Line| work=Lortel Archives, Internet Off-Broadway Database| accessdate=29 September 2019| df=mdy-all}}</ref> At the time, the Public did not have enough money to finance the production so it borrowed $1.6 million to produce the show.<ref>\"What They Did for Love.\" ''American Theatre''.

''A Chorus Line'' provides a glimpse into the personalities of the performers and the choreographer, as they describe the events that have shaped their lives and their decisions to become dancers.\n\nFollowing several workshops and an [[Off-Broadway]] production, ''A Chorus Line'' opened at the [[Shubert Theatre (New York City)|Shubert Theatre]] on Broadway July 25, 1975. An unprecedented box office and critical hit, the musical received twelve [[Tony Award]] nominations and won nine, in addition to the 1976 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]].\n\nThe original Broadway production ran for 6,137 performances, becoming the [[List of Broadway shows that have held title of longest-running show|longest-running production in Broadway history]] until surpassed by ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' in 1997, and the longest-running Broadway musical originally produced in the US, until surpassed in 2011 by the revival of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''. It remains the [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|seventh longest-running Broadway show]] ever. ''A Chorus Line''{{'}}s success has spawned many successful productions worldwide. It began a lengthy run in the [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1976 and was revived on Broadway in 2006, and in the West End in 2013.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe show opens in the middle of an audition for an upcoming Broadway production. The formidable director Zach and his assistant choreographer Larry put the dancers through their paces. Every dancer is desperate for work (\"I Hope I Get It\"). After the next round of cuts, 17 dancers remain. Zach tells them he is looking for a strong dancing chorus of four boys and four girls. He wants to learn more about them, and asks the dancers to introduce themselves. With reluctance, the dancers reveal their pasts. The stories generally progress chronologically from early life experiences through adulthood to the end of a career.\n\nThe first candidate, Mike, explains that he is the youngest of 12 children. He recalls his first experience with dance, watching his sister's dance class when he was a pre-schooler (\"I Can Do That\"). Mike took her place one day when she refused to go to class\u2014and he stayed. Bobby tries to hide the unhappiness of his childhood by making jokes. As he speaks, the other dancers have misgivings about this strange audition process and debate what they should reveal to Zach (\"And...\"), but since they all need the job, the session continues.\n\nZach is angered when he feels that the streetwise Sheila is not taking the audition seriously. Opening up, she reveals that her mother married at a young age and her father neither cared about nor loved them. When she was six she realized, as had Bebe and Maggie, that [[ballet]] provided relief from her unhappy family life (\"At the Ballet\"). The scatterbrained Kristine is [[tone deafness|tone-deaf]], and her lament that she could never sing is interrupted by her husband Al finishing her phrases in tune (\"Sing\").\n\nMark, the youngest of the dancers, relates his first experiences with pictures of the female anatomy and his first [[Nocturnal emission|wet dream]], while the other dancers share memories of adolescence (\"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love\"). The 4'10\" Connie laments the problems of being short, and Diana Morales recollects her horrible high-school acting class ([[Nothing (A Chorus Line song)|\"Nothing\"]]). Don remembers his first job at a [[nightclub]] and Judy reflects on her problematic childhood while some of the auditioners talk about their opinion of their parents (\"Mother\"). Greg speaks about his discovery of his [[homosexuality]] and Richie recounts how he nearly became a [[kindergarten]] teacher (\"Gimme the Ball\"). Finally, the newly-[[buxom]] Val explains that talent alone doesn't count for everything with casting directors, and silicone and [[plastic surgery]] can really help (\"Dance: Ten; Looks: Three\").\n\nThe dancers go downstairs to learn a song for the audition's next section, but Cassie stays onstage to talk to Zach. She is a veteran dancer who has had notable successes as a soloist. They have a history together: Zach had previously cast her in a featured part, and they had lived together for several years. Zach tells Cassie that she is too good for the chorus and shouldn't be at this audition. But she hasn't been able to find solo work and is willing to \"come home\" to the chorus where she can at least express her passion for dance (\"The Music and the Mirror\"). Zach sends her downstairs to learn the dance combination.\n\nZach calls Paul, who has been reluctant to share his past, on stage for a private talk, and he emotionally relives his childhood and high-school experience, his early career in a [[drag (clothing)|drag]] act, coming to terms with his manhood and his homosexuality, and his parents' ultimate reaction to finding out about his lifestyle. Paul breaks down and is comforted by Zach. Cassie and Zach's complex relationship resurfaces during a run-through of the number created to showcase an unnamed star (\"One\"). Zach confronts Cassie, feeling that she is \"dancing down,\" and they rehash what went wrong in their relationship and her career. Zach points to the machine-like dancing of the rest of the cast\u2014the other dancers who have all blended together, and who will probably never be recognized individually\u2014and mockingly asks if this is what she wants. Cassie defiantly defends the dancers: \"I\u2019d be proud to be one of them. They\u2019re wonderful....They\u2019re all special. I\u2019d be happy to be dancing in that line. Yes, I would....\"\n\nDuring a [[tap dance|tap]] sequence, Paul falls and injures his knee that recently underwent surgery. After Paul is carried off to the hospital, all at the audition stand in disbelief, realizing that their careers can also end in an instant. Zach asks the remaining dancers what they will do when they can no longer dance. Led by Diana, they reply that whatever happens, they will be free of regret (\"[[What I Did for Love (A Chorus Line)|What I Did for Love]]\"). The final eight dancers are selected: Mike, Cassie, Bobby, Judy<!-- Note that Bebe was selected in the film, but this article refers to the stage version -->, Richie, Val, Mark, and Diana.\n\n\"One\" (reprise/finale) begins with an individual bow for each of the 19 characters, their hodgepodge rehearsal clothes replaced by identical spangled gold costumes. As each dancer joins the group, it is suddenly difficult to distinguish one from the other: [[irony|ironically]], each character who was an individual to the audience seems now to be an anonymous member of a neverending [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]].<ref>Synopsis adapted from [http://www.musicals101.com/chorus2.htm \"Michael Bennett's ''A Chorus Line''\"].</ref>\n\n==Musical numbers==\n* \"[[I Hope I Get It]]\" \u2013 Company\n* \"[[I Can Do That (A Chorus Line song)|I Can Do That]]\" \u2013 Mike\n* \"And...\" \u2013 Bobby, Richie, Val, and Judy\n* \"[[At the Ballet]]\" \u2013 Sheila, Bebe, and Maggie\n* \"[[Sing!

The sessions were originally hosted by dancers Michon Peacock and Tony Stevens.  The first taped session occurred at the Nickolaus Exercise Center January 26, 1974.  They hoped that they would form a professional dance company to make workshops for Broadway dancers.\n\nMichael Bennett was invited to join the group primarily as an observer, but quickly took control of the proceedings. Although Bennett's involvement has been challenged, there has been no question about Kirkwood and Dante's authorship. In later years, Bennett's claim that ''A Chorus Line'' had been his brainchild resulted in not only hard feelings but a number of lawsuits as well.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/02/theater/02chor.html Those First in \u2018Chorus Line\u2019 Gain a Continuing Stake] New York Times February 2, 2008</ref> During the workshop sessions, random characters would be chosen at the end for the chorus jobs based on their performance quality, resulting in genuine surprise among the cast.  However, several costumers protested this ending, mainly due to the stress of having to change random actors in time for the finale. This resulted in the ending being cut in exchange for the same set of characters winning the slots.<ref name=mckay>McKay, William.

As Kelly Bishop, the original Sheila, later noted, \"it was appalling when director  [[Richard Attenborough]] went on a talk show and said 'this is a story about kids trying to break into show business.' I almost tossed my TV out the window; I mean what an ''idiot!'' It's about veteran dancers looking for one last job before it's too late for them to dance anymore. No wonder the film sucked!\"\n\nIn 1976, \"One\" and \"What I Did For Love\" were performed by the cast of ''[[The Brady Bunch Hour|The Brady Bunch Variety Hour]]''.\n\nIn 1988, the [[60th Academy Awards]] featured a variation of \"I Hope I Get It\" at the beginning of the ceremony.\n\nIn 1990, original cast members Baayork Lee and Thommie Walsh collaborated with Robert Viagas on the book ''On the Line: The Creation of A Chorus Line'', which chronicles the musical's origins and evolution and includes interviews with the entire original cast.\n\nIn 1990, [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] launched a marketing campaign around ''A Chorus Line'' as it was touring the United States. The promotions included television commercials featuring the musical and the right to say that tickets for the show could be charged only on Visa cards. Visa paid $500,000 for the promotion.<ref>McManus, John, \"Visa joins with ''Chorus Line'',\" ''Advertising Age'', September 17, 1990, Vol. 61 Issue 38, p. 4</ref>\n\nAlso in 1990, much of the original cast reunited to perform selections from the musical as well as talk about it on the talk show ''[[Donahue]]''. This performance was given to benefit the final run of the show as it was about to close on Broadway at the time. The highlight of the appearance was an emotionally charged performance of \"At The Ballet\" as performed by [[Kelly Bishop]], Kay Cole and Nancy Lane which left several of the cast and the studio audience fighting back tears. Another highlight was the comical performance of \"Dance: Ten, Looks: Three (Tits and Ass)\" as done by Pamela Blair. Renee Baughman was the only original cast member who couldn't attend the show's taping because she had to care for her seriously ill father.\n\n''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror V]]\" closes with a parody of \"One\", which the Simpson family and Groundskeeper Willie sing (with alternate lyrics) after they are turned inside out by a mysterious fog.\n\nMichael Bennett and Ed Kleban are portrayed in the 2001 musical ''[[A Class Act]]'', a partly fictionalized account of Kleban's life using some of the lyricist's unpublished songs.\n\nIn \"What I'll Never Do For Love Again,\" the 20th episode of the fifth season of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'' (2002), Elaine Vassal auditions (ultimately in vain) for a Boston production of ''A Chorus Line,'' singing \"Dance: Ten; Looks: Three\" and \"The Music and the Mirror.\"\n\nJames D. Stern and Adam Del Deo produced and directed a [[documentary film]] about the musical called ''[[Every Little Step (film)|Every Little Step]]'', which includes footage of Michael Bennett and interviews with Marvin Hamlisch, Bob Avian, former theater critic for ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Frank Rich]], and original cast members [[Donna McKechnie]] and [[Baayork Lee]]. The film includes some of the audiotapes made at the early workshop sessions and shows behind-the-scenes footage of the audition, rehearsals, and performances of both the original 1975 production and the 2006 Broadway revival. Production of the documentary began in 2005 when 3,000 hopefuls arrived on the first day of auditions for the revival. The film made its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2008 and was released as ''Broadway Broadway'' in Japan the following month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ff20081017a2.html|title='Every Little Step' \u2013 The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}</ref> The documentary opened in limited release in the US in April 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/a-chorus-line-documentary-every-little-step-to-hit-screens-in-april-com-157377|title=A Chorus Line Documentary \"Every Little Step\" to Hit Screens in April|work=Playbill|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130071058/http://playbill.com/news/article/125652.html|archivedate=2009-01-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, music from the score was used in the television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' in the episode \"[[Brown Betty (Fringe)|Brown Betty]]\", and also in the movie ''[[Land of the Lost (film)|Land of the Lost]]'' that same year featuring [[Will Ferrell]], [[Danny McBride (actor)|Danny McBride]], and [[Anna Friel]]\n\nThe song \"What I Did for Love\" has been recorded by [[Aretha Franklin]] on ''[[Sweet Passion]]'' (1977), [[Petula Clark]], [[The Three Degrees]] on their 1977 album ''Standing Up for Love'', [[Me First and the Gimme Gimmes]] on ''[[Are a Drag]]'' (1999), [[Christine Ebersole]] in a 2009 episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', and most recently by [[Lea Michele]] in the first episode of the second season of the hit musical television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. In a later episode in the same season, [[Jenna Ushkowitz]] and [[Harry Shum Jr.]] performed \"Sing!\", although the male and female vocals were switched. The episode \"Hell-O\" from the show's first season was planned to feature a performance of \"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love\", although the performance was cut; in a later episode the song can be heard playing in the background. Never officially released, the song was performed by [[Lea Michele]] and [[Jonathan Groff]]. \"At The Ballet\" was featured in the show's fourth season and was performed by [[Chris Colfer]], [[Naya Rivera]], [[Lea Michele]] and [[Sarah Jessica Parker]].\n\nThe ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[W.T.F.

Randel (\"Judy Turner\") mounted her original production, ''The Hat'', at [[New York International Fringe Festival|The New York International Fringe Festival]] \u2013 [[FringeNYC]]. ''The Hat'' was inspired by her experience as a young Broadway dancer who learns on the eve of a performance that her father has died. Randel appeared in more than 2,000 performances of the musical from 1981 to 1985 at Broadway's [[Shubert Theatre (New York City)|Shubert Theatre]] and on National and international tours, and can be seen as a featured dancer in Richard Attenborough's film, ''[[A Chorus Line (film)|A Chorus Line]]''.\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|LGBT}}\n* {{Portal-inline|Theatre}}\n* {{Portal-inline|New York City}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Long, Robert Emmet, ''Broadway, the Golden Years''.

In [[World War II]], he led the [[SS Division Totenkopf]] and was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]. Post-war, Becker was tried by Soviet authorities twice, for [[war crimes]] and sabotage and was executed in 1953, after the second trial.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in 1902, Becker joined the army in 1920 and left it in 1932 with the rank of Sergeant major (''Wachtmeister''). In 1933, he joined the [[SS]] and met [[Wilhelm Bittrich]] and [[Hermann Priess]]. In 1935, Becker was transferred to the ''SS Totenkopf'' Standarte \"Oberbayern\", stationed at the ''SS-\u00dcbungslager'' Dachau, which later became part of the [[SS Division Totenkopf]]. On the 9<sup>th</sup> November 1940, Becker was promoted to ''SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer'' and commander of the ''SS-Totenkopf-Regiment''. From 1942 to 1944 he held the rank of an ''SS-Standartenf\u00fchre''r and saw active duty in the ''Totenkopf-Division.'' Early in 1944, he was transferred to [[SS F\u00fchrungshauptamt|SS-F\u00fchrungshauptamt]] and in March, he assumed command of the 36th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, [[SS Division Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]] in Italy. On the 21<sup>st</sup> June, he is promoted to ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrer'' and in July, commander of the ''3<sup>rd</sup> SS-Panzerdivision Totenkopf.'' The 1<sup>st</sup> of October 1944 he is promoted to SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer.<ref>{{Cite book|last=von Preradovich|first=Nikolaus|title=Die Generale der Waffen-SS|publisher=Kurt Vowinckel Verlag|year=1985|isbn=3 921 655 41 2|location=Germany|pages=122}}</ref> \n\nIn December 1944, the division was moved to [[Hungary]] for the battles around [[Budapest]]. The division crossed the [[Danube]] River to Vienna, attempting to surrender to the U.S. forces. Under the terms of Germany's capitulation, the surrender was refused and the unit was handed over to the Soviet Red Army.\n\n==Trials, convictions and execution==\n\nIn November 1947, he was put on trial before a Soviet military court in [[Poltava]] and sentenced to 25 years forced labor for [[war crimes]]. While serving his sentence, Becker \"tried his jailers' patience\" by attempting to manufacture explosives, leading to his retrial. \"The personification of the brutal [[Landsknecht]]s who formed the high-ranking officers of the Waffen-SS\", he was convicted and executed in February 1953.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=128}}\n\nBecker proved himself a brutal, ruthless and debauched man, even to SS standards according to official Waffen-SS inquiries: \"On the Eastern Front, Becker has raped Russian women in public and has appeared completely drunk on several occasions in the frontlines as regimental commander. In Spring 1943, he had organised prostitutes to come to his command centre and on the 20<sup>th</sup> April 1943, he had all the artillery sent a ten-minute salute salvo to celebrate the F\u00fchrer\u2019s birthday. Even in on the Western front on Christmas 1942, he had organised an orgy for his regiment in the officers\u2019 casino.

In [[World War II]], he led the [[SS Division Totenkopf]] and was a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]. Post-war, Becker was tried by Soviet authorities twice, for [[war crimes]] and sabotage and was executed in 1953, after the second trial.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in 1902, Becker joined the army in 1920. In 1933, he joined the [[SS]] and met [[Wilhelm Bittrich]] and [[Hermann Priess]]. In 1935, Becker was transferred to the SS Totenkopf Standarte \"Oberbayern\", stationed at the SS-\u00dcbungslager Dachau, which later became part of the [[SS Division Totenkopf]]. Becker was appointed regimental commander in August 1941. In October, he was given command of the division, until March 1944 when he assumed command of the 36th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, [[SS Division Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]] in Italy. On 20 July 1944, Becker was given command of the SS Division Totenkopf. \n\nIn December 1944, the division was moved to [[Hungary]] for the battles around [[Budapest]]. The division crossed the [[Danube]] River to Vienna, attempting to surrender to the U.S. forces. Under the terms of Germany's capitulation, the surrender was refused and the unit was handed over to the Soviet Red Army.\n\n==Trials, convictions and execution==\n\nIn November 1947, he was put on trial before a Soviet military court in [[Poltava]] and sentenced to 25 years forced labor for [[war crimes]]. While serving his sentence, Becker \"tried his jailers' patience\" by attempting to manufacture explosives, leading to his retrial. \"The personification of the brutal [[Landsknecht]]s who formed the high-ranking officers of the Waffen-SS\", he was convicted and executed in February 1953.{{sfn|Parrish|1996|p=128}}\n\n==Awards==\n*[[Iron Cross]] (1939) 2nd Class (24 May 1940) & 1st Class (26 June 1940)<ref name=\"Thomas p31\">Thomas 1997, p. 31.</ref>\n*[[German Cross]] in Gold on 26 September 1942 as SS-''[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]]'' in SS-Totenkopf Regiment 3<ref>Patzwall & Scherzer 2001, p. 31.</ref>\n*[[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]]\n** Knight's Cross on 7 September 1943 as SS-''Standartenf\u00fchrer'' and commander of the SS Regiment Theodor Eicke.<ref name=\"Scherzer p209\">Scherzer 2007, p. 209.</ref>\n** Oak Leaves on 21 September 1944 as SS-''[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' and commander of the SS Division Totenkopf<ref name=\"Scherzer p209\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*Main article [[Register of SS-Leaders in general\u2019s rank#List SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer|List SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer]]\n\n==References==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|first=Michael|last=Parrish|title=The Lesser Terror: Soviet State Security, 1939\u20131953|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=D2153C|publisher=Praeger Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-275-95113-9|ref = harv}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last1=Patzwall\n  |first1=Klaus D.\n  |last2=Scherzer\n  |first2=Veit\n  |year=2001\n  |title=Das Deutsche Kreuz 1941 \u2013 1945 Geschichte und Inhaber Band II\n  |trans-title=The German Cross 1941 \u2013 1945 History and Recipients Volume 2\n  |language=German\n  |location=Norderstedt, Germany\n  |publisher=Verlag Klaus D.

She first included it in her setlist while opening for [[Neil Young]]. Ronstadt gave an early televised performance of \"You're No Good\" on an episode of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' which was broadcast December 21, 1973.\n\nRonstadt recorded her album ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'' with producer [[Peter Asher]] in the summer of 1974 at [[the Sound Factory]]; \"You're No Good\" was a last-minute choice for recording, and while the song was Ronstadt's suggestion, Asher recalls: \"It was an odd coincidence. She\u2019d been doing the song already, and it was always a favorite song of mine...the version I fell in love with [being by] the Swinging Blue Jeans\".<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/classic-tracks/classic-track-you-re-no-good-linda-ronstadt/387624A| title=Classic Track: You're No Good| publisher=MixOnline.com| accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref> The original backing track intended for Ronstadt's version of \"You're No Good\" was recorded July 1, 1974. According to Bob Warford, a guitarist in Ronstadt's touring band who played on the July 1 track, \"They were trying to do an R&B version of the song, which was actually closer to the way we did it live than to the released version. We played it at a faster tempo live, which we did on that recording [ie. of July 1].\"<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\"/> Ronstadt vetoed the July 1 arrangement; she recalls: \"It was just the wrong groove for me. I don\u2019t think I knew how to phrase around [the players], certainly no fault of theirs. They were fantastic.\"<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\"/>\n\nThe final recording of the Ronstadt version of \"You're No Good\" was made July 5, 1974. Ronstadt would recall: \"Ed Black, who played six-string guitar and pedal steel, started to play a rhythm riff on his [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]]. Kenny Edwards...the bass player...echoed the riff in octaves. [[Andrew Gold]] added a sparse drum track, giving me a basic track to sing over. We did a few takes, picked one we liked, and then Andrew, who always played guitars and keyboards went to work with Peter [Asher]and began to work up layers of guitar, piano and percussion tracks.\" Ronstadt recalls that during a playback after several hours of work, [[Val Garay]], the engineer, accidentally erased Andrew Gold's guitar solo from the track, necessitating Asher and Gold's reconstructing that solo from scratch.<ref>{{cite book\n| first=Linda\n| last=Ronstadt\n| year=2013\n| title=Simple Dreams: a musical memoir\n| edition=1st hardcover\n| publisher=Simon & Schuster\n| location= New York\n| pages=96\u201397\n| isbn=978-1-4516-6872-8}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 1974 a string arrangement - by [[Gregory Rose (musician)|Gregory Rose]] - was added to the track at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]]. According to a ''Classic Tracks'' article by Mick Hurwitz at MixOnline.com: \"It ends with a strong, long held note, which Asher conceived, executed by Garay with a slow riding of the level on the string faders during the final mix.\"<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\"/>\n\n[[Capitol Records]] was unsure whether to release \"You're No Good\" or \"[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]\" as the lead single off ''Heart Like a Wheel'', only deciding to release \"You're No Good\" a week after the album's release.\n\nLinda Ronstadt's version of \"You're No Good\" became the song's most successful cover. The track ascended to number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart dated February 15, 1975. \"You're No Good\" was also an international hit for Ronstadt, reaching number 15 in Australia, number 17 in the Netherlands, and number 24 in New Zealand. The B-side of \"You're No Good\", \"I Can't Help It <small>(If I'm Still in Love with You)</small>, originally sung by [[Hank Williams]], also charted and was simultaneously a number 2 [[Hot Country Songs|C&W]] hit for Ronstadt. \"When Will I Be Loved\" was then issued as the follow-up single.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 November 1974, p.32</ref>\n\nBuoyed in part by the success of \"You're No Good\", the album ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'', which was released in late 1974, was a major success, and eventually went [[double platinum]]. It was also nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].\n\nThe success of \"You're No Good\" set a precedent for Ronstadt's single releases which over the next five years would virtually all be remakes of classic rock and roll songs.\n\nIn a 1983 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ronstadt expressed reservations about the recordings she had made during her 1970s heyday, specifically citing \"You're No Good\": \"I thought the production on 'You're No Good' was very good but [that] I didn't sing it very well.

She first included it in her setlist while opening for [[Neil Young]]. Ronstadt gave an early televised performance of \"You're No Good\" on an episode of ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' which was broadcast December 21, 1973.\n\nRonstadt recorded her album ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'' with producer [[Peter Asher]] in the summer of 1974 at [[the Sound Factory]]; \"You're No Good\" was a last-minute choice for recording, and while the song was Ronstadt's suggestion, Asher recalls: \"It was an odd coincidence. She\u2019d been doing the song already, and it was always a favorite song of mine...the version I fell in love with [being by] the Swinging Blue Jeans\".<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/classic-tracks/classic-track-you-re-no-good-linda-ronstadt/387624A| title=Classic Track: You're No Good| publisher=MixOnline.com| accessdate=25 June 2015}}</ref> The original backing track intended for Ronstadt's version of \"You're No Good\" was recorded July 1, 1974. According to Bob Warford, a guitarist in Ronstadt's touring band who played on the July 1 track, \"They were trying to do an R&B version of the song, which was actually closer to the way we did it live than to the released version. We played it at a faster tempo live, which we did on that recording [ie. of July 1].\"<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\"/> Ronstadt vetoed the July 1 arrangement; she recalls: \"It was just the wrong groove for me. I don\u2019t think I knew how to phrase around [the players], certainly no fault of theirs. They were fantastic.\"<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\"/>\n\nThe final recording of the Ronstadt version of \"You're No Good\" was made July 5, 1974. Ronstadt would recall: \"Ed Black, who played six-string guitar and pedal steel, started to play a rhythm riff on his [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]]. Kenny Edwards...the bass player...echoed the riff in octaves. [[Andrew Gold]] added a sparse drum track, giving me a basic track to sing over. We did a few takes, picked one we liked, and then Andrew, who always played guitars and keyboards went to work with Peter [Asher]and began to work up layers of guitar, piano and percussion tracks.\" Ronstadt recalls that during a playback after several hours of work, [[Val Garay]], the engineer, accidentally erased Andrew Gold's guitar solo from the track, necessitating Asher and Gold's reconstructing that solo from scratch.<ref>{{cite book\n| first=Linda\n| last=Ronstadt\n| year=2013\n| title=Simple Dreams: a musical memoir\n| edition=1st hardcover\n| publisher=Simon & Schuster\n| location= New York\n| pages=96\u201397\n| isbn=978-1-4516-6872-8}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 1974 a string arrangement - by [[Gregory Rose (musician)|Gregory Rose]] - was added to the track at [[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios]]. According to a ''Classic Tracks'' article by Mick Hurwitz at MixOnline.com: \"It ends with a strong, long held note, which Asher conceived, executed by Garay with a slow riding of the level on the string faders during the final mix.\"<ref name=\"Classic Tracks\"/>\n\n[[Capitol Records]] was unsure whether to release \"You're No Good\" or \"[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]\" as the lead single off ''Heart Like a Wheel'', only deciding to release \"You're No Good\" a week after the album's release.\n\nLinda Ronstadt's version of \"You're No Good\" became the song's most successful cover. The track ascended to number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart dated February 15, 1975. \"You're No Good\" was also an international hit for Ronstadt, reaching number 15 in Australia, number 17 in the Netherlands, and number 24 in New Zealand. The B-side of \"You're No Good\", \"I Can't Help It <small>(If I'm Still in Love with You)</small>, originally sung by [[Hank Williams]], also charted and was simultaneously a number 2 [[Hot Country Songs|C&W]] hit for Ronstadt. \"When Will I Be Loved\" was then issued as the follow-up single.<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', 15 November 1974, p.32</ref>\n\nBuoyed in part by the success of \"You're No Good\", the album ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'', which was released in late 1974, was a major success, and eventually went [[double platinum]]. It was also nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].\n\nThe success of \"You're No Good\" set a precedent for Ronstadt's single releases which over the next five years would virtually all be remakes of classic rock and roll songs.\n\nIn a 1983 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Ronstadt expressed reservations about the recordings she had made during her 1970s heyday, specifically citing \"You're No Good\": \"I thought the production on 'You're No Good' was very good but [that] I didn't sing it very well. As a song it was just an afterthought. It's not the kind of song I got a lot of satisfaction out of singing.\"<ref>\"Ronstadt Marching to a Different Drum\", ''The Deseret News'', 14 December 1993 p. 4-SO</ref>\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-begin|width=67%}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1974\u201375)\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[ARIA Charts|Australia]] \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|15\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] Top Singles \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|7\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[RPM (magazine)|Canada]] Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.3925&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.3925.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.3925 |title=Image : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada |website=Bac-lac.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-08-18}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Dutch Top 40|Netherlands]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n{{singlechart|New Zealand|24|artist=Linda Ronstadt|song=You're No Good|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Linda Ronstadt|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|10|artist=Linda Ronstadt|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}\n|-\n|US ''[[Cash Box]]'' Top 100<ref>{{cite web|url=http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19750215.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426115818/http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19750215.html |archivedate=2016-04-26 }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1975)\n!
