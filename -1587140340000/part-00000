This point is located in the north of the [[Indian subcontinent]], although the precise location has never been calculated and is constantly shifting due to changes in the distribution of the human population across the planet.\n\n===Longest lines between two points===\n\n====Along constant latitude====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n* The '''longest continuous east\u2013west distance on land''' is {{cvt|10726|km}} along the latitude 48\u00b024'53\"N, from the west coast of France ({{Coord|48|24|53|N|4|47|44|W}}) through [[Central Europe]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]] and [[China]], to a point on the east coast of Russia ({{Coord|48|24|53|N|140|6|3|E}}).\n* The '''longest continuous east\u2013west distance at sea''' is {{cvt|22471|km}} along the latitude 55\u00b059'S, south of [[Cape Horn]], [[South America]].\n** The '''longest continuous east\u2013west distance at sea between two continents''' is {{cvt|15409|km}} along the latitude 18\u00b039'12\"N, from the coast of [[Hainan]], China ({{Coord|18|39|12|N|110|15|9|E}}) across the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the coast of [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Mexico]] ({{Coord|18|39|12|N|103|42|6|W}}).\n\n====Along constant longitude====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n* The '''longest continuous north\u2013south distance on land''' is {{cvt|7590|km}} along the meridian 99\u00b01'30\"E, from the northern tip of Siberia in the Russian Federation ({{Coord|76|13|6|N|99|1|30|E}}), through Mongolia, China, and [[Myanmar]], to a point on the south coast of [[Thailand]] ({{Coord|7|53|24|N|99|1|30|E}}).\n** The longest in Africa is {{cvt|7417|km}} along the meridian 20\u00b012'E, from the north coast of [[Libya]] ({{Coord|32|19|0|N|20|12|0|E}}), through [[Chad]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[Botswana]], to the south coast of [[South Africa]] ({{Coord|34|41|30|S|20|12|0|E}}).\n** The longest in South America is {{cvt|7098|km}} along the meridian 70\u00b02'W, from the north coast of [[Venezuela]] ({{Coord|11|30|30|N|70|2|0|W}}), through [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]], to the southern tip of [[Argentina]] ({{Coord|52|33|30|S|70|2|0|W}}).\n** The longest in North America is {{cvt|5813|km}} along the meridian 97\u00b052'30\"W, from northern [[Canada]] ({{Coord|68|21|0|N|97|52|30|W}}), through the [[United States]], to southern Mexico ({{Coord|16|1|0|N|97|52|30|W}}).\n* The '''longest continuous north\u2013south distance at sea''' is {{cvt|15986|km}} along the meridian 34\u00b045'45\"W, from the coast of Eastern Greenland ({{Coord|66|23|45|N|34|45|45|W}}) across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf]], on the coast of Antarctica ({{Coord|77|37|0|S|34|45|45|W}}).

The mating of two munchkin parents, Mm x Mm, have the chance of producing these offspring: 25% MM- a nonviable kitten,  50% Mm-short-legged, 25% mm- normal.

Kittens bearing one munchkin gene and one normal gene ('''Mm''') will be short-legged munchkins. Kittens bearing two normal genes ('''mm''') will be normal.

As of 1921, all major treaties with foreign states had to be approved by the Riksdag, and the two chambers of the Riksdag now elected their own [[speaker (politics)|Speakers]] along with two deputy speakers each.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|Results of the 1921 Swedish general election}}\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:right\n!Party\n!Votes\n!%\n!Seats\n!+/\u2013\n|-\n|align=left|[[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]]||630,855||36.2||93||+18\n|-\n|align=left|[[Moderate Party|General Electoral League]]||449,302||25.8||62||\u20139\n|-\n|align=left|[[Free-minded National Association]]||325,608||18.7||41||\u20136\n|-\n|align=left|[[Centre Party (Sweden)|Farmers' League]]||192,269||11.0||21||\u20139\n|-\n|align=left|[[Left Party (Sweden)|Communist Party of Sweden|Communist Party]]||80,355||4.6||7||0\n|-\n|align=left|[[Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden (1921)|Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden|Social Democratic Left Party]]||56,241||3.2||6||New\n|-\n|align=left|Other parties||7,322||0.4||0||0\n|-\n|align=left|Invalid/blank votes||5,601||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left|'''Total'''||'''1,747,553'''||'''100'''||'''230'''||'''0'''\n|-\n|align=left|Registered voters/turnout||3,222,917||54.2||\u2013||\u2013\n|-\n|align=left colspan=5|Source: Nohlen & St\u00f6ver\n|}\n{{Bar box\n|title=Popular vote\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=600px\n|barwidth=350px\n|bars=\n{{Bar percent|S|{{Swedish Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}|36.22}}\n{{Bar percent|AV|{{Moderate Party/meta/color}}|25.79}}\n{{Bar percent|FL|{{Liberals (Sweden)/meta/color}}|18.69}}\n{{Bar percent|B|{{Centre Party (Sweden)/meta/color}}|11.04}}\n{{Bar percent|SKP|{{Left Party (Sweden)/meta/color}}|4.61}}\n{{Bar percent|SSV|#E53333|3.23}}\n{{Bar percent|Others|{{Other/meta/color}}|0.42}}\n}}\n{{Bar box\n|title=Parliament seats\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|width=600px\n|barwidth=350px\n|bars=\n{{Bar percent|S|{{Swedish Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}|40.43}}\n{{Bar percent|AV|{{Moderate Party/meta/color}}|26.96}}\n{{Bar percent|FL|{{Liberals (Sweden)/meta/color}}|17.83}}\n{{Bar percent|B|{{Centre Party (Sweden)/meta/color}}|9.13}}\n{{Bar percent|SKP|{{Left Party (Sweden)/meta/color}}|3.04}}\n{{Bar percent|SSV|#E53333|2.61}}\n}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs a result of the election Prime Minister [[Oscar von Sydow]] resigned and was replaced by [[Hjalmar Branting]] who also became [[Foreign Minister of Sweden]] .\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'', (''Owl edition''), 2nd ed., Stockholm : Nordisk familjeboks f\u00f6rlags aktiebolag, 1904-1926 {{in lang|sv}}\n\n{{Swedish elections}}\n\n[[Category:General elections in Sweden|1921]]\n[[Category:1921 elections in Europe]]\n[[Category:1921 in Sweden]]\n[[Category:September 1921 events]]\n", "name_user": "Glottran", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eResults", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1921_Swedish_general_election"}

Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks|Franks]] in 462. During the [[Middle Ages]] the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and western Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the [[Hanseatic League]] and one of the largest cities north of the [[Alps]] in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to [[World War II]], the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918\u20131926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) dropping {{convert|34,711|long ton|tonne|abbr= off}} of [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|bombs on the city]].<ref>\n{{cite web|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|title= bomber command \u2013 mines laid \u2013 flight august \u2013 1945 \u2013 1571 \u2013 Flight Archive|publisher= }}\n</ref>\nThe bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city. With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.\n\nCologne is a major cultural centre for the [[Rhineland]]; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The [[Cologne Trade Fair]] hosts a number of [[trade show]]s such as [[Art Cologne]], [[imm Cologne]], [[Gamescom]], and the [[Photokina]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cologne|Timeline of Cologne}}\n\n===Roman Cologne===\n[[File:Wall painting with Dionysian scenes from a luxurious Roman villa excavated to the south of the cathedral, Romisch-Germanisches Museum, Cologne (8119154487).jpg|thumb|Fresco with [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysian scenes]] from a Roman villa of Cologne, [[Germany]] (site of the ancient city [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]), 3rd century AD, [[Romano-Germanic Museum]]]]\nThe first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', founded in 38&nbsp;BC by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germani cisrhenani|Cisrhenian]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]].

In 310, under emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/> Cologne is shown on the [[4th century]] [[Peutinger Map]].\n\nMaternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opened in 1890.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nEarly medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]]. In 716, [[Charles Martel]] commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when [[Chilperic II]], King of [[Neustria]], invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the [[Battle of Cologne]]. Charles fled to the [[Eifel]] mountains, rallied supporters, and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the [[Battle of Ambl\u00e8ve]]. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/> In the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]] Cologne fell into the dominion of [[Lothair I]]'s [[Middle Francia]]\u2014later called [[Lotharingia]] ([[Lower Lorraine]]).\n\nIn 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]]. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of [[J\u00fclich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced to reside in [[Bonn]].<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Harry de Quetteville. \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.</ref> The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the \"Greve\". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBesides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, [[Rainald of Dassel]], gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they, in fact, had been taken from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.</ref>\n\nCologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west as well as the main south\u2013north Western Europe trade route, Northern Italy to Flanders. The intersection of these trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000\u201355,000.<ref>''The Population of European Cities'', Bairoch</ref> Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/>\n\n[[File:Cologn1411.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|Cologne around 1411]]\n\n===Early modern history===\nThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.\n\nAs a free city, Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (\"Reichskontingent\") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken \u2013 K\u00f6lsche Funke rut-wie\u00df vun 1823 e.V. \u2013 Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe free city of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Archbishopric of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were drawn from the [[Bavaria]] [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Br\u00fchl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Br\u00fchl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n===From the 19th century until World War II===\n\n[[File:H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke - K\u00f6ln (1).tif|thumb|H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke]]\nCologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|D\u00e9partement]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].\n\nThe permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.\n\nCologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[https://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254&id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung K\u00f6ln |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.\n\nDuring [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 15 February 1926</ref>\nIn contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.\n\nAs part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u201333), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at M\u00fcngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].\n\nThe democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919\u20131933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]\nDuring World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Milit\u00e4rbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[M\u00fcnster]].

With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became\u2013and still is\u2013home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.\n\nIn 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the \"world's greatest heap of rubble\". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt'' (\"North-South-Drive\"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.\n\nThe destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the G\u00fcrzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.\n\nIn 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&nbsp;million again.\n[[File:2013-08-10 07-18-55 Ballonfahrt \u00fcber K\u00f6ln EH 0626.jpg|thumb|left|Cologne in 2013]]\n\n===Post-reunification===\n[[File:1983 09 15 to 23 Envelope of the Letter from Odessa to Cuba.jpg|thumb|Soviet letter's envelope in honor of the Internationale Philatelic Exhibition ''LUPOSTA'' in Cologne in 1983.]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the ''K\u00f6lnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.\n\nDue to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005.

This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a \"waste scandal\" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.\n\n===Mayor===\nThe Lord Mayor of Cologne is [[Henriette Reker]].

The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ay8mnbMwYesC&pg=PT35&lpg=PT35&dq=The+inner+city+of+Cologne+was+completely+destroyed+during+World+War+II.+The+reconstruction+of+the+city+followed+the+style+of+the+1950s,+while+respecting+the+old+layout+and+naming+of+the+streets.+Thus,+the+city+today+is+characterized+by+simple+and+modest+post-war+buildings,+with+a+few+interspersed+pre-war+buildings+which+were+reconstructed+due+to+their+historical+importance.+Some+buildings+of+the+%22Wiederaufbauzeit%22+(era+of+reconstruction),+for+example,+the+opera+house+by+Wilhelm+Riphahn,+are+nowadays+regarded+as+classics+of+modern+architecture.&source=bl&ots=ofJlT_fW3J&sig=ZW8uf284rvWeNz3zMy5GV3sjXY0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1_e-TiNvaAhVKr1QKHV-CDDMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20inner%20city%20of%20Cologne%20was%20completely%20destroyed%20during%20World%20War%20II.%20The%20reconstruction%20of%20the%20city%20followed%20the%20style%20of%20the%201950s%2C%20while%20respecting%20the%20old%20layout%20and%20naming%20of%20the%20streets.%20Thus%2C%20the%20city%20today%20is%20characterized%20by%20simple%20and%20modest%20post-war%20buildings%2C%20with%20a%20few%20interspersed%20pre-war%20buildings%20which%20were%20reconstructed%20due%20to%20their%20historical%20importance.%20Some%20buildings%20of%20the%20%22Wiederaufbauzeit%22%20(era%20of%20reconstruction)%2C%20for%20example%2C%20the%20opera%20house%20by%20Wilhelm%20Riphahn%2C%20are%20nowadays%20regarded%20as%20classics%20of%20modern%20architecture.&f=false|title=Heidi Klum & Seal The truth about the divorce|last=Hombach|first=Jean-Pierre|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4716-2190-1|location=|pages=31|language=en}}</ref> Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.\n\nGreen areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately {{convert|75|m2|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=K\u00f6lnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. [[Pigeon]]s are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of [[Feral organism|feral]] exotics, most visibly [[parrots]] such as the [[rose-ringed parakeet]]. The sheltered climate in southeast [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green [[parrots]] is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.<ref>{{cite web|title=In NRW behaupten sich immer mehr exotische V\u00f6gel|url=http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|publisher=RP Online|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\nCologne had 5.8&nbsp;million overnight stays booked and 3.35&nbsp;million arrivals in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cologne-tourism.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release/article/tourism-results-for-2016-moderate-decrease-in-visitor-numbers-due-to-difficult-general-conditions.html |title=Tourism results for 2016: Moderate decrease in visitor numbers due to difficult general conditions |publisher=K\u00f6lnTourismus |date=21 February 2017 |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany.<ref name=\"Nightlife\">{{cite web|title=Nightlife|url=http://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/nightlife|publisher=K\u00f6lnTourismus|accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The city has 70 clubs, \"countless\" bars, restaurants, and pubs.<ref name=\"Nightlife\"/>\n\n===Landmarks===\n\n====Churches====\n* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''K\u00f6lner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most loved landmark.

In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], which supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des K\u00f6lner Doms &#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as \"the eternal construction site\" (''die ewige Baustelle'').\n* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.&nbsp;Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard.

The [[Museum Schn\u00fctgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]].\nMany art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. [[Galerie Karsten Greve]], one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.\n\nSeveral orchestras are active in the city, among them the [[G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra]], which is also the orchestra of the [[Cologne Opera]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]] (''German State Radio Orchestra''), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building ([[K\u00f6lner Philharmonic|K\u00f6lner Philharmonie]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=K\u00f6lner Philharmonie |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archivedate = 11 December 2007}}</ref> Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua K\u00f6ln]] and the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester K\u00f6ln]], and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor K\u00f6ln]]. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio f\u00fcr elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Lat\u00e4ng'' (the student quarter around the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.\n\n[[File:Water feature in Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|Water feature in Cologne, Germany, summer of 2017.]]The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].\n\nCologne is well known for its beer, called [[K\u00f6lsch (beer)|K\u00f6lsch]]. [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of K\u00f6lsch being the only language one can drink.\n\nCologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''K\u00f6lnisch Wasser''; lit: \"Water of Cologne\"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm M\u00fclhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and M\u00fchlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand M\u00fclhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegen\u00fcber dem J\u00fclichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[M\u00e4urer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.\n\n===Carnival===\nThe [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called \"Tolle Tage\" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival.

The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstra\u00dfe (\"Federal Road\") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobr\u00fccke'' (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this, the ''Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt'' (\"North-South-Drive\") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.\n\nIn 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.\n\n===Cycling===\n[[File:4517Bensberg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] at [[Bensberg (KVB)|Bensberg station]]]]\n[[File:146 019-5 Rheinexpressinkoelnhbf.jpg|thumb|right|Train at [[K\u00f6ln Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very [[bicycle-friendly]].

During the [[Middle Ages]] the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and western Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the [[Hanseatic League]] and one of the largest cities north of the [[Alps]] in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to [[World War II]], the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918\u20131926).

With the intention of restoring as many historic buildings as possible, the successful postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.\n\nCologne is a major cultural centre for the [[Rhineland]]; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture.

In 310, under emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/> Cologne is shown on the [[4th century]] [[Peutinger Map]].\n\nMaternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opened in 1890.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nEarly medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]]. In 716, [[Charles Martel]] commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when [[Chilperic II]], King of [[Neustria]], invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the [[Battle of Cologne]]. Charles fled to the [[Eifel]] mountains, rallied supporters, and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the [[Battle of Ambl\u00e8ve]]. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/> In the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]] Cologne fell into the dominion of [[Lothair I]]'s [[Middle Francia]]\u2014later called [[Lotharingia]] ([[Lower Lorraine]]).\n\nIn 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]]. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of [[J\u00fclich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced to reside in [[Bonn]].<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Harry de Quetteville. \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.</ref> The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the \"Greve\". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBesides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, [[Rainald of Dassel]], gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they, in fact, had been taken from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P.

The intersection of these trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000\u201355,000.<ref>''The Population of European Cities'', Bairoch</ref> Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/>\n\n[[File:Cologn1411.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|Cologne around 1411]]\n\n===Early modern history===\nThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.\n\nAs a free city, Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (\"Reichskontingent\") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken \u2013 K\u00f6lsche Funke rut-wie\u00df vun 1823 e.V. \u2013 Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe free city of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Archbishopric of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were drawn from the [[Bavaria]] [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Br\u00fchl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Br\u00fchl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n===From the 19th century until World War II===\n\n[[File:H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke - K\u00f6ln (1).tif|thumb|H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke]]\nCologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|D\u00e9partement]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].\n\nThe permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.\n\nCologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[https://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254&id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung K\u00f6ln |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.\n\nDuring [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 15 February 1926</ref>\nIn contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.\n\nAs part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u201333), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at M\u00fcngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].\n\nThe democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919\u20131933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]\nDuring World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Milit\u00e4rbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[M\u00fcnster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[J\u00fclich]], [[D\u00fcren]], and [[Monschau]].

With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became\u2013and still is\u2013home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.\n\nIn 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the \"world's greatest heap of rubble\". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt'' (\"North-South-Drive\"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.\n\nThe destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the G\u00fcrzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.\n\nIn 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&nbsp;million again.\n[[File:2013-08-10 07-18-55 Ballonfahrt \u00fcber K\u00f6ln EH 0626.jpg|thumb|left|Cologne in 2013]]\n\n===Post-reunification===\n[[File:1983 09 15 to 23 Envelope of the Letter from Odessa to Cuba.jpg|thumb|Soviet letter's envelope in honor of the Internationale Philatelic Exhibition ''LUPOSTA'' in Cologne in 1983.]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the ''K\u00f6lnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.\n\nDue to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to [[Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.\n\nCologne was the focus of the 2015 [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany|New Year's Eve sexual assaults]], with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne|title=Tensions rise in Germany over handling of mass sexual assaults in Cologne|last=Connolly|first=Kate| newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"waz2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/politik/1075-anzeigen-nach-koelner-silvesternacht-73-verdaechtige-id11567004.html|title=1075 Anzeigen nach K\u00f6lner Silvesternacht \u2013 73 Verd\u00e4chtige|trans-title=1,075 assaults by Cologne New Year's Eve \u2013 73 suspects|work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=German|accessdate=15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe metropolitan area encompasses over {{convert|405|km2|0|abbr=off}}, extending around a central point that lies at 50\u00b0 56' 33 latitude and 6\u00b0 57' 32 longitude.

The [[Museum Schn\u00fctgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]].\nMany art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. [[Galerie Karsten Greve]], one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.\n\nSeveral orchestras are active in the city, among them the [[G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra]], which is also the orchestra of the [[Cologne Opera]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]] (''German State Radio Orchestra''), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building ([[K\u00f6lner Philharmonic|K\u00f6lner Philharmonie]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=K\u00f6lner Philharmonie |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 December 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archivedate = 11 December 2007}}</ref> Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua K\u00f6ln]] and the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester K\u00f6ln]], and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor K\u00f6ln]]. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio f\u00fcr elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Lat\u00e4ng'' (the student quarter around the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.\n\n[[File:Water feature in Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|Water feature in Cologne, Germany, summer of 2017.]]The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].\n\nCologne is well known for its beer, called [[K\u00f6lsch (beer)|K\u00f6lsch]]. [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of K\u00f6lsch being the only language one can drink.\n\nCologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''K\u00f6lnisch Wasser''; lit: \"Water of Cologne\"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm M\u00fclhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and M\u00fchlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand M\u00fclhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegen\u00fcber dem J\u00fclichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[M\u00e4urer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.\n\n===Carnival===\nThe [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called \"Tolle Tage\" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Z\u00fclpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archivedate=25 January 2008 |title=Carnival \u2013 Cologne's \"fifth season\" \u2013 Cologne Sights & Events \u2013 Stadt K\u00f6ln |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Rivalry with D\u00fcsseldorf===\nCologne and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] have a \"fierce regional rivalry\",<ref name=\"Rivalry\">{{cite news|title=Giving Beer A Home in the Rhineland|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20110728-36597.html|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Local]]|date=28 July 2011}}</ref> which includes [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|carnival]] parades, [[Association football|football]], and beer.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> People in Cologne prefer [[K\u00f6lsch (beer)|K\u00f6lsch]] while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer [[Altbier]] (\"Alt\").<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne or K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> The rivalry has been described as a \"love\u2013hate relationship\".<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/>\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Museum Ludwig K\u00f6ln - S\u00fcdeingang - Schriftzug.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]].]]\n[[File:Dionysusmoza\u00efek 17-02-2009 10-51-23.JPG|thumb|Roman [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] in Cologne: [[Dionysus]] Mosaic on display at [[R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Museum]]]]\n\n{{Main|List of museums in Cologne}}\n* [[Fragrance Museum|Farina Fragrance Museum]] \u2013 birthplace of [[Eau de Cologne]]\n* [[R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Museum]] (Roman-Germanic Museum) \u2013 ancient Roman and Germanic culture\n* [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] \u2013 European painting from the 13th to the early 20th century\n* [[Museum Ludwig]] \u2013 modern art\n* [[Museum Schn\u00fctgen]] \u2013 medieval art\n* [[Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst (Cologne)|Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst]] \u2013 [[applied art]]\n* [[Kolumba|Kolumba Kunstmuseum des Erzbistums K\u00f6ln]] ([[art museum]] of the Archbishopric of Cologne) \u2013 modern art museum built around medieval ruins of [[St. Kolumba, Cologne]], completed 2007\n* Cathedral Treasury \"Domschatzkammer\" \u2013 historic underground vaults of the Cathedral\n* [[EL-DE Haus]] \u2013 former local headquarters of the [[Gestapo]] houses a museum documenting [[Nazi]] rule in Cologne with a special focus on the persecution of political dissenters and minorities\n* German Sports and Olympic Museum \u2013 exhibitions about sports from antiquity until the present\n* [[Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum]] \u2013 Chocolate Museum\n* Geomuseum of the University of Cologne \u2013 the exhibition includes fossils (such as [[dinosaur]] bones and the skeleton of an [[Eryops]]), [[stones]] and [[minerals]]\n* Forum for Internet Technology in Contemporary Art \u2013 collections of Internet-based art, corporate part of (NewMediaArtProjectNetwork):cologne, the experimental platform for art and New Media\n* [[Flora und Botanischer Garten K\u00f6ln]] \u2013 the city's formal park and main [[botanical garden]]\n* [[Forstbotanischer Garten K\u00f6ln]] \u2013 an [[arboretum]] and woodland [[botanical garden]]\n\n===Music fairs and festivals===\nThe city was home to the internationally famous [[Ringfest]], and now to the C/o pop festival.<ref name=\"C/o pop\"> {{cite web\n| url=http://www.c-o-pop.de/home.4.en.html\n| title=C/o Pop Official Website\n| publisher=\n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Cologne enjoys a thriving Christmas Market (''Weihnachtsmarkt'') presence with several locations in the city.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Koelnmesse Nordeingang.jpg|thumb|North entrance to [[Koelnmesse]], 2008]]\n[[File:Rheinauhafen - The Bench - Rheinseite (1828-30).jpg|thumb|Modern office building at [[Rheinauhafen]]]]\nAs the largest city in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan region, Cologne benefits from a large [[market structure]].<ref>[http://www.stadt-koeln.de/mediaasset/content/pdf80/cbg_2009_bfrei_deutsch.pdf stadt-koeln.de ''Cologne Business Guide''] {{in lang|de|en}}</ref> In competition with [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the economy of Cologne is primarily based on [[Insurance industry|insurance]] and [[media industry|media industries]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125964/Cologne/61370/Economy|title=Cologne|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> while the city is also an important cultural and research centre and home to a number of [[corporate headquarters]].\n\nAmong the largest media companies based in Cologne are [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], [[RTL Television]] (with subsidiaries), [[n-tv]], [[Deutschlandradio]], [[Brainpool TV]] and publishing houses like J.&nbsp;P.

The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstra\u00dfe (\"Federal Road\") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobr\u00fccke'' (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this, the ''Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt'' (\"North-South-Drive\") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.\n\nIn 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.\n\n===Cycling===\n[[File:4517Bensberg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] at [[Bensberg (KVB)|Bensberg station]]]]\n[[File:146 019-5 Rheinexpressinkoelnhbf.jpg|thumb|right|Train at [[K\u00f6ln Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very [[bicycle-friendly]].

There are two important protected areas in the region that are home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Animals such as [[yaks]] and [[dzo]]s roam across the wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a decrease in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the [[Tibetan antelope]], [[argali]], [[kiang]]s, [[musk deer]], and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, the locals of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.\n\nApart from the exotic wildlife, the Valley of Spiti is also known for its wealth of flora and the profusion of wild flowers. Some of the most common species found here include ''Causinia thomsonii'', ''Seseli trilobum'', ''Crepis flexuosa'', ''Caragana brevifolia'' and ''Krascheninikovia ceratoides''. Then there are more than 62 species of medicinal plants found here.\n\n== People ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}{{historical populations|11=1901|12=12,392|13=1911|14=12,981|15=1921|16=12,836|17=1931|18=13,733|19=1941|20=14,594|21=1951|22=15,338|23=1961|24=23,682|25=1971|26=27,568|27=1981|28=32,100|29=1991|30=31,294|31=2001|32=33,224|33=2011|34=31,564|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}[[File:Gandhala- mother & child 28-6-04.jpg|thumb|left|180 px|Mother and child near [[Gandhola Monastery]], 2004]]\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Lahaul and Spiti district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 31,564.

Generally, the Lahaulis are of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], while the Spiti [[Bhot]] are more similar to the Tibetans, owing to their proximity to Tibet. The district has a Himachal Pradesh state legislative law in place to curb antique loot, by suspecting travellers given past incidences. In pre-independence era, the ethnic tribal belt was into the British lahaul and the chamba lahaul, which was merged with Punjab post 1947. This is the second largest district in the Indian union.\n\nThe language spoken by both the Lahauli and Spiti is [[Spiti Bhoti]], a [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] language of the [[Lahuli\u2013Spiti languages|Western Innovative subgroup]]. They are very similar to the [[Ladakh]]i and [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] culturally, as they had been placed under the rule of the [[Guge]] and [[Ladakh]] kingdoms at occasional intervals.\n\nAmong the Lahaulis, the family acts as the basic unit of kinship. The extended family system is common, evolved from the [[polyandry|polyandric]] system of the past. The family is headed by a senior male member, known as the Yunda, while his wife, known as the Yundamo, attains authority by being the oldest member in the generation. The [[clan]] system, also known as Rhus, plays another major role in the Lahauli society.\n\nThe Spiti [[Bhot]] community has an inheritance system that is otherwise unique to the Tibetans. Upon the death of both parents, only the eldest son will inherit the family property, while the eldest daughter inherits the mother's jewellery, and the younger siblings inherit nothing. Men usually fall back on the social security system of the [[Himalayas|Trans-Himalayan]] Gompas.\n\n=== Lifestyle ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nThe lifestyles of the Lahauli and Spiti Bhot are similar, owing to their proximity. [[Polyandry]] was widely practiced by the Lahaulis in the past, although this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot do not generally practice polyandry any more, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions.\n\nDivorces are accomplished by a simple ceremony performed in the presence of village elders. Divorce can be sought by either partner. The husband has to pay compensation to his ex-wife if she does not remarry. However, this is uncommon among the Lahaulis.\n\nAgriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato farming is common. Occupations include animal husbandry, working in government programs, government services, and other businesses and crafts that include weaving. Houses are constructed in the Tibetan architectural style, as the land in Lahul and Spiti is mountainous and quite prone to earthquakes. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lahaulspititravel.com/references/|title=References - Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|work=Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Ki-Gompa Spiti.jpg|right|thumb|[[Key Monastery|Ki-Gompa]], [[Spiti]]]]\n\nMost of the Lahaulis follow a combination of [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Gelugpa]] order. Within Lahoul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul towards Ladhakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti. This bas-relief, of marble, depicts the Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of the Buddha's compassion) in a stylized seated position; Hindu devotees take it to be Shiva Nataraj, Shiva dancing. This image appears to be of sixteenth-century Chamba craftsmanship. It was created to replace the original black stone image of the deity, which became damaged by art looters. This original image is kept beneath the plinth of the shrine. It appears to be of 12th century Kashmiri provenance. Much of the art thieves are active in this remote belt because of neglected gompas and temples. Raja Ghepan, one of the major deities is greatly worshipped by almost all Lahauli.\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Lahaul and Spiti\n| titlebar = #Fcd116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|gold|62.01}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|orange|36.91}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christians|Christian]]|dodgerblue|0.67}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.41}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br />\n\u2020{{small|Includes [[Muslim]]s (0.23%).}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |title=Census of India: District Profile |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113144353/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\nBefore the spread of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the people were adherents of the religion 'Lung Pe Chhoi', an animistic religion that had some affinities with the [[B\u00f6n]] religion of [[Tibet]].  While the religion flourished, animal and human sacrifices were regularly offered up to the 'Iha', a term that refers to evil spirits residing in the natural world, notably in the old pencil-cedar trees, rocks, and caves. Vestiges of the Lung Pe Chhoi religion can be seen in the behaviour of the [[Lama]]s, who are believed to possess certain supernatural powers.\n\nThe [[Losar]] festival (also known as Halda in Lahauli) is celebrated between the months of January and February. The date of celebration is decided by the [[Lama]]s. It has the same significance as the [[Diwali]] festival of [[Hinduism]], but is celebrated in a Tibetan fashion.\n\nAt the start of the festival, two or three persons from every household will come holding burning incense. The burning sticks are then piled into a bonfire. The people will then pray to Shiskar Apa, the goddess of wealth (other name [[Vasudhara]]) in the Buddhist religion.\n\n== Tourism ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Ki gompa-3.jpg|thumb|[[Key Monastery]], is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery located on top of a hill at an altitude of {{Convert|4166|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Sarina Singh|display-authors=etal|year=2007|title=??correct title??

This monastery rose to prominence when it celebrated its thousandth year of existence in 1996. It houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist statues and [[Thangka]]s. The ancient gompa is finished with mud plaster, and contains several scriptures and documents. Lama Dzangpo heads the gompa here. There is a modern guest house with a dining hall and all facilities are available.\n\nAnother gompa, [[Kardang Monastery]], is located at an elevation of 3,500 metres across the river, about 8&nbsp;km from [[Keylong]]. Kardang is well connected by the road via the Tandi bridge which is about 14&nbsp;km from Keylong.  Built in the 12th century, this monastery houses a large library of Buddhist literature including the main [[Kangyur]] and [[Tangyur]] scriptures.\n\nThe treacherous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors to tour only between the months of June to October, when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from [[Kinnaur]] (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.\n\n=== Buddhist monasteries ===\nSpiti is one of the important centers of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh. It is popularly known as the 'land of lamas'. The valley is dotted by numerous Buddhist Monasteries or Gompas.\n\n'''Kye Monastery:'''\n[[Kye Monastery]] is one of the main learning centres of Buddhist studies in Spiti. The monastery is house to some 100 odd monks who receive education here. It is the oldest and biggest monastery in Spiti. It houses rare paintings and scriptures of Buddha and other gods and goddess. There are also rare 'Thangka' paintings and ancient musical instruments 'trumpets, cymbals, and drums in the monastery.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Tabo Monastery:'''\nPerched at an altitude of 3050 meters, Tabo Monastery is often referred to as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas'. The 10th century Tabo Monastery was founded by the great scholar, Richen Zangpo. The monastery houses more than 60 lamas and contains the rare collection of scriptures, pieces of art, wall paintings -Thankas and Stucco.\n\n=== Adventure activities ===\n\n'''To-do-Trails:'''\nFor trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, offering challenging treks to explore the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks take people to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also where you have to cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name.{{tone-inline|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Skiing:'''\nSkiing is the popular adventure sports in Spiti.\n\n'''Yak Safari:'''\n[[Yak]] can be used to see the flora and fauna of trans-Himalayan desert.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nAerail view of Lahaul valley in winter.JPG|Lahaul Valley in winter\nLahaul Valley,Himachal Pradesh,India.jpg|Waterfall near Udaipur town in Lahaul Valley\nMountain peaks, Lahul.jpg|Mountain peak\nKunzum Pass between Lahaul & Spiti.jpg|[[Kunzum Pass]] between Lahul and Spiti\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of highest towns by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Ciliberto, Jonathan.

This gives it a ranking of 638th in India (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=districtcensus/> The district has a population density of {{convert|2|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}.<ref name=districtcensus/> Its [[Family planning in India|population growth rate]] over the decade 2001-2011 was -5%.<ref name=districtcensus/> Lahul and Spiti has a [[sex ratio]] of 903 [[Women in India|females]] for every 1000 males, and a [[Literacy in India|literacy rate]] of 76.81%.<ref name=districtcensus/>\n\nAt the 2011 census, {{sigfig|40.8757|2}}% of the population in the district had [[Kinnauri language|Kinnauri]] as their first language, {{sigfig|26.5207|2}}% \u2013 [[Pattani language|Pattani]], {{sigfig|2.9876|2}}% \u2013 [[Bhotia language|Bhotia]], {{sigfig|2.8609|2}}% \u2013 [[Hindi]], {{sigfig|2.8197|2}}% \u2013 [[Nepali language|Nepali]], and {{sigfig|2.5504|2}}% \u2013 [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=C-16 Population By Mother Tongue - Himachal Pradesh |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-16/DDW-C16-STMT-MDDS-0200.XLSX |website=censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe language, culture, and populations of Lahaul and Spiti are closely related. Generally, the Lahaulis are of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], while the Spiti [[Bhot]] are more similar to the Tibetans, owing to their proximity to Tibet. The district has a Himachal Pradesh state legislative law in place to curb antique loot, by suspecting travellers given past incidences. In pre-independence era, the ethnic tribal belt was into the British lahaul and the chamba lahaul, which was merged with Punjab post 1947. This is the second largest district in the Indian union.\n\nThe language spoken by both the Lahauli and Spiti is [[Spiti Bhoti]], a [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] language of the [[Lahuli\u2013Spiti languages|Western Innovative subgroup]]. They are very similar to the [[Ladakh]]i and [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] culturally, as they had been placed under the rule of the [[Guge]] and [[Ladakh]] kingdoms at occasional intervals.\n\nAmong the Lahaulis, the family acts as the basic unit of kinship. The extended family system is common, evolved from the [[polyandry|polyandric]] system of the past. The family is headed by a senior male member, known as the Yunda, while his wife, known as the Yundamo, attains authority by being the oldest member in the generation. The [[clan]] system, also known as Rhus, plays another major role in the Lahauli society.\n\nThe Spiti [[Bhot]] community has an inheritance system that is otherwise unique to the Tibetans. Upon the death of both parents, only the eldest son will inherit the family property, while the eldest daughter inherits the mother's jewellery, and the younger siblings inherit nothing. Men usually fall back on the social security system of the [[Himalayas|Trans-Himalayan]] Gompas.\n\n=== Lifestyle ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nThe lifestyles of the Lahauli and Spiti Bhot are similar, owing to their proximity. [[Polyandry]] was widely practiced by the Lahaulis in the past, although this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot do not generally practice polyandry any more, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions.\n\nDivorces are accomplished by a simple ceremony performed in the presence of village elders. Divorce can be sought by either partner. The husband has to pay compensation to his ex-wife if she does not remarry. However, this is uncommon among the Lahaulis.\n\nAgriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato farming is common. Occupations include animal husbandry, working in government programs, government services, and other businesses and crafts that include weaving. Houses are constructed in the Tibetan architectural style, as the land in Lahul and Spiti is mountainous and quite prone to earthquakes. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lahaulspititravel.com/references/|title=References - Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|work=Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Ki-Gompa Spiti.jpg|right|thumb|[[Key Monastery|Ki-Gompa]], [[Spiti]]]]\n\nMost of the Lahaulis follow a combination of [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Gelugpa]] order. Within Lahoul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul towards Ladhakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti. This bas-relief, of marble, depicts the Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of the Buddha's compassion) in a stylized seated position; Hindu devotees take it to be Shiva Nataraj, Shiva dancing. This image appears to be of sixteenth-century Chamba craftsmanship. It was created to replace the original black stone image of the deity, which became damaged by art looters. This original image is kept beneath the plinth of the shrine. It appears to be of 12th century Kashmiri provenance. Much of the art thieves are active in this remote belt because of neglected gompas and temples. Raja Ghepan, one of the major deities is greatly worshipped by almost all Lahauli.\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Lahaul and Spiti\n| titlebar = #Fcd116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|gold|62.01}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|orange|36.91}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christians|Christian]]|dodgerblue|0.67}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.41}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br />\n\u2020{{small|Includes [[Muslim]]s (0.23%).}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |title=Census of India: District Profile |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113144353/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\nBefore the spread of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the people were adherents of the religion 'Lung Pe Chhoi', an animistic religion that had some affinities with the [[B\u00f6n]] religion of [[Tibet]].  While the religion flourished, animal and human sacrifices were regularly offered up to the 'Iha', a term that refers to evil spirits residing in the natural world, notably in the old pencil-cedar trees, rocks, and caves. Vestiges of the Lung Pe Chhoi religion can be seen in the behaviour of the [[Lama]]s, who are believed to possess certain supernatural powers.\n\nThe [[Losar]] festival (also known as Halda in Lahauli) is celebrated between the months of January and February. The date of celebration is decided by the [[Lama]]s. It has the same significance as the [[Diwali]] festival of [[Hinduism]], but is celebrated in a Tibetan fashion.\n\nAt the start of the festival, two or three persons from every household will come holding burning incense. The burning sticks are then piled into a bonfire. The people will then pray to Shiskar Apa, the goddess of wealth (other name [[Vasudhara]]) in the Buddhist religion.\n\n== Tourism ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Ki gompa-3.jpg|thumb|[[Key Monastery]], is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery located on top of a hill at an altitude of {{Convert|4166|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Sarina Singh|display-authors=etal|year=2007|title=??correct title?? Lonely Planet Guide|edition=??|publisher=Lonely Planet|page=343}}</ref>]]\nThe natural scenery and Buddhist monasteries, such as [[Ki Gompa|Kye]], [[Dhankar Gompa|Dhankar]], Shashur, [[Guru Ghantal]], Khungri Monastery in [[Pin Valley]], Tnagyud Gompa of the Sakya Sect in [[Komic]], Sherkhang Gompa in Lahlung (believed to be older than Tabo Monastery), the only Buddhist Mummy of a Monk in Gue around 550 years old and [[Chandra Taal|Chandra Taal Lake]] are the main tourist attractions of the region.\n\nOne of the most interesting places is the [[Tabo Monastery]], located 45&nbsp;km from [[Kaza, Himachal Pradesh]], the capital of the Spiti region. This monastery rose to prominence when it celebrated its thousandth year of existence in 1996. It houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist statues and [[Thangka]]s. The ancient gompa is finished with mud plaster, and contains several scriptures and documents. Lama Dzangpo heads the gompa here. There is a modern guest house with a dining hall and all facilities are available.\n\nAnother gompa, [[Kardang Monastery]], is located at an elevation of 3,500 metres across the river, about 8&nbsp;km from [[Keylong]]. Kardang is well connected by the road via the Tandi bridge which is about 14&nbsp;km from Keylong.  Built in the 12th century, this monastery houses a large library of Buddhist literature including the main [[Kangyur]] and [[Tangyur]] scriptures.\n\nThe treacherous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors to tour only between the months of June to October, when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from [[Kinnaur]] (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.\n\n=== Buddhist monasteries ===\nSpiti is one of the important centers of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh. It is popularly known as the 'land of lamas'. The valley is dotted by numerous Buddhist Monasteries or Gompas.\n\n'''Kye Monastery:'''\n[[Kye Monastery]] is one of the main learning centres of Buddhist studies in Spiti. The monastery is house to some 100 odd monks who receive education here. It is the oldest and biggest monastery in Spiti. It houses rare paintings and scriptures of Buddha and other gods and goddess. There are also rare 'Thangka' paintings and ancient musical instruments 'trumpets, cymbals, and drums in the monastery.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Tabo Monastery:'''\nPerched at an altitude of 3050 meters, Tabo Monastery is often referred to as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas'. The 10th century Tabo Monastery was founded by the great scholar, Richen Zangpo. The monastery houses more than 60 lamas and contains the rare collection of scriptures, pieces of art, wall paintings -Thankas and Stucco.\n\n=== Adventure activities ===\n\n'''To-do-Trails:'''\nFor trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, offering challenging treks to explore the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks take people to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also where you have to cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name.{{tone-inline|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Skiing:'''\nSkiing is the popular adventure sports in Spiti.\n\n'''Yak Safari:'''\n[[Yak]] can be used to see the flora and fauna of trans-Himalayan desert.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nAerail view of Lahaul valley in winter.JPG|Lahaul Valley in winter\nLahaul Valley,Himachal Pradesh,India.jpg|Waterfall near Udaipur town in Lahaul Valley\nMountain peaks, Lahul.jpg|Mountain peak\nKunzum Pass between Lahaul & Spiti.jpg|[[Kunzum Pass]] between Lahul and Spiti\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of highest towns by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Ciliberto, Jonathan.
