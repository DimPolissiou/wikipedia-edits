PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure consisting of a perfluorinated, ''n''-octyl \"tail group\" and a [[carboxylate]] \"head group\". The head group can be described as [[hydrophilic]] while the [[fluorocarbon]] tail is both [[hydrophobic]] and [[lipophobic]]. The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The \"tail\" is hydrophobic due to being [[non-polar]] and lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to the [[London dispersion force]] than [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lemal2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lemal DM|date=January 2004|title=Perspective on fluorocarbon chemistry|journal=J.

PFOA serves as a surfactant in the [[emulsion polymerization]] of [[fluoropolymers]] and as a building block for the synthesis of perfluoroalkyl-substituted compounds, polymers, and polymeric materials.  PFOA has been manufactured since the 1940s in industrial quantities.<ref name=\"Lindstrom\">{{cite journal |last1=Lindstrom |first1=Andrew B. |last2=Strynar |first2=Mark J. |last3=Libelo |first3=E.

A positive exposure-response trend for kidney cancer is supported by many studies. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] (ppb) range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. How general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood. PFOA has been detected in industrial waste, stain-resistant carpets, carpet-cleaning liquids, [[house dust]], [[Popcorn bag|microwave popcorn bags]], water, food, and Teflon ([[PTFE]]) products.\n\nAs a result of a class-action lawsuit and community settlement with [[DuPont]], three [[Epidemiology|epidemiologists]] conducted studies on the population surrounding a chemical plant that was exposed to PFOA at levels greater than in the general population.

Retrospective yearly PFOA serum levels were estimated for each subject from 1952 through 2011.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Vaughn|last2=Winquist|first2=Andrea|last3=Steenland|first3=Kyle|date=November 2013|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults Living Near a Chemical Plant|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=11\u201312|pages=1313\u20131318|doi=10.1289/ehp.1306615|issn=0091-6765|pmc=3855514|pmid=24007715}}</ref>\n\nInitial subject recruitment was performed using eligibility criteria and surveys\u2014subjects were eligible if they lived or worked in one of the six contaminated water districts for at least one year between 1950 and December 3, 2004.

Historical regional data including emission rates by the DuPont facility, temporal patterns and groundwater flow are incorporated in the model as well as individual &nbsp;specific occupational exposure level was included. A job-exposure matrix was developed to assess estimated PFOA levels for workers across times and job roles.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIncident data was self-reported by study participants and followed up with a medical chart review. Cancer diagnoses were verified using Ohio/West Virginia cancer registries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA proportional hazards regression model was used for each cancer type with the cancer as the outcome and PFOA serum level included as a time-varying covariate. Participants were followed from age 20 (or age in 1952) to the age of cancer diagnosis. Models were adjusted for time-varying- smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as sex, education and 5-year birth cohort. The outcome of PFOA serum level was log-transformed due to the scarcity of very high cumulative exposure values.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nParticipants who worked at the DuPont facility had higher PFOA serum levels and higher estimated annual PFOA levels than subjects who never worked at the facility. After cancer diagnosis validation, thyroid, kidney and testicular cancer risk were found to increase with an increase in the PFOA serum concentration (log-transformed), with testicular cancer being significantly associated (\u03b1 =0.05). The results are consistent with previous mortality analyses performed using DuPont data. There is a positive exposure-response trend for cancer incidence and PFOA serum levels. Kidney and testicular cancer are of interest given that animal studies have found that PFOA is distributed mainly in the kidneys and because PFOA has been found to induce testicular tumors in rats.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''Impact of In Utero Exposure on Reproductive Organs'''\n\nDue to the fact that PFOA is able to readily pass through the placental barrier, exposure is of particular concern during in utero development.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Vested|first=Anne|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=Cecilia H\u00f8st|last3=Olsen|first3=Sjurdur Frodi|last4=Bonde|first4=Jens Peter|last5=Kristensen|first5=Susanne Lund|last6=Halldorsson|first6=Thorhallur Ingi|last7=Becher|first7=Georg|last8=Haug|first8=Line Sm\u00e5stuen|last9=Ernst|first9=Emil Hagen|date=April 2013|title=Associations of in utero exposure to perfluorinated alkyl acids with human semen quality and reproductive hormones in adult men|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=4|pages=453\u2013458|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205118|issn=1552-9924|pmc=3620740|pmid=23360585}}</ref> Numerous studies have analyzed the impacts of PFOA on fetal development of reproductive organs. One study that followed a Danish pregnancy cohort suggests that in utero exposure to PFOA could be associated with lower levels of sperm concentration and total sperm count in adult males, reduced testicular size, and higher adjusted levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.<ref name=\":3\" /> In utero PFOA exposure is also demonstrated to impact female development. For example, a study following a Danish population-based cohort found a 5.3 month later age of menarche in girls exposed to higher levels of PFOA in utero. Delayed onset of menarche is associated with lower bone mineral density and may have psychosocial impacts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kristensen|first=S. L.|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=C.

PFOA is considered a surfactant, or fluorosurfactant, due to its chemical structure consisting of a perfluorinated, ''n''-octyl \"tail group\" and a [[carboxylate]] \"head group\". The head group can be described as [[hydrophilic]] while the [[fluorocarbon]] tail is both [[hydrophobic]] and [[lipophobic]]. The tail group is inert and does not interact strongly with polar or non-polar chemical [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]]; the head group is reactive and interacts strongly with polar groups, specifically water. The \"tail\" is hydrophobic due to being [[non-polar]] and lipophobic because fluorocarbons are less susceptible to the [[London dispersion force]] than [[hydrocarbon]]s.<ref name=\"Lemal2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lemal DM|date=January 2004|title=Perspective on fluorocarbon chemistry|journal=J.

A positive exposure-response trend for kidney cancer is supported by many studies. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population in the low and sub-[[parts per billion]] (ppb) range, and levels are higher in chemical plant employees and surrounding subpopulations. How general populations are exposed to PFOA is not completely understood.

The study consisted of 32,254 residents with 2,507 reported cancer diagnoses occurring during study period. PFOA serum concentrations were measured at baseline and three to six year follow-up meetings. Retrospective yearly PFOA serum levels were estimated for each subject from 1952 through 2011.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Vaughn|last2=Winquist|first2=Andrea|last3=Steenland|first3=Kyle|date=November 2013|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults Living Near a Chemical Plant|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=11\u201312|pages=1313\u20131318|doi=10.1289/ehp.1306615|issn=0091-6765|pmc=3855514|pmid=24007715}}</ref>\n\nInitial subject recruitment was performed using eligibility criteria and surveys\u2014subjects were eligible if they lived or worked in one of the six contaminated water districts for at least one year between 1950 and December 3, 2004. Follow-up surveys were administered and remaining subjects (completion of at least one survey) were then included in the analysis dataset\u2014selection bias was assessed and the final subjects did not differ significantly from the original population.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nRetrospective PFOA serum concentrations were calculated using the published method of Shin et al. 2011a, 2011b''').''' Historical regional data including emission rates by the DuPont facility, temporal patterns and groundwater flow are incorporated in the model as well as individual &nbsp;specific occupational exposure level was included. A job-exposure matrix was developed to assess estimated PFOA levels for workers across times and job roles.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIncident data was self-reported by study participants and followed up with a medical chart review. Cancer diagnoses were verified using Ohio/West Virginia cancer registries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA proportional hazards regression model was used for each cancer type with the cancer as the outcome and PFOA serum level included as a time-varying covariate. Participants were followed from age 20 (or age in 1952) to the age of cancer diagnosis. Models were adjusted for time-varying- smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as sex, education and 5-year birth cohort. The outcome of PFOA serum level was log-transformed due to the scarcity of very high cumulative exposure values.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nParticipants who worked at the DuPont facility had higher PFOA serum levels and higher estimated annual PFOA levels than subjects who never worked at the facility. After cancer diagnosis validation, thyroid, kidney and testicular cancer risk were found to increase with an increase in the PFOA serum concentration (log-transformed), with testicular cancer being significantly associated (\u03b1 =0.05). The results are consistent with previous mortality analyses performed using DuPont data. There is a positive exposure-response trend for cancer incidence and PFOA serum levels. Kidney and testicular cancer are of interest given that animal studies have found that PFOA is distributed mainly in the kidneys and because PFOA has been found to induce testicular tumors in rats.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''Impact of In Utero Exposure on Reproductive Organs'''\n\nDue to the fact that PFOA is able to readily pass through the placental barrier, exposure is of particular concern during in utero development.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Vested|first=Anne|last2=Ramlau-Hansen|first2=Cecilia H\u00f8st|last3=Olsen|first3=Sjurdur Frodi|last4=Bonde|first4=Jens Peter|last5=Kristensen|first5=Susanne Lund|last6=Halldorsson|first6=Thorhallur Ingi|last7=Becher|first7=Georg|last8=Haug|first8=Line Sm\u00e5stuen|last9=Ernst|first9=Emil Hagen|date=April 2013|title=Associations of in utero exposure to perfluorinated alkyl acids with human semen quality and reproductive hormones in adult men|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=121|issue=4|pages=453\u2013458|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205118|issn=1552-9924|pmc=3620740|pmid=23360585}}</ref> Numerous studies have analyzed the impacts of PFOA on fetal development of reproductive organs.

For example, a study following a Danish population-based cohort found a 5.3 month later age of menarche in girls exposed to higher levels of PFOA in utero.

[[Katniss Everdeen]] ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) volunteers to take her younger sister's place, and with her district's male tribute, [[Peeta Mellark]] ([[Josh Hutcherson]]), travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Hunger Games'' began in March 2009 when [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] entered into a co-production agreement with [[Color Force]], which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of [[Seneca Crane]] to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and [[Coriolanus Snow]]. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011. Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011, with filming taking place in [[North Carolina]].\n\nThe film was released on March 21, 2012, in some European countries<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=145083.html?nopub=1 |title=Hunger Games \u2013 released |publisher=[[AlloCin\u00e9]].fr|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> and in the US and UK on March 23, 2012,<ref>{{cite news|first=Karen|last=Valby|url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/25/hunger-games-release-date/|title=The Hunger Games' gets a release date |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}</ref> in both conventional theaters and digital [[IMAX]] theaters.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|url= https://collider.com/the-hunger-games-imax/142402/|title=The Hunger Games Will Get a One-Week IMAX Run|website = Collider |date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Japan received it last, on September 28.

The film also received numerous nominations, including the [[Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]. For her performance, Lawrence won the Saturn Award for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]] for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie|Best Actress in an Action Movie]], the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], and was also nominated for the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

Ross commented, \"so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events for the sake of an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay.

For her performance, Lawrence won the [[Saturn Awards|Saturn Award]] for [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], the [[Critics' Choice Movie Award]] for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie|Best Actress in an Action Movie]], the [[Empire Award]] for [[Empire Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]], and was also nominated for the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

Additionally, when a substitution is made, the retailer also loses an additional portion of the potential sale because the shopper tends to switch to smaller and/or cheaper substitutes.<ref name=\"OOS2002\"/> In addition to the direct losses, both the retailer and the manufacturer incur additional indirect losses due to decreased customer satisfaction that results in less overall reliance on the particular retailers and brands. When an out-of-stock leads to purchase at another store, this provides the consumer an opportunity to try a different store. Consumer behavior theory argues that trial precedes adoption, and, thus, an out-of-stock sets the stage for possible permanent store switching. When an out-of-stock leads to purchase of a competing brand, the consumer trial can lead to possible permanent brand switching as well.<ref name=\"OOS2002\"/> Research findings show that a typical retailer loses about 4 percent of sales due to having items out-of-stock.

It is in the north-west corner of [[the Weald]], a large remnant forest, the main local remnant being [[Winterfold Forest]] directly north-west on the northern [[Greensand Ridge]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nUntil the mid-1860s, the place was usually spelt '''Cranley'''. The [[Post Office]] persuaded the [[vestry]] to use \"''-leigh''\" to avoid misdirections to nearby [[Crawley]] in [[West Sussex]]. The older spelling is publicly visible in the ''Cranley Hotel''. The name is recorded in the ''[[Pipe Rolls]]'' as ''Cranlea'' in 1166 and ''Cranelega'' in 1167. A little later in the ''[[Feet of Fines]]'' of 1198 the name is written as ''Cranele''. Etymologists consider all these versions to be the fusion of the [[Old English]] words \"[[Crane (bird)|Cran]]\", meaning \"crane\",<ref>Pollington, Stephen, ''Wordcraft, New English to Old English Dictionary and Thesaurus'' 6th Ed., (2011), Anglosaxon Books, Ely, p.137</ref> and \"L\u0113oh\" that together mean 'a woodland clearing visited by cranes'.<ref>Ekwall, Eilert, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names, Third Ed.'' (1951), Clarendon Press, Oxford, p.122</ref> The name is popularly believed to come from imputed large crane-breeding grounds at the Anglo-French named Vachery Pond, often locally known as Vachery.<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p6. (See Bibliography.)</ref> The figure of a crane adorns the old drinking water fountain of 1874 in 'Fountain Square' in the middle of the village. A pair of cranes adorn the crest of the 21st century granted [[coat of arms]] of '''Cranleigh Parish Council'''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cranleighpc.org/cranleigh_coat_of_arms.php |title=The Cranleigh Coat of Arms, Cranleigh Parish Council website |access-date=21 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215155418/http://www.cranleighpc.org/cranleigh_coat_of_arms.php |archive-date=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Early history===\nPartly on the [[Greensand Ridge]], where it rises to {{convert|700|ft|m}} at Winterfold Hill, but mainly on the clay and sandstone Lower [[Weald]], Cranleigh has little of [[prehistoric]] or [[Roman Britain|Roman]] interest, whereas just across the east border Wykehurst and Rapley Farms have Roman buildings and Roman Tile Kilns \u2014 in the parish of [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]. A spur of the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Chichester]] runs north west to Guildford past nearby [[Farley Heath]] in [[Farley Green, Surrey|Farley Green]], a temple site. Cranleigh was not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]],<ref>[https://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/places/surrey/waverley/cranleigh/ Cranleigh]</ref> at that time being part of the manor of [[Shere]].\n\nThe [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] parish church of [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicolas]] dates the first building on its site from around 1170, and the building was in its present form by the mid-14th century. It was extensively [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in 1847. The church has a gargoyle, on a pillar inside the church, which is said to have inspired [[Lewis Carroll]], who lived in Guildford, to create the [[Cheshire Cat]].<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p11.</ref> With the growth of the village, a \"daughter\" church, [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew's]], opened at the west end of the village in 1900 but it closed some sixty years later. The parish is in the [[Diocese]] of Guildford.\n\nThe Boy & Donkey pub, on Knowle Road outside the village, opened in the 16th century as a Hodgsons of Kingston pub and remained in business until the early 1990s. It was sold to Morland of Abingdon who closed it in 1991. The building was converted into a private home.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whatpub.com/pubs/REI/73/boy-donkey-cranleigh |title=Boy & Donkey Knowle Road |date=11 July 2007 |publisher=What Pub|access-date=16 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Cromwell]] visited Knowle House in 1657, his soldiers being billeted in houses in the village.<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p7.</ref>\n\n===Post Industrial Revolution===\nGrowth came due to improvements in transport; in 1813 the [[Wey and Arun Canal]] was authorised. Three years later it opened, passing a few miles to the west of the village. This route linked London (via the [[Thames]] and the [[River Wey|Wey]]) with [[Littlehampton]] (via the [[River Arun|Arun]]). However, the canal traffic was completely eclipsed by the [[Cranleigh Line|Horsham to Guildford railway]] which opened in 1865, and the canal fell into disuse. A [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] road was also built between [[Guildford]] and [[Horsham]], assent for the project being given in 1818. The opening is commemorated by an [[obelisk]] at the junction of the roads to Horsham and to [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]. The [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] used the route when travelling between [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] and [[Brighton]], the distances to which are given on the plaque on the obelisk.\n\nThree people played a major part in the development of the village during the 19th century: Reverend [[John Henry Sapte]], Dr Albert Napper and Stephen Rowland. Sapte arrived in Cranleigh in 1846 as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]]. He played a major role in setting up the [[national school (England and Wales)|National School]] in 1847 and [[Cranleigh School]] in 1865. He was appointed [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|Archdeacon]] of Surrey and remained in the village until his death in 1906.<ref>''Cranleigh Through Time'', p3.</ref>\n\nTogether with Napper, Sapte set up the first [[cottage hospital]] in the country in 1859. It has survived many attempts to close it, through fundraising by the local community. However it lost its beds for in-patients in May 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cranleighhospital.org/history/historysub01.html |title=Cranleigh hospital history |access-date=5 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001122740/http://www.cranleighhospital.org/history/historysub01.html |archive-date=1 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p13.</ref><ref>''Cranleigh Through Time'', p4.</ref>\n\nStephen Rowland was a resident who had a major role in the development of the infrastructure of the village. He formed the Cranleigh Gas Company in 1876, and arranged for a mains water supply in 1886. In 1894 he laid out an estate between the Horsham and Ewhurst Roads, building New Park Road, Avenue Road, Mead Road, Mount Road and Bridge Road. He also set up a grocery store.

Its primary use during the war was to whittle out those not suited to undercover work and begin initial training for those that progressed. Amongst the many recruits that attended Winterfold included [[Muriel Byck]], [[Andr\u00e9e Borrel]], [[Denise Bloch]], [[Noor Inyat Khan]] (Nora Baker) \u2013 a descendant of [[India]]n Muslim royalty <ref>http://www.delhiinformation.in/tombs/tombofhazratinayatkhan.html</ref> and [[Violette Szabo]] GC. A film [[Carve Her Name with Pride]] was made in 1958 about Szabo's wartime life in the SOE. In November 2011, a Memorial to the SOE was unveiled at Winterfold House, Surrey, formerly STS 7, Students' Assessment Board. It was initiated by  British military historian, writer and author [[Paul McCue]] and others. It was attended by Tania Szab\u00f3, the daughter of heroine [[Violette Szabo]], together with representatives from the USA, Dutch and French embassies and from the Canadian High Commission.<ref>https://www.paulmccuebooks.com/events.htm</ref>\n\nDuring the later part of [[World War II]], on 27 August 1944, the infants school was hit by a [[V-1 flying bomb]] and demolished, as was the stained glass east window of the nearby St. Nicolas Church. This occurred early on a Sunday morning, and the school was empty. The only casualty was the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|Rector]], who was in his garden not far away and was injured.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120904072847/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/86/a1962786.shtml WW2 stories on BBC website.]</ref> Another flying bomb hit the [[Gas holder|gasholder]] on the Common, destroying both the structure and a nearby cottage, whose occupant was killed.<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p92.</ref>\n\n===Post-war===\n[[Cranleigh railway station]] was closed by [[Beeching axe|Dr Beeching]] in 1965 after almost exactly a hundred years of operation.<ref>[http://www.cranleighRailway.info/ Cranleigh railway]</ref>\n\nIn 1975 the 1900-built church of St Andrew was demolished.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Waverley parishes.png|thumb|left|Cranleigh [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Waverley, Surrey|Waverley borough]]]]\n\nCranleigh village is {{convert|7.7|mi}} southeast of the county town of [[Surrey]], [[Guildford]], and {{convert|6.2|mi}} [[boxing the compass|ESE]] of [[Godalming]], which is the administrative centre of the borough of [[Waverley, Surrey|Waverley]].<ref name=grf/> In the centre of the civil parish are the greatest number of buildings, fanning out in many side roads and on the high street.<ref name=map>[http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx [[Ordnance Survey]] map, courtesy of [[English Heritage]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424060625/http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/mapsearch.aspx |date=24 April 2012 }}</ref> [[Cranleigh Waters]] also known as the Cranleigh Water, drains the village, before flowing to [[Shalford, Surrey|Shalford]] where it joins the River Wey, specifically in the small, formerly marsh-like locality of Peasmarsh, which still has water meadows lining the bank itself.<ref name=map/> [[Winterfold Forest]], a remaining higher part of the forest that occupies the northeast is on the [[Greensand Ridge]], which can be explored using in places roads or by the long distance path, the [[Greensand Way]].<ref>[http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/greensandway Surrey County Council \u2014 The Greensand Way]</ref><ref>[http://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure_and_culture Kent County Council \u2014 The Greensand Way]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title     = Nearest Settlements\n|Centre    = Cranleigh\n|North     = [[Wonersh|Shamley Green, Wonersh]]\n|Northeast = <small>''across [[Winterfold Forest]]''</small><br>[[Shere, Surrey|Shere]]\n|East      = [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]\n|Southeast = [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]<br>(part of)\n|South     = [[Rudgwick]]\n|Southwest = [[Alfold, Surrey|Alfold]]\n|West      = [[Hascombe]]\n|Northwest = [[Bramley, Surrey|Bramley]]\n}}\n\n===Elevations, Soil and Geology===\nElevations range from a maximum of 240 m [[Above Ordnance Datum|AOD]] (mean high water level) at the car park on Reynolds Hill in Winterfold Heath (a woodland in the north) to 41 m on the watercourse and the disused [[Wey and Arun Canal]] as they leave both the parish in the northwest extreme at the end of East Whipley Lane. The village centre lies at generally 50\u201370 m above AOD.\n\nSoil consists in small areas of \"naturally wet loamy soil\"; the north and south of the village centre and all surrounding areas are \"slowly permeable seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils\".<ref>[https://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/ National Soil Resources Institute, Cranfield University]</ref>\n\nThen deep seas{{clarify|date=February 2020}}, [[Gault Clay]] and the [[Upper Greensand]] [[deposition (geology)|deposit]]s form the deep soil, more evident where erosion has taken place on steeper hillslopes in the civil parish. The Gault Clay contains phosphate-rich nodules in discrete bands and has a rich marine fauna with abundant ammonites, bivalves and gastropods. The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base, giving way upwards into sandstones. Just before the [[paleogene]] which included the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs, sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent; marine Upnor Beds were deposited in [[Surrey]]. In the paleogene, Southern England slightly rose and the seas retreated and reddish and mottled clays of the [[Reading Beds]] were deposited by a large river sand delta system including across much of the [[Weald]] (which covers much of [[Sussex]] and [[Kent]] as well). Later, a rise in sea level around 50 million years ago caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the [[London Clay]] across the county. The London Clay is a bluish-grey marine clay with isolated pockets of fossils especially where chalkier. The youngest part of the London Clay is known as the [[Claygate Beds]] and sand and soft sandstone of the [[Bagshot Formation]], though in many areas such as this generally eroded, followed in most cases by a variable thickness of organic [[humus]].<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx Natural England - Geodiversity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010627/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx |date=2 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy, twinning etc.==\n[[File:Cranleigh Village Hall - geograph.org.uk - 862227.jpg|thumb|left|Village Hall]]\n[[File:West Cranleigh Nurseries - geograph.org.uk - 862260.jpg|thumb|left|West Cranleigh Nurseries]]\nDespite losing the rail link, Cranleigh has prospered both as a satellite of [[Guildford]], and as a service and light engineering centre in its own right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Furthermore, it is a retail centre for the surrounding smaller villages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The resident population of the area decreased by 2.0% in the ten years to 2001.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In January 2007, Cranleigh Parish Council received a grant of arms.<ref>[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/014.htm College of Arms newsletter, September 2007]</ref> Cranleigh is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Vallendar]], Germany, and with [[Semur-en-Auxois]] in [[Burgundy]], eastern France.

It opened in 1865 and was originally known as \"The Surrey County School\".\n\nState schools include Glebelands School (a secondary school), Cranleigh C of E Primary School and Park Mead Primary School. There is also St Cuthbert Mayne Catholic Primary School. Cranleigh C of E Primary School opened in September 2008 as an amalgamation of Cranleigh Infants School and St. Nicolas Junior School.\n\nIn 1847 the National School opened in the present Arts Centre, replacing earlier [[dame school]]s. During the twentieth century, separate infant and secondary schools were formed and moved to their own premises (leaving the C of E Junior School which moved to new buildings in 1964).\n\n==Recreation and entertainment==\n[[File:Cranleigh Leisure Centre. - geograph.org.uk - 167971.jpg|thumb|left|Cranleigh Leisure Centre]]\nThe Cranleigh Arts Centre runs a full programme of feature film screenings, live music, theatre productions, adult and children's activities, exhibitions and workshops.

It consists of fewer than 20 buildings. Reached by Knowle Lane, a rural road leading off of the high street, which is dotted with houses, the settlement lies east of that lane along another lane, Baynards Road. No other neighbourhoods or localities of importance exist in the civil parish as a whole.<ref name=map/><ref>[https://www.google.com/maps Google Maps]</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{more|List of places of worship in Waverley (borough)}}\nThere is a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] church, Jesus Christ Redeemer of Mankind (in the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Arundel and Brighton|Diocese of Arundel & Brighton]]), and churches of the Methodist and Baptist denominations, as well as the Anglican church of St Nicolas mentioned above.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Rail===\n{{Main|Cranleigh railway station}}\n[[Cranleigh railway station]] was opened in 1865 as \"Cranley\" as part of the [[Cranleigh Line]], its name was changed in 1867 to \"Cranleigh\" at the request of the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] as badly addressed letters to \"Cranley\" were often mistaken for \"[[Crawley]]\" and vice versa. Cranleigh was the busiest station on the line with regular commuter traffic to and from London via [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford]]. Cranleigh had a substantial goods yard equipped with a large [[Gantry crane|loading gantry]]. Inward freight consisted mainly of [[coal]] which was required, in particular, by the local [[gasworks]], whilst goods outward were mainly timber.\n\nA victim of the [[Beeching Axe]], the line closed in 1965 and Cranleigh station was demolished shortly afterwards, replaced by the \"[[Stocklund Square]]\" housing and shopping development. In 2004 part of this development was itself demolished and a [[Sainsbury's]] [[supermarket]] was constructed on the site. Today the trackbed is in part used by the [[Downs Link]], and the station's old platform levels are still visible at the rear of the shops.\n\nTwo studies have been carried out to review the possibility of reviving train services. The first, in the 1990s, was to determine whether re-opening a portion of the line for passenger traffic from Bramley to Guildford would be economically viable. Although the study was inconclusive, Waverley Borough Council protected the line from further development in its [[Local Plan]]. In 2009, the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]] applied for funding for a new line to Cranleigh.{{ATOCConnectingCommunitiesReportS10|page=18}}\n\n===Road===\nCranleigh centres around the junction of two [[B roads in Zone 2 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B roads]] to the east of the [[A281 road|A281]] [[Guildford]] to [[Horsham]] road.\n\nThe village is on a number of bus routes, serving among others [[Guildford]], [[Horsham]], [[Godalming]] and [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]. The main operator is [[Arriva Guildford & West Surrey]].\n\n[[Tillingbourne Bus Company]] was based in the village prior to its collapse in 2001.<ref>[http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/83440_cranleigh_bus_company_calls_in_the_receivers Cranleigh bus company calls in the receivers - News - getsurrey]</ref>\n\n===Canal===\nThe [[Wey and Arun Canal]] is gradually being restored.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Obelisk in Cranleigh. - geograph.org.uk - 167981.jpg|thumb|left|Obelisk<br>Cranleigh High Street]]\n[[File:Cranleigh War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 843036.jpg|thumb|left|Rose Garden and War Memorial]]\n\n===Stocklund Square===\nA square near the centre of the village on the High Street, which is the main road running through Cranleigh. It was constructed following the closing of the railway line in 1965, and the removal of the railway station.\n\nA new [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket was built in late 2004. Other shops in the square are [[Oxfam]], [[Carphone Warehouse]] and [[Costa Coffee]]. The square used to have greenery and a fountain, but this was replaced with a more open layout catering for attractions and events such as a town-style public Easter Service and a French Market.\n\n===Fountain Square===\nIn 2006, the pedestrian area surrounding the large stone drinking fountain (1874) at the centre of the village was re-modelled, and given the name 'Fountain Square'. New granite paving, brick planters and trees were introduced in a design which created a haven from traffic and a place for small community events.  As part of this a bus shelter sometime nicknamed the Threepenny Bit Shelter was remodelled at Snoxhall behind the leisure centre. Within a few weeks it was vandalised and pulled to the ground. The bulk of funding was from Surrey County Council (SCC) and the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), to designs by SCC.\n\n===Winterfold House===\n{{main|Winterfold House}}\nWinterfold House, north-east of the village along Barhatch Lane, was built in 1886 for Richard Webster QC, afterwards [[Viscount Alverstone]]. He became [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] in 1900 and died in 1915. A bench in the woodland above the house is known as 'Lord Justice Seat'.\n\nThe house was then bought by [[Charles Armytage-Moore]], founder partner in the stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. He reconstructed the main facade in Queen Anne style, and enhanced the gardens with rare rhododendrons, camellias, azaleas and magnolias. One particular red-flowered species (Rhododendron barbatum Wallich ex G. Don 1834) won an Award of Merit when exhibited by Winterfold House in 1934. During [[World War II]] Winterfold was requisitioned by the Government and used by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) as a training school designated STS 4. Amongst the many recruits that attended Winterfold were [[Violette Szabo]] GC.\n\nArmytage-Moore died in 1960. The house was sold to [[HRH Prince Carol of Romania]]. It achieved notoriety by being searched for evidence after the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]] of 1963, but nothing was found. The house and estate of {{convert|212|acres|km2}} was sold in 18 lots at auction in 1978.\n\n==In popular culture==\nCranleigh appears in the book ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]], in which experiences which do not have words yet are given words which currently only exist as names of places. \"Cranleigh\" is defined as: \"A mood of irrational irritation with everyone and everything.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Adams|author2=John Lloyd |authorlink2=John Lloyd (writer) |title=[[The Meaning of Liff]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Pan Macmillan]]|year=1983|location=London|page=35|isbn=978-0-330-28121-8}}</ref>\n\n\"Cranleigh Hall\", the home of \"Lord Cranleigh\", was the principal location for the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial, ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]''.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/blackorchid/detail.shtml BBC - Doctor Who Classic Series Episode Guide - Black Orchid]</ref>\n\n==Demography and housing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2011 Census Homes\n|-\n!Output area !!Detached  !!Semi-detached!!Terraced!!Flats and apartments!!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes!!shared between households<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|(Civil Parish)||2,089\t||1,137\t||\t667\t||\t881\t||\t5\t||\t0\n\n|}\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2011 Census Key Statistics\n|-\n!Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|(Civil Parish)||11,492||4,779\t||43.3%\t||32.2%||3,278\n|}\n\nThe proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.

It is in the north-west corner of [[the Weald]], a large remnant forest, the main local remnant being [[Winterfold Forest]] directly north-west on the northern [[Greensand Ridge]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nUntil the mid-1860s, the place was usually spelt '''Cranley'''. The [[Post Office]] persuaded the [[vestry]] to use \"''-leigh''\" to avoid misdirections to nearby [[Crawley]] in [[West Sussex]]. The older spelling is publicly visible in the ''Cranley Hotel''. The name is recorded in the ''[[Pipe Rolls]]'' as ''Cranlea'' in 1166 and ''Cranelega'' in 1167. A little later in the ''[[Feet of Fines]]'' of 1198 the name is written as ''Cranele''. Etymologists consider all these versions to be the fusion of the [[Old English]] words \"[[Crane (bird)|Cran]]\", meaning \"crane\",<ref>Pollington, Stephen, ''Wordcraft, New English to Old English Dictionary and Thesaurus'' 6th Ed., (2011), Anglosaxon Books, Ely, p.137</ref> and \"L\u0113oh\" that together mean 'a woodland clearing visited by cranes'.<ref>Ekwall, Eilert, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names, Third Ed.'' (1951), Clarendon Press, Oxford, p.122</ref> The name is popularly believed to come from imputed large crane-breeding grounds at the Anglo-French named Vachery Pond, often locally known as Vachery.<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p6.

A spur of the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Chichester]] runs north west to Guildford past nearby [[Farley Heath]] in [[Farley Green, Surrey|Farley Green]], a temple site. Cranleigh was not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]],<ref>[https://www.exploringsurreyspast.org.uk/themes/places/surrey/waverley/cranleigh/ Cranleigh]</ref> at that time being part of the manor of [[Shere]].\n\nThe [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] parish church of [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicolas]] dates the first building on its site from around 1170, and the building was in its present form by the mid-14th century. It was extensively [[Victorian restoration|restored]] in 1847. The church has a gargoyle, on a pillar inside the church, which is said to have inspired [[Lewis Carroll]], who lived in Guildford, to create the [[Cheshire Cat]].<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p11.</ref> With the growth of the village, a \"daughter\" church, [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew's]], opened at the west end of the village in 1900 but it closed some sixty years later. The parish is in the [[Diocese]] of Guildford.\n\nThe Boy & Donkey pub, on Knowle Road outside the village, opened in the 16th century as a Hodgsons of Kingston pub and remained in business until the early 1990s. It was sold to Morland of Abingdon who closed it in 1991. The building was converted into a private home.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whatpub.com/pubs/REI/73/boy-donkey-cranleigh |title=Boy & Donkey Knowle Road |date=11 July 2007 |publisher=What Pub|access-date=16 December 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Cromwell]] visited Knowle House in 1657, his soldiers being billeted in houses in the village.<ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p7.</ref>\n\n===Post Industrial Revolution===\nGrowth came due to improvements in transport; in 1813 the [[Wey and Arun Canal]] was authorised. Three years later it opened, passing a few miles to the west of the village. This route linked London (via the [[Thames]] and the [[River Wey|Wey]]) with [[Littlehampton]] (via the [[River Arun|Arun]]). However, the canal traffic was completely eclipsed by the [[Cranleigh Line|Horsham to Guildford railway]] which opened in 1865, and the canal fell into disuse. A [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] road was also built between [[Guildford]] and [[Horsham]], assent for the project being given in 1818. The opening is commemorated by an [[obelisk]] at the junction of the roads to Horsham and to [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]. The [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] used the route when travelling between [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] and [[Brighton]], the distances to which are given on the plaque on the obelisk.\n\nThree people played a major part in the development of the village during the 19th century: Reverend [[John Henry Sapte]], Dr Albert Napper and Stephen Rowland. Sapte arrived in Cranleigh in 1846 as the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|rector]]. He played a major role in setting up the [[national school (England and Wales)|National School]] in 1847 and [[Cranleigh School]] in 1865. He was appointed [[Rector (ecclesiastical)#Anglican churches|Archdeacon]] of Surrey and remained in the village until his death in 1906.<ref>''Cranleigh Through Time'', p3.</ref>\n\nTogether with Napper, Sapte set up the first [[cottage hospital]] in the country in 1859. It has survived many attempts to close it, through fundraising by the local community. However it lost its beds for in-patients in May 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cranleighhospital.org/history/historysub01.html |title=Cranleigh hospital history |access-date=5 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001122740/http://www.cranleighhospital.org/history/historysub01.html |archive-date=1 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>''Around Cranleigh'', p13.</ref><ref>''Cranleigh Through Time'', p4.</ref>\n\nStephen Rowland was a resident who had a major role in the development of the infrastructure of the village. He formed the Cranleigh Gas Company in 1876, and arranged for a mains water supply in 1886. In 1894 he laid out an estate between the Horsham and Ewhurst Roads, building New Park Road, Avenue Road, Mead Road, Mount Road and Bridge Road. He also set up a grocery store.

Its primary use during the war was to whittle out those not suited to undercover work and begin initial training for those that progressed. Amongst the many recruits that attended Winterfold included [[Muriel Byck]], [[Andr\u00e9e Borrel]], [[Denise Bloch]], [[Noor Inyat Khan]] (Nora Baker) \u2013 a descendant of [[India]]n Muslim royalty <ref>http://www.delhiinformation.in/tombs/tombofhazratinayatkhan.html</ref> and [[Violette Szabo]] GC. A film [[Carve Her Name with Pride]] was made in 1958 about Szabo's wartime life in the SOE. In November 2011, a Memorial to the SOE was unveiled at Winterfold House, Surrey, formerly STS 7, Students' Assessment Board. It was initiated by  British military historian, writer and author [[Paul McCue]] and others.

The village centre lies at generally 50\u201370 m above AOD.\n\nSoil consists in small areas of \"naturally wet loamy soil\"; the north and south of the village centre and all surrounding areas are \"slowly permeable seasonally wet slightly acid but base-rich loamy and clayey soils\".<ref>[https://www.landis.org.uk/soilscapes/ National Soil Resources Institute, Cranfield University]</ref>\n\nThen deep seas{{clarify|date=February 2020}}, [[Gault Clay]] and the [[Upper Greensand]] [[deposition (geology)|deposit]]s form the deep soil, more evident where erosion has taken place on steeper hillslopes in the civil parish. The Gault Clay contains phosphate-rich nodules in discrete bands and has a rich marine fauna with abundant ammonites, bivalves and gastropods. The Upper Greensand comprises a variety of sediments with fine silts at the base, giving way upwards into sandstones. Just before the [[paleogene]] which included the mass-extinction event of the non-avian dinosaurs, sea levels dropped, exposing Sussex and Kent; marine Upnor Beds were deposited in [[Surrey]]. In the paleogene, Southern England slightly rose and the seas retreated and reddish and mottled clays of the [[Reading Beds]] were deposited by a large river sand delta system including across much of the [[Weald]] (which covers much of [[Sussex]] and [[Kent]] as well). Later, a rise in sea level around 50 million years ago caused widespread deposition, until 2 million years ago, of the [[London Clay]] across the county. The London Clay is a bluish-grey marine clay with isolated pockets of fossils especially where chalkier. The youngest part of the London Clay is known as the [[Claygate Beds]] and sand and soft sandstone of the [[Bagshot Formation]], though in many areas such as this generally eroded, followed in most cases by a variable thickness of organic [[humus]].<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx Natural England - Geodiversity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010627/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID34.aspx |date=2 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Economy, twinning etc.==\n[[File:Cranleigh Village Hall - geograph.org.uk - 862227.jpg|thumb|left|Village Hall]]\n[[File:West Cranleigh Nurseries - geograph.org.uk - 862260.jpg|thumb|left|West Cranleigh Nurseries]]\nDespite losing the rail link, Cranleigh has prospered both as a satellite of [[Guildford]], and as a service and light engineering centre in its own right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} Furthermore, it is a retail centre for the surrounding smaller villages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The resident population of the area decreased by 2.0% in the ten years to 2001.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} In January 2007, Cranleigh Parish Council received a grant of arms.<ref>[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Newsletter/014.htm College of Arms newsletter, September 2007]</ref> Cranleigh is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Vallendar]], Germany, and with [[Semur-en-Auxois]] in [[Burgundy]], eastern France.

It opened in 1865 and was originally known as \"The Surrey County School\".\n\nState schools include Glebelands School (a secondary school), Cranleigh C of E Primary School and Park Mead Primary School. There is also St Cuthbert Mayne Catholic Primary School. Cranleigh C of E Primary School opened in September 2008 as an amalgamation of Cranleigh Infants School and St. Nicolas Junior School.\n\nIn 1847 the National School opened in the present Arts Centre, replacing earlier [[dame school]]s. During the twentieth century, separate infant and secondary schools were formed and moved to their own premises (leaving the C of E Junior School which moved to new buildings in 1964).\n\n==Recreation and entertainment==\n[[File:Cranleigh Leisure Centre. - geograph.org.uk - 167971.jpg|thumb|left|Cranleigh Leisure Centre]]\nThe Cranleigh Arts Centre runs a full programme of feature film screenings, live music, theatre productions, adult and children's activities, exhibitions and workshops.

It consists of fewer than 20 buildings. Reached by Knowle Lane, a rural road leading off of the high street, which is dotted with houses, the settlement lies east of that lane along another lane, Baynards Road. No other neighbourhoods or localities of importance exist in the civil parish as a whole.<ref name=map/><ref>[https://www.google.com/maps Google Maps]</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{more|List of places of worship in Waverley (borough)}}\nThere is a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] church, Jesus Christ Redeemer of Mankind (in the Roman Catholic [[Diocese of Arundel and Brighton|Diocese of Arundel & Brighton]]), and churches of the Methodist and Baptist denominations, as well as the Anglican church of St Nicolas mentioned above.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Rail===\n{{Main|Cranleigh railway station}}\n[[Cranleigh railway station]] was opened in 1865 as \"Cranley\" as part of the [[Cranleigh Line]], its name was changed in 1867 to \"Cranleigh\" at the request of the [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] as badly addressed letters to \"Cranley\" were often mistaken for \"[[Crawley]]\" and vice versa. Cranleigh was the busiest station on the line with regular commuter traffic to and from London via [[Guildford (Surrey) railway station|Guildford]]. Cranleigh had a substantial goods yard equipped with a large [[Gantry crane|loading gantry]]. Inward freight consisted mainly of [[coal]] which was required, in particular, by the local [[gasworks]], whilst goods outward were mainly timber.\n\nA victim of the [[Beeching Axe]], the line closed in 1965 and Cranleigh station was demolished shortly afterwards, replaced by the \"[[Stocklund Square]]\" housing and shopping development. In 2004 part of this development was itself demolished and a [[Sainsbury's]] [[supermarket]] was constructed on the site. Today the trackbed is in part used by the [[Downs Link]], and the station's old platform levels are still visible at the rear of the shops.\n\nTwo studies have been carried out to review the possibility of reviving train services. The first, in the 1990s, was to determine whether re-opening a portion of the line for passenger traffic from Bramley to Guildford would be economically viable. Although the study was inconclusive, Waverley Borough Council protected the line from further development in its [[Local Plan]]. In 2009, the [[Association of Train Operating Companies]] applied for funding for a new line to Cranleigh.{{ATOCConnectingCommunitiesReportS10|page=18}}\n\n===Road===\nCranleigh centres around the junction of two [[B roads in Zone 2 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|B roads]] to the east of the [[A281 road|A281]] [[Guildford]] to [[Horsham]] road.\n\nThe village is on a number of bus routes, serving among others [[Guildford]], [[Horsham]], [[Godalming]] and [[Ewhurst, Surrey|Ewhurst]]. The main operator is [[Arriva Guildford & West Surrey]].\n\n[[Tillingbourne Bus Company]] was based in the village prior to its collapse in 2001.<ref>[http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/83440_cranleigh_bus_company_calls_in_the_receivers Cranleigh bus company calls in the receivers - News - getsurrey]</ref>\n\n===Canal===\nThe [[Wey and Arun Canal]] is gradually being restored.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Obelisk in Cranleigh. - geograph.org.uk - 167981.jpg|thumb|left|Obelisk<br>Cranleigh High Street]]\n[[File:Cranleigh War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 843036.jpg|thumb|left|Rose Garden and War Memorial]]\n\n===Stocklund Square===\nA square near the centre of the village on the High Street, which is the main road running through Cranleigh. It was constructed following the closing of the railway line in 1965, and the removal of the railway station.\n\nA new [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket was built in late 2004. Other shops in the square are [[Oxfam]], [[Carphone Warehouse]] and [[Costa Coffee]]. The square used to have greenery and a fountain, but this was replaced with a more open layout catering for attractions and events such as a town-style public Easter Service and a French Market.\n\n===Fountain Square===\nIn 2006, the pedestrian area surrounding the large stone drinking fountain (1874) at the centre of the village was re-modelled, and given the name 'Fountain Square'. New granite paving, brick planters and trees were introduced in a design which created a haven from traffic and a place for small community events.  As part of this a bus shelter sometime nicknamed the Threepenny Bit Shelter was remodelled at Snoxhall behind the leisure centre. Within a few weeks it was vandalised and pulled to the ground. The bulk of funding was from Surrey County Council (SCC) and the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), to designs by SCC.\n\n===Winterfold House===\n{{main|Winterfold House}}\nWinterfold House, north-east of the village along Barhatch Lane, was built in 1886 for Richard Webster QC, afterwards [[Viscount Alverstone]]. He became [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] in 1900 and died in 1915. A bench in the woodland above the house is known as 'Lord Justice Seat'.\n\nThe house was then bought by [[Charles Armytage-Moore]], founder partner in the stockbrokers Buckmaster & Moore. He reconstructed the main facade in Queen Anne style, and enhanced the gardens with rare rhododendrons, camellias, azaleas and magnolias. One particular red-flowered species (Rhododendron barbatum Wallich ex G. Don 1834) won an Award of Merit when exhibited by Winterfold House in 1934. During [[World War II]] Winterfold was requisitioned by the Government and used by the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) as a training school designated STS 4. Amongst the many recruits that attended Winterfold were [[Violette Szabo]] GC.\n\nArmytage-Moore died in 1960. The house was sold to [[HRH Prince Carol of Romania]]. It achieved notoriety by being searched for evidence after the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]] of 1963, but nothing was found. The house and estate of {{convert|212|acres|km2}} was sold in 18 lots at auction in 1978.\n\n==In popular culture==\nCranleigh appears in the book ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]] and [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]], in which experiences which do not have words yet are given words which currently only exist as names of places. \"Cranleigh\" is defined as: \"A mood of irrational irritation with everyone and everything.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas Adams|author2=John Lloyd |authorlink2=John Lloyd (writer) |title=[[The Meaning of Liff]]|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Pan Macmillan]]|year=1983|location=London|page=35|isbn=978-0-330-28121-8}}</ref>\n\n\"Cranleigh Hall\", the home of \"Lord Cranleigh\", was the principal location for the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial, ''[[Black Orchid (Doctor Who)|Black Orchid]]''.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/blackorchid/detail.shtml BBC - Doctor Who Classic Series Episode Guide - Black Orchid]</ref>\n\n==Demography and housing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2011 Census Homes\n|-\n!Output area !!Detached  !!Semi-detached!!Terraced!!Flats and apartments!!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes!!shared between households<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|(Civil Parish)||2,089\t||1,137\t||\t667\t||\t881\t||\t5\t||\t0\n\n|}\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2011 Census Key Statistics\n|-\n!Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|(Civil Parish)||11,492||4,779\t||43.3%\t||32.2%||3,278\n|}\n\nThe proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.

She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Joan I of Navarre]]. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She became a \"[[femme fatale]]\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] figure.\n\nIsabella arrived in England at the age of 12{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=227}} during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful [[baron]]ial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his [[favourite]], [[Piers Gaveston]], but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall#Return and death|the death of Gaveston]] at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward later turned to a new favourite, [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the [[Despenser War]] and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser and by 1325 her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\n\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small [[mercenary]] army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming [[regent]] on behalf of her son, [[Edward III]]. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the [[Edward II of England#Death|murder of Edward II]]. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|wars with Scotland]].\n\nIn 1330, aged 18, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority, and Mortimer was executed. Isabella lost her regency and was put under arrest for two years,{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=312-313}} but afterwards she lived for many years in considerable style; though she did not reside at court, she often visited to see her grandchildren.\n\n==Early life and marriage: 1295\u20131308==\n[[File:Philip iv and family.jpg|thumb|300px|Isabella's French family, depicted in 1315: l-r: Isabella's brothers, [[Charles IV of France|Charles]] and [[Philip V of France|Philip]], Isabella herself, her father, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], her brother [[Louis X of France|Louis]], and her uncle, [[Charles of Valois]]. [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]].]]\nIsabella was born in [[Paris]] on an uncertain date&nbsp;\u2013 on the basis of the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between May and November 1295. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and [[Piers Langtoft]] agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chronicler [[Guillaume de Nangis]] and English chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by [[Clement V]] in November 1305 permitted her immediate [[marriage by proxy]], despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since she had to reach the canonical age of 7 before her betrothal in May 1303, and that of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between May and November 1295.<ref>See Weir 2006, pp8-9.</ref> Her parents were King [[Philip IV of France]] and Queen [[Joan I of Navarre]]; her brothers [[Louis X of France|Louis]], [[Philip V of France|Philip]] and [[Charles IV of France|Charles]] became kings of France.\n\nIsabella was born into a royal family that ruled the most powerful state in [[Western Europe]]. Her father, King Philip, known as ''\"le Bel\"'' (the Fair) because of his good looks, was a strangely unemotional man; contemporaries described him as \"neither a man nor a beast, but a statue\";<ref>Weir 2006, p.11.</ref> modern historians have noted that he \"cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh\".<ref>Jones and McKitterick, p.394.</ref> Philip built up [[Centralized government|centralised royal power]] in France, engaging in a sequence of conflicts to expand or consolidate French authority across the region, but remained chronically short of money throughout his reign. Indeed, he appeared almost obsessed about building up wealth and lands, something that his daughter was also accused of in later life.<ref>Weir 2006, p.12.</ref> Isabella's mother died when Isabella was still quite young; some contemporaries suspected Philip IV of her murder, albeit probably incorrectly.<ref>Weir 2006, p.14.</ref>\n\n[[File:Seal of Edward II-2.jpg|thumb|left|Seal of Edward II]]\nIsabella was brought up in and around the [[Ch\u00e2teau du Louvre]] and the ''[[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]]'' in Paris.<ref name=WeirP13>Weir 2006, p.13.</ref> Isabella was cared for by Th\u00e9ophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good education and taught to read, developing a love of books.<ref name=WeirP13/> As was customary for the period, all of Philip's children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to [[Edward II of England|Edward]], the infant son of King [[Edward I of England]], with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter's continental possession of [[Gascony]] and claims to [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]].<ref>Weir 2006, p.13-4.</ref> [[Pope Boniface VIII]] had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. Edward I attempted to break the engagement several times for political advantage, and only after he died in 1307 did the wedding proceed.\n\nIsabella and Edward II were finally married at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] on 25 January 1308. Isabella's wardrobe gives some indications of her wealth and style&nbsp;\u2013 she had dresses of [[silk|baudekyn]], [[velvet]], [[taffeta]] and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and [[coif]]s; she brought with her two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen.<ref name=WeirP25>Weir 2006, p.25.</ref> At the time of her marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by [[Geoffrey of Paris]] as \"''the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe.''\" This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella's father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her \"Isabella the Fair\".<ref name=WeirP25/> Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, [[queen regnant]] of Navarre, a plump, plain woman.<ref>Costain, p.82; Weir 2006, p.12.</ref> This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly full-faced women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead.<ref>Weir 2006, p.26.</ref> Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action.<ref>Weir 2006, p.243.</ref> Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence.<ref>Mortimer, 2004, p.36.</ref>\n\n==Queenship==\nAs queen, the young Isabella faced numerous challenges. Edward was handsome, but highly unconventional, possibly forming close romantic attachments to first [[Piers Gaveston]] and then [[Hugh Despenser the younger]]. Edward found himself at odds with the barons, too, in particular his first cousin [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court, and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges; she successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death at the hands of the barons her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using an ever more brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger. By 1326 Isabella found herself at increasing odds with both Edward and Hugh, ultimately resulting in Isabella's own bid for power and the invasion of England.<ref>For a summary of this period, see Weir 2006, chapters 2\u20136; Mortimer, 2006, chapter 1; Doherty, chapters 1\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Fall of Gaveston: 1308\u20131312===\n[[File:Guy de Beauchamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Isabella was able to come to an understanding with her husband's first favourite [[Piers Gaveston]], shown here lying dead at the feet of [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Guy de Beauchamp]], in a 15th-century representation.]]\n\nEdward was an unusual character by medieval standards. Edward looked the part of a [[Plantagenet]] king to perfection. He was tall, athletic, and wildly popular at the beginning of his reign.<ref>Weir 2006, p.39.</ref> He rejected most of the traditional pursuits of a king for the period&nbsp;\u2013 [[jousting]], hunting and warfare&nbsp;\u2013 and instead enjoyed music, poetry and many [[rural crafts]].<ref name=\"Weir, p.37\">Weir 2006, p.37.</ref> Furthermore, there is the question of Edward's sexuality in a period when [[homosexuality]] of any sort was considered a very serious crime, but there is no direct evidence of his sexual orientation. However, contemporary chroniclers made much of his close affinity with a succession of male [[favourite]]s; some condemned Edward for loving them \"beyond measure\" and \"uniquely\", others explicitly referring to an \"illicit and sinful union\".<ref name=DohertyP37>Doherty, p.37.</ref> Nonetheless, Isabella bore four children by Edward, leading to an opinion amongst some historians that Edward's affairs with his male favourites may have been [[Platonic love|platonic]].<ref name=DohertyP37/>\n\nWhen Isabella first arrived in England following her marriage, her husband was already in the midst of a relationship with Piers Gaveston, an \"arrogant, ostentatious\" soldier, with a \"reckless and headstrong\" personality that clearly appealed to Edward.<ref>Doherty, p.38.</ref> Isabella, then aged twelve, was effectively sidelined by the pair. Edward chose to sit with Gaveston rather than Isabella at their wedding celebration,<ref>Doherty, p.46.</ref> causing grave offence to her uncles [[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]], and [[Charles, Count of Valois]],<ref name=\"Weir, p.37\"/> and then refused to grant her either her own lands or her own household.<ref name=DohertyP47>Doherty, p.47.</ref> Edward also gave Isabella's own jewelry to Gaveston, which he wore publicly.<ref>{{cite book | title=Queens Consort, England's Medieval Queens | last=Hilton | first=Lisa | authorlink=Lisa Hilton (writer) | page=247 | year=2008 | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nichelson | location=Great Britain | isbn=978-0-7538-2611-9 }}</ref> It took the intervention of Isabella's father, Philip IV, before Edward began to provide for her more appropriately.<ref name=DohertyP47/>\n\nIsabella's relationship with Gaveston was a complex one. Baronial opposition to Gaveston, championed by Thomas of Lancaster, was increasing, and Philip IV began to covertly fund this grouping, using Isabella and her household as intermediaries.<ref>Doherty, pp47-8.</ref> Edward was forced to exile Gaveston to Ireland for a period, and began to show Isabella much greater respect and assigning her significant lands and patronage; in turn, Philip ceased his support for the barons. Gaveston eventually returned from Ireland, and by 1309\u201311 the three seemed to be co-existing together relatively comfortably.<ref name=DohertyP49>Doherty, p.49.</ref> Indeed, Gaveston's key enemy, Thomas of Lancaster, considered Isabella to be an ally of Gaveston's.<ref name=DohertyP49/> Isabella had begun to build up her own supporters at court, principally the de Beaumont family, itself opposed to the Lancastrians; originating, like her, from France, the senior member of the family, [[Isabella de Vesci]], had been a close confidant of Edward's mother [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]]; supported by her brother, [[Henry de Beaumont]], Isabella de Vesci became a close friend of Queen Isabella in turn.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nDuring 1311, however, Edward conducted a failed campaign against the Scots, during which Isabella and he only just escaped capture. In the aftermath, the barons rose up, signing the [[Ordinances of 1311]], which promised action against Gaveston and expelled Isabella de Vesci and Henry de Beaumont from court.<ref name=WeirP58>Weir 2006, p.58.</ref> 1312 saw a descent into civil war against the king;\u2013 Isabella stood with Edward, sending angry letters to her uncles d'\u00c9vreux and de Valois asking for support.<ref name=WeirP58/> Edward left Isabella, rather against her will, at [[Tynemouth Priory]] in Northumberland whilst he unsuccessfully attempted to fight the barons.<ref>Weir 2006, p.63.</ref> The campaign was a disaster, and although Edward escaped, Gaveston found himself stranded at [[Scarborough Castle]], where his baronial enemies first surrounded and captured him. [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Guy de Beauchamp]] and Thomas of Lancaster ensured Gaveston's execution as he was being taken south to rejoin Edward.<ref>Doherty, p.51.</ref>\n\n===Tensions grow: 1312\u20131321===\nTensions mounted steadily over the decade. In 1312, Isabella gave birth to the future [[Edward III]], but by the end of the year Edward's court was beginning to change. Edward was still relying upon his French in-laws&nbsp;\u2013 Isabella's uncle Louis, for example, had been sent from Paris to assist him&nbsp;\u2013 but [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester|Hugh Despenser the elder]] now formed part of the inner circle, marking the beginning of the Despensers' increased prominence at Edward's court.<ref>Doherty, p.54.</ref> The Despensers were opposed to both the Lancastrians and their other allies in the [[Welsh Marches]], making an easy alliance with Edward, who sought revenge for the death of Gaveston.<ref>Weir 2006, p.68.</ref>\n\nIn 1313, Isabella travelled to Paris with Edward to garner further French support, which resulted in the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]. The journey was a pleasant one, with lots of festivities, although Isabella was injured when her tent burned down.<ref>Doherty, p.56.</ref> During the visit her brothers Louis and Charles had had a satirical [[Puppetry|puppet show]] put on for their guests, and after this Isabella had given new embroidered [[Coin purse|purses]] both to her brothers and to their wives.<ref name=WeirP92>Weir 2006, p.92.</ref> Isabella and Edward then returned to England with new assurances of French support against the English barons. Later in the year, however, Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return and Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two [[Norman people|Norman]] knights, Gautier and Philippe d'Aunay.<ref name=WeirP92/> Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314.<ref>Weir 2006, p.92, 99.</ref> The consequence of this was the Tour de Nesle Affair in Paris, which led to legal action against all three of Isabella's sisters-in-law; [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] were imprisoned for life for adultery. [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]] was imprisoned for a year. Isabella's reputation in France suffered somewhat as a result of her perceived role in the affair.\n\nIn the north, however, the situation was turning worse. Edward attempted to quash the Scots in a fresh campaign in 1314, resulting in the disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Edward was blamed by the barons for the catastrophic failure of the campaign. Thomas of Lancaster reacted to the defeats in Scotland by taking increased power in England and turning against Isabella, cutting off funds and harassing her household.<ref>Doherty, p.60.</ref> To make matters worse, the \"[[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317|Great Famine]]\" descended on England during 1315\u201317, causing widespread loss of life and financial problems.<ref name=DohertyP61>Doherty, p.61.</ref>\n\nDespite Isabella giving birth to her second son, [[John of Eltham, Earl of Cornwall|John]], in 1316, Edward's position was precarious. Indeed, [[John Deydras]], a royal Pretender, appeared in [[Oxford]], claiming to have been switched with Edward at birth, and to be the real king of England himself.<ref>Doherty, pp.60\u20131.</ref> Given Edward's unpopularity, the rumours spread considerably before Deydras' eventual execution, and appear to have greatly upset Isabella. Isabella responded by deepening her alliance with Lancaster's enemy Henry de Beaumont and by taking up an increased role in government herself, including attending council meetings and acquiring increased lands.<ref>Doherty, pp.61\u20132.</ref> Henry's sister, Isabella de Vesci, continued to remain a close adviser to the Queen.<ref name=DohertyP61/> The Scottish general [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas|Sir James Douglas]], war leader for [[Robert I of Scotland]], made a bid to capture Isabella personally in 1319, almost [[James Douglas, Lord of Douglas#Myton and Byland|capturing her at York]]&nbsp;\u2013 Isabella only just escaped.<ref>Doherty, p.62.</ref> Suspicions fell on Lancaster, and one of Edward's knights, Edmund Darel, was arrested on charges of having betrayed her location, but the charges were essentially unproven.<ref name=DohertyP64>Doherty, p.64.</ref> In 1320, Isabella accompanied Edward to France, to try and convince her brother, Philip V, to provide fresh support to crush the English barons.<ref name=DohertyP64/>\n\nMeanwhile, Hugh de Despenser the younger became an increasing favourite of Isabella's husband, and was believed by some to have begun a sexual relationship with him around this time.<ref>Weir 2006, p.120.</ref> Hugh was the same age as Edward. His father, Hugh the elder, had supported Edward and Gaveston a few years previously.<ref>Doherty, p.65.</ref> The Despensers were bitter enemies of Lancaster, and with Edward's support began to increase their power base in the Welsh Marches, in the process making enemies of [[Roger Mortimer de Chirk]] and his nephew, [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer of Wigmore]], their rival [[Marcher Lord]]s.<ref>Doherty, p.66.</ref> Whilst Isabella had been able to work with Gaveston, Edward's previous favourite, it became increasingly clear that Hugh the younger and Isabella could not work out a similar compromise. Unfortunately for Isabella, she was still estranged from Lancaster's rival faction, giving her little room to manoeuvre.<ref>Doherty, p.67.</ref> In 1321, Lancaster's alliance moved against the Despensers, sending troops into London and demanding their exile. [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], a moderate baron with strong French links, asked Isabella to intervene in an attempt to prevent war;<ref>Weir 2006, p.132.</ref> Isabella publicly went down on her knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers, providing him with a face-saving excuse to do so, but Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.<ref>Doherty, p.67; Weir 2006, p.132.</ref>\n\n===Return of the Despensers, 1321\u20131326===\nDespite the momentary respite delivered by Isabella, by the autumn of 1321, the tensions between the two factions of Edward, Isabella and the Despenser, opposing the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with forces still mobilised across the country.<ref>Doherty, p.70.</ref> At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to [[Canterbury]], during which she left the traditional route to stop at [[Leeds Castle]] in Kent, a fortification held by [[Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere|Bartholomew de Badlesmere]], steward of the King's household who had by 1321 joined the ranks of Edward's opponents. Some historians believe that the pilgrimage was a deliberate act by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a ''[[casus belli]]''.<ref>Doherty, p.70-1; Weir 2006, p.133.</ref> Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife [[Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere]] in charge of the castle. When the latter adamantly refused the Queen admittance, fighting broke out outside the castle between Isabella's guards and the garrison, marking the beginning of the [[Despenser War]].<ref name=DohertyP71>Doherty, p.71.</ref> Whilst Edward mobilised his own faction and placed Leeds Castle under siege, Isabella was given the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] and assumed control of the royal [[Court of Chancery#Origins|Chancery]] from the [[Tower of London]].<ref name=DohertyP71/> After surrendering to Edward's forces on 31 October 1321, Margaret, Baroness Badlesmere and her children were sent to the Tower, and 13 of the Leeds garrison were hanged. By January 1322, Edward's army, reinforced by the Despensers returning from exile, had forced the surrender of the Mortimers, and by March Lancaster himself had been captured after the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]]; Lancaster was promptly executed, leaving Edward and the Despensers victorious.<ref>Doherty, pp72-3.</ref>\n\n[[File:TynemouthPriory2005-03-08 1.jpg|thumb|[[Tynemouth Priory]], seen from the sea, where Isabella escaped the Scots army following the disastrous campaign of 1322.]]\nHugh Despenser the younger was now firmly ensconced as Edward's new favourite and together over the next four years Edward and the Despensers imposed a harsh rule over England, a \"sweeping revenge\"<ref>Weir 2006, p.138.</ref> characterised by land confiscation, large-scale imprisonment, executions and the punishment of extended family members, including women and the elderly.<ref>Doherty, pp74-5.</ref> This was condemned by contemporary chroniclers, and is felt to have caused concern to Isabella as well;<ref>Doherty, p.73.</ref> some of those widows being persecuted included her friends.<ref>Weir 2006, p.143.</ref> Isabella's relationship with Despenser the younger continued to deteriorate; the Despensers refused to pay her monies owed to her, or return her castles at [[Marlborough Castle|Marlborough]] and [[Devizes Castle|Devizes]].<ref>Weir 2006, p.144.</ref> Indeed, various authors have suggested that there is evidence that Hugh Despenser the younger may have attempted to assault Isabella herself in some fashion.<ref>Weir 2006, p.149.</ref> Certainly, immediately after the Battle of Boroughbridge, Edward began to be markedly less generous in his gifts towards Isabella, and none of the spoils of the war were awarded to her.<ref>Doherty, p.75.</ref> Worse still, later in the year Isabella was caught up in the failure of another of Edward's campaigns in Scotland, in a way that permanently poisoned her relationship with both Edward and the Despensers.\n\nIsabella and Edward had travelled north together at the start of the autumn campaign; before the disastrous [[Battle of Old Byland]] in Yorkshire, Edward had ridden south, apparently to raise more men, sending Isabella east to [[Tynemouth Castle and Priory|Tynemouth Priory]].<ref>Doherty, pp.76\u20137.</ref> With the Scottish army marching south, Isabella expressed considerable concern about her personal safety and requested assistance from Edward. Her husband initially proposed sending Despenser forces to secure her, but Isabella rejected this outright, instead requesting friendly troops. Rapidly retreating south with the Despensers, Edward failed to grasp the situation, with the result that Isabella found herself and her household cut off from the south by the Scottish army, with the coastline patrolled by [[Flemish]] naval forces allied to the Scots.<ref name=DohertyP77>Doherty, p.77.</ref> The situation was precarious and Isabella was forced to use a group of squires from her personal retinue to hold off the advancing army whilst other of her knights commandeered a ship; the fighting continued as Isabella and her household retreated onto the vessel, resulting in the death of two of her ladies-in-waiting.<ref name=DohertyP77/> Once aboard, Isabella evaded the Flemish navy, landing further south and making her way to York.<ref name=DohertyP77/> Isabella was furious, both with Edward for, from her perspective, abandoning her to the Scots, and with Despensers for convincing Edward to retreat rather than sending help.<ref name=DohertyP78>Doherty, p.78.</ref> For his part, Edward blamed [[Lewis de Beaumont]], the [[Bishop of Durham]] and an ally of Isabella, for the fiasco.<ref name=DohertyP78/>\n\nIsabella effectively separated from Edward from here onwards, leaving him to live with Hugh Despenser. At the end of 1322, Isabella left the court on a ten-month-long pilgrimage around England by herself.<ref name=DohertyP79>Doherty, p.79.</ref> On her return in 1323 she visited Edward briefly, but refused to take a loyalty oath to the Despensers and was removed from the process of granting royal patronage.<ref name=DohertyP79/> At the end of 1324, as tensions grew with Isabella's homeland of France, Edward and the Despensers confiscated all of Isabella's lands, took over the running of her household and arrested and imprisoned all of her French staff. Isabella's youngest children were removed from her and placed into the custody of the Despensers.<ref>Doherty, p.80.</ref> At this point, Isabella appears to have realised that any hope of working with Edward was effectively over and begun to consider radical solutions.\n\n==Invasion of England==\nBy 1325, Isabella was facing increasing pressure from Hugh Despenser the Younger, Edward's new royal favourite. With her lands in England seized, her children taken away from her and her household staff arrested, Isabella began to pursue other options. When her brother, King Charles IV of France, seized Edward's French possessions in 1325, she returned to France, initially as a delegate of the King charged with negotiating a peace treaty between the two nations. However, her presence in France became a focal point for the many nobles opposed to Edward's reign. Isabella gathered an army to oppose Edward, in alliance with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, whom she may have taken as a lover. Isabella and Mortimer returned to England with a mercenary army, seizing the country in a lightning campaign. The Despensers were executed and Edward was forced to abdicate&nbsp;\u2013 his eventual fate and possible murder remains a matter of considerable historical debate. Isabella ruled as regent until 1330, when her son, Edward deposed Mortimer in turn and ruled directly in his own right.{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=312-313}}\n\n===Tensions in Gascony, 1323\u20131325===\n[[File:Isabela Karel Eda.jpg|thumb|upright|A near-contemporary [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] showing the future [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] giving homage to [[Charles IV of France]] under the guidance of Edward's mother, and Charles' sister, Isabella, in 1325.<ref>Ainsworth, p.3.</ref>]]\n\nIsabella's husband Edward, as the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France for his lands in [[Gascony]].<ref name=HolmesP16>Holmes, p.16.</ref> Isabella's three brothers each had only short reigns, and Edward had successfully avoided paying homage to Louis X, and had only paid homage to Philip V under great pressure.

Charles sent a message through [[Pope John XXII]] to Edward, suggesting that he was willing to reverse the forfeiture of the lands if Edward ceded the Agenais and paid homage for the rest of the lands:<ref>Sumption, p.97.</ref> the Pope proposed Isabella as an ambassador. Isabella, however, saw this as a perfect opportunity to resolve her situation with Edward and the Despensers.\n\nHaving promised to return to England by the summer, Isabella reached Paris in March 1325, and rapidly agreed a truce in Gascony, under which Prince Edward, then thirteen years old, would come to France to give homage on his father's behalf.<ref name=DohertyP81>Doherty, p.81.</ref> Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September.

Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323, making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice to get down to the [[River Thames]], across the river and then on eventually to safety in France.<ref>Weir 2006, p.153.</ref> Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape and some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.<ref>Weir 2006, p.154; see Mortimer, 2004 pp128-9 for the alternative perspective.</ref>\n\nIsabella was reintroduced to Mortimer in Paris by her cousin, [[Joan of Valois (1294\u20131352)|Joan, Countess of Hainault]], who appears to have approached Isabella suggesting a marital alliance between their two families, marrying Prince Edward to Joan's daughter, [[Philippa of Hainault|Philippa]].<ref>Weir 2006, p.194.</ref> Mortimer and Isabella may have begun a physical relationship from December 1325 onwards; If so Isabella was taking a huge risk in doing so&nbsp;\u2013 female infidelity was a very serious offence in medieval Europe, as shown during the Tour de Nesle Affair&nbsp;\u2013 both Isabella's former French sisters-in-law had died by 1326 as a result of their imprisonment for exactly this offence.<ref>A point born out by Mortimer, 2004, p.140.</ref> Isabella's motivation has been the subject of discussion by historians; some believe that there was a strong sexual attraction between the two, that they shared an interest in the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] and that they both enjoyed fine art and high living.<ref>Weir 2006, p.197.</ref> One historian has described their relationship as one of the \"great romances of the Middle Ages\".<ref>Mortimer, 2004, p.141.</ref> They also shared a common enemy&nbsp;\u2013 the regime of Edward II and the Despensers.\n\nTaking Prince Edward with them, Isabella and Mortimer left the French court in summer 1326 and travelled north to [[William I, Count of Hainaut]].

They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawn and quartered]] as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England.

This was then confirmed at the [[Parliament of 1327|next parliament]], dominated by Isabella and Mortimer's followers. The session was held in January 1327, with Isabella's case being led by her supporter [[Adam Orleton]], [[Bishop of Hereford]]. Isabella's son, Prince Edward, was confirmed as Edward III of England, with his mother appointed regent.<ref>Doherty, pp 114\u201315.</ref> Isabella's position was still precarious, as the legal basis for deposing Edward was doubtful and many lawyers of the day maintained that Edward II was still the rightful king, regardless of the declaration of the Parliament. The situation could be reversed at any moment and Edward II was known to be a vengeful ruler.\n\nEdward II's subsequent fate, and Isabella's role in it, remains hotly contested by historians. The minimally agreed version of events is that Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved from [[Kenilworth Castle]] in the Midlands to the safer location of [[Berkeley Castle]] in the Welsh borders, where he was put into the custody of [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley|Lord Berkeley]]. On 23 September, Isabella and Edward III were informed by messenger that Edward had died whilst imprisoned at the castle, because of a \"fatal accident\". Edward's body was apparently buried at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], with his heart being given in a casket to Isabella. After the funeral, there were rumours for many years that Edward had survived and was really alive somewhere in Europe, some of which were captured in the famous [[Fieschi Letter]] written in the 1340s, although no concrete evidence ever emerged to support the allegations. There are, however, various historical interpretations of the events surrounding this basic sequence of events.\n\n[[File:Berkeley Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Berkeley Castle]], where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] was popularly said to have been murdered on the orders of Isabella and Mortimer; some current scholarship disputes this interpretation.]]\nAccording to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted to murder Edward in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in {{lang-la|Eduardum occidere nolite timere bonum est}}) which, depending on where the comma was inserted, could mean either \"Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good\" or \"Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear\".  In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot [[Fireplace poker|poker]] have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded [[Joan of Arc]] and other near contemporaries after their deaths.\n\nThree recent historians, however, have offered an alternative interpretation of events. [[Paul C. Doherty|Paul Doherty]], drawing extensively on the Fieschi Letter of the 1340s, has argued that Edward in fact escaped from Berkeley Castle with the help of William Ockle, a knight whom Doherty argues subsequently pretended to be Edward in disguise around Europe, using the name \"William the Welshman\" to draw attention away from the real Edward himself. In this interpretation, a look-alike was buried at Gloucester.<ref>Doherty, pp 213\u201315.</ref> [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]], focusing more on contemporary documents from 1327 itself, argues that Roger de Mortimer engineered a fake \"escape\" for Edward from Berkeley Castle; after this Edward was kept in Ireland, believing he was really evading Mortimer, before finally finding himself free, but politically unwelcome, after the fall of Isabella and Mortimer. In this version, Edward makes his way to Europe, before subsequently being buried at Gloucester.<ref>Mortimer, 2004, pp 244\u2013264; Mortimer, 2006, appendix 2.</ref> Finally, [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]], again drawing on the Fieschi Letter, has recently argued that Edward II escaped his captors, killing one in the process, and lived as a hermit for many years; in this interpretation, the body in Gloucester Cathedral is of Edward's dead captor. In all of these versions, it is argued that it suited Isabella and Mortimer to publicly claim that Edward was dead, even if they were aware of the truth. Other historians, however, including [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]], have criticised the methodology behind this revisionist approach and disagree with the conclusions.<ref>See Carpenter 2007a, Carpenter 2007b.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nIsabella and Mortimer ruled together for four years, with Isabella's period as regent marked by the acquisition of huge sums of money and land. When their political alliance with the Lancastrians began to disintegrate, Isabella continued to support Mortimer. Isabella fell from power when her son, Edward III deposed Mortimer in a coup, taking back royal authority for himself. Unlike Mortimer, Isabella survived the transition of power, however, remaining a wealthy and influential member of the English court, albeit never returning directly to active politics.<ref>For a summary of this period, see Weir 2006, chapter 11; Doherty, chapter 8; Mortimer, 2006, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n===As regent, 1326\u20131330===\n[[File:Isabella and Roger Mortimer.jpg|thumb|15th-century manuscript illustration that depicts Isabella and allegedly [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]] at [[Hereford]]; the execution of [[Hugh Despenser the younger]] can be seen in the background.]]\nIsabella's reign as regent lasted only four years, before the fragile political alliance that had brought her and Mortimer to power disintegrated. 1328 saw the marriage of Isabella's son, Edward III to Philippa of Hainault, as agreed before the invasion of 1326; the lavish ceremony was held in London to popular acclaim.<ref>Doherty, p.142.</ref> Isabella and Mortimer had already begun a trend that continued over the next few years, in starting to accumulate huge wealth. With her lands restored to her, Isabella was already exceptionally rich, but she began to accumulate yet more. Within the first few weeks, Isabella had granted herself almost \u00a312,000;<ref>Weir 2006, p.245.</ref> finding that Edward's royal treasury contained \u00a360,000, a rapid period of celebratory spending then ensued.<ref>Weir 2006, p.248.</ref> Isabella soon awarded herself another \u00a320,000, allegedly to pay off foreign debts.<ref>Weir 2006, p.249.</ref> At Edward III's coronation, Isabella then extended her land holdings from a value of \u00a34,400 each year to the huge sum of \u00a313,333, making her one of the largest landowners in the kingdom.<ref>Weir 2006, p.259.</ref> Isabella also refused to hand over her [[dower]] lands to Philippa after her marriage to Edward III, in contravention of usual custom.<ref>Weir 2006, p.303.</ref> Isabella's lavish lifestyle matched her new incomes.<ref>Weir 2006, p.258.</ref> Mortimer, in effect her first minister, after a restrained beginning, also began to accumulate lands and titles at a tremendous rate, particularly in the Marcher territories.<ref>Doherty, p.156.</ref>\n\nThe new regime also faced some key foreign policy dilemmas, which Isabella approached from a [[Political realism|realist]] perspective.<ref name=\"Weir, p.261\">Weir 2006, p.261.</ref> The first of these was the situation in Scotland, where Edward II's unsuccessful policies had left an unfinished, tremendously expensive war. Isabella was committed to bringing this issue to a conclusion by diplomatic means. Edward III initially opposed this policy, before eventually relenting,<ref>Weir 2006, p.304.</ref> leading to the [[Treaty of Edinburgh\u2013Northampton|Treaty of Northampton]]. Under this treaty, Isabella's daughter Joan would marry [[David II of Scotland|David Bruce]] (heir apparent to the Scottish throne) and Edward III would renounce any claims on Scottish lands, in exchange for the promise of Scottish military aid against any enemy except the French, and \u00a320,000 in compensation for the raids across northern England. No compensation would be given to those earls who had lost their Scottish estates, and the compensation would be taken by Isabella.<ref>Weir 2006, p.305, p.313.</ref> Although strategically successful and, historically at least, \"a successful piece of policy making\",<ref>Weir 2006, p.306.</ref> Isabella's Scottish policy was by no means popular and contributed to the general sense of discontent with the regime. Secondly, the Gascon situation, still unresolved from Edward II's reign, also posed an issue. Isabella reopened negotiations in Paris, resulting in a peace treaty under which the bulk of Gascony, minus the Agenais, would be returned to England in exchange for a 50,000 [[Mark (money)|mark]] penalty.<ref>Weir 2006, p.261; Neillands, p.32.</ref> The treaty was not popular in England because of the Agenais clause.<ref name=\"Weir, p.261\"/>\n\nHenry of Lancaster was amongst the first to break with Isabella and Mortimer. By 1327 Lancaster was irritated by Mortimer's behaviour and Isabella responded by beginning to sideline him from her government.<ref>Weir 2006, p.307.</ref> Lancaster was furious over the passing of the Treaty of Northampton, and refused to attend court,<ref>Weir 2006, p.314.</ref> mobilising support amongst the commoners of London.<ref>Weir 2006, p.315.</ref> Isabella responded to the problems by undertaking a wide reform of royal administration, local law enforcement.<ref name=WeirP309>Weir 2006, p.309.</ref> In a move guaranteed to appeal to domestic opinion, Isabella also decided to pursue Edward III's [[English claims to the French throne|claim on the French throne]], sending her advisers to France to demand official recognition of his claim.<ref name=WeirP309/> The French nobility were unimpressed and, since Isabella lacked the funds to begin any military campaign, she began to court the opinion of France's neighbours, including proposing the marriage of her son John to the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family.<ref>Weir 2006, p.310.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1328 the situation had descended into near civil war once again, with Lancaster mobilising his army against Isabella and Mortimer.<ref>Weir 2006, p.322.</ref> In January 1329 Isabella's forces under Mortimer's command took Lancaster's stronghold of [[Leicester]], followed by [[Bedford]]; Isabella&nbsp;\u2013 wearing armour, and mounted on a warhorse&nbsp;\u2013 and Edward III marched rapidly north, resulting in Lancaster's surrender. He escaped death but was subjected to a colossal fine, effectively crippling his power.<ref>Weir 2006, p.322; Mortimer, 2004, p.218.</ref> Isabella was merciful to those who had aligned themselves with him, although some&nbsp;\u2013 such as her old supporter Henry de Beaumont, whose family had split from Isabella over the peace with Scotland, which had lost them huge land holdings in Scotland<ref>Doherty, p.149.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 fled to France.<ref>Weir 2006, p.333.</ref>\n\nDespite Lancaster's defeat, however, discontent continued to grow. [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund of Kent]] had sided with Isabella in 1326, but had since begun to question his decision and was edging back towards Edward II, his half-brother. Edmund of Kent was in conversations with other senior nobles questioning Isabella's rule, including Henry de Beaumont and Isabella de Vesci. Edmund was finally involved in a conspiracy in 1330, allegedly to restore Edward II, who, he claimed, was still alive: Isabella and Mortimer broke up the conspiracy, arresting Edmund and other supporters&nbsp;\u2013 including [[Simon Mepeham]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Doherty, p.151.</ref> Edmund may have expected a pardon, possibly from Edward III, but Isabella was insistent on his execution.<ref>Doherty, p.152.</ref> The execution itself was a fiasco after the executioner refused to attend and Edmund of Kent had to be killed by a local dung-collector, who had been himself sentenced to death and was pardoned as a bribe to undertake the beheading.<ref>Doherty, p.153.</ref> Isabella de Vesci escaped punishment, despite having been closely involved in the plot.\n\n===Mortimer's fall from power, 1330===\nBy mid-1330, Isabella and Mortimer's regime was increasingly insecure, and Isabella's son, Edward III, was growing frustrated at Mortimer's grip on power. Various historians, with different levels of confidence, have also suggested that in late 1329 Isabella became pregnant. A child of Mortimer's with royal blood would have proved both politically inconvenient for Isabella, and challenging to Edward's own position.<ref>Weir 2006, p.326, is relatively cautious in this assertion; Mortimer, 2004 pp221-3 is more confident.</ref>\n\n[[File:Berkhamsted Castle Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berkhamsted Castle]], where Isabella was initially held after Mortimer and her fall from power in 1330.]]\nEdward quietly assembled a body of support from the Church and selected nobles,<ref>Doherty, pp158-9.</ref> whilst Isabella and Mortimer moved into [[Nottingham Castle]] for safety, surrounding themselves with loyal troops.<ref>Doherty, p.159.</ref> In the autumn, Mortimer was investigating another plot against him, when he challenged a young noble, [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]], during an interrogation. Mortimer declared that his word had priority over the king's, an alarming statement that Montagu reported back to Edward.<ref>Doherty, p.160.</ref> Edward was convinced that this was the moment to act, and on 19 October, Montagu led a force of twenty-three armed men into the castle by a secret tunnel. Up in the [[keep]], Isabella, Mortimer and other council members were discussing how to arrest Montagu, when Montagu and his men appeared.<ref name=DoheryP161>Doherty, p.161.</ref> Fighting broke out on the stairs and Mortimer was overwhelmed in his chamber. Isabella threw herself at Edward's feet, famously crying \"''Fair son, have pity on gentle Mortimer!''\"<ref name=DoheryP161/> Lancastrian troops rapidly took the rest of the castle, leaving Edward in control of his own government for the first time.\n\nParliament was convened the next month, where Mortimer was put on trial for treason.

[[Thomas Gray]], the 18th-century poet, combined Marlowe's depiction of Isabella with [[William Shakespeare]]'s description of [[Margaret of Anjou]] (the wife of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]) as the \"She-Wolf of France\", to produce the anti-French poem ''[[The Bard (poem)|The Bard]]'' (1757), in which Isabella rips apart the bowels of Edward II with her \"unrelenting fangs\".<ref name=WeirP2>Weir 2006, p. 2.</ref> The \"She-Wolf\" epithet stuck, and [[Bertolt Brecht]] re-used it in ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' (1923).<ref name=WeirP2/>\n\n===Film===\nIn [[Derek Jarman]]'s film [[Edward II (film)|''Edward II'']] (1991), based on Marlowe's play, Isabella is portrayed (by actress [[Tilda Swinton]]) as a \"femme fatale\" whose thwarted love for Edward causes her to turn against him and steal his throne. In contrast to the negative depictions, [[Mel Gibson]]'s film ''[[Braveheart]]'' (1995) portrays Isabella (played by the French actress [[Sophie Marceau]]) more sympathetically.

She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of [[Philip IV of France]] and [[Joan I of Navarre]]. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She became a \"[[femme fatale]]\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] figure.\n\nIsabella arrived in England at the age of 12{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=227}} during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful [[baron]]ial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his [[favourite]], [[Piers Gaveston]], but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall#Return and death|the death of Gaveston]] at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward later turned to a new favourite, [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the [[Despenser War]] and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser and by 1325 her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\n\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small [[mercenary]] army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming [[regent]] on behalf of her son, [[Edward III]]. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the [[Edward II of England#Death|murder of Edward II]]. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|wars with Scotland]].\n\nIn 1330, aged 18, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority, and Mortimer was executed. Isabella lost her regency and was put under arrest for two years,{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=312-313}} but afterwards she lived for many years in considerable style; though she did not reside at court, she often visited to see her grandchildren.\n\n==Early life and marriage: 1295\u20131308==\n[[File:Philip iv and family.jpg|thumb|300px|Isabella's French family, depicted in 1315: l-r: Isabella's brothers, [[Charles IV of France|Charles]] and [[Philip V of France|Philip]], Isabella herself, her father, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], her brother [[Louis X of France|Louis]], and her uncle, [[Charles of Valois]]. [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]].]]\nIsabella was born in [[Paris]] on an uncertain date&nbsp;\u2013 on the basis of the chroniclers and the eventual date of her marriage, she was probably born between May and November 1295. She is described as born in 1292 in the Annals of Wigmore, and [[Piers Langtoft]] agrees, claiming that she was 7 years old in 1299. The French chronicler [[Guillaume de Nangis]] and English chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] describe her as 12 years old at the time of her marriage in January 1308, placing her birth between January 1295 and of 1296. A papal dispensation by [[Clement V]] in November 1305 permitted her immediate [[marriage by proxy]], despite the fact that she was probably only 10 years old. Since she had to reach the canonical age of 7 before her betrothal in May 1303, and that of 12 before her marriage in January 1308, the evidence suggests that she was born between May and November 1295.<ref>See Weir 2006, pp8-9.</ref> Her parents were King [[Philip IV of France]] and Queen [[Joan I of Navarre]]; her brothers [[Louis X of France|Louis]], [[Philip V of France|Philip]] and [[Charles IV of France|Charles]] became kings of France.\n\nIsabella was born into a royal family that ruled the most powerful state in [[Western Europe]]. Her father, King Philip, known as ''\"le Bel\"'' (the Fair) because of his good looks, was a strangely unemotional man; contemporaries described him as \"neither a man nor a beast, but a statue\";<ref>Weir 2006, p.11.</ref> modern historians have noted that he \"cultivated a reputation for Christian kingship and showed few weaknesses of the flesh\".<ref>Jones and McKitterick, p.394.</ref> Philip built up [[Centralized government|centralised royal power]] in France, engaging in a sequence of conflicts to expand or consolidate French authority across the region, but remained chronically short of money throughout his reign. Indeed, he appeared almost obsessed about building up wealth and lands, something that his daughter was also accused of in later life.<ref>Weir 2006, p.12.</ref> Isabella's mother died when Isabella was still quite young; some contemporaries suspected Philip IV of her murder, albeit probably incorrectly.<ref>Weir 2006, p.14.</ref>\n\n[[File:Seal of Edward II-2.jpg|thumb|left|Seal of Edward II]]\nIsabella was brought up in and around the [[Ch\u00e2teau du Louvre]] and the ''[[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]]'' in Paris.<ref name=WeirP13>Weir 2006, p.13.</ref> Isabella was cared for by Th\u00e9ophania de Saint-Pierre, her nurse, given a good education and taught to read, developing a love of books.<ref name=WeirP13/> As was customary for the period, all of Philip's children were married young for political benefit. Isabella was promised in marriage by her father to [[Edward II of England|Edward]], the infant son of King [[Edward I of England]], with the intention to resolve the conflicts between France and England over the latter's continental possession of [[Gascony]] and claims to [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]].<ref>Weir 2006, p.13-4.</ref> [[Pope Boniface VIII]] had urged the marriage as early as 1298 but was delayed by wrangling over the terms of the marriage contract. Edward I attempted to break the engagement several times for political advantage, and only after he died in 1307 did the wedding proceed.\n\nIsabella and Edward II were finally married at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] on 25 January 1308. Isabella's wardrobe gives some indications of her wealth and style&nbsp;\u2013 she had dresses of [[silk|baudekyn]], [[velvet]], [[taffeta]] and cloth, along with numerous furs; she had over 72 headdresses and [[coif]]s; she brought with her two gold crowns, gold and silver dinnerware and 419 yards of linen.<ref name=WeirP25>Weir 2006, p.25.</ref> At the time of her marriage, Isabella was probably about twelve and was described by [[Geoffrey of Paris]] as \"''the beauty of beauties... in the kingdom if not in all Europe.''\" This description was probably not simply flattery by a chronicler, since both Isabella's father and brothers were considered very handsome men by contemporaries, and her husband was to nickname her \"Isabella the Fair\".<ref name=WeirP25/> Isabella was said to resemble her father, and not her mother, [[queen regnant]] of Navarre, a plump, plain woman.<ref>Costain, p.82; Weir 2006, p.12.</ref> This indicates that Isabella was slender and pale-skinned, although the fashion at the time was for blonde, slightly full-faced women, and Isabella may well have followed this stereotype instead.<ref>Weir 2006, p.26.</ref> Throughout her career, Isabella was noted as charming and diplomatic, with a particular skill at convincing people to follow her courses of action.<ref>Weir 2006, p.243.</ref> Unusual for the medieval period, contemporaries also commented on her high intelligence.<ref>Mortimer, 2004, p.36.</ref>\n\n==Queenship==\nAs queen, the young Isabella faced numerous challenges. Edward was handsome, but highly unconventional, possibly forming close romantic attachments to first [[Piers Gaveston]] and then [[Hugh Despenser the younger]]. Edward found himself at odds with the barons, too, in particular his first cousin [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court, and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges; she successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death at the hands of the barons her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using an ever more brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger. By 1326 Isabella found herself at increasing odds with both Edward and Hugh, ultimately resulting in Isabella's own bid for power and the invasion of England.<ref>For a summary of this period, see Weir 2006, chapters 2\u20136; Mortimer, 2006, chapter 1; Doherty, chapters 1\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Fall of Gaveston: 1308\u20131312===\n[[File:Guy de Beauchamp.jpg|thumb|upright|Isabella was able to come to an understanding with her husband's first favourite [[Piers Gaveston]], shown here lying dead at the feet of [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Guy de Beauchamp]], in a 15th-century representation.]]\n\nEdward was an unusual character by medieval standards. Edward looked the part of a [[Plantagenet]] king to perfection. He was tall, athletic, and wildly popular at the beginning of his reign.<ref>Weir 2006, p.39.</ref> He rejected most of the traditional pursuits of a king for the period&nbsp;\u2013 [[jousting]], hunting and warfare&nbsp;\u2013 and instead enjoyed music, poetry and many [[rural crafts]].<ref name=\"Weir, p.37\">Weir 2006, p.37.</ref> Furthermore, there is the question of Edward's sexuality in a period when [[homosexuality]] of any sort was considered a very serious crime, but there is no direct evidence of his sexual orientation. However, contemporary chroniclers made much of his close affinity with a succession of male [[favourite]]s; some condemned Edward for loving them \"beyond measure\" and \"uniquely\", others explicitly referring to an \"illicit and sinful union\".<ref name=DohertyP37>Doherty, p.37.</ref> Nonetheless, Isabella bore four children by Edward, leading to an opinion amongst some historians that Edward's affairs with his male favourites may have been [[Platonic love|platonic]].<ref name=DohertyP37/>\n\nWhen Isabella first arrived in England following her marriage, her husband was already in the midst of a relationship with Piers Gaveston, an \"arrogant, ostentatious\" soldier, with a \"reckless and headstrong\" personality that clearly appealed to Edward.<ref>Doherty, p.38.</ref> Isabella, then aged twelve, was effectively sidelined by the pair. Edward chose to sit with Gaveston rather than Isabella at their wedding celebration,<ref>Doherty, p.46.</ref> causing grave offence to her uncles [[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]], and [[Charles, Count of Valois]],<ref name=\"Weir, p.37\"/> and then refused to grant her either her own lands or her own household.<ref name=DohertyP47>Doherty, p.47.</ref> Edward also gave Isabella's own jewelry to Gaveston, which he wore publicly.<ref>{{cite book | title=Queens Consort, England's Medieval Queens | last=Hilton | first=Lisa | authorlink=Lisa Hilton (writer) | page=247 | year=2008 | publisher=Weidenfeld & Nichelson | location=Great Britain | isbn=978-0-7538-2611-9 }}</ref> It took the intervention of Isabella's father, Philip IV, before Edward began to provide for her more appropriately.<ref name=DohertyP47/>\n\nIsabella's relationship with Gaveston was a complex one. Baronial opposition to Gaveston, championed by Thomas of Lancaster, was increasing, and Philip IV began to covertly fund this grouping, using Isabella and her household as intermediaries.<ref>Doherty, pp47-8.</ref> Edward was forced to exile Gaveston to Ireland for a period, and began to show Isabella much greater respect and assigning her significant lands and patronage; in turn, Philip ceased his support for the barons. Gaveston eventually returned from Ireland, and by 1309\u201311 the three seemed to be co-existing together relatively comfortably.<ref name=DohertyP49>Doherty, p.49.</ref> Indeed, Gaveston's key enemy, Thomas of Lancaster, considered Isabella to be an ally of Gaveston's.<ref name=DohertyP49/> Isabella had begun to build up her own supporters at court, principally the de Beaumont family, itself opposed to the Lancastrians; originating, like her, from France, the senior member of the family, [[Isabella de Vesci]], had been a close confidant of Edward's mother [[Eleanor of Castile|Eleanor]]; supported by her brother, [[Henry de Beaumont]], Isabella de Vesci became a close friend of Queen Isabella in turn.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nDuring 1311, however, Edward conducted a failed campaign against the Scots, during which Isabella and he only just escaped capture. In the aftermath, the barons rose up, signing the [[Ordinances of 1311]], which promised action against Gaveston and expelled Isabella de Vesci and Henry de Beaumont from court.<ref name=WeirP58>Weir 2006, p.58.</ref> 1312 saw a descent into civil war against the king;\u2013 Isabella stood with Edward, sending angry letters to her uncles d'\u00c9vreux and de Valois asking for support.<ref name=WeirP58/> Edward left Isabella, rather against her will, at [[Tynemouth Priory]] in Northumberland whilst he unsuccessfully attempted to fight the barons.<ref>Weir 2006, p.63.</ref> The campaign was a disaster, and although Edward escaped, Gaveston found himself stranded at [[Scarborough Castle]], where his baronial enemies first surrounded and captured him. [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Guy de Beauchamp]] and Thomas of Lancaster ensured Gaveston's execution as he was being taken south to rejoin Edward.<ref>Doherty, p.51.</ref>\n\n===Tensions grow: 1312\u20131321===\nTensions mounted steadily over the decade. In 1312, Isabella gave birth to the future [[Edward III]], but by the end of the year Edward's court was beginning to change. Edward was still relying upon his French in-laws&nbsp;\u2013 Isabella's uncle Louis, for example, had been sent from Paris to assist him&nbsp;\u2013 but [[Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester|Hugh Despenser the elder]] now formed part of the inner circle, marking the beginning of the Despensers' increased prominence at Edward's court.<ref>Doherty, p.54.</ref> The Despensers were opposed to both the Lancastrians and their other allies in the [[Welsh Marches]], making an easy alliance with Edward, who sought revenge for the death of Gaveston.<ref>Weir 2006, p.68.</ref>\n\nIn 1313, Isabella travelled to Paris with Edward to garner further French support, which resulted in the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]. The journey was a pleasant one, with lots of festivities, although Isabella was injured when her tent burned down.<ref>Doherty, p.56.</ref> During the visit her brothers Louis and Charles had had a satirical [[Puppetry|puppet show]] put on for their guests, and after this Isabella had given new embroidered [[Coin purse|purses]] both to her brothers and to their wives.<ref name=WeirP92>Weir 2006, p.92.</ref> Isabella and Edward then returned to England with new assurances of French support against the English barons. Later in the year, however, Isabella and Edward held a large dinner in London to celebrate their return and Isabella apparently noticed that the purses she had given to her sisters-in-law were now being carried by two [[Norman people|Norman]] knights, Gautier and Philippe d'Aunay.<ref name=WeirP92/> Isabella concluded that the pair must have been carrying on an illicit affair, and appears to have informed her father of this during her next visit to France in 1314.<ref>Weir 2006, p.92, 99.</ref> The consequence of this was the Tour de Nesle Affair in Paris, which led to legal action against all three of Isabella's sisters-in-law; [[Blanche of Burgundy|Blanche]] and [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] were imprisoned for life for adultery. [[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]] was imprisoned for a year. Isabella's reputation in France suffered somewhat as a result of her perceived role in the affair.\n\nIn the north, however, the situation was turning worse. Edward attempted to quash the Scots in a fresh campaign in 1314, resulting in the disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]]. Edward was blamed by the barons for the catastrophic failure of the campaign.

His father, Hugh the elder, had supported Edward and Gaveston a few years previously.<ref>Doherty, p.65.</ref> The Despensers were bitter enemies of Lancaster, and with Edward's support began to increase their power base in the Welsh Marches, in the process making enemies of [[Roger Mortimer de Chirk]] and his nephew, [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer of Wigmore]], their rival [[Marcher Lord]]s.<ref>Doherty, p.66.</ref> Whilst Isabella had been able to work with Gaveston, Edward's previous favourite, it became increasingly clear that Hugh the younger and Isabella could not work out a similar compromise. Unfortunately for Isabella, she was still estranged from Lancaster's rival faction, giving her little room to manoeuvre.<ref>Doherty, p.67.</ref> In 1321, Lancaster's alliance moved against the Despensers, sending troops into London and demanding their exile. [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke]], a moderate baron with strong French links, asked Isabella to intervene in an attempt to prevent war;<ref>Weir 2006, p.132.</ref> Isabella publicly went down on her knees to appeal to Edward to exile the Despensers, providing him with a face-saving excuse to do so, but Edward intended to arrange their return at the first opportunity.<ref>Doherty, p.67; Weir 2006, p.132.</ref>\n\n===Return of the Despensers, 1321\u20131326===\nDespite the momentary respite delivered by Isabella, by the autumn of 1321, the tensions between the two factions of Edward, Isabella and the Despenser, opposing the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with forces still mobilised across the country.<ref>Doherty, p.70.</ref> At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to [[Canterbury]], during which she left the traditional route to stop at [[Leeds Castle]] in Kent, a fortification held by [[Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere|Bartholomew de Badlesmere]], steward of the King's household who had by 1321 joined the ranks of Edward's opponents. Some historians believe that the pilgrimage was a deliberate act by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a ''[[casus belli]]''.<ref>Doherty, p.70-1; Weir 2006, p.133.</ref> Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife [[Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere]] in charge of the castle.

Her husband initially proposed sending Despenser forces to secure her, but Isabella rejected this outright, instead requesting friendly troops. Rapidly retreating south with the Despensers, Edward failed to grasp the situation, with the result that Isabella found herself and her household cut off from the south by the Scottish army, with the coastline patrolled by [[Flemish]] naval forces allied to the Scots.<ref name=DohertyP77>Doherty, p.77.</ref> The situation was precarious and Isabella was forced to use a group of squires from her personal retinue to hold off the advancing army whilst other of her knights commandeered a ship; the fighting continued as Isabella and her household retreated onto the vessel, resulting in the death of two of her ladies-in-waiting.<ref name=DohertyP77/> Once aboard, Isabella evaded the Flemish navy, landing further south and making her way to York.<ref name=DohertyP77/> Isabella was furious, both with Edward for, from her perspective, abandoning her to the Scots, and with Despensers for convincing Edward to retreat rather than sending help.<ref name=DohertyP78>Doherty, p.78.</ref> For his part, Edward blamed [[Lewis de Beaumont]], the [[Bishop of Durham]] and an ally of Isabella, for the fiasco.<ref name=DohertyP78/>\n\nIsabella effectively separated from Edward from here onwards, leaving him to live with Hugh Despenser. At the end of 1322, Isabella left the court on a ten-month-long pilgrimage around England by herself.<ref name=DohertyP79>Doherty, p.79.</ref> On her return in 1323 she visited Edward briefly, but refused to take a loyalty oath to the Despensers and was removed from the process of granting royal patronage.<ref name=DohertyP79/> At the end of 1324, as tensions grew with Isabella's homeland of France, Edward and the Despensers confiscated all of Isabella's lands, took over the running of her household and arrested and imprisoned all of her French staff. Isabella's youngest children were removed from her and placed into the custody of the Despensers.<ref>Doherty, p.80.</ref> At this point, Isabella appears to have realised that any hope of working with Edward was effectively over and begun to consider radical solutions.\n\n==Invasion of England==\nBy 1325, Isabella was facing increasing pressure from Hugh Despenser the Younger, Edward's new royal favourite. With her lands in England seized, her children taken away from her and her household staff arrested, Isabella began to pursue other options. When her brother, King Charles IV of France, seized Edward's French possessions in 1325, she returned to France, initially as a delegate of the King charged with negotiating a peace treaty between the two nations. However, her presence in France became a focal point for the many nobles opposed to Edward's reign. Isabella gathered an army to oppose Edward, in alliance with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, whom she may have taken as a lover. Isabella and Mortimer returned to England with a mercenary army, seizing the country in a lightning campaign. The Despensers were executed and Edward was forced to abdicate&nbsp;\u2013 his eventual fate and possible murder remains a matter of considerable historical debate. Isabella ruled as regent until 1330, when her son, Edward deposed Mortimer in turn and ruled directly in his own right.{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=312-313}}\n\n===Tensions in Gascony, 1323\u20131325===\n[[File:Isabela Karel Eda.jpg|thumb|upright|A near-contemporary [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] showing the future [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] giving homage to [[Charles IV of France]] under the guidance of Edward's mother, and Charles' sister, Isabella, in 1325.<ref>Ainsworth, p.3.</ref>]]\n\nIsabella's husband Edward, as the [[Duke of Aquitaine]], owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the King of France for his lands in [[Gascony]].<ref name=HolmesP16>Holmes, p.16.</ref> Isabella's three brothers each had only short reigns, and Edward had successfully avoided paying homage to Louis X, and had only paid homage to Philip V under great pressure.

Charles sent a message through [[Pope John XXII]] to Edward, suggesting that he was willing to reverse the forfeiture of the lands if Edward ceded the Agenais and paid homage for the rest of the lands:<ref>Sumption, p.97.</ref> the Pope proposed Isabella as an ambassador. Isabella, however, saw this as a perfect opportunity to resolve her situation with Edward and the Despensers.\n\nHaving promised to return to England by the summer, Isabella reached Paris in March 1325, and rapidly agreed a truce in Gascony, under which Prince Edward, then thirteen years old, would come to France to give homage on his father's behalf.<ref name=DohertyP81>Doherty, p.81.</ref> Prince Edward arrived in France, and gave homage in September.

Mortimer had been imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1322 following his capture by Edward during the Despenser wars. Mortimer's uncle, Roger Mortimer de Chirk finally died in prison, but Mortimer managed to escape the Tower in August 1323, making a hole in the stone wall of his cell and then escaping onto the roof, before using rope ladders provided by an accomplice to get down to the [[River Thames]], across the river and then on eventually to safety in France.<ref>Weir 2006, p.153.</ref> Victorian writers suggested that, given later events, Isabella might have helped Mortimer escape and some historians continue to argue that their relationship had already begun at this point, although most believe that there is no hard evidence for their having had a substantial relationship before meeting in Paris.<ref>Weir 2006, p.154; see Mortimer, 2004 pp128-9 for the alternative perspective.</ref>\n\nIsabella was reintroduced to Mortimer in Paris by her cousin, [[Joan of Valois (1294\u20131352)|Joan, Countess of Hainault]], who appears to have approached Isabella suggesting a marital alliance between their two families, marrying Prince Edward to Joan's daughter, [[Philippa of Hainault|Philippa]].<ref>Weir 2006, p.194.</ref> Mortimer and Isabella may have begun a physical relationship from December 1325 onwards; If so Isabella was taking a huge risk in doing so&nbsp;\u2013 female infidelity was a very serious offence in medieval Europe, as shown during the Tour de Nesle Affair&nbsp;\u2013 both Isabella's former French sisters-in-law had died by 1326 as a result of their imprisonment for exactly this offence.<ref>A point born out by Mortimer, 2004, p.140.</ref> Isabella's motivation has been the subject of discussion by historians; some believe that there was a strong sexual attraction between the two, that they shared an interest in the [[King Arthur|Arthurian legends]] and that they both enjoyed fine art and high living.<ref>Weir 2006, p.197.</ref> One historian has described their relationship as one of the \"great romances of the Middle Ages\".<ref>Mortimer, 2004, p.141.</ref> They also shared a common enemy&nbsp;\u2013 the regime of Edward II and the Despensers.\n\nTaking Prince Edward with them, Isabella and Mortimer left the French court in summer 1326 and travelled north to [[William I, Count of Hainaut]].

They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance on his skin. He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians.

This was then confirmed at the [[Parliament of 1327|next parliament]], dominated by Isabella and Mortimer's followers. The session was held in January 1327, with Isabella's case being led by her supporter [[Adam Orleton]], [[Bishop of Hereford]]. Isabella's son, Prince Edward, was confirmed as Edward III of England, with his mother appointed regent.<ref>Doherty, pp 114\u201315.</ref> Isabella's position was still precarious, as the legal basis for deposing Edward was doubtful and many lawyers of the day maintained that Edward II was still the rightful king, regardless of the declaration of the Parliament. The situation could be reversed at any moment and Edward II was known to be a vengeful ruler.\n\nEdward II's subsequent fate, and Isabella's role in it, remains hotly contested by historians. The minimally agreed version of events is that Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved from [[Kenilworth Castle]] in the Midlands to the safer location of [[Berkeley Castle]] in the Welsh borders, where he was put into the custody of [[Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley|Lord Berkeley]]. On 23 September, Isabella and Edward III were informed by messenger that Edward had died whilst imprisoned at the castle, because of a \"fatal accident\". Edward's body was apparently buried at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], with his heart being given in a casket to Isabella. After the funeral, there were rumours for many years that Edward had survived and was really alive somewhere in Europe, some of which were captured in the famous [[Fieschi Letter]] written in the 1340s, although no concrete evidence ever emerged to support the allegations. There are, however, various historical interpretations of the events surrounding this basic sequence of events.\n\n[[File:Berkeley Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Berkeley Castle]], where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] was popularly said to have been murdered on the orders of Isabella and Mortimer; some current scholarship disputes this interpretation.]]\nAccording to legend, Isabella and Mortimer famously plotted to murder Edward in such a way as not to draw blame on themselves, sending a famous order (in {{lang-la|Eduardum occidere nolite timere bonum est}}) which, depending on where the comma was inserted, could mean either \"Do not be afraid to kill Edward; it is good\" or \"Do not kill Edward; it is good to fear\".  In actuality, there is little evidence of anyone deciding to have Edward assassinated, and none whatsoever of the note having been written. Similarly, accounts of Edward being killed with a red-hot [[Fireplace poker|poker]] have no strong contemporary sources to support them. The conventional 20th-century view has been that Edward did die at Berkeley Castle, either murdered on Isabella's orders or of ill-health brought on by his captivity, and that subsequent accounts of his survival were simply rumours, similar to those that surrounded [[Joan of Arc]] and other near contemporaries after their deaths.\n\nThree recent historians, however, have offered an alternative interpretation of events. [[Paul C. Doherty|Paul Doherty]], drawing extensively on the Fieschi Letter of the 1340s, has argued that Edward in fact escaped from Berkeley Castle with the help of William Ockle, a knight whom Doherty argues subsequently pretended to be Edward in disguise around Europe, using the name \"William the Welshman\" to draw attention away from the real Edward himself. In this interpretation, a look-alike was buried at Gloucester.<ref>Doherty, pp 213\u201315.</ref> [[Ian Mortimer (historian)|Ian Mortimer]], focusing more on contemporary documents from 1327 itself, argues that Roger de Mortimer engineered a fake \"escape\" for Edward from Berkeley Castle; after this Edward was kept in Ireland, believing he was really evading Mortimer, before finally finding himself free, but politically unwelcome, after the fall of Isabella and Mortimer. In this version, Edward makes his way to Europe, before subsequently being buried at Gloucester.<ref>Mortimer, 2004, pp 244\u2013264; Mortimer, 2006, appendix 2.</ref> Finally, [[Alison Weir (historian)|Alison Weir]], again drawing on the Fieschi Letter, has recently argued that Edward II escaped his captors, killing one in the process, and lived as a hermit for many years; in this interpretation, the body in Gloucester Cathedral is of Edward's dead captor. In all of these versions, it is argued that it suited Isabella and Mortimer to publicly claim that Edward was dead, even if they were aware of the truth. Other historians, however, including [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]], have criticised the methodology behind this revisionist approach and disagree with the conclusions.<ref>See Carpenter 2007a, Carpenter 2007b.</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nIsabella and Mortimer ruled together for four years, with Isabella's period as regent marked by the acquisition of huge sums of money and land. When their political alliance with the Lancastrians began to disintegrate, Isabella continued to support Mortimer. Isabella fell from power when her son, Edward III deposed Mortimer in a coup, taking back royal authority for himself. Unlike Mortimer, Isabella survived the transition of power, however, remaining a wealthy and influential member of the English court, albeit never returning directly to active politics.<ref>For a summary of this period, see Weir 2006, chapter 11; Doherty, chapter 8; Mortimer, 2006, chapter 4.</ref>\n\n===As regent, 1326\u20131330===\n[[File:Isabella and Roger Mortimer.jpg|thumb|15th-century manuscript illustration that depicts Isabella and allegedly [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]] at [[Hereford]]; the execution of [[Hugh Despenser the younger]] can be seen in the background.]]\nIsabella's reign as regent lasted only four years, before the fragile political alliance that had brought her and Mortimer to power disintegrated. 1328 saw the marriage of Isabella's son, Edward III to Philippa of Hainault, as agreed before the invasion of 1326; the lavish ceremony was held in London to popular acclaim.<ref>Doherty, p.142.</ref> Isabella and Mortimer had already begun a trend that continued over the next few years, in starting to accumulate huge wealth. With her lands restored to her, Isabella was already exceptionally rich, but she began to accumulate yet more. Within the first few weeks, Isabella had granted herself almost \u00a312,000;<ref>Weir 2006, p.245.</ref> finding that Edward's royal treasury contained \u00a360,000, a rapid period of celebratory spending then ensued.<ref>Weir 2006, p.248.</ref> Isabella soon awarded herself another \u00a320,000, allegedly to pay off foreign debts.<ref>Weir 2006, p.249.</ref> At Edward III's coronation, Isabella then extended her land holdings from a value of \u00a34,400 each year to the huge sum of \u00a313,333, making her one of the largest landowners in the kingdom.<ref>Weir 2006, p.259.</ref> Isabella also refused to hand over her [[dower]] lands to Philippa after her marriage to Edward III, in contravention of usual custom.<ref>Weir 2006, p.303.</ref> Isabella's lavish lifestyle matched her new incomes.<ref>Weir 2006, p.258.</ref> Mortimer, in effect her first minister, after a restrained beginning, also began to accumulate lands and titles at a tremendous rate, particularly in the Marcher territories.<ref>Doherty, p.156.</ref>\n\nThe new regime also faced some key foreign policy dilemmas, which Isabella approached from a [[Political realism|realist]] perspective.<ref name=\"Weir, p.261\">Weir 2006, p.261.</ref> The first of these was the situation in Scotland, where Edward II's unsuccessful policies had left an unfinished, tremendously expensive war. Isabella was committed to bringing this issue to a conclusion by diplomatic means. Edward III initially opposed this policy, before eventually relenting,<ref>Weir 2006, p.304.</ref> leading to the [[Treaty of Edinburgh\u2013Northampton|Treaty of Northampton]]. Under this treaty, Isabella's daughter Joan would marry [[David II of Scotland|David Bruce]] (heir apparent to the Scottish throne) and Edward III would renounce any claims on Scottish lands, in exchange for the promise of Scottish military aid against any enemy except the French, and \u00a320,000 in compensation for the raids across northern England. No compensation would be given to those earls who had lost their Scottish estates, and the compensation would be taken by Isabella.<ref>Weir 2006, p.305, p.313.</ref> Although strategically successful and, historically at least, \"a successful piece of policy making\",<ref>Weir 2006, p.306.</ref> Isabella's Scottish policy was by no means popular and contributed to the general sense of discontent with the regime. Secondly, the Gascon situation, still unresolved from Edward II's reign, also posed an issue. Isabella reopened negotiations in Paris, resulting in a peace treaty under which the bulk of Gascony, minus the Agenais, would be returned to England in exchange for a 50,000 [[Mark (money)|mark]] penalty.<ref>Weir 2006, p.261; Neillands, p.32.</ref> The treaty was not popular in England because of the Agenais clause.<ref name=\"Weir, p.261\"/>\n\nHenry of Lancaster was amongst the first to break with Isabella and Mortimer. By 1327 Lancaster was irritated by Mortimer's behaviour and Isabella responded by beginning to sideline him from her government.<ref>Weir 2006, p.307.</ref> Lancaster was furious over the passing of the Treaty of Northampton, and refused to attend court,<ref>Weir 2006, p.314.</ref> mobilising support amongst the commoners of London.<ref>Weir 2006, p.315.</ref> Isabella responded to the problems by undertaking a wide reform of royal administration, local law enforcement.<ref name=WeirP309>Weir 2006, p.309.</ref> In a move guaranteed to appeal to domestic opinion, Isabella also decided to pursue Edward III's [[English claims to the French throne|claim on the French throne]], sending her advisers to France to demand official recognition of his claim.<ref name=WeirP309/> The French nobility were unimpressed and, since Isabella lacked the funds to begin any military campaign, she began to court the opinion of France's neighbours, including proposing the marriage of her son John to the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family.<ref>Weir 2006, p.310.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1328 the situation had descended into near civil war once again, with Lancaster mobilising his army against Isabella and Mortimer.<ref>Weir 2006, p.322.</ref> In January 1329 Isabella's forces under Mortimer's command took Lancaster's stronghold of [[Leicester]], followed by [[Bedford]]; Isabella&nbsp;\u2013 wearing armour, and mounted on a warhorse&nbsp;\u2013 and Edward III marched rapidly north, resulting in Lancaster's surrender. He escaped death but was subjected to a colossal fine, effectively crippling his power.<ref>Weir 2006, p.322; Mortimer, 2004, p.218.</ref> Isabella was merciful to those who had aligned themselves with him, although some&nbsp;\u2013 such as her old supporter Henry de Beaumont, whose family had split from Isabella over the peace with Scotland, which had lost them huge land holdings in Scotland<ref>Doherty, p.149.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 fled to France.<ref>Weir 2006, p.333.</ref>\n\nDespite Lancaster's defeat, however, discontent continued to grow. [[Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent|Edmund of Kent]] had sided with Isabella in 1326, but had since begun to question his decision and was edging back towards Edward II, his half-brother. Edmund of Kent was in conversations with other senior nobles questioning Isabella's rule, including Henry de Beaumont and Isabella de Vesci. Edmund was finally involved in a conspiracy in 1330, allegedly to restore Edward II, who, he claimed, was still alive: Isabella and Mortimer broke up the conspiracy, arresting Edmund and other supporters&nbsp;\u2013 including [[Simon Mepeham]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Doherty, p.151.</ref> Edmund may have expected a pardon, possibly from Edward III, but Isabella was insistent on his execution.<ref>Doherty, p.152.</ref> The execution itself was a fiasco after the executioner refused to attend and Edmund of Kent had to be killed by a local dung-collector, who had been himself sentenced to death and was pardoned as a bribe to undertake the beheading.<ref>Doherty, p.153.</ref> Isabella de Vesci escaped punishment, despite having been closely involved in the plot.\n\n===Mortimer's fall from power, 1330===\nBy mid-1330, Isabella and Mortimer's regime was increasingly insecure, and Isabella's son, Edward III, was growing frustrated at Mortimer's grip on power. Various historians, with different levels of confidence, have also suggested that in late 1329 Isabella became pregnant. A child of Mortimer's with royal blood would have proved both politically inconvenient for Isabella, and challenging to Edward's own position.<ref>Weir 2006, p.326, is relatively cautious in this assertion; Mortimer, 2004 pp221-3 is more confident.</ref>\n\n[[File:Berkhamsted Castle Jan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Berkhamsted Castle]], where Isabella was initially held after Mortimer and her fall from power in 1330.]]\nEdward quietly assembled a body of support from the Church and selected nobles,<ref>Doherty, pp158-9.</ref> whilst Isabella and Mortimer moved into [[Nottingham Castle]] for safety, surrounding themselves with loyal troops.<ref>Doherty, p.159.</ref> In the autumn, Mortimer was investigating another plot against him, when he challenged a young noble, [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]], during an interrogation. Mortimer declared that his word had priority over the king's, an alarming statement that Montagu reported back to Edward.<ref>Doherty, p.160.</ref> Edward was convinced that this was the moment to act, and on 19 October, Montagu led a force of twenty-three armed men into the castle by a secret tunnel. Up in the [[keep]], Isabella, Mortimer and other council members were discussing how to arrest Montagu, when Montagu and his men appeared.<ref name=DoheryP161>Doherty, p.161.</ref> Fighting broke out on the stairs and Mortimer was overwhelmed in his chamber. Isabella threw herself at Edward's feet, famously crying \"''Fair son, have pity on gentle Mortimer!''\"<ref name=DoheryP161/> Lancastrian troops rapidly took the rest of the castle, leaving Edward in control of his own government for the first time.\n\nParliament was convened the next month, where Mortimer was put on trial for treason. Isabella was portrayed as an innocent bystander during the proceedings,<ref>Doherty, p.162.</ref> and no mention of her sexual relationship with Mortimer was made public.<ref>Doherty, p.172.</ref> Isabella's lover was executed at [[Tyburn]], but Edward III showed leniency and he was not quartered or [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]].<ref>Doherty, p.163.</ref>\n\n===In retirement, 1330\u20131358===\n[[File:Castle-rising-castle.JPG|thumb|[[Castle Rising (castle)|Castle Rising]]; bought by Isabella in 1327, it formed her home during her later years.]]\nAfter the coup, Isabella was initially transferred to [[Berkhamsted Castle]],{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=312}} and then held under house arrest at [[Windsor Castle]] until 1332, when she then moved back to her own [[Castle Rising (castle)|Castle Rising]] in [[Norfolk]].<ref name=DohertyP173>Doherty, p.173.</ref> [[Agnes Strickland]], a Victorian historian, argued that Isabella suffered from occasional fits of madness during this period but modern interpretations suggest, at worst, a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] following the death of her lover.<ref name=DohertyP173/> Isabella remained extremely wealthy; despite being required to surrender most of her lands after losing power, in 1331 she was reassigned a yearly income of \u00a33000,{{sfn|Castor|2011|p=313}} which increased to \u00a34000 by 1337.<ref name=DohertyP173/> She lived an expensive lifestyle in Norfolk, including [[minstrel]]s, huntsmen, grooms and other luxuries,<ref name=\"Doherty, p.176\">Doherty, p.176.</ref> and was soon travelling again around England. In 1342, there were suggestions that she might travel to Paris to take part in peace negotiations, but eventually this plan was quashed.<ref>Doherty, p.174.</ref> She was also appointed to negotiate with France in 1348 and was involved in the negotiations with [[Charles II of Navarre]] in 1358.<ref name=\"mortimer332\">{{cite book | title=The Perfect King The Life of Edward III, Father of the English Nation | last=Mortimer | first=Ian | authorlink=Ian Mortimer (historian) | page=332 | year=2008 | publisher=Vintage }}</ref>\n\nAs the years went by, Isabella became very close to her daughter Joan, especially after Joan left her unfaithful husband, King David II of Scotland.<ref>Doherty, p.175.</ref> Joan also nursed her just before she died. She doted on her grandchildren, including [[Edward, the Black Prince]]. She became increasingly interested in religion as she grew older, visiting a number of shrines.<ref>Doherty, pp175-6.</ref> She remained, however, a gregarious member of the court, receiving constant visitors; amongst her particular friends appear to have been Roger Mortimer's daughter [[Agnes Mortimer, Countess of Pembroke]], and Roger Mortimer's grandson, also called [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], whom Edward III restored to the Earldom of March.<ref>Doherty, p.177.</ref> King Edward and his children often visited her as well.<ref name=\"mortimer332\" /> She remained interested in Arthurian legends and jewellery; in 1358 she appeared at the [[St George's Day]] celebrations at Windsor wearing a dress made of silk, silver, 300 rubies, 1800 pearls and a circlet of gold.<ref name=\"Doherty, p.176\"/> She may also have developed an interest in [[astrology]] or [[geometry]] towards the end of her life, receiving various presents relating to these disciplines.<ref>Weir 2006, p.371.</ref>\n\nIsabella took the [[nun]]'s habit of the [[Poor Clares]] before she died on 22 August 1358 at [[Hertford Castle]], and her body was returned to London for burial at the [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Franciscan church]] at [[Newgate]], in a service overseen by Archbishop [[Simon Islip]].<ref>Weir 2006, p.374.</ref> She was buried in the mantle she had worn at her wedding and at her request, Edward's heart, placed into a casket thirty years before, was interred with her. Isabella left the bulk of her property, including Castle Rising, to her favourite grandson, the Black Prince, with some personal effects being granted to her daughter Joan.<ref>Weir 2006, p.373.</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of Isabella of France}}\n\n===Literature and theatre===\nQueen Isabella appeared with a major role in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (c. 1592) and thereafter has been frequently used as a character in plays, books, and films, often portrayed as beautiful but manipulative or wicked. [[Thomas Gray]], the 18th-century poet, combined Marlowe's depiction of Isabella with [[William Shakespeare]]'s description of [[Margaret of Anjou]] (the wife of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]) as the \"She-Wolf of France\", to produce the anti-French poem ''[[The Bard (poem)|The Bard]]'' (1757), in which Isabella rips apart the bowels of Edward II with her \"unrelenting fangs\".<ref name=WeirP2>Weir 2006, p. 2.</ref> The \"She-Wolf\" epithet stuck, and [[Bertolt Brecht]] re-used it in ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' (1923).<ref name=WeirP2/>\n\n===Film===\nIn [[Derek Jarman]]'s film [[Edward II (film)|''Edward II'']] (1991), based on Marlowe's play, Isabella is portrayed (by actress [[Tilda Swinton]]) as a \"femme fatale\" whose thwarted love for Edward causes her to turn against him and steal his throne. In contrast to the negative depictions, [[Mel Gibson]]'s film ''[[Braveheart]]'' (1995) portrays Isabella (played by the French actress [[Sophie Marceau]]) more sympathetically. In the film, an adult Isabella is fictionally depicted as having a romantic affair with the Scottish hero [[William Wallace]]. However, in reality, she was nine years old at the time of Wallace's death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/aug/06/lying-historical-fiction|title=The lying art of historical fiction|publisher=Guardian News|date=6 August 2010|accessdate=24 September 2012}}</ref> Additionally, Wallace is incorrectly suggested to be the father of her son, Edward III, despite Wallace's death being many years before Edward's birth.<ref>Ewan, pp. 1219\u201321.</ref>\n\n==Issue==\nEdward and Isabella had four children, and she suffered at least one [[miscarriage]].
