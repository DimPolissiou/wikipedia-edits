For this draft, the cutoff birth date is December 31, 1998.\n* She has either:\n** completed her college eligibility;\n** received a bachelor's degree, or is scheduled to receive such in the 3 months following the draft; or\n** is at least 4 years removed from high school graduation.\n\nA player who is scheduled to receive her bachelor's degree within 3 months of the draft date, and is younger than the cutoff age, is only eligible if the calendar year of the draft is no earlier than the fourth after her high school graduation.\n\nPlayers with remaining college eligibility who meet the cutoff age must notify the WNBA headquarters of their intent to enter the draft no later than 10 days before the draft date, and must renounce any remaining college eligibility to do so. A separate notification timetable is provided for players involved in postseason tournaments (most notably the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Division I tournament]]); those players must declare for the draft within 24 hours of their final game. The latter timetable proved to be moot due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus]]-induced cancellation of the [[2020 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|2020 NCAA Tournament]].\n\n\"International players\" are defined as those for whom all of the following is true:\n* Born and currently residing outside the U.S.\n* Never \"exercised intercollegiate basketball eligibility\" in the U.S.\n\nFor \"international players\", the eligibility age is 20, also measured on December 31 of the year of the draft.\n\nThree players with remaining college eligibility, all of whom were juniors in the 2019\u201320 college season, declared for the draft:\n* [[Satou Sabally]] of [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]] announced on February 20 that she would enter the draft upon the end of Oregon's 2019\u201320 season.
