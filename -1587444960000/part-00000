Today at Phillips Exeter Academy, all classes are taught using this method, with no more than 12 or 13. In November 1930, Harkness gave Exeter $5.8 million to support this initiative.

This would be a real revolution in methods.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bass |display-authors=etal |first=Jo Ann F.|title=A declaration of readers' rights: renewing our commitment to students|year=2007|publisher=A & B/Pearson|location=Boston|isbn=978-0205499793|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2vuAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>}}\n\nThe result was \"Harkness teaching\", in which a teacher and a group of students work together, exchanging ideas and information, similar to the [[Socratic method]]. Today at Phillips Exeter Academy, all classes are taught using this method, with no more than 12 or 13. In November 1930, Harkness gave Exeter $5.8 million to support this initiative. Since then, the academy's principal mode of instruction has been by discussion, \"seminar style,\" around an oval table known as the [[Harkness table]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/phillips-exeter-harkness-table-2014-11|title=Why the Classes at Phillips Exeter Are Different Than at Any Other Private School|work=Business Insider|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=The trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy |title=Phillips Exeter Academy {{!}}Harkness |url=http://www.exeter.edu/admissions/109_1220.aspx |accessdate=January 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220030626/http://www.exeter.edu/admissions/109_1220.aspx |archivedate=December 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:Exeter Baseball.JPG|left|thumb|Exeter baseball team in 1881, including a student from the [[Chinese Educational Mission]]]] This informality was for many decades reflected in the school's \"unwritten code that there were no rules at the academy until you broke one.\"<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-05-vw-24821-story.html| last1=Lamb| first1=David| title=Exeter Remembered: Prep School Gambler Who Finally Makes His Point| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| date=January 5, 1986| access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref> Expelled alumni include the journalist [[David Lamb (journalist)|David Lamb]] and the writer and editor [[George Plimpton]].\n\n=== Recent history ===\nExeter participated in the [[Chinese Educational Mission]], hosting seven students from [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]], starting in 1879.

The report harshly criticized the school for not supporting the victims when they reported the incidents and for a pattern of not including these allegations in the faculty members' files. Apparently, the school maintained two sets of files, and would keep the more sensitive material away from Human Resources and prospective employers. Typically, faculty members would then leave Exeter but get hired at peer schools. In at least one case, the teacher then molested students at his next school.

The rapid development of technology has added [[cyberwarfare|cyber warfare]] to their mission. Tactical units within SAC are also capable of carrying out covert political action while deployed in hostile and austere environments. A large covert operation typically has components that involve many or all of these categories as well as paramilitary operations. Political and \"influence\" covert operations are used to support [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]]. Overt support for one element of an insurgency would often be counterproductive due to the impression it would potentially exert on the local population. In such cases covert assistance allows the US to assist without damaging these elements in the process.\n\n==Overview==\nSAC provides the [[United States National Security Council]] with alternative options when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible.

The primary strengths of SAC Paramilitary Officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/> As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 and most importantly&nbsp;\u2013 to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]/[[unconventional warfare]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets.\n\nThere are four principal elements within SAC's Special Operations Group: the '''Air Branch''', the '''Maritime Branch''', the '''Ground Branch''', and the '''Armor and Special Programs Branch'''. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.\n\nTogether, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete [[combined arms]] covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.<ref name=\"so\"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA24&dq=special+ops:+america%27s+elite+forces+delta+the+best+period#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat |author= Fred J.

Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like its successor, the CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.\n\nOne of the OSS' greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |title=Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network\n |accessdate=2008-08-14\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814145107/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |archivedate=August 14, 2008\n |df=mdy\n}}, CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>\n\nOSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].\n\nOSS was disbanded shortly after [[World War II]], with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] of the CIA. In 1962, the paramilitary operations of CIA centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of SAC.

By 1970, communist plans repeatedly emphasized attacking the government's \"pacification\" program and specifically targeted Phoenix agents. The NLF also imposed quotas. In 1970, for example, communist officials near [[Da Nang]] in northern South Vietnam instructed their agents to \"kill 400 persons\" deemed to be government \"tyrant[s]\" and to \"annihilate\" anyone involved with the \"pacification\" program.

Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Draper |title=A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8090-9613-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/verythinlineiran00drap }}</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |year=1987 |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981\u20131987 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-60117-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilsecretwarsof0000wood |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990.<ref name='Woodward 1987'/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Riesenfeld |first=Stefan A. |year=1987 |title=The Powers of Congress and the President in International Relations: Revisited |journal=[[California Law Review]] |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=405\u201314 |jstor=3480586 |doi=10.2307/3480586 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |access-date=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427220228/https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |archive-date=April 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Sandinista]] leader [[Daniel Ortega]] was re-elected as President of [[Nicaragua]] in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.\n\n===El Salvador===\nCIA personnel were also involved in the [[Salvadoran civil war]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uXCpB-D0LLEC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=cia+el+salvador|title=Killer Elite|author=Michael Smith|page=52|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007 | isbn=978-0-312-36272-0}}</ref>  Some allege that the techniques used to interrogate prisoners in El Salvador foreshadowed those later used in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|title=Prisoner Abuse: Patterns from the Past|author1=Thomas Blanton|author2=Peter Kornbluh|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=December 5, 2004|access-date=March 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124020135/http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|archive-date=November 24, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> In fact, when a similar counter-insurgency program was proposed in Iraq, it was referred to as \"the Salvador Option\".

The rapid development of technology has added [[cyberwarfare|cyber warfare]] to their mission. Tactical units within SAC are also capable of carrying out covert political action while deployed in hostile and austere environments. A large covert operation typically has components that involve many or all of these categories as well as paramilitary operations. Political and \"influence\" covert operations are used to support [[Foreign policy of the United States|U.S. foreign policy]]. Overt support for one element of an insurgency would often be counterproductive due to the impression it would potentially exert on the local population. In such cases covert assistance allows the US to assist without damaging these elements in the process.\n\n==Overview==\nSAC provides the [[United States National Security Council]] with alternative options when overt military and/or diplomatic actions are not viable or politically feasible.

They may employ officers to work as journalists, recruit agents of influence, operate media platforms, plant certain stories or information in places it is hoped it will come to public attention, or seek to deny and/or discredit information that is public knowledge.

The primary strengths of SAC Paramilitary Officers are operational agility, adaptability, and deniability. They often operate in small teams, typically made up of two to ten operatives (with some operations being carried out by a single officer), all usually with extensive military tactical experience and a set of specialized skills that does not exist in any other unit.<ref name='Waller'/> As fully trained intelligence case officers, Paramilitary Operations Officers possess all the clandestine skills to collect human intelligence&nbsp;\u2013 and most importantly&nbsp;\u2013 to recruit assets from among the indigenous troops receiving their training. These officers often operate in remote locations behind enemy lines to carry out [[direct action (military)|direct action]] (including [[Raid (military)|raids]] and [[sabotage]]), [[counter-intelligence]], [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]/[[unconventional warfare]], [[counter-terrorism]], and [[Hostage crisis|hostage rescue]] missions, in addition to being able to conduct espionage via [[Human intelligence (espionage)|HUMINT]] assets.\n\nThere are four principal elements within SAC's Special Operations Group: the '''Air Branch''', the '''Maritime Branch''', the '''Ground Branch''', and the '''Armor and Special Programs Branch'''. The Armor and Special Programs Branch is charged with development, testing, and covert procurement of new personnel and vehicular armor and maintenance of stockpiles of ordnance and weapons systems used by SOG, almost all of which must be obtained from clandestine sources abroad, in order to provide SOG operatives and their foreign trainees with plausible deniability in accordance with U.S. Congressional directives.\n\nTogether, the SAC/SOG comprises a complete [[combined arms]] covert paramilitary force. Paramilitary Operations Officers are the core of each branch and routinely move between the branches to gain expertise in all aspects of SOG.<ref name=\"so\"/> As such, Paramilitary Operations Officers are trained to operate in a multitude of environments. Because these officers are taken from the most highly trained units in the U.S. military and then provided with extensive additional training to become CIA clandestine intelligence officers, many U.S. security experts assess them as the most elite of the U.S. special missions units.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLu2K11cXSMC&pg=PA24&dq=special+ops:+america%27s+elite+forces+delta+the+best+period#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Special OPS: America's elite forces in 21st century combat |author= Fred J.

Roosevelt]]. Major General [[William Joseph Donovan]] was the head of the OSS. Donovan was a soldier and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient from [[World War I]]. He was also a lawyer and former classmate of FDR at [[Columbia Law School]].<ref>Wild Bill Donovan: The Last Hero, Anthony Cave Brown, New York City, Times Books, 1982</ref>  Like its successor, the CIA, OSS included both [[HUMINT|human intelligence functions]] and special operations paramilitary functions. Its Secret Intelligence division was responsible for espionage, while its [[Operation Jedburgh|Jedburgh]] teams, a joint U.S.-UK-French unit, were forerunners of groups that create guerrilla units, such as the U.S. Army Special Forces and the CIA. OSS' Operational Groups were larger U.S. units that carried out direct action behind enemy lines. Even during World War II, the idea of intelligence and special operations units not under strict military control was controversial. OSS operated primarily in the [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) and to some extent in the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], while [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] was extremely reluctant to have any OSS personnel within his area of operations.\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945, the OSS also played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in China and Burma, and recruited other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]]. OSS also helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], espionage, [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]], and post-war planning.\n\nOne of the OSS' greatest accomplishments during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and [[Austrian people|Austrian]] commandos for missions inside Nazi Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists, socialist party members, [[labor activist]]s, [[anti-Nazi]] [[POW]]s, and German and [[Jewish refugees]]. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |title=Chef Julia Child, others part of World War II spy network\n |accessdate=2008-08-14\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814145107/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html\n |archivedate=August 14, 2008\n |df=mdy\n}}, CNN, August 14, 2008</ref>\n\nOSS Paramilitary Officers parachuted into many countries that were behind enemy lines, including France, Norway, Greece, and the Netherlands. In Crete, OSS paramilitary officers linked up with, equipped and fought alongside [[Greek resistance]] forces against the [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Axis occupation]].\n\nOSS was disbanded shortly after [[World War II]], with its intelligence analysis functions moving temporarily into the U.S. [[United States Department of State|Department of State]]. Espionage and counterintelligence went into military units, while paramilitary and other covert action functions went into the [[Office of Policy Coordination]] set up in 1948. Between the original creation of the CIA by the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and various mergers and reorganizations through 1952, the wartime OSS functions generally ended up in CIA. The mission of training and leading guerrillas in due course went to the [[United States Army Special Forces]], but those missions required to remain covert were performed by the (Deputy) Directorate of Plans and its successor the [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] of the CIA. In 1962, the paramilitary operations of CIA centralized in the Special Operations Division (SOD), the predecessor of SAC.

By 1970, communist plans repeatedly emphasized attacking the government's \"pacification\" program and specifically targeted Phoenix agents. The NLF also imposed quotas. In 1970, for example, communist officials near [[Da Nang]] in northern South Vietnam instructed their agents to \"kill 400 persons\" deemed to be government \"tyrant[s]\" and to \"annihilate\" anyone involved with the \"pacification\" program.

Once in power, the Sandinistas disbanded the [[Nicaraguan National Guard]], who had committed many human rights abuses, and arrested and executed some of its members. Other former National Guard members helped to form the backbone of the Nicaraguan Counterrevolution or [[Contras|Contra]]. CIA paramilitary teams from Special Activities Division were deployed to train and lead these rebel forces against the Sandinista government. These paramilitary activities were based in Honduras and Costa Rica. Direct military aid by the United States was eventually forbidden by the [[Boland Amendment]] of the Defense Appropriations Act of 1983. The Boland Amendment was extended in October 1984 to forbid action by not only the Defense Department, but also to include the Central Intelligence Agency.<ref>{{cite book |first=Theodore |last=Draper |title=A Very Thin Line: The Iran-Contra Affair |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8090-9613-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/verythinlineiran00drap }}</ref><ref name='Woodward 1987'>{{cite book |first=Bob |last=Woodward |year=1987 |title=VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981\u20131987 |location=New York |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-60117-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/veilsecretwarsof0000wood |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe Boland Amendment was a compromise because the [[U.S. Democratic Party]] did not have enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and on the grounds that it was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300&nbsp;million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990.<ref name='Woodward 1987'/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Riesenfeld |first=Stefan A. |year=1987 |title=The Powers of Congress and the President in International Relations: Revisited |journal=[[California Law Review]] |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=405\u201314 |jstor=3480586 |doi=10.2307/3480586 |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |access-date=October 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190427220228/https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1975&context=californialawreview |archive-date=April 27, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Sandinista]] leader [[Daniel Ortega]] was re-elected as President of [[Nicaragua]] in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.\n\n===El Salvador===\nCIA personnel were also involved in the [[Salvadoran civil war]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uXCpB-D0LLEC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=cia+el+salvador|title=Killer Elite|author=Michael Smith|page=52|publisher=Macmillan|year=2007 | isbn=978-0-312-36272-0}}</ref>  Some allege that the techniques used to interrogate prisoners in El Salvador foreshadowed those later used in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|title=Prisoner Abuse: Patterns from the Past|author1=Thomas Blanton|author2=Peter Kornbluh|lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=December 5, 2004|access-date=March 16, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124020135/http://www.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/|archive-date=November 24, 2006|url-status=live}}</ref> In fact, when a similar counter-insurgency program was proposed in Iraq, it was referred to as \"the Salvador Option\".
