Clancy, in the form of a beach bod, decides to interview the sim Glasses Man, who he discovers is, in fact, the President in this universe. In front of the White House, a group of anti-marijuana protesters are gathered, seemingly unbothered by the zombies around them. This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find this new situation a relief. This does not last long as they are hit with a cure bringing them back to life that, ironically, means the zombies can kill them again.

They encounter a sleeping giant named Barry and go inside his ear where Darryl transforms himself into a giant to fight Barry over a past aggression.

Ward became interested in the podcast because of his taste for listening to people talking about philosophy. According to Ward, \"Duncan is a lot of fun\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sanchez|first1=Leonardo|title=Criador de 'Hora de Aventura' assina anima\u00e7\u00e3o sobre drogas, morte e f\u00e9|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/criador-de-hora-de-aventura-assina-animacao-filosofica-que-discute-drogas-morte-e-fe.shtml |website=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020|language=portuguese}}</ref> Around 2013, during the start of his podcast broadcast, Trussel received an email from Ward praising him for his podcast.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prudom |first1=Laura |title=Netflix's The Midnight Gospel: Exclusive First Look at Adventure Time Creator's Adult Animated Series|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-the-midnight-gospel-release-date-trailer-adventure-time |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> About a year later, Ward stepped down as [[showrunner]] for ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Strauss |first1=Neil |title=\u2018Adventure Time\u2019: The Trippiest Show on Television|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/adventure-time-the-trippiest-show-on-television-84180/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=October 2, 2014}}</ref> Despite saying in an interview that he would not work on another series, Ward was taking the first steps in a new series anchored in the adaptation of Trussell's podcast. Sometime later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached him again to show a rough concept; taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\"/> Mike Mayfield joined the project as a supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations. The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to develop it out to following a concept. According to Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. Other references included the animated films ''[[Watership Down]]'' and ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'', the animated television series ''[[\u00c6on Flux]]'' and ''[[Liquid Television]]'', and the mystery horror drama television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell's long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\"/> Joe Wong, the composer from the show, included his own song \"Dreams Wash Away\" from his debut album ''Nite Creatures'' in first season finale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/04/joe-wong-dreams-wash-away-stream/|title=Podcast Host and Composer Joe Wong Shares Debut Single \u201cDreams Wash Away\u201d: Stream  |website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first1=Ben|last1=Kaye|accessdate=April 26, 2020|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"'Gospel' means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nThroughout the episodes the series deals with different themes that explored through the interviews. During the first season, the guests interviewed covered topics such as [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[meditation]], forgiveness, spiritualism, funerary rituals, death positivity, drug use, pain, moksha (transcendence) and existentialism.

An analysis of birth and death. The series reinforces how this cycle is a continuous, ending process and one cannot escape it. In the last episode of the first season, there is a deeper discussion about the miracle of life, the suffering that existence brings to human life, and the detestable pain that death brings with it. The main theme of this episode entitled \"Mouse of Silver\" is to deal with the loss of a loved one. Despite being the main theme in this episode, the theme reappears in several others at different levels. For Trussell, the last episode becomes even more personal due to the discourse brought by the deep sorrow he felt after he lost his mother to cancer.<ref name=\"Mea2\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title='The Midnight Gospel' Ending Explained: Is Clancy dead?

According him \"''Rick and Morty'' might embrace nihilism more than most, thriving in the chaos of Rick's anarchic worldview, but the world ends over and over again for real in ''The Midnight Gospel'', providing a cosmic counterpoint to the introspective teachings of the 'space-cast'.\" He also points out how the show deals positively with topics like hope and loss.<ref name=\"DigS\">{{cite web |last1=Opie|first1=David|title=Why The Midnight Gospel is the anti-Rick and Morty|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32205363/midnight-gospel-review-netflix-rick-and-morty/ |website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comic science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated science fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| name                     = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional release poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = Pendleton Ward\n| creator                  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Pendleton Ward]]\n* [[Duncan Trussell]]\n}}\n| voices                   = {{Plainlist|\n* Duncan Trussell\n* [[Phil Hendrie]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = [[Joe Wong (musician)|Joe Wong]]\n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 8\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Duncan Trussell\n* Antonio Canobbio\n* Ben Kalina\n* Chris Prynoski\n}}\n| producer                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Shannon Prynoski\n* Tony Salama\n}}\n| editor                   = Megan Love\n| cinematography           = \n| runtime                  = 20-36 minutes\n| company                  = Oatmeal Maiden<br>[[Titmouse, Inc.]]\n| distributor              = \n| channel                  = [[Netflix]]\n| picture_format           = [[4K resolution|4K]] ([[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]])<br>[[High-dynamic-range video|High dynamic range]]\n| audio_format             = [[Dolby Digital Plus]] 5.1\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website                  = https://www.netflix.com/title/80987903\n}}\n\n'''''The Midnight Gospel''''' is an American [[adult animated]] web television series created by ''[[Adventure Time]]'' creator [[Pendleton Ward]] and comedian [[Duncan Trussell]].

Ward became interested in the podcast because of his taste for listening to people talking about philosophy. According to Ward, \"Duncan is a lot of fun\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sanchez|first1=Leonardo|title=Criador de 'Hora de Aventura' assina anima\u00e7\u00e3o sobre drogas, morte e f\u00e9|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2020/04/criador-de-hora-de-aventura-assina-animacao-filosofica-que-discute-drogas-morte-e-fe.shtml |website=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] |accessdate=April 24, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020|language=portuguese}}</ref> Around 2013, during the start of his podcast broadcast, Trussel received an email from Ward praising him for his podcast.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Prudom |first1=Laura |title=Netflix's The Midnight Gospel: Exclusive First Look at Adventure Time Creator's Adult Animated Series|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-the-midnight-gospel-release-date-trailer-adventure-time |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> About a year later, Ward stepped down as [[showrunner]] for ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Strauss |first1=Neil |title=\u2018Adventure Time\u2019: The Trippiest Show on Television|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/adventure-time-the-trippiest-show-on-television-84180/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=October 2, 2014}}</ref> Despite saying in an interview that he would not work on another series, Ward was taking the first steps in a new series anchored in the adaptation of Trussell's podcast. Sometime later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making. Here's How It Finally Happened.|url=https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/midnight-gospel-netflix-duncan-trussell-pendleton-ward |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In the first meeting with Ward, Trussell declined to join to a new project claiming he was too busy to turn his podcast into an animated show. In 2018, Ward approached him again to show a rough concept; taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\"/> Mike Mayfield joined the project as a supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations. The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to develop it out to following a concept. According to Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. Other references included the animated films ''[[Watership Down]]'' and ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'', the animated television series ''[[\u00c6on Flux]]'' and ''[[Liquid Television]]'', and the mystery horror drama television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]''.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell's long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\"/> Joe Wong, the composer from the show, included his own song \"Dreams Wash Away\" from his debut album ''Nite Creatures'' in first season finale.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/04/joe-wong-dreams-wash-away-stream/|title=Podcast Host and Composer Joe Wong Shares Debut Single \u201cDreams Wash Away\u201d: Stream  |website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first1=Ben|last1=Kaye|accessdate=April 26, 2020|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"'Gospel' means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nThroughout the episodes the series deals with different themes that explored through the interviews. During the first season, the guests interviewed covered topics such as [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[meditation]], forgiveness, spiritualism, funerary rituals, death positivity, drug use, pain, moksha (transcendence) and existentialism. The animation also acts as a background for stories that expand the interviews.<ref name=\"Mea1\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title='The Midnight Gospel' Season 1 is a mesmerizing contemplation on life, love and death that mustn't be missed |url=https://meaww.com/the-midnight-gospel-duncan-trussell-family-hour-podcast-animated-netflix-series-love-death-life-431699 |website=Meaww|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In the second episode deer-dog hybrids mangling baby clowns to a knight seeking vengeance against an ass-wielding villain. The animation also intentionally complements the dialogue of an interview. For example, during the episode with interviewee [[Anne Lamott]], she comments on her lack of fear of death as her character is wheeled to an industrial meat grinder run by a bunch of clowns. These animated backstories pulls the viewer into the conversation, making him an important part of the exploration of said subject.<ref name=\"Thr1\">{{cite web |last1=Robinson|first1=Joshua|title=Netflix's Mind-Melting Animated Series 'The Midnight Gospel' Is a Soul-Affirming Success|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-midnight-gospel-review-netflix |website=[[Thrillist]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> \n\nOne constant in several episodes is the life cycle. An analysis of birth and death. The series reinforces how this cycle is a continuous, ending process and one cannot escape it. In the last episode of the first season, there is a deeper discussion about the miracle of life, the suffering that existence brings to human life, and the detestable pain that death brings with it. The main theme of this episode entitled \"Mouse of Silver\" is to deal with the loss of a loved one. Despite being the main theme in this episode, the theme reappears in several others at different levels. For Trussell, the last episode becomes even more personal due to the discourse brought by the deep sorrow he felt after he lost his mother to cancer.<ref name=\"Mea2\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title='The Midnight Gospel' Ending Explained: Is Clancy dead?

As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service.

According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"float: right;text-align:center; width:%70;margin:10px\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#FEDA4A;\"|\n| 1\n| 88% (16 reviews)\n| 79 (7 reviews)\n|}\n\n====Season 1====\nReception of the series has been largely positive, with several critics pointing to the last episode of the season called \"Mouse of Silver\" as the most touching and exciting of the season. The series has received praise for its visuals, animation and the way it deals with deep and philosophical subjects. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 88% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 7.53/10. The site's consensus reads \"''The Midnight Gospel''{{'}}s strange brew won't be for all tastes, but those willing to drink deep will find a wealth of vibrant visuals and illuminating insights.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_midnight_gospel/s01|title=The Midnight Gospel: Season 1|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref> On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 79 out of 100, based on reviews from seven critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-midnight-gospel|title=The Midnight Gospel Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn a positive review, Robert Lloyd from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' acclaims the visual style reminiscent of ''Adventure Time'' and even so it has his own style and conversations about real issues. Lloyd said \"Like ''Adventure Time'', but more explicitly, it takes an interest in matters of birth, death, rebirth, transfiguration.

But much like the podcast episodes it frames itself around, there's not much in the way of an ongoing narrative to reward viewers or justify a binge session.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-the-midnight-gospel-season-1-review|title=Netflix's The Midnight Gospel Is No Adventure Time |website=[[IGN]]|first1=Jesse|last1=Schedeen|accessdate=April 22, 2020|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In a less enthusiastic review for [[Collider]], Dave Trumbore said \"It's like watching a psychotic lava lamp while listening to your college roommate wax on and on after a week of Philosophy 101 and a few rounds of stacking bong hits.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/midnight-gospel-review-netflix-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell/ |title=\u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 Review: Better Be High AF to Enjoy This New Netflix Series |website=[[Collider]]|first1=Dave|last1=Trumbore|accessdate=April 22, 2020|date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> \n\nSome critics have noted the similarities and differences between ''The Midnight Gospel'' and ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' for the style of animation and the way they deal with deep themes. David Opie from ''[[Digital Spy]]'' identified ''The Midnight Gospel'' as an antithesis to ''Rick and Morty''. He claims that both shows change the viewers' perspective on the worldview. According him \"''Rick and Morty'' might embrace nihilism more than most, thriving in the chaos of Rick's anarchic worldview, but the world ends over and over again for real in ''The Midnight Gospel'', providing a cosmic counterpoint to the introspective teachings of the 'space-cast'.\" He also points out how the show deals positively with topics like hope and loss.<ref name=\"DigS\">{{cite web |last1=Opie|first1=David|title=Why The Midnight Gospel is the anti-Rick and Morty|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32205363/midnight-gospel-review-netflix-rick-and-morty/ |website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comic science fiction television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated science fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Marxblom", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}
