In 1896, it became a part of [[Pakokku]] Hill Tracts Districts of [[British Burma]] until January 4, 1948.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe [[Chin people]] entered the Chin Hills in the first millennium 1200 AD as part of the wider migration of Chin peoples into the area. For much of history, the sparsely populated Chin Hills were ruled by local chiefs, such as Tlaisun(Hlawncheu), Bawithang, Hauhulh, Sumthang, Laizo and Zahau chiefs in the mid-land ([[Falam|present Falam]] area), [[Guite people|Guite]], Doungel, Vaiphei, Chawnglawi, Thado, Suantak and Sukte chiefs in the north (present [[Tedim]], Sialkal, [[Tonzang]], and [[Lamka]] areas), Zathang, Chinzah, Khenglawt, Khiteng, Hlawnchhing, Tlangchhan, Khawlhring, Leitak(Hlawnceu) and Zokhua chiefs in the south (present [[Hakha]], and [[Thantlang]] and some parts of Lushai hill), and Sailo (son of Gosum, descendants of Guite or Ninguitea and adopted by Thangmanga, descendant of Suantak) and Hualngo (descendants of Ngaihte) chiefs in the Lushai hill. The Pakhup and Torel in the Fanai hill. The Chozah(Mahlei), Zawtha, Khule, Hlychho(Cha-awh, Tlari, Kapi, Khichha), Topa, Khaimeichho, Kathie, Chhaihlo, Chhachhai(Zawkhai), Thlyutha, Zachho, Laihlo, Bohia, Nohro(Hlikhai-Rokhai, Sobei{Laitha, Laikah, Lawbei}, Thangie), Hlythi(Laihly), Notlia, Tau-ei Azyu and Tlapo in the Tlosai, Hawthai, Hlaipao, Lautu, Zophei, Zotung and Senthang hills. [[Hniarlawn]] is the closest village to the capital Hakha, Hniarlawn is where the strongest of strongest lai-pawih wrestlers are from.\n\nSome historians (Arthur Phayre, Tun Nyein) put Pateikkaya in eastern Bengal, thus wrongly placing the entire Chin Hills under Pagan suzerainty but others, like Harvey, citing stone inscriptions, properly put it near the eastern Chin Hills.<ref name=geh-326>{{cite book|author=GE Harvey|title=History of Burma|page=326|chapter=Notes on Pateikkaya and Macchagiri|year=1925|publisher=Frank Cass & Co. Ltd.|location=London}}</ref> (Burmese Chronicles report the kings of Pateikkaya as Indian though the ethnicity of the subjects is not explicitly cited.) Accordingly, since the first human settlement in the region later called Chin Hills as early as 10 century CE, no other external military conquest nor tributary influence was noticed either in oral traditions or other historical inscriptions but the rule and leadership of local native chiefs as listed above until the British advancement in the late 19th century.\n\n===Feudal era===\n[[File:Map_of_Taungoo_Empire_(1580).png|thumb]]\nThe first confirmed political entity in the region was the [[Shan States|Shan State]] of [[Kalay|Kale]] (Kalay), founded by the [[Shan people]] who came to dominate Kale kabaw valley of the northwestern-to-eastern arc of Burma after the fall of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in 1287. Kale was a minor Shan state. Its author. The minor state occasionally paid tribute to the larger Shan States of [[Mohnyin]] and [[Mogaung]] and ultimately became a vassal state of the Burmese [[Ava Kingdom]] in the 1370s. Starting in the 1480s, Ava began to disintegrate and Kale was swallowed up by the Shan State of Mohnyin by the 1520s. Three of the Saopha sons (Thein Kheing/Thuan Khai(Ancestor of Hlythi/Hlawncheu, Hauhulh and Zahao/Zahau), Phra Lung/Phurh hlum (Ancestor of Zanniat/Nuhma/Nohro(Sumthang,Syuhlo,Hlosa/Hluansang{Chozah/Cheizah/Chinzah, Zawtha/Zawthang/Zathang, Hlychho/Hlawnchhing, Khule/Khuhhly/Khenglawt, Hluansang, Hlikhai} and Notlia/Nuhnu/Nutlai), and Ral Thang{Mi-E, Thawr, Lente, Bawithang, Sailung}) fled to the Chin hills around 1400 where their descendants ruled the petty chiefdoms all over Falam, Hakha, and parts of Paletwa and Mindat district along with various villages in the hill range of Bangladesh(Chittagong Hills Tracts and India(Mizoram) as well some villages in Rakhaing State.\n\nThe Burmese kingdoms between 1555 and 1559 when King [[Bayinnaung]] of the [[Toungoo Dynasty]] conquered part of Upper Burma and its surrounding regions, stretching from the eastern and northern Shan states to the western Magway Division and plain region in [[Manipur]].<ref name=mha>{{cite book|title=A History of Burma|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofburma00htin/page/117 117]|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York and London|year=1967|author=Maung Htin Aung|authorlink=Htin Aung}}</ref> Toungoo began to weaken in the late 17th century. By the 1730s, a resurgent Manipuri Kingdom had conquered the [[Kabaw Valley]], which is at the eastern front of Chin Hills, from the Burmese. Situated in a far west hilly region, however, Chin Hills was traditionally autonomous and far for successional Burman kingdoms to reach. Until British colonial rule, independent city-states such as [[Ciimnuai]] (Chinwe/Chin Nwe) later shifted to [[Tedim]] and [[Vangteh]] in the north, Tlaisun and Rallang in the mid-land, and [[Hakha]], Thantlang and Zokhua in the south played important political role in securing peace of the region, and each city-state practised its own independent sovereignty in their own rights.\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe British acquired the Chin Hills a decade after the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1885. The ensuing Chin resistance to the British was suppressed only by 1896 with the arrest of [[Khai Kam|Khai Kam Thuantak]] of Siyin area.

After the war, Chin state leaders headed by Vumkhohau Thuantak, with [[Bamar|Burman]], [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Kachin people|Kachin]] leaders, participated in the [[Panglong Conference]] which discussed the future of an independent Union of Burma. Because of the region's heavy economic dependence on Burma, Chin leaders, unlike Shan and Kachin leaders, asked only for a \"special administrative division\", not a full-fledged state. As a result, when the 1947 [[Constitution of Burma]] granted the right of secession to states after 10 years after the independence, the Chin people did not get a state (no right to secede). (The [[Karen people|Karen]], who did not participate in the conference, received a state, with the right to secede.)\n\n===Post Burmese independence===\nUpon [[Burma]]'s independence from the United Kingdom in 1948, '''Chin Hills Special Division''' was created out of the Chin Hills, with its capital at [[Falam, Burma|Falam]]. On January 4, 1974, it was granted state status and became Chin State.<ref name=md/> Today, the state has little infrastructure and remains extremely poor and undeveloped.\n\n\"Chin National Day\" is designated on 20 February to commemorate the \"General Assembly of Chinland\" held in 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Celebration Of 65th Chin National Day|url=http://unpo.org/article/15528|publisher=Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization|date=2013-02-20|accessdate=2017-11-18}}</ref> The first celebration of Chin National Day was held in 1951.

[[Falam]] had been the district capital since the British colonization. After the military coup in 1962, the junta in the 1974 reorganization shifted the state capital to Hakha.\n\nThe township borders have been adjusted, most recently in a reorganization of Falam District in 2008. Falam Township lost area in its northeast to Tedim Township but gained territory from Tedim in the northwest, extending northward as far as the developing town of Rihkhawdar (Reehkawdar) on the Indian border. In that reorganization, Falam lost a small area in its southwest back to Thantlang Township from which it had recently been shifted.\n\n===Districts and townships===\n* [[Falam District]] of northern Chin State\n** [[Falam Township]]\n** [[Tedim Township]]\n** [[Tonzang Township]]\n** [[Cikha Township]]\n** [[Rihkhawdar Township]]\n** [[Khai Kam Township]] \n** [[Webulah Township]]\n* [[Hakha District]] of northern Chin State\n** [[Hakha Township]]\n** [[Thantlang Township]]\n* [[Matupi District]] of Central and Southwestern Chin State\n** [[Matupi Township]]\n** [[Paletwa Township]]\n** [[Rezua Township]]\n** [[Samee Township]]\n** [[Lailenpi Township]]\n*  [[Mindat District]] of Southeastern Chin State\n** [[Mindat Township]]\n** [[Kanpetlet Township]]\n** [[Makui Innu Township]]\n\nHakha District was formed by the first Chin State Hluttaw emergency meeting No. 2/2012 on 1 June.<ref>http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/46newsn.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Page 16, Col 1.</ref> Matupi District was formed by the second Pyidaungsu Hluttaw regular meeting on 28 June 2017.<ref>{{citation|url=https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B2-BapXMfMvnUUtpUktlQnVPSXM|title=Second Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, fifth regular meeting record|publisher=[[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]]|page=420|language=my}}</ref><ref>Rezua</ref>\n\n===Cities and towns===\n* [[Cikha]], sub-township in the north\n* [[Falam]], northern Chin State (Falam District)\n* [[Hakha]], capital of Chin State (Hakha District)\n* [[Kanpetlet]]\n* [[Lalenpi]], sub-township in west south\n* [[Matupi, Myanmar|Matupi]], southern capital town.(Matupi District)\n* [[Mindat, Chin State|Mindat]], southern Chin State \n* [[Paletwa]], southern Chin State\n* [[Rezua]],  Rezua Township \n* [[Rihkhawdar]], sub-township in the north\n* [[Samee, Paletwa|Sami]], sub-township in south\n* [[Tedim]], Tedim Township\n(Proposed Tedim District)\n* [[Thantlang]], Thantlang Township\n* [[Tonzang]], Tonzang Township\n* [[Webulah]], Webulah town \n* [[Hnaring]], Hnaring town\n* [[Surkhua]], Surkhua town\n* [[Makui innu]], Makui innu town\n* [[Khaikam]], Khaikam sub-township in East\n\n==Government==\n\n===Executive===\n[[Chin State Government]]\n\n===Legislature===\n{{see also|Chin State Hluttaw}}\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[Chin State High Court]]{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Hiang Ziing Village, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|left|thumb| HiangHing Village, [[Tedim Township]] - View]]\nKhonumtung (Mount Victoria), {{convert|10500|ft|m}} high, is the highest peak in Chin State.\n\nMany natural watercourses flow among mountain ranges running from north to south forming valleys and gorges.

The longest waterfall in Chin state is the Bungtla Waterfall near [[Matupi, Myanmar|Matupi]].\n\n==Population==\n===Demographics===\n{{Historical populations\n|footnote    = \n|source      = 2014 Myanmar Census<ref name=\"census-2014\">{{cite book|title=Census Report|publisher=Ministry of Immigration and Population|location=Naypyitaw|date=May 2015|series=The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census|volume=2|pages=17|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B067GBtstE5TeUlIVjRjSjVzWlk/view}}</ref>\n|1973|323295\n|1983|368949\n|2014|478801\n}}\nThe people of Chin state are made up of many tribes which, though historically related, now speak divergent languages and have different cultural and historical identities. Some consider the name Chin an [[exonym]], given by the Burmese and of unclear origin.\n\nThe first ''''Chin National Day'''' was celebrated in 1951 at Mindat.\n\nThe term ''Laimi'' was a common name for the people in Falam, Hakha,Thantlang and Lawngtlai district. There are some western tribes like Lusei, Ralte, Fanai/Pawi-Lusei, Renthlei, Hmar and Khiangte are claiming the term ''[[Mizo people|Mizo]]'' to refer themselves and the whole tribes of the so-called ''Chin''s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe government of Myanmar officially designated Falam as the radio language of Chin State more than 30 years ago. Since then Falam has been the medium for Chin radio program broadcast by the government.\n\nHowever, the Tedim language is the common language used among Zomi/Zo people. Tedim is spoken widely in Kalay township where they have been vastly [[Kalaymyo|overwhelming]] long before Burmese Independence. The population of Tedim language speaking people is calculated to be more than 100,000, without taking into account of the fact that Ngawn, [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]], Sihzang who hardly understand.\n\nLai is used as the main communication language in Falam, Hakha and Thantlang townships and it is used and understood by most of the chin people. As the dialects in the areas of Hakha and Falam are from Tibeto-Burman dialect and 85% of the phonetic and accent are the same, people from Falam can easily communicate with Hakha language and vice versa. Chin people have a native-like understanding of [[Mizo language]], except for those who live in very remote areas speaking dialects.\n\n[[Chin people]] are called by names such as [[Zo people|Laimi and Zo people]], K'Cho, [[Lusei]] (later [[Mizo people|Mizo]]), Kuki and others based on the names they were designated by Burmese people in the surrounding areas and the British. Recently, some Tedim Cikha, Khaikam and Tonzang people have accepted ''Zomi'' nomenclature, which means the people of Zo (ancestor) or Highland uh.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This very Zo people who live and dwell in the plain region are called phaimi (which means people from plain area). According to the record of Zam Siian Sang Gualnam who surveyed the seasons and population of the people called Chin Nationalities during the years 2004\u20132007 with the ''Chin Survey'' research team, the combination of all Chin peoples and their populations are as follows:\n\n1. In Sagaing Division\n*Tedim Zomi(500000+)\n*Zo(25000+)\n*[[Lushai]]/[[Lusei]]/[[Mizo people|Mizo]] (50000 +)\n*[[Thadou people|Thadou]] (50000 +)also called kuki\n*Matupi (3000-/+)\n*Lai(Hakha-Thlantlang and Zokhua)(40000+)\n*Falam(Thuan Khai,Zanniat and Ral Thang (60000+)\n*Sizaang(10000+)\n*Hawthai (60000+)\n*others(50000+)\n\nin MagweDivision\n*Lai(Hakha) (20000+)\n*Hawthai (30000+)\n*Asho(250000+)They \u0142ive in lower *magwe and also in Pegu Division.\nOthers(60000+)\nChin of Myanmar in Other Countries \n**India(100000+)\n**Malaysia(60000+)\n**Singapore(3000+)\n**Uk/USA/EU(100000+)\n\n2. In Chin State\n*numbered 470,000 in population.\n\n3. In India (Census of India 2011)\n*[[Lushai/Mizo]] (7500000+)\n* Thadou-Kuki (280,000 +)\n*Hmar (100,000+)\n*Mara (190,000+)\n*Paite (275000+)Manipur+Mizoram\n*Vaiphei (40000+)\n*Simte (80,000+)\n*Tedim Zomi (140000+)\n*Lai(Hakha)(70000 natives+30000)\n*[[Kom people (India)|Kom]] (15,000+)\n*[[Zou people|Zo (122,000+)]]\n*Gangte people(20000+)\n*Halam Pople(50000+) They live in Tripura and Assam\n\nExcept for [[Laimi]], [[Thadou people|Thadou]], [[Kuki people|Kuki]], [[Mizo people|Mizo]] and [[Hmar]], [[Mara people|Mara]] the remaining tribes in India mentioned above are united under Zomi Council. They are [[Paite people|Paite]], Simte, Vaiphei, [[Zou people|Zou]], Komrem, Mate and [[Tedim people]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Furthermore, the tribes under Zomi Council and Thadou people speak different dialects that are close to those of the Tedim people. They migrated to Manipur State (India) about 800 years ago.\n\nAlthough the exact population of [[Chin people]] is unknown so far and the population of [[Laimi]]  are the second largest after Zomi in Chin state, Laimi may be divided in two groups Hakha and Falam as the two dialects differ a bit but Hakha Lai Language is understood by more population numbers, the population in Chin State is dispersing in rush in the past 50 years. Besides, the number of [[Chin people]] in Chin State has been decreasing at a rapid rate due to migration since the early 2000s for economic and political reasons.\n\nMaking a living is getting harder due to rapid population increase and unsustainable practice of slash and burn agriculture.\n\nSince the early 1990s, a large number of Burmese soldiers began moving into Chin State because there have been movements of rebellion. It is estimated that from Falam region alone, approximately 100,000 have moved to other parts of Burma and a significantly large number has gone to neighboring countries of India, Malaysia and Thailand since 2000. From Hakha and Thantlang regions, no fewer than 100,000 people have migrated to Malaysia, India and other countries. This emigration is true for other townships in Chin State, with the exception of Mindat, Kanpetlet and Paletwa \u2014 three of the most isolated towns. Since early 2000, a large number of Chin people living and working legally and illegally have been settled as refugees in third countries including Australia, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Netherland, Canada, United States and New Zealand with the United States taking in the largest numbers.\n\nThe Chin people in Falam use the word Salai for ''Mr.'' and Leng as ''Miss as'' the Hakha (ethnic Chin) use ''Leng'' as Miss and ''Val'' as Mr.\n\nThe Tedim ethnic group use ''Tang'' as Mr. and ''Lia'' as Miss. ''Pa''/''Nu'' as the marired person male/female respectively. The honour person as ''Sia'' for person and ''Sianu or Siapa as female/male respectively.\nThe Maras use \"Puhpa\" for \"Mr\" and \"Pihno\" for \"Mrs\"\n\nMatu use ''Mang'' for man and ''Tuem'' for woman and ''Pu'' and ''Pi'', and ''Pa'' and ''Nu'', are used commonly for elderly Chin and Chin leaders such as ''Pu Hrang Thio'' (famous for his courage in the nationwide). The title of ''Pu'' is a term of respect. Failure to use it may be interpreted as a sign of disrespect. The word ''Pi'' is used to address elderly Chin women. Tribes also practice different ways in naming people.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Chin (2014)<ref name=\"TUR\">{{cite book | url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B067GBtstE5TSl9FNElRRGtvMUk | title=The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Census Report Volume 2-C | publisher=Department of Population Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population MYANMAR | author=Department of Population Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population MYANMAR | year=July 2016 | pages=12\u201315}}</ref>\n|title =\n|label1 = Christianity\n|value1 = 85.4\n|color1 = DodgerBlue\n|label2 = Buddhism\n|value2 = 13\n|color2 = Yellow\n|label3 = Tribal religion\n|value3 = 0.4\n|color3 = GreenYellow\n|label4 = Islam\n|value4 = 0.1\n|color4 = Green\n|label5 = Other religion\n|value5 = 1.1\n|color5 = DeepPink\n}}\n\n[[Christianity]] is the practised by the majority of the population.

In 1896, it became a part of [[Pakokku]] Hill Tracts Districts of [[British Burma]] until January 4, 1948.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe [[Chin people]] entered the Chin Hills in the first millennium 1200 AD as part of the wider migration of Chin peoples into the area. For much of history, the sparsely populated Chin Hills were ruled by local chiefs, such as Tlaisun(Hlawncheu), Bawithang, Hauhulh, Sumthang, Laizo and Zahau chiefs in the mid-land ([[Falam|present Falam]] area), [[Guite people|Guite]], Doungel, Vaiphei, Chawnglawi, Thado, Suantak and Sukte chiefs in the north (present [[Tedim]], Sialkal, [[Tonzang]], and [[Lamka]] areas), Zathang, Chinzah, Khenglawt, Khiteng, Hlawnchhing, Tlangchhan, Khawlhring, Leitak(Hlawnceu) and Zokhua chiefs in the south (present [[Hakha]], and [[Thantlang]] and some parts of Lushai hill), and Sailo (son of Gosum, descendants of Guite or Ninguitea and adopted by Thangmanga, descendant of Suantak) and Hualngo (descendants of Ngaihte) chiefs in the Lushai hill. The Pakhup and Torel in the Fanai hill. The Chozah(Mahlei), Zawtha, Khule, Hlychho(Cha-awh, Tlari, Kapi, Khichha), Topa, Khaimeichho, Kathie, Chhaihlo, Chhachhai(Zawkhai), Thlyutha, Zachho, Laihlo, Bohia, Nohro(Hlikhai-Rokhai, Sobei{Laitha, Laikah, Lawbei}, Thangie), Hlythi(Laihly), Notlia, Tau-ei Azyu and Tlapo in the Tlosai, Hawthai, Hlaipao, Lautu, Zophei, Zotung and Senthang hills. [[Hniarlawn]] is the closest village to the capital Hakha, Hniarlawn is where the strongest of strongest lai-pawih wrestlers are from.\n\nSome historians (Arthur Phayre, Tun Nyein) put Pateikkaya in eastern Bengal, thus wrongly placing the entire Chin Hills under Pagan suzerainty but others, like Harvey, citing stone inscriptions, properly put it near the eastern Chin Hills.<ref name=geh-326>{{cite book|author=GE Harvey|title=History of Burma|page=326|chapter=Notes on Pateikkaya and Macchagiri|year=1925|publisher=Frank Cass & Co. Ltd.|location=London}}</ref> (Burmese Chronicles report the kings of Pateikkaya as Indian though the ethnicity of the subjects is not explicitly cited.) Accordingly, since the first human settlement in the region later called Chin Hills as early as 10 century CE, no other external military conquest nor tributary influence was noticed either in oral traditions or other historical inscriptions but the rule and leadership of local native chiefs as listed above until the British advancement in the late 19th century.\n\n===Feudal era===\n[[File:Map_of_Taungoo_Empire_(1580).png]]\nThe first confirmed political entity in the region was the [[Shan States|Shan State]] of [[Kalay|Kale]] (Kalay), founded by the [[Shan people]] who came to dominate Kale kabaw valley of the northwestern-to-eastern arc of Burma after the fall of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in 1287. Kale was a minor Shan state. Its author. The minor state occasionally paid tribute to the larger Shan States of [[Mohnyin]] and [[Mogaung]] and ultimately became a vassal state of the Burmese [[Ava Kingdom]] in the 1370s. Starting in the 1480s, Ava began to disintegrate and Kale was swallowed up by the Shan State of Mohnyin by the 1520s.

By the 1730s, a resurgent Manipuri Kingdom had conquered the [[Kabaw Valley]], which is at the eastern front of Chin Hills, from the Burmese. Situated in a far west hilly region, however, Chin Hills was traditionally autonomous and far for successional Burman kingdoms to reach. Until British colonial rule, independent city-states such as [[Ciimnuai]] (Chinwe/Chin Nwe) later shifted to [[Tedim]] and [[Vangteh]] in the north, Tlaisun and Rallang in the mid-land, and [[Hakha]], Thantlang and Zokhua in the south played important political role in securing peace of the region, and each city-state practised its own independent sovereignty in their own rights.\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe British acquired the Chin Hills a decade after the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] of 1885. The ensuing Chin resistance to the British was suppressed only by 1896 with the arrest of [[Khai Kam|Khai Kam Thuantak]] of Siyin area.

After the war, Chin state leaders headed by Vumkhohau Thuantak, with [[Bamar|Burman]], [[Shan people|Shan]] and [[Kachin people|Kachin]] leaders, participated in the [[Panglong Conference]] which discussed the future of an independent Union of Burma. Because of the region's heavy economic dependence on Burma, Chin leaders, unlike Shan and Kachin leaders, asked only for a \"special administrative division\", not a full-fledged state. As a result, when the 1947 [[Constitution of Burma]] granted the right of secession to states after 10 years after the independence, the Chin people did not get a state (no right to secede). (The [[Karen people|Karen]], who did not participate in the conference, received a state, with the right to secede.)\n\n===Post Burmese independence===\nUpon [[Burma]]'s independence from the United Kingdom in 1948, '''Chin Hills Special Division''' was created out of the Chin Hills, with its capital at [[Falam, Burma|Falam]].

[[Falam]] had been the district capital since the British colonization. After the military coup in 1962, the junta in the 1974 reorganization shifted the state capital to Hakha.\n\nThe township borders have been adjusted, most recently in a reorganization of Falam District in 2008. Falam Township lost area in its northeast to Tedim Township but gained territory from Tedim in the northwest, extending northward as far as the developing town of Rihkhawdar (Reehkawdar) on the Indian border. In that reorganization, Falam lost a small area in its southwest back to Thantlang Township from which it had recently been shifted.\n\n===Districts and townships===\n* [[Falam District]] of northern Chin State\n** [[Falam Township]]\n** [[Tedim Township]]\n** [[Tonzang Township]]\n** [[Cikha Township]]\n** [[Rihkhawdar Township]]\n** [[Khai Kam Township]] \n** [[Webulah Township]]\n* [[Hakha District]] of northern Chin State\n** [[Hakha Township]]\n** [[Thantlang Township]]\n* [[Matupi District]] of Central and Southwestern Chin State\n** [[Matupi Township]]\n** [[Paletwa Township]]\n** [[Rezua Township]]\n** [[Samee Township]]\n** [[Lailenpi Township]]\n*  [[Mindat District]] of Southeastern Chin State\n** [[Mindat Township]]\n** [[Kanpetlet Township]]\n** [[Makui Innu Township]]\n\nHakha District was formed by the first Chin State Hluttaw emergency meeting No. 2/2012 on 1 June.<ref>http://www.mrtv3.net.mm/newpaper/46newsn.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Page 16, Col 1.</ref> Matupi District was formed by the second Pyidaungsu Hluttaw regular meeting on 28 June 2017.<ref>{{citation|url=https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B2-BapXMfMvnUUtpUktlQnVPSXM|title=Second Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, fifth regular meeting record|publisher=[[Pyidaungsu Hluttaw]]|page=420|language=my}}</ref><ref>Rezua</ref>\n\n===Cities and towns===\n* [[Cikha]], sub-township in the north\n* [[Falam]], northern Chin State (Falam District)\n* [[Hakha]], capital of Chin State (Hakha District)\n* [[Kanpetlet]]\n* [[Lalenpi]], sub-township in west south\n* [[Matupi, Myanmar|Matupi]], southern capital town.(Matupi District)\n* [[Mindat, Chin State|Mindat]], southern Chin State \n* [[Paletwa]], southern Chin State\n* [[Rezua]],  Rezua Township \n* [[Rihkhawdar]], sub-township in the north\n* [[Samee, Paletwa|Sami]], sub-township in south\n* [[Tedim]], Tedim Township\n(Proposed Tedim District)\n* [[Thantlang]], Thantlang Township\n* [[Tonzang]], Tonzang Township\n* [[Webulah]], Webulah town \n* [[Hnaring]], Hnaring town\n* [[Surkhua]], Surkhua town\n* [[Makui innu]], Makui innu town\n* [[Khaikam]], Khaikam sub-township in East\n\n==Government==\n\n===Executive===\n[[Chin State Government]]\n\n===Legislature===\n{{see also|Chin State Hluttaw}}\n\n===Judiciary===\n[[Chin State High Court]]{{expand section|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Hiang Ziing Village, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|left|thumb| HiangHing Village, [[Tedim Township]] - View]]\nKhonumtung (Mount Victoria), {{convert|10500|ft|m}} high, is the highest peak in Chin State.\n\nMany natural watercourses flow among mountain ranges running from north to south forming valleys and gorges.

Some consider the name Chin an [[exonym]], given by the Burmese and of unclear origin.\n\nThe first ''''Chin National Day'''' was celebrated in 1951 at Mindat.\n\nThe term ''Laimi'' was a common name for the people in Falam, Hakha,Thantlang and Lawngtlai district. There are some western tribes like Lusei, Ralte, Fanai/Pawi-Lusei, Renthlei, Hmar and Khiangte are claiming the term ''[[Mizo people|Mizo]]'' to refer themselves and the whole tribes of the so-called ''Chin''s.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe government of Myanmar officially designated Falam as the radio language of Chin State more than 30 years ago. Since then Falam has been the medium for Chin radio program broadcast by the government.\n\nHowever, the Tedim language is the common language used among Zomi/Zo people. Tedim is spoken widely in Kalay township where they have been vastly [[Kalaymyo|overwhelming]] long before Burmese Independence. The population of Tedim language speaking people is calculated to be more than 100,000, without taking into account of the fact that Ngawn, [[Vaiphei people|Vaiphei]], Sihzang who hardly understand.\n\nLai is used as the main communication language in Falam, Hakha and Thantlang townships and it is used and understood by most of the chin people. As the dialects in the areas of Hakha and Falam are from Tibeto-Burman dialect and 85% of the phonetic and accent are the same, people from Falam can easily communicate with Hakha language and vice versa. Chin people have a native-like understanding of [[Mizo language]], except for those who live in very remote areas speaking dialects.\n\n[[Chin people]] are called by names such as [[Zo people|Laimi and Zo people]], K'Cho, [[Lusei]] (later [[Mizo people|Mizo]]), Kuki and others based on the names they were designated by Burmese people in the surrounding areas and the British. Recently, some Tedim Cikha, Khaikam and Tonzang people have accepted ''Zomi'' nomenclature, which means the people of Zo (ancestor) or Highland uh.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This very Zo people who live and dwell in the plain region are called phaimi (which means people from plain area). According to the record of Zam Siian Sang Gualnam who surveyed the seasons and population of the people called Chin Nationalities during the years 2004\u20132007 with the ''Chin Survey'' research team, the combination of all Chin peoples and their populations are as follows:\n\n1.

They migrated to Manipur State (India) about 800 years ago.\n\nAlthough the exact population of [[Chin people]] is unknown so far and the population of [[Laimi]]  are the second largest after Zomi in Chin state, Laimi may be divided in two groups Hakha and Falam as the two dialects differ a bit but Hakha Lai Language is understood by more population numbers, the population in Chin State is dispersing in rush in the past 50 years. Besides, the number of [[Chin people]] in Chin State has been decreasing at a rapid rate due to migration since the early 2000s for economic and political reasons.\n\nMaking a living is getting harder due to rapid population increase and unsustainable practice of slash and burn agriculture.\n\nSince the early 1990s, a large number of Burmese soldiers began moving into Chin State because there have been movements of rebellion. It is estimated that from Falam region alone, approximately 100,000 have moved to other parts of Burma and a significantly large number has gone to neighboring countries of India, Malaysia and Thailand since 2000. From Hakha and Thantlang regions, no fewer than 100,000 people have migrated to Malaysia, India and other countries. This emigration is true for other townships in Chin State, with the exception of Mindat, Kanpetlet and Paletwa \u2014 three of the most isolated towns. Since early 2000, a large number of Chin people living and working legally and illegally have been settled as refugees in third countries including Australia, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Netherland, Canada, United States and New Zealand with the United States taking in the largest numbers.\n\nThe Chin people in Falam use the word Salai for ''Mr.'' and Leng as ''Miss as'' the Hakha (ethnic Chin) use ''Leng'' as Miss and ''Val'' as Mr.\n\nThe Tedim ethnic group use ''Tang'' as Mr. and ''Lia'' as Miss. ''Pa''/''Nu'' as the marired person male/female respectively. The honour person as ''Sia'' for person and ''Sianu or Siapa as female/male respectively.\nThe Maras use \"Puhpa\" for \"Mr\" and \"Pihno\" for \"Mrs\"\n\nMatu use ''Mang'' for man and ''Tuem'' for woman and ''Pu'' and ''Pi'', and ''Pa'' and ''Nu'', are used commonly for elderly Chin and Chin leaders such as ''Pu Hrang Thio'' (famous for his courage in the nationwide). The title of ''Pu'' is a term of respect. Failure to use it may be interpreted as a sign of disrespect. The word ''Pi'' is used to address elderly Chin women. Tribes also practice different ways in naming people.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Chin (2014)<ref name=\"TUR\">{{cite book | url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B067GBtstE5TSl9FNElRRGtvMUk | title=The 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census Census Report Volume 2-C | publisher=Department of Population Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population MYANMAR | author=Department of Population Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population MYANMAR | year=July 2016 | pages=12\u201315}}</ref>\n|title =\n|label1 = Christianity\n|value1 = 85.4\n|color1 = DodgerBlue\n|label2 = Buddhism\n|value2 = 13\n|color2 = Yellow\n|label3 = Tribal religion\n|value3 = 0.4\n|color3 = GreenYellow\n|label4 = Islam\n|value4 = 0.1\n|color4 = Green\n|label5 = Other religion\n|value5 = 1.1\n|color5 = DeepPink\n}}\n\n[[Christianity]] is the practised by the majority of the population.
