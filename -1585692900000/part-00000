One of the last great [[Rococo]] buildings to be designed in Europe,<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 179.\">Lowndes, p. 179.</ref> the palace was conceived as a summer retreat for [[Peter III of Portugal|Dom Pedro of Braganza]], later to become husband and then [[king consort]] to his own niece, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]]. It served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness continued in the years following Dom Pedro's death in 1786. Following the destruction by fire of the [[Ajuda National Palace|Ajuda Palace]] in 1794, Queluz Palace became the official residence of the Portuguese [[Regent|prince regent]] [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], and his family and remained so until the royal family fled to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]] in 1807 following the French [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invasion of Portugal]].<ref name=\"IPPAR\">IPPAR</ref>\n\nWork on the palace began in 1747 under Portuguese architect [[Mateus Vicente de Oliveira]]. Despite being far smaller, the palace is often referred to as the Portuguese [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref>Fielding, p. 275.</ref> From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state. Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted one-third of the interior, the palace was extensively restored, and today is open to the public as a major tourist attraction.\n\nOne wing of the palace, the [[Palace of Queluz#State Guest House|Queen Maria I Pavilion]], built by [[Manuel Caetano de Sousa (architect)|Manuel Caetano de Sousa]], is currently used as Portugal's official [[state guest house]], allocated to foreign [[Head of state|heads of state]].\n\n== Architecture and history ==\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:GianonewplanQueluz.JPG|left|300px|thumb|Simplified diagram showing layout of the palace (not to scale).

In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, Italian-influenced [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] which preceded the [[Rococo]] style throughout Europe.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/>\n\nComparisons with the far larger and more Baroque Versailles are unwarranted: Versailles is referred to as having \"an aura of majesty\" and it was built and dedicated to exhibit in stone \"all the glories of France,\"<ref>Rey, p. 44.</ref> whereas the far smaller palace at Queluz has been described as \"exquisite rather than magnificent\" and looking like \"a very expensive birthday cake\".<ref>Fielding, p. 275</ref> In its frivolity, the architecture of Queluz reflects the lifestyle led by the Portuguese royal family at the time of building: during the reign of Dom Pedro's brother, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]], when Portugal was in practice governed by a ''valido'' or [[favourite]], the [[Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]]. Pombal encouraged the royal family to while away their days in the country and leave affairs of state to him.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/> Thus the extravagant, almost whimsical architecture of Queluz, set apart from the capital city, exactly represents the politics and social events of Portugal during this era, and the carefree and flamboyant lives led by its occupants.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/> Queluz's role as a haven for those without responsibility was, however, to be short-lived.\n\nOn the accession to the throne of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state in much the same way as [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] used Europe's other famed Rococo palace, [[Sanssouci]].<ref>Powell, pp. 95&ndash;101.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Quinta de Queluz (s\u00e9culo XVII), na Villa Mombello, Imbersago, It\u00e1lia.png|thumb|left|300px|Queluz, as it looked in the 17th century]]\nThe site chosen for this summer retreat was in a secluded hollow.<ref>Lowndes. p. 179.</ref> It had originally been owned by the [[Manuel de Moura y Corte Real, 2nd Marquis of Castel Rodrigo|Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo]]. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the Marquis was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then became one of the many properties of the Portuguese king, [[John IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o IV]]. He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 181.\">Dynes, p. 181.</ref> Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of [[John V of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o V]].\n\nThe architect, Mateus Vicente de Oliveira, had trained under [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice|Ludovice of Ratisbon]] and [[Jean Baptiste Robillon]]<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 276.\">Fielding, p. 276.</ref> during the construction of the royal palace and [[convent]] of [[Mafra National Palace|Mafra]]. The more sombre and massive classical palace at Mafra does not appear to have influenced the design for Queluz, which is in a lighter, more airy style.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 179.\"/> Work began in 1747 and continued rapidly until 1755, when it was interrupted by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great earthquake of 1755]], after which the labourers were more urgently required for the reconstruction of the city. The earthquake proved to be a catalyst, because the urban rebuilding process stimulated the development of the arts in Portugal.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/> The subsequent architecture of Queluz was influenced by new ideas and concepts. When work recommenced in 1758, the design was adapted for fear of another earthquake. Thus the later works take the form of low, long buildings, more structurally stable than a single high block: as a result, viewed from a distance the palace resembles long [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]s linked by higher [[pavilion]]s rather than one single construction.<ref>Fielding, p. 276.</ref>\n\n==Exterior==\n[[File:Queluz (36930369494) (2).jpg|300px|thumb|The palace's public face to the town: the entrance from the [[cour d'honneur]]. Architecturally the most severe of the palace's many fa\u00e7ades, it gives no hint of the architectural excesses beyond (''see key '''2''''').]]\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Queluz March 2018-4.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Robillon's entrance is reached by flights of ingeniously designed steps adorned with statuary that employ [[forced perspective]] (''see key '''11''''').]]\n[[File:Neptune's glory (29838154532).jpg|thumb|300px|right|upright|Queluz is known for its gardens and their features, including the famous Fountain of Neptune.]]\nThe public [[fa\u00e7ade]] of the palace faces directly onto a town square and takes the form of two low, symmetrical, [[quadrant (architecture)|quadrant]] wings which flank the forward-reaching wings of a small central ''[[corps de logis]]'', thus forming a semi-circular [[cour d'honneur]] (''see key 1''). The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the [[onion dome|onion-domed]] chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and [[servants' quarters]] (''see keys 2, 1 and 13'').<ref>Lowndes, p. 175.</ref> The only decoration comes from the simple classical [[pediment]]s above the windows. This fa\u00e7ade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face with one of the most architecturally severe elevations of the palace (''see illustration right'').\n\nOliveira was directly responsible for the \"Ceremonial Fa\u00e7ade\" of the \"corps de logis\", the rectangular block which forms the nucleus of the palace, and some of the interior courtyards. His former tutor, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Robillon, was in charge of the gardens, many buildings, and the Rococo interiors. He in turn was assisted by [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement]] and other French and Portuguese artists. The \"Ceremonial Fa\u00e7ade\" is the best-known view of the palace. With classical proportions, it is externally decorated by [[travertine]] rendering and delicately carved [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]]s over the windows. It has been described as a \"harmonious example of Portuguese Baroque\".<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 181.\"/> This fa\u00e7ade with its single-storey flanking wings forms a three-sided courtyard containing the \"Hanging Garden\"\u2014so called because like the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] it is on a raised terrace (''see key 5'').\n\nThe second major part of the palace is the great western wing, known as the Robillon wing or Robillon Pavilion, which illustrates better than any other the excesses of Baroque and Rococo architecture (''see key 9''). Completed in 1779, it has a [[Doric order|doric]] [[colonnade]] which runs the entire length of its western and southern fa\u00e7ades, the roof of which provides a balustraded balcony accessible from the floor above (''see key 10''). Owing to the topography of the site, the eastern side appears as a single-storey building, with only the upper floor visible above the ground in the \"Hanging Garden\". The balustrade on the roof of the Robillon wing is broken by heavy segmental [[pediment]]s adorned with reclining statuary figures; the balustrade itself is also adorned with [[:wiktionary:flambeau|flambeau]]x, statuary and heavy [[armorial]] [[Trophy (architectural)|trophies]] (''see illustration below'').\n\nThe Robillon wing contains an entrance to the palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight so as not to lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (''see key 11''). The bays of the fa\u00e7ade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and [[pilaster]]s in natural stone (''see illustration'').\n\nIn 1760, Pombal arranged for Dom Pedro to marry the king's unstable daughter Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple to live with their children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away from the seat of government. It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she did not have time to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.<ref name=\"Maria I of Portugal\">Maria I of Portugal</ref>\n\nBy the death of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the interior work was completed.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\">Fielding, p. 279.</ref> This was fortunate, as from this period his widow's mental health deteriorated, until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects. Her eldest son, later King [[John VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]], was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.<ref name=\"Fielding, p.279.\">Fielding, p.279.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the [[World Monuments Fund]] began a program to restore the lead sculptures by British sculptor [[John Cheere]], as well as some of the other features of the garden. The project is ongoing.\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Oh happy days!

The Baroque extravagance is emphasized by being placed above the simpler [[Doric order|doric]] colonnade (''see key '''8''''').]]\n|}\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe interior of the palace received no less attention to detail and design than the exterior. French [[artisan]]s were employed to decorate the rooms, many of which are small, their walls and ceilings painted to depict allegorical and historical scenes. Polished red bricks were frequently used for the floors, for a [[:wiktionary:rustic|rustic]] appearance as well as coolness in hot weather.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 179.\"/> The many tall pavilions which link the various lower wings of the palace allow for a series of long low rooms broken by higher and lighter rooms. A predominant feature of the interiors is the [[azulejo]]s: [[polychrome]] glazed tiles, often in a [[chinoiserie]] style with tones of blues and yellows contrasting with muted reds. Materials for use on the interior included stone imported from [[Genoa]] and woods from Brazil, Denmark and Sweden, while coloured marbles were imported from Italy.<ref>Lowndes, p. 179</ref> Many of the palace's rooms were severely damaged by fire in 1934, and much was lost.\n\n=== The state apartments ===\n\n==== The Sala das Mangas ====\n\nThe Sala das Mangas (the only room in the state apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels (''illustrated below''). The gallery leads to the enfilade of [[state room]]s, all of which have been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed [[Drawing room|salon]] painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.\n\n==== The Music Room ====\n\nThe Music Room (''illustrated below'') which follows the \"Sala dos Embaixadores\" is decorated with gilded and painted wood and was redesigned in 1768. The [[:Image:Queluz Palace ceiling detail.JPG|ceiling inset with painted cartouches]] is notable for the intricate ribbed scheme of its design, similar to that of the vestibule at [[Caserta Palace|Caserta]].<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 182.\">Dynes, p. 182.</ref> The Music Room is decorated in a more neoclassical style than the other state rooms, reflecting its redesign in the period following the Baroque Rococo in the final half of the 18th century. This room was the setting for the large concerts for which the palace was famous.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 183.\">Dynes, p. 183.</ref> The room still contains the [[Empire (style)|Empire]] grand piano decorated with gilt appliques.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 182.\"/> Above the piano hangs a [[:Image:Sala de M\u00fasica.jpg]].

To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms.<ref>Dynes, p. 183.</ref> The [[ormolu]] Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]]' [[Amalienburg]] at [[Schloss Nymphenburg]].<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 183.\"/> The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden [[caryatid]]s.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 183.\">Lowndes, p. 183.</ref>\n\n==== The Hall of Ambassadors ====\n\nThe Hall of Ambassadors (\"Sala dos Embaixadores\"), sometimes called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 and is one of the largest reception rooms in the palace.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 183.\"/> This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt [[console table]] above which are [[pier glass]]es adorned with crystal [[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s. The throne [[dais]], set in an [[apse]], is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a [[Checkerboard|chequer board]] pattern of black and white marble tiles.<ref>Lowndes, p. 178.</ref>\n<center>\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Queluz interior 1.JPG|300px|thumb|The Ballroom.

It was no coincidence that the chapel was the first part of the palace to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband\u2014the couple attended [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] several times a day.<ref name=\"Maria I of Portugal\"/> Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies.<ref name=\"Maria I of Portugal\"/> Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil.

Amongst the more remarkable rooms in this suite are the Sala das Merendas, the Queen's Boudoir and the King's Bedroom.\n\n====Sala das Merendas====\n\nThis was the royal family's private dining room. The decoration continues the theme used in some of the more formal and public rooms, with tiled panels illustrating [[Pastoral|courtiers in sylvan poses]]. These panels, like much other work in the palace, were produced by [[Jo\u00e3o Valentim]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Conrado Rosa]].<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\">Lowndes, p. 181.</ref>\n\n====The Queen's Boudoir====\n\nThis was one of the private rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is designed in the form of a [[:wiktionary:bower|bower]], with a [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (''illustrated below''), giving the impression of being in a [[pergola]] rather than an interior.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by Jos\u00e9 Conrado Rosa.<ref>Dynes, p. 184.</ref> Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], who visited the palace in 1794.<ref>Lowndes, p. 181</ref>\n\n====The King's Bedroom====\n\nThe King's Bedroom (''illustrated below'') has been described as one of the most \"fantastic\" rooms in the palace.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> Although actually square, it gives the illusion of being completely circular, with a domed ceiling supported by columns of mirrored glass. Between the columns are [[cartouche]]s depicting scenes from the tales of [[Don Quixote]]. Peter the IV died in this room in 1834, same room where he was born in  1798.

The Flemish influences, including the canals, in the garden are the work of the Dutch gardener [[Gerald van der Kolk]], who assisted Robillon from 1760.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 186\">Dynes, p. 186.</ref> Formal terraces and walkways are given extra interest by statuary and fountains. The dominant feature of the principal parterre is the \"Portico dos Cavalinhos\", a garden temple flanked by two allegorical equestrian statues depicting [[Pheme|Fame]]s, and two [[sphinx]]es (''see final illustration'') surreally dressed in 18th-century costume, combining the formal and the fantastic.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 277.\">Fielding, p. 277.</ref> This surreal theme continues elsewhere in the gardens where such motifs as the [[rape of the Sabines]] and the death of [[Abel]] alternate with statuary of [[donkey]]s dressed in human clothing. Deeper in the gardens is a [[grotto]] complete with a cascade. Later to be a popular feature in Portuguese gardens, the Queluz cascade was the first [[artificial waterfall]] to be constructed near Lisbon.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 277.\"/>\n\nAn avenue of huge [[magnolia]]s forms the approach to the classical Robillon wing of the palace (''see key 7''), while from the wing a [[:Image:Palacio Queluz Corredor Mangas2.JPG|double staircase leads to the canal]]. More than 100&nbsp;metres (330&nbsp;ft) long, the [[:Image:Palacio Queluz Corredor Mangas1.JPG|walls of the canal]] are decorated with tiled panels depicting [[seascapes]] and associated scenes. This is the largest of a series of canals in the gardens bordered with [[chinoiserie]]-style [[azulejo]] tiles. Fed by a stream, the sluice gates to the canals are only opened in May. During the 18th century, the canals were the setting for [[f\u00eate champ\u00eatre|f\u00eates champ\u00eatres]] during which fully rigged ships would sail in processions with figures aboard in allegorical costumes.<ref>Fielding, p. 278.</ref>\n\nThe gardens also contain a [[:Image:Queluz Palace fa\u00e7ade and Triton fountain.JPG|fountain with tritons and dolphins]] which has been attributed to [[Bernini]].<ref>Lowndes, p. 185.</ref> There are further fountains and statuary in the lower gardens, including an important collection of statues by the British sculptor John Cheere (1709&ndash;1787).

The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children.<ref name=\"IPPAR.\">IPPAR.</ref> These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934.<ref name=\"IPPAR.\"/> To escape the forces of [[Napoleon I]] in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|fled to Brazil]]. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]], made several alterations to the building.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt [[Infanta Benedita of Portugal|Princess Maria Francisca Benedita]].<ref name=\"IPPAR.\"/> The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that Jo\u00e3o VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.<ref name=\"Fielding, p.279.\"/>\n\nCarlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister,<ref>Lowndes, p. 180.</ref> is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] described as the finest in Europe.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/> The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/> She died at the palace in 1830.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son [[Miguel of Portugal|King Miguel]] used the palace during the three-year [[Liberal Wars|civil war]] which he fought against his brother King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]],<ref name=\"IPPAR.\"/> before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son [[Pedro V of Portugal|Pedro V]]. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|Lu\u00eds]]. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the [[Lisbon regicide|assassination]] of Lu\u00eds' son [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]] in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|monarchy fell two years later]].\n\n== National Monument ==\n[[File:Queluz01.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The gardens at the Palace of Queluz are littered with fountains, statues, and sculptures.]]\nIn the 21st century, the palace gardens, once an [[irrigation|irrigated]] oasis in the centre of parched farmland, are bounded by the \"''Radial de Sintra''\" motorway which feeds traffic towards Lisbon and away from Sintra. However, transportation and tourism have been important infrastructural catalysts for the palace's maintenance and management. \n\nSince 1940 it has been open to the public as a museum. It houses much of the former royal collection, including furniture, [[Arraiolos]] carpets, paintings, and Chinese and European [[ceramic]]s and [[porcelain]].<ref name=\"IPPAR\"/>\n\nThe town square that the palace faces, \"''Largo do Pal\u00e1cio de Queluz''\", remains relatively unaltered since the 18th century. The large houses, once the homes of [[courtier]]s, and the [[Pousada de Dona Maria, Queluz|former Royal Guard quarters]] with its [[campanile]] are still clustered around the palace. \n\nIn latter years, the town of Queluz has expanded considerably to become one of the suburbs of Lisbon. The Palace of Queluz is one of most notable public landmarks in the [[Lisbon metropolitan area]].\n\n== State guest house ==\nThe ''Pavilh\u00e3o de D. Maria I'' ([[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] Pavilion), which makes up the palace's southernmost wing, was built during the third, and final, construction phase, executed by [[Manuel Caetano de Sousa]], which lasted from 1786, the year of King Pedro III's death, until 1792. \n\nIn 1957, the Queen Maria I Pavilion was renovated to serve as the [[Portuguese Government]]'s official [[state guest house]], for visiting heads of state and government.<ref name=\"IPPAR\"/> The planned state tour of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1957 was a principal motivating factor in the pavilion's renovation into a state guest house.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/9226071/S%C3%ADmbolos_e_pol%C3%ADtica_externa_a_visita_da_rainha_Isabel_II_a_Portugal_em_1957 Academia - Politica Externa: A Visita da Rainha Isabel II a Portugal em 1957]</ref>\n\nToday, the pavilion continues to house visiting dignitaries.

One of the last great [[Rococo]] buildings to be designed in Europe,<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 179.\">Lowndes, p. 179.</ref> the palace was conceived as a summer retreat for [[Peter III of Portugal|Dom Pedro of Braganza]], later to become husband and then [[king consort]] to his own niece, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal|Maria I]]. It served as a discreet place of incarceration for Queen Maria as her descent into madness continued in the years following Dom Pedro's death in 1786. Following the destruction by fire of the [[Ajuda National Palace|Ajuda Palace]] in 1794, Queluz Palace became the official residence of the Portuguese [[Regent|prince regent]] [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], and his family and remained so until the royal family fled to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]] in 1807 following the French [[Invasion of Portugal (1807)|invasion of Portugal]].<ref name=\"IPPAR\">IPPAR</ref>\n\nWork on the palace began in 1747 under Portuguese architect [[Mateus Vicente de Oliveira]]. Despite being far smaller, the palace is often referred to as the Portuguese [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].<ref>Fielding, p. 275.</ref> From 1826, the palace slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state. Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted one-third of the interior, the palace was extensively restored, and today is open to the public as a major tourist attraction.\n\nOne wing of the palace, the [[Palace of Queluz#State Guest House|Queen Maria I Pavilion]], built by [[Manuel Caetano de Sousa (architect)|Manuel Caetano de Sousa]], is currently used as Portugal's official [[state guest house]], allocated to foreign [[Head of state|heads of state]].\n\n== Architecture and history ==\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:GianonewplanQueluz.JPG|left|300px|thumb|Simplified diagram showing layout of the palace (not to scale).

In its design, Queluz is a revolt against the earlier, heavier, Italian-influenced [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] which preceded the [[Rococo]] style throughout Europe.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/>\n\nComparisons with the far larger and more Baroque Versailles are unwarranted: Versailles is referred to as having \"an aura of majesty\" and it was built and dedicated to exhibit in stone \"all the glories of France,\"<ref>Rey, p. 44.</ref> whereas the far smaller palace at Queluz has been described as \"exquisite rather than magnificent\" and looking like \"a very expensive birthday cake\".<ref>Fielding, p. 275</ref> In its frivolity, the architecture of Queluz reflects the lifestyle led by the Portuguese royal family at the time of building: during the reign of Dom Pedro's brother, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]], when Portugal was in practice governed by a ''valido'' or [[favourite]], the [[Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]]. Pombal encouraged the royal family to while away their days in the country and leave affairs of state to him.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/> Thus the extravagant, almost whimsical architecture of Queluz, set apart from the capital city, exactly represents the politics and social events of Portugal during this era, and the carefree and flamboyant lives led by its occupants.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/> Queluz's role as a haven for those without responsibility was, however, to be short-lived.\n\nOn the accession to the throne of Dom Pedro's wife Maria in 1777, Pombal was dismissed, and Dom Pedro and Maria ruled jointly in his place, using the partially completed Rococo palace at Queluz as a retreat from affairs of state in much the same way as [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] used Europe's other famed Rococo palace, [[Sanssouci]].<ref>Powell, pp. 95&ndash;101.</ref>\n\n[[File:A Quinta de Queluz (s\u00e9culo XVII), na Villa Mombello, Imbersago, It\u00e1lia.png|thumb|left|300px|Queluz, as it looked in the 17th century]]\nThe site chosen for this summer retreat was in a secluded hollow.<ref>Lowndes. p. 179.</ref> It had originally been owned by the [[Manuel de Moura y Corte Real, 2nd Marquis of Castel Rodrigo|Marquis of Castelo Rodrigo]]. When the ruling Spanish were driven from Portugal in 1640, the Marquis was accused of having collaborated with the Spanish and the property was seized by the Portuguese Crown. The estate and its hunting lodge then became one of the many properties of the Portuguese king, [[John IV of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o IV]]. He set it aside as one of the properties reserved for the second son of the reigning monarch.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 181.\">Dynes, p. 181.</ref> Thus it came into the hands of Dom Pedro, the second son of [[John V of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o V]].\n\nThe architect, Mateus Vicente de Oliveira, had trained under [[Jo\u00e3o Frederico Ludovice|Ludovice of Ratisbon]] and [[Jean Baptiste Robillon]]<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 276.\">Fielding, p. 276.</ref> during the construction of the royal palace and [[convent]] of [[Mafra National Palace|Mafra]]. The more sombre and massive classical palace at Mafra does not appear to have influenced the design for Queluz, which is in a lighter, more airy style.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 179.\"/> Work began in 1747 and continued rapidly until 1755, when it was interrupted by the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Great earthquake of 1755]], after which the labourers were more urgently required for the reconstruction of the city. The earthquake proved to be a catalyst, because the urban rebuilding process stimulated the development of the arts in Portugal.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 178.\"/> The subsequent architecture of Queluz was influenced by new ideas and concepts. When work recommenced in 1758, the design was adapted for fear of another earthquake. Thus the later works take the form of low, long buildings, more structurally stable than a single high block: as a result, viewed from a distance the palace resembles long [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]s linked by higher [[pavilion]]s rather than one single construction.<ref>Fielding, p. 276.</ref>\n\n==Exterior==\n[[File:Queluz (36930369494) (2).jpg|300px|thumb|The palace's public face to the town: the entrance from the [[cour d'honneur]].

The southern of the two quadrant wings is terminated by the [[onion dome|onion-domed]] chapel, while the northern wing contained the kitchens and [[servants' quarters]] (''see keys 2, 1 and 13'').<ref>Lowndes, p. 175.</ref> The only decoration comes from the simple classical [[pediment]]s above the windows. This fa\u00e7ade, that most readily seen from the town, presents a decorous and impassive public face with one of the most architecturally severe elevations of the palace (''see illustration right'').\n\nOliveira was directly responsible for the \"Ceremonial Fa\u00e7ade\" of the \"corps de logis\", the rectangular block which forms the nucleus of the palace, and some of the interior courtyards. His former tutor, the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Robillon, was in charge of the gardens, many buildings, and the Rococo interiors. He in turn was assisted by [[Jean-Baptiste Pillement]] and other French and Portuguese artists. The \"Ceremonial Fa\u00e7ade\" is the best-known view of the palace. With classical proportions, it is externally decorated by [[travertine]] rendering and delicately carved [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]]s over the windows. It has been described as a \"harmonious example of Portuguese Baroque\".<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 181.\"/> This fa\u00e7ade with its single-storey flanking wings forms a three-sided courtyard containing the \"Hanging Garden\"\u2014so called because like the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] it is on a raised terrace (''see key 5'').\n\nThe second major part of the palace is the great western wing, known as the Robillon wing or Robillon Pavilion, which illustrates better than any other the excesses of Baroque and Rococo architecture (''see key 9''). Completed in 1779, it has a [[Doric order|doric]] [[colonnade]] which runs the entire length of its western and southern fa\u00e7ades, the roof of which provides a balustraded balcony accessible from the floor above (''see key 10''). Owing to the topography of the site, the eastern side appears as a single-storey building, with only the upper floor visible above the ground in the \"Hanging Garden\". The balustrade on the roof of the Robillon wing is broken by heavy segmental [[pediment]]s adorned with reclining statuary figures; the balustrade itself is also adorned with [[:wiktionary:flambeau|flambeau]]x, statuary and heavy [[armorial]] [[Trophy (architectural)|trophies]] (''see illustration below'').\n\nThe Robillon wing contains an entrance to the palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight so as not to lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (''see key 11''). The bays of the fa\u00e7ade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and [[pilaster]]s in natural stone (''see illustration'').\n\nIn 1760, Pombal arranged for Dom Pedro to marry the king's unstable daughter Maria, the heiress to the throne. Pombal encouraged the couple to live with their children in the unfinished palace at Queluz, away from the seat of government. It had always been a favourite retreat of the couple and was their principal home before Maria's accession. Further enlargements were made to reflect the palace's elevation from country retreat to royal palace. However, Maria had dismissed Pombal on her accession and, as a ruling monarch, she did not have time to while away her hours in the country. Dom Pedro interfered little in affairs of state, preferring to spend his time on religious matters.<ref name=\"Maria I of Portugal\">Maria I of Portugal</ref>\n\nBy the death of Dom Pedro in 1786, all the interior work was completed.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\">Fielding, p. 279.</ref> This was fortunate, as from this period his widow's mental health deteriorated, until in 1794, she and her court took up official and full-time residence at Queluz. There the now completely insane Queen could be hidden from the view of her subjects. Her eldest son, later King [[John VI of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o VI]], was appointed Regent and ruled from Lisbon and the great palace at Mafra.<ref name=\"Fielding, p.279.\">Fielding, p.279.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the [[World Monuments Fund]] began a program to restore the lead sculptures by British sculptor [[John Cheere]], as well as some of the other features of the garden. The project is ongoing.\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Oh happy days!

The Baroque extravagance is emphasized by being placed above the simpler [[Doric order|doric]] colonnade (''see key '''8''''').]]\n|}\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe interior of the palace received no less attention to detail and design than the exterior. French [[artisan]]s were employed to decorate the rooms, many of which are small, their walls and ceilings painted to depict allegorical and historical scenes. Polished red bricks were frequently used for the floors, for a [[:wiktionary:rustic|rustic]] appearance as well as coolness in hot weather.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 179.\"/> The many tall pavilions which link the various lower wings of the palace allow for a series of long low rooms broken by higher and lighter rooms. A predominant feature of the interiors is the [[azulejo]]s: [[polychrome]] glazed tiles, often in a [[chinoiserie]] style with tones of blues and yellows contrasting with muted reds. Materials for use on the interior included stone imported from [[Genoa]] and woods from Brazil, Denmark and Sweden, while coloured marbles were imported from Italy.<ref>Lowndes, p. 179</ref> Many of the palace's rooms were severely damaged by fire in 1934, and much was lost.\n\n=== The state apartments ===\n\n==== The Sala das Mangas ====\n\nThe Sala das Mangas (the only room in the state apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels (''illustrated below''). The gallery leads to the enfilade of [[state room]]s, all of which have been fully restored. The formal rooms of the palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed [[Drawing room|salon]] painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.\n\n==== The Music Room ====\n\nThe Music Room (''illustrated below'') which follows the \"Sala dos Embaixadores\" is decorated with gilded and painted wood and was redesigned in 1768. The [[:Image:Queluz Palace ceiling detail.JPG|ceiling inset with painted cartouches]] is notable for the intricate ribbed scheme of its design, similar to that of the vestibule at [[Caserta Palace|Caserta]].<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 182.\">Dynes, p. 182.</ref> The Music Room is decorated in a more neoclassical style than the other state rooms, reflecting its redesign in the period following the Baroque Rococo in the final half of the 18th century. This room was the setting for the large concerts for which the palace was famous.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 183.\">Dynes, p. 183.</ref> The room still contains the [[Empire (style)|Empire]] grand piano decorated with gilt appliques.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 182.\"/> Above the piano hangs a [[:Image:Sala de M\u00fasica.jpg]].

To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms.<ref>Dynes, p. 183.</ref> The [[ormolu]] Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]]' [[Amalienburg]] at [[Schloss Nymphenburg]].<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 183.\"/> The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden [[caryatid]]s.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 183.\">Lowndes, p. 183.</ref>\n\n==== The Hall of Ambassadors ====\n\nThe Hall of Ambassadors (\"Sala dos Embaixadores\"), sometimes called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 and is one of the largest reception rooms in the palace.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 183.\"/> This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt [[console table]] above which are [[pier glass]]es adorned with crystal [[Sconce (light fixture)|sconce]]s. The throne [[dais]], set in an [[apse]], is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and the floor is a [[Checkerboard|chequer board]] pattern of black and white marble tiles.<ref>Lowndes, p. 178.</ref>\n<center>\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Queluz interior 1.JPG|300px|thumb|The Ballroom.

It was no coincidence that the chapel was the first part of the palace to be completed and was consecrated as early as 1752. Religion was one of Dom Pedro's favourite interests. During the reign of his wife he attended to matters spiritual and she to matters temporal. The Queen's interest in religion was, however, no less fevered than that of her husband\u2014the couple attended [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] several times a day.<ref name=\"Maria I of Portugal\"/> Following Dom Pedro's death, the Queen abandoned all festivities at the palace, and state receptions assumed the air of religious ceremonies.<ref name=\"Maria I of Portugal\"/> Finally the Queen's instability and religious mania degenerated into complete insanity.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> Queluz and its chapel then became her permanent retreat from the world until she was forced to flee from the advancing French in 1807 to Brazil. She died there in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1816.\n\nThe chapel beneath its large [[onion dome]] is dark and cavernous and decorated with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor [[Silvestre Faria Lobo]].<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 183.\"/> The upper level has galleries for the use of royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo [[pipe organ]]. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable [[baptismal font|font]], its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.<ref>Lowndes, p. 185.</ref>\n<center>\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Queluz chapel vault.JPG|150px|thumb|The vault above the altar inside the palace chapel.]]\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Queluz interior 2.JPG|300px|thumb|The altar of the palace chapel.]]\n|}\n</center>\n\n=== Private apartments ===\n\nThe private rooms of the palace are far smaller and more intimate than the formal state rooms and contain many [[:Image:Queluz Palace miniature world.JPG|royal mementos and curios]] which belonged to the rooms' former occupants. Amongst the more remarkable rooms in this suite are the Sala das Merendas, the Queen's Boudoir and the King's Bedroom.\n\n====Sala das Merendas====\n\nThis was the royal family's private dining room. The decoration continues the theme used in some of the more formal and public rooms, with tiled panels illustrating [[Pastoral|courtiers in sylvan poses]]. These panels, like much other work in the palace, were produced by [[Jo\u00e3o Valentim]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Conrado Rosa]].<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\">Lowndes, p. 181.</ref>\n\n====The Queen's Boudoir====\n\nThis was one of the private rooms used by Maria I during her time at Queluz. It is designed in the form of a [[:wiktionary:bower|bower]], with a [[Trellis (agriculture)|trellis]] pattern on the ceiling which is reflected in the design of the marquetry floor (''illustrated below''), giving the impression of being in a [[pergola]] rather than an interior.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> The marquetry floors of the private rooms distinguish these smaller more intimate rooms from the larger state rooms where such delicate features would have been damaged by more frequent use. The walls of the boudoir are heavily mirrored and contain overdoor and mirror carouches by Jos\u00e9 Conrado Rosa.<ref>Dynes, p. 184.</ref> Next to the boudoir is the Queen's bedroom; it was from this light and airy room that the demented shrieks of the Queen were reported by [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]], who visited the palace in 1794.<ref>Lowndes, p. 181</ref>\n\n====The King's Bedroom====\n\nThe King's Bedroom (''illustrated below'') has been described as one of the most \"fantastic\" rooms in the palace.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> Although actually square, it gives the illusion of being completely circular, with a domed ceiling supported by columns of mirrored glass. Between the columns are [[cartouche]]s depicting scenes from the tales of [[Don Quixote]]. Peter the IV died in this room in 1834, same room where he was born in  1798. The room contains a large bust of the King showing his \"pendulous jowls and unattractive face\".<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/>\n<center>\n{|\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Sala das Merendas.jpg|300px|thumb|The Sala das Merendas]]\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Quarto Imp\u00e9rio.jpg|300px|thumb|The Empire Bedroom]]\n|style=\"width:300px; padding:10px;\"|[[File:Sem t\u00edtuloop.jpg|300px|thumb|The Queen's Boudoir.

The Flemish influences, including the canals, in the garden are the work of the Dutch gardener [[Gerald van der Kolk]], who assisted Robillon from 1760.<ref name=\"Dynes, p. 186\">Dynes, p. 186.</ref> Formal terraces and walkways are given extra interest by statuary and fountains. The dominant feature of the principal parterre is the \"Portico dos Cavalinhos\", a garden temple flanked by two allegorical equestrian statues depicting [[Pheme|Fame]]s, and two [[sphinx]]es (''see final illustration'') surreally dressed in 18th-century costume, combining the formal and the fantastic.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 277.\">Fielding, p. 277.</ref> This surreal theme continues elsewhere in the gardens where such motifs as the [[rape of the Sabines]] and the death of [[Abel]] alternate with statuary of [[donkey]]s dressed in human clothing. Deeper in the gardens is a [[grotto]] complete with a cascade. Later to be a popular feature in Portuguese gardens, the Queluz cascade was the first [[artificial waterfall]] to be constructed near Lisbon.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 277.\"/>\n\nAn avenue of huge [[magnolia]]s forms the approach to the classical Robillon wing of the palace (''see key 7''), while from the wing a [[:Image:Palacio Queluz Corredor Mangas2.JPG|double staircase leads to the canal]]. More than 100&nbsp;metres (330&nbsp;ft) long, the [[:Image:Palacio Queluz Corredor Mangas1.JPG|walls of the canal]] are decorated with tiled panels depicting [[seascapes]] and associated scenes. This is the largest of a series of canals in the gardens bordered with [[chinoiserie]]-style [[azulejo]] tiles. Fed by a stream, the sluice gates to the canals are only opened in May. During the 18th century, the canals were the setting for [[f\u00eate champ\u00eatre|f\u00eates champ\u00eatres]] during which fully rigged ships would sail in processions with figures aboard in allegorical costumes.<ref>Fielding, p. 278.</ref>\n\nThe gardens also contain a [[:Image:Queluz Palace fa\u00e7ade and Triton fountain.JPG|fountain with tritons and dolphins]] which has been attributed to [[Bernini]].<ref>Lowndes, p. 185.</ref> There are further fountains and statuary in the lower gardens, including an important collection of statues by the British sculptor John Cheere (1709&ndash;1787). These gardens are set within tall hedges of [[Taxus baccata|yew]] and [[cypress]], and magnolia and mulberry trees planted by [[Jean-Andoche Junot|Marshal Junot]] during the French occupation in the Napoleonic wars.<ref>Lowndes, p. 184.</ref>\n\n== Later history ==\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Nacional de Queluz DSC04844 - QUELUZ (33206059102).jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[onion dome]] of the chapel.

A main road passes within metres of the palace (''see key '''15''''').]]\n\nFollowing a fire at the [[Ajuda National Palace|Ajuda Palace]] in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife [[Charlotte of Spain|Carlotta Joaquina]] began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children.<ref name=\"IPPAR.\">IPPAR.</ref> These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934.<ref name=\"IPPAR.\"/> To escape the forces of [[Napoleon I]] in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|fled to Brazil]]. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, [[Jean-Andoche Junot|General Junot]], made several alterations to the building.<ref name=\"Fielding, p. 279.\"/> On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt [[Infanta Benedita of Portugal|Princess Maria Francisca Benedita]].<ref name=\"IPPAR.\"/> The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that Jo\u00e3o VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.<ref name=\"Fielding, p.279.\"/>\n\nCarlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister,<ref>Lowndes, p. 180.</ref> is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] described as the finest in Europe.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/> The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/> She died at the palace in 1830.<ref name=\"Lowndes, p. 181.\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son [[Miguel of Portugal|King Miguel]] used the palace during the three-year [[Liberal Wars|civil war]] which he fought against his brother King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]],<ref name=\"IPPAR.\"/> before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son [[Pedro V of Portugal|Pedro V]]. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|Lu\u00eds]]. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace in Lisbon. On the [[Lisbon regicide|assassination]] of Lu\u00eds' son [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]] in 1908, the palace passed into the ownership of the state. Portugal was in the turmoil of revolution and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|monarchy fell two years later]].\n\n== National Monument ==\n[[File:Queluz01.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The gardens at the Palace of Queluz are littered with fountains, statues, and sculptures.]]\nIn the 21st century, the palace gardens, once an [[irrigation|irrigated]] oasis in the centre of parched farmland, are bounded by the \"''Radial de Sintra''\" motorway which feeds traffic towards Lisbon and away from Sintra. However, transportation and tourism have been important infrastructural catalysts for the palace's maintenance and management. \n\nSince 1940 it has been open to the public as a museum. It houses much of the former royal collection, including furniture, [[Arraiolos]] carpets, paintings, and Chinese and European [[ceramic]]s and [[porcelain]].<ref name=\"IPPAR\"/>\n\nThe town square that the palace faces, \"''Largo do Pal\u00e1cio de Queluz''\", remains relatively unaltered since the 18th century. The large houses, once the homes of [[courtier]]s, and the [[Pousada de Dona Maria, Queluz|former Royal Guard quarters]] with its [[campanile]] are still clustered around the palace. \n\nIn latter years, the town of Queluz has expanded considerably to become one of the suburbs of Lisbon. The Palace of Queluz is one of most notable public landmarks in the [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]].\n\n== State guest house ==\nThe ''Pavilh\u00e3o de D. Maria I'' ([[Maria I of Portugal|Queen Maria I]] Pavilion), which makes up the palace's southernmost wing, was built during the third, and final, construction phase, executed by [[Manuel Caetano de Sousa]], which lasted from 1786, the year of King Pedro III's death, until 1792. \n\nIn 1957, the Queen Maria I Pavilion was renovated to serve as the [[Portuguese Government]]'s official [[state guest house]], for visiting heads of state and government.<ref name=\"IPPAR\"/> The planned state tour of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1957 was a principal motivating factor in the pavilion's renovation into a state guest house.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/9226071/S%C3%ADmbolos_e_pol%C3%ADtica_externa_a_visita_da_rainha_Isabel_II_a_Portugal_em_1957 Academia - Politica Externa: A Visita da Rainha Isabel II a Portugal em 1957]</ref>\n\nToday, the pavilion continues to house visiting dignitaries.

It was part of the \"[[Black Reichswehr]]\" and in the late days of the [[Weimar Republic]] operated as the armed branch of the national conservative [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), placed at party gatherings in the position of armed security guards (''Saalschutz'').\n\n==History==\n===Weimar Republic (1918\u20131933)===\nThe ''Stahlhelm'' was formed on December 25, 1918, in [[Magdeburg]], [[Germany]], by the factory owner and first World War-disabled [[Military reserve force|reserve]] officer [[Franz Seldte]]. After the [[armistice with Germany|November 11 Armistice]], the Army had been split up and the newly established German ''[[Reichswehr]]'' according to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was to be confined to no more than 100,000 men. Similar to the numerous ''[[Freikorps]]'', which upon the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] were temporarily backed by the [[Council of the People's Deputies]] under Chancellor [[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]]), the ''Stahlhelm'' ex-servicemen's organization was meant to form a [[paramilitary]] organization. \n\nThe league was a rallying point for [[Revanchism|revanchist]] and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]] forces from the beginning. Within the organization a worldview oriented toward the prior [[German Empire|Imperial]] regime and the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] monarchy predominated, many of its members promoting the ''Dolchstosslegende'' (\"[[Stab-in-the-back legend]]\") and the \"November Criminals\" bias against the [[Weimar Coalition]] government. Its journal, ''Der Stahlhelm'', was edited by Count [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Blumenthal]], later hanged for his part in the [[July 20 plot]]. Financing was provided by the ''Deutscher Herrenklub'', an association of German industrialists and [[business magnate]]s with elements of the [[East Elbia]]n landed gentry (''[[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]]''). [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] veterans were denied admission and formed a separate ''[[Reichsbund j\u00fcdischer Frontsoldaten]]''.\n\nAfter the failed [[Kapp Putsch]] of 1920, the organization gained further support from dissolved ''Freikorps'' units. In 1923 the former DNVP politician [[Theodor Duesterberg]] joined the ''Stahlhelm'' and quickly rose to Seldte's deputy and long\u2013time rival. From 1924 on, in several subsidiary organizations, veterans with front line experience as well as new recruits would provide a standing armed force in support of the ''Reichswehr'' beyond the 100,000 men allowed. With 500,000 members in 1930, the league was the largest paramilitary organization of [[Weimar Republic]]. In the 1920s the ''Stahlhelm'' received political support from Fascist Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref>Stanley G. Payne. ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition''. University of Wisconsin Press, 1980. {{ISBN|9780299080648}}. Pp. 62.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P046284, Berlin, Reichspr\u00e4sidentenwahl, Werbung \"Stahlhelm\".jpg|thumb|left|A \"Stahlhelm\" propaganda car in Berlin promoting DNVP nominee Theodor Duesterberg for president of the German Reich in the 1932 election]]\nAlthough the ''Stahlhelm'' was officially a non-party entity and above party politics, after 1929 it took on an open anti-republican and anti-democratic character. Its goals were a German dictatorship, the preparation of a revanchist program, and the direction of local anti-parliamentarian action. For political reasons its members distinguished themselves from the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) as \"German [[Fascism|Fascists]]\". Among their further demands were the establishment of a Greater Germanic People's Reich, struggle against [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democracy]], the \"mercantilism of the Jews\" and the general liberal democratic worldview, and attempted without success to place candidates favorable to the politics of a renewed German [[Drang nach Osten|expansion to the East]].\n\nIn 1929 the ''Stahlhelm'' supported the \"Peoples' Initiative\" of DNVP leader [[Alfred Hugenberg]] and the Nazis to initiate a [[1929 German referendum|German referendum]] against the [[Young Plan]] on [[World War I reparations]] in order to overthrow the government of Chancellor [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]]. In 1931 they proposed another [[1931 Prussian Landtag referendum|referendum for the dissolution of the Prussian Landtag]]. After both these referenda failed to reach the 50% necessary to be declared valid, the organization in October 1931 joined another attempt of DNVP, NSDAP and [[Pan-German League]] to form the [[Harzburg Front]], a united [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] campaign against the Weimar Republic and Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]]. However, the front soon broke up and in the first round of the 1932 [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election]], Theodor Duesterberg ran as ''Stahlhelm'' candidate against incumbent [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Facing a massive Nazi campaign reproaching him with a non-pure \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\" ancestry he only gained 6.8% of the votes cast.\n\n===Nazi Germany (1933\u20131935)===\n[[File:Naziuniformen 1934.jpg|thumb|left|''Der Stahlhelm'' in uniform, [[Circa|ca.]] 1934]]\nAfter the Nazi [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]] on January 30, 1933, the new authorities urged for a merge into the party's ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary organization. [[Franz Seldte]] joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour, prevailing against Duesterberg. The ''Stahlhelm'' still tried to keep its distance from the Nazis, and in the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|German federal election]] of 5 March 1933 formed the united conservative \"Black-White-Red Struggle Front\" (''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'') with the DNVP and the [[Agricultural League]], reaching 8% of the votes. On March 27, 1933, a SA raid with the intention of disarmament on ''Stahlhelm'' members in [[Braunschweig]], who under the command of [[Werner Schrader]] had forged an alliance with scattered Republican ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]]'' forces. The violent incident initiated by Nazi Minister [[Dietrich Klagges]] and later called ''Stahlhelm Putsch'' was characteristic of the pressure applied by the Nazis on the ''Stahlhelm'' in this period, mistrusting the organization due to its fundamentally [[monarchist]] character. In April Seldte applied for membership in the NSDAP and also joined the SA, from August 1933 in the rank of an ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.\n\nOn April 27, 1933, Seldte had officially declared the ''Stahlhelm'' subordinate to Hitler's command. The attempts by the Nazis to integrate the ''Stahlhelm'' succeeded in 1934 in the course of the \"voluntary\" ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process: the organization was renamed ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Frontk\u00e4mpferbund'' (League of National Socialist Frontline-Fighters) while large parts were merged into the SA as ''Wehrstahlhelm'', ''Reserve I'' and ''Reserve II'' contingents. The remaining ''Frontk\u00e4mpferbund'' veterans' units were finally dissolved by decree of Adolf Hitler on November 7, 1935. Seldte's rival Duesterberg was interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] upon the [[Night of the Long Knives]] at the beginning of July 1934, but released soon after.\n\n==Ranks and insignia==\n[[File:Stahlhelm (N&H) obverse 1.JPG|thumb|A Stahlhelm membership stickpin]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Wehrmann\n* Oberwehrmann\n* Stabswehrmann\n* Gruppenf\u00fchrer\n* Feldmeister\n* Oberfeldmeister\n* Zugf\u00fchrer\n* Oberzugf\u00fchrer\n* Kompanief\u00fchrer\n* Bataillonsf\u00fchrer\n* Stabsf\u00fchrer\n* Regimentsf\u00fchrer\n* Brigadef\u00fchrer\n* Divisionsf\u00fchrer\n* Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\n* Bundeshauptmann\n* Bundesf\u00fchrer\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Weimar paramilitary groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Tauber |first=Kurt |year=1967 |title=[[Beyond Eagle and Swastika]]: German Nationalism Since 1945 |location=Middletown, Conn. |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n<!--\n  ===============================================================================\n   WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

Similar to the numerous ''[[Freikorps]]'', which upon the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|Revolution of 1918\u20131919]] were temporarily backed by the [[Council of the People's Deputies]] under Chancellor [[Friedrich Ebert]] ([[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]]), the ''Stahlhelm'' ex-servicemen's organization was meant to form a [[paramilitary]] organization. \n\nThe league was a rallying point for [[Revanchism|revanchist]] and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]] forces from the beginning. Within the organization a worldview oriented toward the prior [[German Empire|Imperial]] regime and the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] monarchy predominated, many of its members promoting the ''Dolchstosslegende'' (\"[[Stab-in-the-back legend]]\") and the \"November Criminals\" bias against the [[Weimar Coalition]] government. Its journal, ''Der Stahlhelm'', was edited by Count [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen von Blumenthal]], later hanged for his part in the [[July 20 plot]]. Financing was provided by the ''Deutscher Herrenklub'', an association of German industrialists and [[business magnate]]s with elements of the [[East Elbia]]n landed gentry (''[[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]]''). [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish]] veterans were denied admission and formed a separate ''[[Reichsbund j\u00fcdischer Frontsoldaten]]''.\n\nAfter the failed [[Kapp Putsch]] of 1920, the organization gained further support from dissolved ''Freikorps'' units. In 1923 the former DNVP politician [[Theodor Duesterberg]] joined the ''Stahlhelm'' and quickly rose to Seldte's deputy and long\u2013time rival. From 1924 on, in several subsidiary organizations, veterans with front line experience as well as new recruits would provide a standing armed force in support of the ''Reichswehr'' beyond the 100,000 men allowed. With 500,000 members in 1930, the league was the largest paramilitary organization of [[Weimar Republic]]. In the 1920s the ''Stahlhelm'' received political support from Fascist Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]].<ref>Stanley G. Payne. ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition''.

Its goals were a German dictatorship, the preparation of a revanchist program, and the direction of local anti-parliamentarian action. For political reasons its members distinguished themselves from the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) as \"German [[Fascism|Fascists]]\". Among their further demands were the establishment of a Greater Germanic People's Reich, struggle against [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democracy]], the \"mercantilism of the Jews\" and the general liberal democratic worldview, and attempted without success to place candidates favorable to the politics of a renewed German [[Drang nach Osten|expansion to the East]].\n\nIn 1929 the ''Stahlhelm'' supported the \"Peoples' Initiative\" of DNVP leader [[Alfred Hugenberg]] and the Nazis to initiate a [[1929 German referendum|German referendum]] against the [[Young Plan]] on [[World War I reparations]] in order to overthrow the government of Chancellor [[Hermann M\u00fcller (politician)|Hermann M\u00fcller]]. In 1931 they proposed another [[1931 Prussian Landtag referendum|referendum for the dissolution of the Prussian Landtag]]. After both these referenda failed to reach the 50% necessary to be declared valid, the organization in October 1931 joined another attempt of DNVP, NSDAP and [[Pan-German League]] to form the [[Harzburg Front]], a united [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] campaign against the Weimar Republic and Chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]]. However, the front soon broke up and in the first round of the 1932 [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election]], Theodor Duesterberg ran as ''Stahlhelm'' candidate against incumbent [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Facing a massive Nazi campaign reproaching him with a non-pure \"[[Aryan race|Aryan]]\" ancestry he only gained 6.8% of the votes cast.\n\n===Nazi Germany (1933\u20131935)===\n[[File:Naziuniformen 1934.jpg|thumb|left|''Der Stahlhelm'' in uniform, [[Circa|ca.]] 1934]]\nAfter the Nazi [[Machtergreifung|seizure of power]] on January 30, 1933, the new authorities urged for a merge into the party's ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary organization. [[Franz Seldte]] joined the [[Hitler Cabinet]] as Reich Minister for Labour, prevailing against Duesterberg. The ''Stahlhelm'' still tried to keep its distance from the Nazis, and in the run-up to the [[March 1933 German federal election|German federal election]] of 5 March 1933 formed the united conservative \"Black-White-Red Struggle Front\" (''Kampffront Schwarz-Wei\u00df-Rot'') with the DNVP and the [[Agricultural League]], reaching 8% of the votes. On March 27, 1933, a SA raid with the intention of disarmament on ''Stahlhelm'' members in [[Braunschweig]], who under the command of [[Werner Schrader]] had forged an alliance with scattered Republican ''[[Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold|Reichsbanner]]'' forces. The violent incident initiated by Nazi Minister [[Dietrich Klagges]] and later called ''Stahlhelm Putsch'' was characteristic of the pressure applied by the Nazis on the ''Stahlhelm'' in this period, mistrusting the organization due to its fundamentally [[monarchist]] character. In April Seldte applied for membership in the NSDAP and also joined the SA, from August 1933 in the rank of an ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.\n\nOn April 27, 1933, Seldte had officially declared the ''Stahlhelm'' subordinate to Hitler's command. The attempts by the Nazis to integrate the ''Stahlhelm'' succeeded in 1934 in the course of the \"voluntary\" ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process: the organization was renamed ''Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Frontk\u00e4mpferbund'' (League of National Socialist Frontline-Fighters) while large parts were merged into the SA as ''Wehrstahlhelm'', ''Reserve I'' and ''Reserve II'' contingents. The remaining ''Frontk\u00e4mpferbund'' veterans' units were finally dissolved by decree of Adolf Hitler on November 7, 1935. Seldte's rival Duesterberg was interned at [[Dachau concentration camp]] upon the [[Night of the Long Knives]] at the beginning of July 1934, but released soon after.\n\n==Ranks==\n[[File:Stahlhelm (N&H) obverse 1.JPG|thumb|A Stahlhelm membership stickpin]]\n*Wehrmann\n*Oberwehrmann\n*Stabswehrmann\n*Gruppenf\u00fchrer\n*Feldmeister\n*Oberfeldmeister\n*Zugf\u00fchrer\n*Oberzugf\u00fchrer\n*Kompanief\u00fchrer\n*Bataillonsf\u00fchrer\n*Stabsf\u00fchrer\n*Regimentsf\u00fchrer\n*Brigadef\u00fchrer\n*Divisionsf\u00fchrer\n*Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\n*Bundeshauptmann\n*Bundesf\u00fchrer\n\n==See also==\n*[[Weimar paramilitary groups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book |last=Tauber |first=Kurt |year=1967 |title=[[Beyond Eagle and Swastika]]: German Nationalism Since 1945 |location=Middletown, Conn. |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n<!--\n  ===============================================================================\n   WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A COLLECTION OF LINKS.

{"title_page": "Crotoxin", "text_new": "'''Crotoxin (CTX)''' is the main toxic compound in the [[snake venom]] of the South American rattlesnake, ''[[Crotalus durissus]] terrificus''. Crotoxin is a heterodimeric beta-[[neurotoxin]], composed of an acidic, non-toxic and non-enzymatic subunit (CA), and a basic, weakly toxic, [[phospholipase A2]] protein (CB). \nThis neurotoxin causes paralysis by both pre- and postsynaptic blocking of [[acetylcholine]] signalling. \n\n==History==\nCrotoxin was identified in 1938 by researchers of the Department of Chemistry of the [[Instituto Butantan]] in S\u00e3o Paulo. The compound was first purified from the venom of ''Crotalus d. terrificus''. These researchers found that 60 per cent of the venom consisted of a neurotoxic substance, later referred to as crotoxin.<ref name=Slotta1938>Slotta, KH, Fraenkel-Conrat H.

The first publication of this discovery already proved that the toxin worked with two elements, a toxic and a coagulating principle.<ref name=Slotta1938 />  \nLater was discovered that the crotoxin protein is not homogeneous, but consists of 2 subunits. The toxic effect of crotoxin is determined mainly by the phospholipase A2 action of CB. The CA subunit is non-enzymatic and non-toxic, but has blood coagulating functions ([[Coagulation]]), now known as crotapotin.<ref>R\u00fcbsamen K, Breithaupt H, Habermann E (1971).

Both components form a noncovalent heterodimeric complex ([[Protein dimer]]). It was found that isoforms ([[Protein isoform]]) of CA and CB can form at least 16 distinct CTX complexes.<ref name=Fernandes2017 />\n\n==== The CA subunit ====\nThe CA protein is formed by three [[disulfide]]-bonded polypeptide chains: \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. Alpha-helices ([[Alpha helix]]) with loops at the terminal positions are formed by the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. The \u03b3 chain forms a disordered loop. Component CA is present in the heterodimeric complex to prevent the binding of the phospholipase A2 to nonspecific binding sites.<ref name=Fernandes2017 />\n\n====The CB subunit====\nThe CB subunit is a phospholipase A2 protein. The C-terminal ([[C-terminus]]) of the CB subunit is important for the interaction between both subunits as it interacts with an alpha helix of CA. The CA subunit thereby blocks a part of the enzyme surface of phospholipase A2, resulting in an impossibility to be activated. This means the phospholipase A2 cannot adsorb onto a lipid/water interface from the cell membrane. Residues on the CB subunit which are involved in the enzyme surface and blocked by the CA subunit are F24 and F119, which are [[phenylalanine]] amino acids. It however was found that these residues are not part of the [[active site]].<ref>Pereanez JA, G\u00f3mez ID, Patino AC (2012).

The isoforms thereby also play a role in the stability of the crotoxin complex. Less toxic complexes are less stable while the more toxic complexes are more stable. The more toxic crotoxin complexes therefore dissociate more slowly than the less toxic ones. The relation between toxicity and enzym activity is a result of the synergistic manner ([[Synergy]]) of action of both subunits. For this the CA subunit enhances the toxicity of the CB subunit while it reduces its enzyme activity and anticoagulant activity.<ref>Faure G, Xu H, Saul FA (2011).

Membrane damage by the PLA2 activity allows PLA2 to enter cells and specifically bind to proteins and receptors either agonistic or antagonistic, inducing pharmacological effects non-enzymatically. The intracellular PLA2 could also remain enzymatically active and hydrolyze membrane phospholipids. This could lead to pharmacological effect by means of the damage to the membranes and membrane proteins, or by the lysophospholipids and [[fatty acids]] released in hydrolysis.<ref>Kini, R Manjunatha (2003).

Postsynaptic [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] are blocked by the heterodimeric form of crotoxin.

Crotoxin is a heterodimeric beta-[[neurotoxin]], composed of an acidic, non-toxic and non-enzymatic subunit (CA), and a basic, weakly toxic, [[phospholipase A2]] protein (CB). \nThis neurotoxin causes paralysis by both pre- and postsynaptic blocking of [[acetylcholine]] signalling. \n\n==History==\nCrotoxin was identified in 1938 by researchers of the Department of Chemistry of the [[Instituto Butantan]] in S\u00e3o Paulo. The compound was first purified from the venom of ''Crotalus d. terrificus''. These researchers found that 60 per cent of the venom consisted of a neurotoxic substance, later referred to as crotoxin.<ref name=Slotta1938>Slotta, KH, Fraenkel-Conrat H.

The toxic effect of crotoxin is determined mainly by the phospholipase A2 action of CB. The CA subunit is non-enzymatic and non-toxic, but has blood coagulating functions ([[Coagulation]]), now known as crotapotin.<ref>R\u00fcbsamen K, Breithaupt H, Habermann E (1971).

Both components form a noncovalent heterodimeric complex ([[Protein dimer]]). It was found that isoforms ([[Protein isoform]]) of CA and CB can form at least 16 distinct CTX complexes.<ref name=Fernandes2017 />\n\n==== The CA subunit ====\nThe CA protein is formed by three [[disulfide]]-bonded polypeptide chains: \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. Alpha-helices ([[Alpha helix]]) with loops at the terminal positions are formed by the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. The \u03b3 chain forms a disordered loop. Component CA is present in the heterodimeric complex to prevent the binding of the phospholipase A2 to nonspecific binding sites.<ref name=Fernandes2017 />\n\n====The CB subunit====\nThe CB subunit is a phospholipase A2 protein. The C-terminal ([[C-terminus]]) of the CB subunit is important for the interaction between both subunits as it interacts with an alpha helix of CA. The CA subunit thereby blocks a part of the enzyme surface of phospholipase A2, resulting in an impossibility to be activated. This means the phospholipase A2 cannot adsorb onto a lipid/water interface from the cell membrane. Residues on the CB subunit which are involved in the enzyme surface and blocked by the CA subunit are F24 and F119, which are [[phenylalanine]] amino acids. It however was found that these residues are not part of the [[active site]].<ref>Pereanez JA, G\u00f3mez ID, Patino AC (2012).

The isoforms thereby also play a role in the stability of the crotoxin complex. Less toxic complexes are less stable while the more toxic complexes are more stable. The more toxic crotoxin complexes therefore dissociate more slowly than the less toxic ones. The relation between toxicity and enzym activity is a result of the synergistic manner ([[Synergy]]) of action of both subunits. For this the CA subunit enhances the toxicity of the CB subunit while it reduces its enzyme activity and anticoagulant activity.<ref>Faure G, Xu H, Saul FA (2011).

The exact mechanism of presynaptic acetylcholine inhibition by Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is not known. While the presynaptic effect is caused by the CB subunit, it is enhanced by the presence of the CA subunit.<ref>Cavalcante, Walter L.g., et al (2017).

Membrane damage by the PLA2 activity allows PLA2 to enter cells and specifically bind to proteins and receptors either agonistic or antagonistic, inducing pharmacological effects non-enzymatically. The intracellular PLA2 could also remain enzymatically active and hydrolyze membrane phospholipids. This could lead to pharmacological effect by means of the damage to the membranes and membrane proteins, or by the lysophospholipids and [[fatty acids]] released in hydrolysis.<ref>Kini, R Manjunatha (2003).

The large changes in the Ca2+-concentrations interfere with many processes, including vesicle fusion and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Both these processes are important for acetylcholine homeostasis.<ref>Rigoni, Michela, et al (2007).

Postsynaptic [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] are blocked by the heterodimeric form of crotoxin. This blocking is achieved by a stabilization of the inactive form of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by the enzyme complex. Together with the presynaptic acetylcholine inhibition, this post synaptic effect can lead to paralysis of the affected muscles.<ref name=Bon1979 />\n\n==Toxicity==\nCrotoxin has fatal neurotoxic effects, as the toxicity of CB is synergistically intensified by CA.<ref>Laustsen AH (2016).

Historians often depict it as the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history. The symbol of [[Britannia]] (a female personification of Great Britain) was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain. The historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] (1988) argues that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]]\" than at any time in a thousand years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32 {{ISBN|0192852132}}</ref>\n\nThis \"golden age\"<ref>From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C. S. Lewis]]; Lewis, ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century'' (Oxford, 1954) p. 1, {{OCLC|256072}}</ref> represented the apogee of the [[English Renaissance]] and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]], as [[William Shakespeare]] and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the [[Protestant Reformation]] became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the [[Spanish Armada]] was repelled. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\n\nThe Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns. It was a brief period of internal peace between the [[English Reformation]] and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics and then the political battles between [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\n\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The [[Italian Renaissance]] had come to an end under the weight of Spanish domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in its own religious battles that were (temporarily) settled in 1598 by a policy of tolerating Protestantism with the [[Edict of Nantes]]. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent by Spain's [[tercios]], the centuries-long conflict between France and England was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign.\n\nThe one great rival was Spain, with whom England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1585\u20131604. An attempt by [[Philip II of Spain]] to invade England with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 was famously defeated, but the tide of war turned against England with an unsuccessful expedition to Portugal and the Azores, the [[English Armada|Drake\u2013Norris Expedition of 1589]]. Thereafter, Spain provided some support for Irish Catholics in a debilitating rebellion against English rule, and Spanish naval and land forces inflicted a series of reversals against English offensives. This drained both the English Exchequer and economy that had been so carefully restored under Elizabeth's prudent guidance. English commercial and territorial expansion would be limited until the signing of the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London]] the year following Elizabeth's death.\n\nEngland during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], as well as Elizabeth's harsh punishments for any dissenters. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] trade and persistent theft of Spanish treasure.\n[[File:Britannia-Statue.jpg|thumb|The National Armada memorial in [[Plymouth]] using the Britannia image to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 (William Charles May, sculptor, 1888)]]\n\n==Romance and reality==\n[[File:Elizabeth succession allegory.jpg|left|thumb|250px|'''Elizabeth ushers in Peace and Plenty'''. Detail from ''The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'', c. 1572, attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]].]]\nThe [[Victorian era]] and the early 20th century idealised the Elizabethan era. The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' maintains that \"[T]he long reign of Elizabeth I, 1558\u20131603, was England's Golden Age... '[[Merry England]]', in love with life, expressed itself in music and literature, in architecture and in adventurous seafaring\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061112031836/http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-200261 Elizabeth I and England's Golden Age]. Britannica Student Encyclopedia</ref> This idealising tendency was shared by Britain and an Anglophilic America. In popular culture, the image of those adventurous Elizabethan seafarers was embodied in the films of [[Errol Flynn]].<ref>See ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Sea Hawk]]'' (1940).</ref>\n\nIn response and reaction to this hyperbole, modern historians and biographers have tended to take a more dispassionate view of the Tudor period.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Patrick Collinson|title=Elizabeth I and the verdicts of history|journal=Historical Research|year=2003|volume=76 |issue =194|pages=469\u201391|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.00186}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\nElizabethan England was not particularly successful in a military sense during the period, but it avoided major defeats and built up a powerful navy. On balance, it can be said that Elizabeth provided the country with a long period of general if not total peace and generally increased prosperity due in large part to stealing from Spanish treasure ships, raiding settlements with low defenses, and selling African slaves. Having inherited a virtually bankrupt state from previous reigns, her frugal policies restored fiscal responsibility. Her fiscal restraint cleared the regime of debt by 1574, and ten years later the Crown enjoyed a surplus of \u00a3300,000.<ref>Melissa D. Aaron, ''Global Economics'' (2005), p. 25. In the later decades of the reign, the costs of warfare \u2014 defeating the [[English Armada]] of 1589 and funding the campaigns in the Netherlands \u2014 obliterated the surplus; England had a debt of \u00a3350,000 at Elizabeth's death in 1603.</ref> Economically, [[Sir Thomas Gresham]]'s founding of the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] (1565), the first stock exchange in England and one of the earliest in Europe, proved to be a development of the first importance, for the economic development of England and soon for the world as a whole. With taxes lower than other European countries of the period, the economy expanded; though the wealth was distributed with wild unevenness, there was clearly more wealth to go around at the end of Elizabeth's reign than at the beginning.<ref>Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576\u20131642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 49\u201396 {{ISBN|0691064547}}.</ref> This general peace and prosperity allowed the attractive developments that \"Golden Age\" advocates have stressed.<ref>Christopher Hibbert (1991) ''The Virgin Queen: Elizabeth I, Genius of the Golden Age,'' Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0201608170}}.</ref>\n\n===Plots, intrigues and conspiracies===\nThe Elizabethan Age was also an age of plots and conspiracies, frequently political in nature, and often involving the highest levels of Elizabethan society. High officials in Madrid, Paris and Rome sought to kill Elizabeth, a Protestant, and replace her with [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], a Catholic. That would be a prelude to the religious recovery of England for Catholicism. In 1570, the [[Ridolfi plot]] was thwarted. In 1584, the [[Francis Throckmorton|Throckmorton Plot]] was discovered, after Francis Throckmorton confessed his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Queen and restore the Catholic Church in England. Another major [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] was the [[Babington Plot]] \u2014 the event which most directly led to Mary's execution, the discovery of which involved a [[double agent]], [[Gilbert Gifford]], acting under the direction of [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's highly effective spy master.\n\nThe [[Essex Rebellion]] of 1601 has a dramatic element, as just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]), paid for a performance of [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] at the [[Globe Theatre]], apparently with the goal of stirring public ill will towards the monarchy.<ref name=\"bate256\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Bate|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age|publisher=Penguin|location=London|year=2008|pages=256\u2013286|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> It was reported at the trial of Essex by [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Chamberlain's Men]] actor [[Augustine Phillips]], that the conspirators paid the company forty [[shilling]]s \"above the ordinary\" (i. e., above their usual rate) to stage the play, which the players felt was too old and \"out of use\" to attract a large audience.<ref name=\"bate256\" />\n\nIn the [[Bye Plot]] of 1603, two Catholic priests planned to kidnap King James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Most dramatic was the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]] to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. It was discovered in time with eight conspirators executed, including [[Guy Fawkes]], who became the iconic evil traitor in English lore.<ref>J. A. Sharpe (2005) ''Remember, Remember: A Cultural History of Guy Fawkes Day'', Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0674019350}}</ref>\n\n===Royal Navy and defeat of the Armada===\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Spanish Armada fighting the English navy at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]] in 1588.]]\nWhile Henry VIII had launched the [[Royal Navy]], Edward and Mary had ignored it and it was little more than a system of coastal defense. Elizabeth made naval strength a high priority.<ref>Julian S. Corbett (1898) [https://archive.org/details/drakeandtudorna01corbgoog ''Drake and the Tudor Navy, With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power''] 2 vol.</ref> She risked war with Spain by supporting the \"[[Sea Dogs]]\", such as [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on the Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The Navy yards were leaders in technical innovation, and the captains devised new tactics. Parker (1996) argues that the full-rigged ship was one of the greatest technological advances of the century and permanently transformed naval warfare. In 1573 English shipwrights introduced designs, first demonstrated in the \"Dreadnaught\", that allowed the ships to sail faster and maneuver better and permitted heavier guns.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=The 'Dreadnought' Revolution of Tudor England|journal=Mariner's Mirror|year=1996|volume=82 |issue =3|pages=269\u2013300|doi=10.1080/00253359.1996.10656603}}</ref> Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so that soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they stood off and fired broadsides that would sink the enemy vessel. When Spain finally decided to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco. Superior English ships and seamanship foiled the invasion and led to the destruction of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, marking the high point of Elizabeth's reign. Technically, the Armada failed because Spain's over-complex strategy required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. Moreover, the poor design of the Spanish cannons meant they were much slower in reloading in a close-range battle. Spain and France still had stronger fleets, but England was catching up.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=Why the Armada Failed|journal=History Today|year=1888|volume=38 |issue =5|pages=26\u201333}}</ref>\n\nParker has speculated on the dire consequences if the Spanish had landed their invasion army in 1588. He argues that the Spanish army was larger, more experienced, better-equipped, more confident, and had better financing. The English defenses, on the other hand, were thin and outdated; England had too few soldiers and they were at best only partially trained. Spain had chosen England's weakest link and probably could have captured London in a week. Parker adds that a Catholic uprising in the north and in Ireland could have brought total defeat.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=If the Armada Had Landed|doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1976.tb01347.x|journal=History|year=1976|volume=61|issue =203|pages=358\u2013368}}</ref>\n\n===Colonising the New World===\n{{main|English colonial empire}}\nThe discoveries of Christopher Columbus electrified all of western Europe, especially maritime powers like England.

Her desire to moderate the religious persecutions of previous Tudor reigns \u2014 the persecution of Catholics under Edward VI, and of Protestants under Mary I \u2014 appears to have had a moderating effect on English society. Elizabeth, Protestant, but undogmatic one, <ref> Christopher Haigh, English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993 p.&nbsp;237 {{ISBN|978-0-19-822162-3}}, </ref> reinstated the 1552 Book of Common Prayer with modifications which made clear that the Church of England believed in the (spiritual) Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Communion but without a definition how in favor of leaving this a mystery, and she had the Black Rubric removed from the Articles of Faith: this had allowed kneeling to receive communion without implying that by doing so it meant the real and essential presence of Christ in the bread and wine: she believed it so. She was not able to get an unmarried clergy or the Protestant Holy Communion celebrated to look like a Mass,  <ref> Haigh, op. cit. p.&nbsp;241</ref>. The Apostolic Succession was maintained, the institution of the church continued without a break (with 98% of the clergy remaining at their posts) and the attempt to ban music in church was defeated. The Injunctions of 1571 forbade any doctrines that did not conform to the teaching of the Church Fathers and the Catholic Bishops. The Queen's hostility to strict Calvinistic doctrines blocked the Radicals. \n\nAlmost no original theological thought came out of the English Reformation: instead the Church relied on the Catholic Consensus of the first Four Ecumenical Councils.   The preservation of many Catholic doctrines and practices was the cuckoos nest that eventually resulted in the formation of the Via Media during the 17th century. <ref> Diarmaid MacCullough, The Later Reformation in England, 1547-1603, 2001, pp.&nbsp;24\u201329 {{ISBN|0-333-69331-0}}, 'The cuckoo in the nest,' p.&nbsp;64, 78-86; English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993, pp.&nbsp;240\u2013242, 29-295.  </ref> She spent the rest of her reign ferociously fending of radical reformers and Roman Catholics who wanted to modify the Settlement of Church affairs: The Church of England was Protestant, \"with its peculiar arrested development in Protestant terms, and the ghost which it harboured of an older world of Catholic traditions and devotional practice,\" <ref> MacCullough, p.&nbsp;85. </ref>\n\nFor a number of years refrained from persecuting Catholics because she was against Catholicism, not her Catholic subjects if they made no trouble. In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] declared Elizabeth a heretic who was not the legitimate queen and that her subjects no longer owed her obedience. The pope sent Jesuits and seminarians to secretly evangelize and support Catholics. After several plots to overthrow her, Catholic clergy were mostly considered to be traitors, and were pursued aggressively in England. Often priests were tortured or executed after capture unless they cooperated with the English authorities. People who publicly supported Catholicism were excluded from the professions; sometimes fined or imprisoned.<ref>J. B.

The astronomers [[Thomas Digges]] and [[Thomas Harriot]] made important contributions; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published his seminal study of magnetism, ''De Magnete,'' in 1600. Substantial advancements were made in the fields of cartography and surveying. The eccentric but influential [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] also merits mention.\n\nMuch of this scientific and technological progress related to the practical skill of navigation. English achievements in exploration were noteworthy in the Elizabethan era. Sir [[Francis Drake]] circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1581, and [[Martin Frobisher]] explored the [[Arctic]]. The first attempt at English settlement of the eastern seaboard of North America occurred in this era\u2014the abortive colony at [[Roanoke Island]] in 1587.\n\nWhile Elizabethan England is not thought of as an age of technological innovation, some progress did occur. In 1564 Guilliam Boonen came from the [[Netherlands]] to be Queen Elizabeth's first [[coach-builder]] \u2014thus introducing the new European invention of the spring-suspension coach to England, as a replacement for the litters and carts of an earlier transportation mode. Coaches quickly became as fashionable as sports cars in a later century; social critics, especially [[Puritan]] commentators, noted the \"diverse great ladies\" who rode \"up and down the countryside\" in their new coaches.<ref>Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576\u20131642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 81\u201382 {{ISBN|0691064547}}</ref>\n\n==Social history==\nHistorians since the 1960s have explored many facets of the social history, covering every class of the population.<ref>On the social and demographic history see D.

Most towns were unpaved with poor public sanitation.  There were no [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] or drains,  and rubbish was simply abandoned in the street. Animals such as [[rat]]s thrived in these conditions. In larger towns and cities, such as London, common diseases arising from lack of sanitation included [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[malaria]], [[typhus]], [[diphtheria]], [[Scarlet fever]], and [[chickenpox]].<ref name=\"Life In Tudor Times\">{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/tudor.html |title=Life In Tudor Times |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nOutbreaks of the [[Black Death]] [[pandemic]] occurred in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589 and 1603.

Their homes were, as in earlier centuries, [[thatched]] huts with one or two rooms, although later on during this period, roofs were also tiled. Furniture was basic, with stools being commonplace rather than chairs.<ref name=\"Life In Tudor Times\"/> The walls of Tudor houses were often made from timber and [[wattle and daub]], or brick; stone and [[tiles]] were more common in the wealthier homes. The daub was usually then painted with [[limewash]], making it white, and the wood was painted with black [[tar]] to prevent rotting, but not in Tudor times; the Victorians did this afterwards. The bricks were handmade and thinner than modern bricks. The wooden beams were cut by hand, which makes telling the difference between Tudor houses and Tudor-style houses easy, as the original beams are not straight. The upper floors of Tudor houses were often larger than the ground floors, which would create an overhang (or [[jettying|jetty]]). This would create more floor-surface above while also keeping maximum street width. During the Tudor period, the use of glass when building houses was first used, and became widespread. It was very expensive and difficult to make, so the panes were made small and held together with a lead lattice, in [[casement windows]]. People who could not afford glass often used polished horn, cloth or paper. Tudor chimneys were tall, thin, and often decorated with symmetrical patterns of molded or cut brick. Early Tudor houses, and the homes of poorer people, did not have chimneys. The smoke in these cases would be let out through a simple hole in the roof.\n\n[[Mansions]] had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm. These fires were also the only way of cooking food. Wealthy Tudor homes needed many rooms, where a large number of guests and [[servants]] could be accommodated, fed and entertained. Wealth was demonstrated by the extensive use of glass. Windows became the main feature of Tudor mansions, and were often a fashion statement. Mansions were often designed to a symmetrical plan; \"E\" and \"H\" shapes were popular.<ref name=\"Tudor Houses\">{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |title=Tudor Houses |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510202040/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |archivedate=10 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Poverty===\n{{Main|Poor Law}}\n[[File:Vagrant being punished in the streets (Tudor England).jpg|thumb|240px|A woodcut from circa 1536 depicting a vagrant being punished in the streets in Tudor England.]]\n\nAbout one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give [[alms]] to assist the [[impotent poor]].<ref>John F.

There were few books, so pupils read from [[hornbooks]] instead. These wooden boards had the alphabet, prayers or other writings pinned to them and were covered with a thin layer of transparent cow's horn.

For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods\u2014such as oranges for the upper class\u2014and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.<ref>Joan Thirsk (2006) ''Food in Early Modern England: Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500\u20131760'', Continuum, {{ISBN|0826442331}}</ref>\n\nAt the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. The upper classes often celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of the king or queen. Feasts were commonly used to commemorate the \"procession\" of the crowned heads of state in the summer months, when the king or queen would travel through a circuit of other nobles' lands both to avoid the plague season of London, and alleviate the royal coffers, often drained through the winter to provide for the needs of the royal family and court. This would include a few days or even a week of feasting in each noble's home, who depending on his or her production and display of fashion, generosity and entertainment, could have his way made in court and elevate his or her status for months or even years.\n\nSpecial courses after a feast or dinner which often involved a special room or outdoor gazebo (sometimes known as a folly) with a central table set with dainties of \"medicinal\" value to help with digestion. These would include wafers, comfits of sugar-spun anise or other spices, jellies and marmalades (a firmer variety than we are used to, these would be more similar to our gelatin jigglers), candied fruits, spiced nuts and other such niceties. These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. One must remember that sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though it could be as everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body. It also, of course, allowed those standing to show off their gorgeous new clothes and the holders of the dinner and banquet to show off the wealth of their estate, what with having a special room just for banqueting.\n\n===Gender===\n[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait..jpg|thumb|250px|''The Procession Picture'', c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]\nWhile the Tudor era presents an abundance of material on the women of the nobility\u2014especially royal wives and queens\u2014historians have recovered scant documentation about the average lives of women.

Yet within this general trend, a native school of painting was developing. In Elizabeth's reign, [[Nicholas Hilliard]], the Queen's \"limner and goldsmith,\" is the most widely recognized figure in this native development; but [[George Gower]] has begun to attract greater notice and appreciation as knowledge of him and his art and career has improved.<ref>Ellis Waterhouse (1978) ''Painting in Britain: 1530\u20131790,'' 4th ed., New York, Viking Penguin, pp. 34\u201339 {{ISBN|0300058322}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n===Pastimes===\n{{Main|Elizabethan leisure}}\nThe Annual Summer [[Fair]] and other seasonal fairs such as May Day were often bawdy affairs.\n\nWatching plays became very popular during the Tudor period. Most towns sponsored plays enacted in town squares followed by the actors using the courtyards of taverns or inns (referred to as inn-yards) followed by the first theatres (great open-air amphitheatres and then the introduction of indoor theatres called playhouses). This popularity was helped by the rise of great playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] using London theatres such as the [[Globe Theatre]]. By 1595, 15,000 people a week were watching plays in London. It was during Elizabeth's reign that the first real theatres were built in England. Before theatres were built, actors travelled from town to town and performed in the streets or outside inns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/tudors/entertainment.html |title=Tudor Entertainment |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618130140/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/homework/tudors/entertainment.html |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMiracle plays were local re-enactments of stories from the Bible.

Animal sports included [[bear baiting|bear]] and [[bull baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cock fighting]].\n\nThe rich enjoyed [[tennis]], [[fencing]], and [[jousting]]. Hunting was strictly limited to the upper class. They favoured their packs of dogs and hounds trained to chase foxes, hares and boars. The rich also enjoyed hunting small game and birds with hawks, known as [[falconry]].\n\n====Jousting====\nJousting was an upscale, very expensive sport where warriors on horseback raced toward each other in full armor trying to use their lance to knock the other off his horse. It was a violent sport--[[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] of France was killed in a tournament in 1559, as were many lesser men. King Henry VIII was a champion; he finally retired from the lists after a hard fall left him unconscious for hours.<ref>Richard Barber and Juliet Barker,  ''Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages'' (Boydell Press, 1998) {{ISBN|0851157815}}</ref>\n\nOther sports included archery, bowling, hammer-throwing, quarter-staff contests, [[troco]], [[quoits]], [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], wrestling and [[mob football]].\n\n====Gambling and card games====\nDice was a popular activity in all social classes.  Cards appeared in Spain and Italy about 1370, but they probably came from Egypt. They began to spread throughout Europe and came into England around 1460. By the time of Elizabeth's reign, gambling was a common sport. Cards were not played only by the upper class. Many of the lower classes had access to playing cards. The card suits tended to change over time. The first Italian and Spanish decks had the same suits: Swords, Batons/ Clubs, Cups, and Coins. The suits often changed from country to country. England probably followed the Latin version, initially using cards imported from Spain but later relying on more convenient supplies from France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daines Barrington|authorlink=Daines Barrington|title=Archaeologia, or, Miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity|volume=8|year=1787|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|location=London|page=141}}</ref> Most of the decks that have survived use the French Suit: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Yet even before Elizabeth had begun to reign, the number of cards had been standardized to 52 cards per deck. The lowest court subject in England was called the \u201cknave.\u201d The lowest court card was therefore called the knave until later when the term \u201cJack\u201d became more common. Popular card games included Maw, One and Thirty, Bone-ace. (These are all games for small group players.) Ruff and Honors was a team game.\n\n===Festivals, holidays and celebrations===\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - Festival at Bermondsey.png|right|thumb|300px|A wedding feast, c. 1569.]]\n\nDuring the Elizabethan era, people looked forward to holidays because opportunities for leisure were limited, with time away from hard work being restricted to periods after church on Sundays. For the most part, leisure and festivities took place on a public church holy day. Every month had its own holiday, some of which are listed below:\n*The first Monday after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] of January (any time between 7 January and 14 January) was [[Plough Monday]]. It celebrated returning to work after the Christmas celebrations and the New Year.\n*2 February: [[Candlemas]]. Although often still very cold, Candlemas was celebrated as the first day of spring. All Christmas decorations were burned on this day, in candlelight and torchlight processions.\n*14 February: [[Valentine's day|Valentine's Day]].\n*Between 3 March and 9 March: [[Shrove Tuesday]] (known as [[Mardi Gras]] or Carnival on the Continent). On this day, apprentices were allowed to run amok in the city in mobs, wreaking havoc, because it supposedly cleansed the city of vices before [[Lent]]. <br />The day after Shrove Tuesday was [[Ash Wednesday]], the first day of Lent when all were to abstain from eating and drinking certain things.<br />24 March: [[Lady Day]] or the feast of the Annunciation, the first of the [[quarter days|Quarter Days]] on which rents and salaries were due and payable. It was a legal New Year when courts of law convened after a winter break, and it marked the supposed moment when the Angel [[Gabriel]] came to announce to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she would bear a child.\n*1 May: [[May day|May Day]], celebrated as the first day of summer. This was one of the few Celtic festivals with no connection to Christianity and patterned on [[Beltane]]. It featured crowning a [[May Queen]], a [[green man|Green Man]] and dancing around a [[maypole]].\n*21 June: [[Midsummer]] (Christianized as the feast of [[John the Baptist]]) and another Quarter Day.\n*1 August: [[Lammas]]tide, or Lammas Day. Traditionally, the first day of August, in which it was customary to bring a loaf of bread to the church.\n*29 September: [[Michaelmas]]. Another Quarter Day. Michaelmas celebrated the beginning of autumn, and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]].\n*25 October: [[St. Crispin's Day]]. Bonfires, revels, and an elected 'King Crispin' were all featured in this celebration. Dramatized by Shakespeare in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<br/>28 October: [[Lord Mayor's Show|The Lord Mayor's Show]], which still takes place today in London.<br/>31 October: [[All Hallows Eve]] or [[Halloween]]. The beginning celebration of the days of the dead.\n*1 November: [[All Saints' Day|All Hallows]] or [[All Saints' Day]], followed by [[All Souls' Day]].\n*17 November: [[Accession Day]] or Queen's Day, the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession to the throne, celebrated with lavish [[Accession Day tilt|court festivities featuring jousting]] during her lifetime and as a national holiday for dozens of years after her death.<ref>Hutton 1994, p. 146\u2013151</ref>\n*24 December: The [[Twelve Days of Christmas]] started at sundown and lasted until [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] on 6 January.

Historians often depict it as the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] in English history. The symbol of [[Britannia]] (a female personification of Great Britain) was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain. The historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] (1988) argues that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the [[House of Tudor|Tudors]]\" than at any time in a thousand years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32 {{ISBN|0192852132}}</ref>\n\nThis \"golden age\"<ref>From the 1944 Clark lectures by [[C. S. Lewis]]; Lewis, ''English Literature in the Sixteenth Century'' (Oxford, 1954) p. 1, {{OCLC|256072}}</ref> represented the apogee of the [[English Renaissance]] and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for [[Elizabethan theatre|theatre]], as [[William Shakespeare]] and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the [[Protestant Reformation]] became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the [[Spanish Armada]] was repelled. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.\n\nThe Elizabethan age contrasts sharply with the previous and following reigns. It was a brief period of internal peace between the [[English Reformation]] and the religious battles between Protestants and Catholics and then the political battles between [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and the monarchy that engulfed the remainder of the seventeenth century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]], and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism.\n\nEngland was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The [[Italian Renaissance]] had come to an end under the weight of Spanish domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in its own religious battles that were (temporarily) settled in 1598 by a policy of tolerating Protestantism with the [[Edict of Nantes]]. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent by Spain's [[tercios]], the centuries-long conflict between France and England was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth's reign.\n\nThe one great rival was Spain, with whom England clashed both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]] of 1585\u20131604. An attempt by [[Philip II of Spain]] to invade England with the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 was famously defeated, but the tide of war turned against England with an unsuccessful expedition to Portugal and the Azores, the [[English Armada|Drake-Norris Expedition of 1589]]. Thereafter, Spain provided some support for Irish Catholics in a debilitating rebellion against English rule, and Spanish naval and land forces inflicted a series of reversals against English offensives. This drained both the English Exchequer and economy that had been so carefully restored under Elizabeth's prudent guidance. English commercial and territorial expansion would be limited until the signing of the [[Treaty of London, 1604|Treaty of London]] the year following Elizabeth's death.\n\nEngland during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], as well as Elizabeth's harsh punishments for any dissenters. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] trade and persistent theft of Spanish treasure.\n[[File:Britannia-Statue.jpg|thumb|The National Armada memorial in [[Plymouth]] using the Britannia image to celebrate the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 (William Charles May, sculptor, 1888)]]\n\n==Romance and reality==\n[[File:Elizabeth succession allegory.jpg|left|thumb|250px|'''Elizabeth ushers in Peace and Plenty'''.

On balance, it can be said that Elizabeth provided the country with a long period of general if not total peace and generally increased prosperity due in large part to stealing from Spanish treasure ships, raiding settlements with low defenses, and selling African slaves. Having inherited a virtually bankrupt state from previous reigns, her frugal policies restored fiscal responsibility. Her fiscal restraint cleared the regime of debt by 1574, and ten years later the Crown enjoyed a surplus of \u00a3300,000.<ref>Melissa D. Aaron, ''Global Economics'' (2005), p. 25. In the later decades of the reign, the costs of warfare \u2014 defeating the [[English Armada]] of 1589 and funding the campaigns in the Netherlands \u2014 obliterated the surplus; England had a debt of \u00a3350,000 at Elizabeth's death in 1603.</ref> Economically, [[Sir Thomas Gresham]]'s founding of the [[Royal Exchange (London)|Royal Exchange]] (1565), the first stock exchange in England and one of the earliest in Europe, proved to be a development of the first importance, for the economic development of England and soon for the world as a whole. With taxes lower than other European countries of the period, the economy expanded; though the wealth was distributed with wild unevenness, there was clearly more wealth to go around at the end of Elizabeth's reign than at the beginning.<ref>Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576\u20131642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 49\u201396 {{ISBN|0691064547}}.</ref> This general peace and prosperity allowed the attractive developments that \"Golden Age\" advocates have stressed.<ref>Christopher Hibbert (1991) ''The Virgin Queen: Elizabeth I, Genius of the Golden Age,'' Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0201608170}}.</ref>\n\n===Plots, intrigues and conspiracies===\nThe Elizabethan Age was also an age of plots and conspiracies, frequently political in nature, and often involving the highest levels of Elizabethan society. High officials in Madrid, Paris and Rome sought to kill Elizabeth, a Protestant, and replace her with [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], a Catholic. That would be a prelude to the religious recovery of England for Catholicism. In 1570, the [[Ridolfi plot]] was thwarted. In 1584, the [[Francis Throckmorton|Throckmorton Plot]] was discovered, after Francis Throckmorton confessed his involvement in a plot to overthrow the Queen and restore the Catholic Church in England. Another major [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] was the [[Babington Plot]] \u2014 the event which most directly led to Mary's execution, the discovery of which involved a [[double agent]], [[Gilbert Gifford]], acting under the direction of [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's highly effective spy master.\n\nThe [[Essex Rebellion]] of 1601 has a dramatic element, as just before the uprising, supporters of the Earl of Essex, among them Charles and Joscelyn Percy (younger brothers of the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]]), paid for a performance of [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] at the [[Globe Theatre]], apparently with the goal of stirring public ill will towards the monarchy.<ref name=\"bate256\">{{cite book|author=Jonathan Bate|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age|publisher=Penguin|location=London|year=2008|pages=256\u2013286|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> It was reported at the trial of Essex by [[Lord Chamberlain's Men|Chamberlain's Men]] actor [[Augustine Phillips]], that the conspirators paid the company forty [[shilling]]s \"above the ordinary\" (i. e., above their usual rate) to stage the play, which the players felt was too old and \"out of use\" to attract a large audience.<ref name=\"bate256\" />\n\nIn the [[Bye Plot]] of 1603, two Catholic priests planned to kidnap King James and hold him in the Tower of London until he agreed to be more tolerant towards Catholics. Most dramatic was the 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]] to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament. It was discovered in time with eight conspirators executed, including [[Guy Fawkes]], who became the iconic evil traitor in English lore.<ref>J. A.

Elizabeth made naval strength a high priority.<ref>Julian S. Corbett (1898) [https://archive.org/details/drakeandtudorna01corbgoog ''Drake and the Tudor Navy, With a History of the Rise of England as a Maritime Power''] 2 vol.</ref> She risked war with Spain by supporting the \"[[Sea Dogs]]\", such as [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] and [[Francis Drake]], who preyed on the Spanish merchant ships carrying gold and silver from the New World. The Navy yards were leaders in technical innovation, and the captains devised new tactics. Parker (1996) argues that the full-rigged ship was one of the greatest technological advances of the century and permanently transformed naval warfare. In 1573 English shipwrights introduced designs, first demonstrated in the \"Dreadnaught\", that allowed the ships to sail faster and maneuver better and permitted heavier guns.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=The 'Dreadnought' Revolution of Tudor England|journal=Mariner's Mirror|year=1996|volume=82 |issue =3|pages=269\u2013300|doi=10.1080/00253359.1996.10656603}}</ref> Whereas before warships had tried to grapple with each other so that soldiers could board the enemy ship, now they stood off and fired broadsides that would sink the enemy vessel. When Spain finally decided to invade and conquer England it was a fiasco. Superior English ships and seamanship foiled the invasion and led to the destruction of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, marking the high point of Elizabeth's reign. Technically, the Armada failed because Spain's over-complex strategy required coordination between the invasion fleet and the Spanish army on shore. Moreover, the poor design of the Spanish cannons meant they were much slower in reloading in a close-range battle. Spain and France still had stronger fleets, but England was catching up.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=Why the Armada Failed|journal=History Today|year=1888|volume=38 |issue =5|pages=26\u201333}}</ref>\n\nParker has speculated on the dire consequences if the Spanish had landed their invasion army in 1588. He argues that the Spanish army was larger, more experienced, better-equipped, more confident, and had better financing. The English defenses, on the other hand, were thin and outdated; England had too few soldiers and they were at best only partially trained. Spain had chosen England's weakest link and probably could have captured London in a week. Parker adds that a Catholic uprising in the north and in Ireland could have brought total defeat.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Geoffrey Parker|title=If the Armada Had Landed|doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1976.tb01347.x|journal=History|year=1976|volume=61|issue =203|pages=358\u2013368}}</ref>\n\n===Colonising the New World===\n{{main|English colonial empire}}\nThe discoveries of Christopher Columbus electrified all of western Europe, especially maritime powers like England.

Her desire to moderate the religious persecutions of previous Tudor reigns \u2014 the persecution of Catholics under Edward VI, and of Protestants under Mary I \u2014 appears to have had a moderating effect on English society. Elizabeth, Protestant, but undogmatic one, <ref> Christopher Haigh, English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993 p.&nbsp;237 {{ISBN|978-0-19-822162-3}}, </ref> reinstated the 1552 Book of Common Prayer with modifications which made clear that the Church of England believed in the (spiritual) Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Communion but without a definition how in favor of leaving this a mystery, and she had the Black Rubric removed from the Articles of Faith: this had allowed kneeling to receive communion without implying that by doing so it meant the real and essential presence of Christ in the bread and wine: she believed it so. She was not able to get an unmarried clergy or the Protestant Holy Communion celebrated to look like a Mass,  <ref> Haigh, op. cit. p.&nbsp;241</ref>. The Apostolic Succession was maintained, the institution of the church continued without a break (with 98% of the clergy remaining at their posts) and the attempt to ban music in church was defeated. The Injunctions of 1571 forbade any doctrines that did not conform to the teaching of the Church Fathers and the Catholic Bishops. The Queen's hostility to strict Calvinistic doctrines blocked the Radicals. \n\nAlmost no original theological thought came out of the English Reformation: instead the Church relied on the Catholic Consensus of the first Four Ecumenical Councils.   The preservation of many Catholic doctrines and practices was the cuckoos nest that eventually resulted in the formation of the Via Media during the 17th century. <ref> Diarmaid MacCullough, The Later Reformation in England, 1547-1603, 2001, pp.&nbsp;24\u201329 {{ISBN|0-333-69331-0}}, 'The cuckoo in the nest,' p.&nbsp;64, 78-86; English Reformations, Religion, Politics and Society under the Tudors, 1993, pp.&nbsp;240\u2013242, 29-295.  </ref> She spent the rest of her reign ferociously fending of radical reformers and Roman Catholics who wanted to modify the Settlement of Church affairs: The Church of England was Protestant, \"with its peculiar arrested development in Protestant terms, and the ghost which it harboured of an older world of Catholic traditions and devotional practice,\" <ref> MacCullough, p.&nbsp;85. </ref>\n\nFor a number of years refrained from persecuting Catholics because she was against Catholicism, not her Catholic subjects if they made no trouble. In 1570, [[Pope Pius V]] declared Elizabeth a heretic who was not the legitimate queen and that her subjects no longer owed her obedience. The pope sent Jesuits and seminarians to secretly evangelize and support Catholics. After several plots to overthrow her, Catholic clergy were mostly considered to be traitors, and were pursued aggressively in England. Often priests were tortured or executed after capture unless they cooperated with the English authorities. People who publicly supported Catholicism were excluded from the professions; sometimes fined or imprisoned.<ref>J. B.

The astronomers [[Thomas Digges]] and [[Thomas Harriot]] made important contributions; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] published his seminal study of magnetism, ''De Magnete,'' in 1600. Substantial advancements were made in the fields of cartography and surveying. The eccentric but influential [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] also merits mention.\n\nMuch of this scientific and technological progress related to the practical skill of navigation. English achievements in exploration were noteworthy in the Elizabethan era. Sir [[Francis Drake]] circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1581, and [[Martin Frobisher]] explored the [[Arctic]]. The first attempt at English settlement of the eastern seaboard of North America occurred in this era\u2014the abortive colony at [[Roanoke Island]] in 1587.\n\nWhile Elizabethan England is not thought of as an age of technological innovation, some progress did occur. In 1564 Guilliam Boonen came from the [[Netherlands]] to be Queen Elizabeth's first [[coach-builder]] \u2014thus introducing the new European invention of the spring-suspension coach to England, as a replacement for the litters and carts of an earlier transportation mode. Coaches quickly became as fashionable as sports cars in a later century; social critics, especially [[Puritan]] commentators, noted the \"diverse great ladies\" who rode \"up and down the countryside\" in their new coaches.<ref>Ann Jennalie Cook (1981) ''The Privileged Playgoers of Shakespeare's London, 1576\u20131642,'', Princeton University Press, pp. 81\u201382 {{ISBN|0691064547}}</ref>\n\n==Social history==\nHistorians since the 1960s have explored many facets of the social history, covering every class of the population.<ref>On the social and demographic history see D.

Their homes were, as in earlier centuries, [[thatched]] huts with one or two rooms, although later on during this period, roofs were also tiled. Furniture was basic, with stools being commonplace rather than chairs.<ref name=\"Life In Tudor Times\"/> The walls of Tudor houses were often made from timber and [[wattle and daub]], or brick; stone and [[tiles]] were more common in the wealthier homes. The daub was usually then painted with [[limewash]], making it white, and the wood was painted with black [[tar]] to prevent rotting, but not in Tudor times; the Victorians did this afterwards. The bricks were handmade and thinner than modern bricks. The wooden beams were cut by hand, which makes telling the difference between Tudor houses and Tudor-style houses easy, as the original beams are not straight. The upper floors of Tudor houses were often larger than the ground floors, which would create an overhang (or [[jettying|jetty]]). This would create more floor-surface above while also keeping maximum street width. During the Tudor period, the use of glass when building houses was first used, and became widespread. It was very expensive and difficult to make, so the panes were made small and held together with a lead lattice, in [[casement windows]]. People who could not afford glass often used polished horn, cloth or paper. Tudor chimneys were tall, thin, and often decorated with symmetrical patterns of molded or cut brick. Early Tudor houses, and the homes of poorer people, did not have chimneys. The smoke in these cases would be let out through a simple hole in the roof.\n\n[[Mansions]] had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm. These fires were also the only way of cooking food. Wealthy Tudor homes needed many rooms, where a large number of guests and [[servants]] could be accommodated, fed and entertained. Wealth was demonstrated by the extensive use of glass. Windows became the main feature of Tudor mansions, and were often a fashion statement. Mansions were often designed to a symmetrical plan; \"E\" and \"H\" shapes were popular.<ref name=\"Tudor Houses\">{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |title=Tudor Houses |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510202040/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/houses/tudor.htm |archivedate=10 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Poverty===\n{{Main|Poor Law}}\n[[File:Vagrant being punished in the streets (Tudor England).jpg|thumb|240px|A woodcut from circa 1536 depicting a vagrant being punished in the streets in Tudor England.]]\n\nAbout one-third of the population lived in poverty, with the wealthy expected to give [[alms]] to assist the [[impotent poor]].<ref>John F.

There were few books, so pupils read from [[hornbooks]] instead. These wooden boards had the alphabet, prayers or other writings pinned to them and were covered with a thin layer of transparent cow's horn.

Potatoes were just arriving at the end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings, and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces.<ref>[[F. G. Emmison|Emmison, F.

The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some grew their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbors to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.<ref>Jeffrey L. Singman (1995) ''Daily Life in Elizabethan England'', Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 133\u201336 {{ISBN|031329335X}}</ref>\n\nEngland was exposed to new foods (such as the [[potato]] imported from South America), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed a wide variety of food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods\u2014such as oranges for the upper class\u2014and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried mustard balls first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.<ref>Joan Thirsk (2006) ''Food in Early Modern England: Phases, Fads, Fashions 1500\u20131760'', Continuum, {{ISBN|0826442331}}</ref>\n\nAt the rich end of the scale the manor houses and palaces were awash with large, elaborately prepared meals, usually for many people and often accompanied by entertainment. The upper classes often celebrated religious festivals, weddings, alliances and the whims of the king or queen. Feasts were commonly used to commemorate the \"procession\" of the crowned heads of state in the summer months, when the king or queen would travel through a circuit of other nobles' lands both to avoid the plague season of London, and alleviate the royal coffers, often drained through the winter to provide for the needs of the royal family and court. This would include a few days or even a week of feasting in each noble's home, who depending on his or her production and display of fashion, generosity and entertainment, could have his way made in court and elevate his or her status for months or even years.\n\nSpecial courses after a feast or dinner which often involved a special room or outdoor gazebo (sometimes known as a folly) with a central table set with dainties of \"medicinal\" value to help with digestion. These would include wafers, comfits of sugar-spun anise or other spices, jellies and marmalades (a firmer variety than we are used to, these would be more similar to our gelatin jigglers), candied fruits, spiced nuts and other such niceties. These would be eaten while standing and drinking warm, spiced wines (known as hypocras) or other drinks known to aid in digestion. One must remember that sugar in the Middle Ages or Early Modern Period was often considered medicinal, and used heavily in such things. This was not a course of pleasure, though it could be as everything was a treat, but one of healthful eating and abetting the digestive capabilities of the body. It also, of course, allowed those standing to show off their gorgeous new clothes and the holders of the dinner and banquet to show off the wealth of their estate, what with having a special room just for banqueting.\n\n===Gender===\n[[File:Elizabeth I, Procession Portrait..jpg|thumb|250px|''The Procession Picture'', c. 1600, showing Elizabeth I borne along by her courtiers.]]\nWhile the Tudor era presents an abundance of material on the women of the nobility\u2014especially royal wives and queens\u2014historians have recovered scant documentation about the average lives of women.

Yet within this general trend, a native school of painting was developing. In Elizabeth's reign, [[Nicholas Hilliard]], the Queen's \"limner and goldsmith,\" is the most widely recognized figure in this native development; but [[George Gower]] has begun to attract greater notice and appreciation as knowledge of him and his art and career has improved.<ref>Ellis Waterhouse (1978) ''Painting in Britain: 1530\u20131790,'' 4th ed., New York, Viking Penguin, pp. 34\u201339 {{ISBN|0300058322}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular culture==\n===Pastimes===\n{{Main|Elizabethan leisure}}\nThe Annual Summer [[Fair]] and other seasonal fairs such as May Day were often bawdy affairs.\n\nWatching plays became very popular during the Tudor period. Most towns sponsored plays enacted in town squares followed by the actors using the courtyards of taverns or inns (referred to as inn-yards) followed by the first theatres (great open-air amphitheatres and then the introduction of indoor theatres called playhouses). This popularity was helped by the rise of great playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]] using London theatres such as the [[Globe Theatre]]. By 1595, 15,000 people a week were watching plays in London. It was during Elizabeth's reign that the first real theatres were built in England. Before theatres were built, actors travelled from town to town and performed in the streets or outside inns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/Homework/tudors/entertainment.html |title=Tudor Entertainment |publisher=Woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk |date=2004-01-01 |accessdate=2010-08-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618130140/http://www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/homework/tudors/entertainment.html |archivedate=18 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMiracle plays were local re-enactments of stories from the Bible.

Animal sports included [[bear baiting|bear]] and [[bull baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cock fighting]].\n\nThe rich enjoyed [[tennis]], [[fencing]], and [[jousting]]. Hunting was strictly limited to the upper class. They favoured their packs of dogs and hounds trained to chase foxes, hares and boars. The rich also enjoyed hunting small game and birds with hawks, known as [[falconry]].\n\n====Jousting====\nJousting was an upscale, very expensive sport where warriors on horseback raced toward each other in full armor trying to use their lance to knock the other off his horse. It was a violent sport--[[Henry II of France|King Henry II]] of France was killed in a tournament in 1559, as were many lesser men. King Henry VIII was a champion; he finally retired from the lists after a hard fall left him unconscious for hours.<ref>Richard Barber and Juliet Barker,  ''Tournaments: Jousts, Chivalry and Pageants in the Middle Ages'' (Boydell Press, 1998) {{ISBN|0851157815}}</ref>\n\nOther sports included archery, bowling, hammer-throwing, quarter-staff contests, [[troco]], [[quoits]], [[Skittles (sport)|skittles]], wrestling and [[mob football]].\n\n====Gambling and card games====\nDice was a popular activity in all social classes.  Cards appeared in Spain and Italy about 1370, but they probably came from Egypt. They began to spread throughout Europe and came into England around 1460. By the time of Elizabeth's reign, gambling was a common sport. Cards were not played only by the upper class. Many of the lower classes had access to playing cards. The card suits tended to change over time. The first Italian and Spanish decks had the same suits: Swords, Batons/ Clubs, Cups, and Coins. The suits often changed from country to country. England probably followed the Latin version, initially using cards imported from Spain but later relying on more convenient supplies from France.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daines Barrington|authorlink=Daines Barrington|title=Archaeologia, or, Miscellaneous tracts relating to antiquity|volume=8|year=1787|publisher=[[Society of Antiquaries of London]]|location=London|page=141}}</ref> Most of the decks that have survived use the French Suit: Spades, Hearts, Clubs, and Diamonds. Yet even before Elizabeth had begun to reign, the number of cards had been standardized to 52 cards per deck. The lowest court subject in England was called the \u201cknave.\u201d The lowest court card was therefore called the knave until later when the term \u201cJack\u201d became more common. Popular card games included Maw, One and Thirty, Bone-ace. (These are all games for small group players.) Ruff and Honors was a team game.\n\n===Festivals, holidays and celebrations===\n[[File:Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder - Festival at Bermondsey.png|right|thumb|300px|A wedding feast, c. 1569.]]\n\nDuring the Elizabethan era, people looked forward to holidays because opportunities for leisure were limited, with time away from hard work being restricted to periods after church on Sundays. For the most part, leisure and festivities took place on a public church holy day. Every month had its own holiday, some of which are listed below:\n*The first Monday after [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] of January (any time between 7 January and 14 January) was [[Plough Monday]]. It celebrated returning to work after the Christmas celebrations and the New Year.\n*2 February: [[Candlemas]]. Although often still very cold, Candlemas was celebrated as the first day of spring. All Christmas decorations were burned on this day, in candlelight and torchlight processions.\n*14 February: [[Valentine's day|Valentine's Day]].\n*Between 3 March and 9 March: [[Shrove Tuesday]] (known as [[Mardi Gras]] or Carnival on the Continent). On this day, apprentices were allowed to run amok in the city in mobs, wreaking havoc, because it supposedly cleansed the city of vices before [[Lent]]. <br />The day after Shrove Tuesday was [[Ash Wednesday]], the first day of Lent when all were to abstain from eating and drinking certain things.<br />24 March: [[Lady Day]] or the feast of the Annunciation, the first of the [[quarter days|Quarter Days]] on which rents and salaries were due and payable. It was a legal New Year when courts of law convened after a winter break, and it marked the supposed moment when the Angel [[Gabriel]] came to announce to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she would bear a child.\n*1 May: [[May day|May Day]], celebrated as the first day of summer. This was one of the few Celtic festivals with no connection to Christianity and patterned on [[Beltane]]. It featured crowning a [[May Queen]], a [[green man|Green Man]] and dancing around a [[maypole]].\n*21 June: [[Midsummer]] (Christianized as the feast of [[John the Baptist]]) and another Quarter Day.\n*1 August: [[Lammas]]tide, or Lammas Day. Traditionally, the first day of August, in which it was customary to bring a loaf of bread to the church.\n*29 September: [[Michaelmas]]. Another Quarter Day. Michaelmas celebrated the beginning of autumn, and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]].\n*25 October: [[St. Crispin's Day]]. Bonfires, revels, and an elected 'King Crispin' were all featured in this celebration. Dramatized by Shakespeare in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''.<br/>28 October: [[Lord Mayor's Show|The Lord Mayor's Show]], which still takes place today in London.<br/>31 October: [[All Hallows Eve]] or [[Halloween]].
