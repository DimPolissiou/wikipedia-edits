{"title_page": "Thermal insulation", "text_new": "[[Image:Steinwolle 1600dpi roxul rxl80.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mineral wool]] Insulation, 1600 dpi scan]]\n\n'''Thermal insulation''' is the reduction of [[heat transfer]] (i.e., the transfer of [[thermal energy]] between objects of differing temperature) between objects in thermal contact or in range of radiative influence. Thermal insulation can be achieved with specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object shapes and materials.\n\nHeat flow is an inevitable consequence of contact between objects of different [[temperature]]. Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which [[thermal conduction]] is reduced or [[thermal radiation]] is reflected rather than absorbed by the lower-temperature body.\n\nThe insulating capability of a material is measured as the inverse of [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductivity (k)]]. Low thermal conductivity is equivalent to high insulating capability ([[R-value (insulation)|Resistance value]]). In [[thermal engineering]], other important properties of insulating materials are product [[density|density (\u03c1)]] and [[heat capacity|specific heat capacity (c)]].\n\n== Definition ==\n{{main|Thermal conductivity}}\nThermal conductivity ''k'' is measured in [[watt]]s-per-meter per [[kelvin]] (W\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7K<sup>\u22121</sup> or W/m/K). This is because [[heat transfer]], measured as [[Power (physics)|power]], has been found to be (approximately) proportional to \n* difference of temperature <math> \\Delta T </math>\n* the surface area of [[thermal contact]] <math> A </math>\n* the inverse of the thickness of the material <math> d </math>\nFrom this, it follows that the power of heat loss <math> P </math> is given by\n<math> P = \\frac{k A\\, \\Delta T }{d} </math>\n\nThermal conductivity depends on the material and for fluids, its temperature and pressure. For comparison purposes, conductivity under standard conditions (20&nbsp;\u00b0C at 1 atm) is commonly used. For some materials, thermal conductivity may also depend upon the direction of heat transfer.\n{{See ||List of thermal conductivities}}\n\nThe act of insulation is accomplished by encasing an object in material with low thermal conductivity in high thickness. Decreasing the exposed surface area could also lower heat transfer, but this quantity is usually fixed by the geometry of the object to be insulated.\n\n[[Multi-layer insulation]] is used where radiative loss dominates, or when the user is restricted in volume and weight of the insulation (e.g. [[Emergency Blanket]], [[radiant barrier]])\n\n===Insulation of cylinders===\n\n[[File:Plasma sprayed ceramic coating applied onto a part of an automotive exhaust system copy.jpg|thumb|right|Car exhausts usually require some form of heat barrier, especially high-performance exhausts, where a ceramic coating is often applied.]]\n\nFor insulated cylinders, a ''critical radius'' must be reached. Before the critical radius is reached, any added insulation increases heat transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node123.html|title=17.2 Combined Conduction and Convection|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019222743/http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node123.html|archivedate=19 October 2017}}</ref> The convective thermal resistance is inversely proportional to the surface area and therefore the radius of the cylinder, while the [[Thermal conduction#Cylindrical shells|thermal resistance of a cylindrical shell]] (the insulation layer) depends on the ratio between outside and inside radius, not on the radius itself. If the outside radius of a cylinder is increased by applying insulation, a fixed amount of conductive resistance (equal to 2*pi*k*L(Tin-Tout)/ln(Rout/Rin)) is added. However, at the same time, the convective resistance is reduced. This implies that adding insulation below a certain '''critical radius''' actually increases the heat transfer. For insulated cylinders, the critical radius is given by the equation<ref>Bergman, Lavine, Incropera and DeWitt, ''Introduction to Heat Transfer'' (sixth edition), Wiley, 2011.</ref>\n\n:<math>{r_{critical}} = {k \\over h}</math>\n\nThis equation shows that the critical radius depends only on the heat transfer coefficient and the thermal conductivity of the insulation. If the radius of the insulated cylinder is smaller than the critical radius for insulation, the addition of any amount of insulation will increase heat transfer.\n\n==Applications==\n\n=== Industrial Thermal Insulation Paint & Coatings ===\nInsulation coatings is used to replace or enhance conventional thermal insulation systems in a variety of applications. Applications include: controlling radiant heat gain, personnel protection, reducing and/or eliminating condensation, and blocking energy transfer from one substrate to another. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mascoat.com/faq.html|title=FAQ - Industrial Insulation Coatings Answers {{!}} Mascoat|website=www.mascoat.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, coatings create a bonding directly on the substrate, the coating provides an excellent corrosion barrier system while providing dramatic temperature differentials, which aid in corrosion protection.\n\n===Clothing and natural animal insulation in birds and mammals===\nGases possess poor [[thermal conduction]] properties compared to liquids and solids and thus make good insulation material if they can be trapped. In order to further augment the effectiveness of a gas (such as air), it may be disrupted into small cells, which cannot effectively transfer heat by [[natural convection]]. Convection involves a larger bulk flow of gas driven by buoyancy and temperature differences, and it does not work well in small cells where there is little density difference to drive it, and the high surface-to-volume ratios of the small cells retards gas flow in them by means of viscous [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nIn order to accomplish small gas cell formation in man-made thermal insulation, glass and polymer materials can be used to trap air in a foam-like structure. This principle is used industrially in building and piping insulation such as ([[glass wool]]), [[cellulose]], [[rock wool]], [[polystyrene]] foam (styrofoam), [[polyurethane|urethane foam]], [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], and [[cork (material)|cork]]. Trapping air is also the principle in all highly insulating clothing materials such as wool, down feathers and fleece.\n\nThe air-trapping property is also the insulation principle employed by [[homeothermic]] animals to stay warm, for example [[down feather]]s, and insulating hair such as natural sheep's [[wool]]. In both cases the primary insulating material is air, and the polymer used for trapping the air is natural [[keratin]] protein.\n\n===Buildings===\n{{main|Building insulation}}\n[[Image:Hallway insulation.jpg|thumb|right|Common insulation applications in [[apartment]] [[building]] in [[Ontario]], Canada.]]\nMaintaining acceptable temperatures in buildings (by heating and cooling) uses a large proportion of global energy consumption. Building insulations also commonly use the principle of small trapped air-cells as explained above, e.g. fiberglass (specifically [[glass wool]]), [[cellulose]], [[rock wool]], [[polystyrene]] foam, [[polyurethane|urethane foam]], [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], [[cork (material)|cork]], etc.  For a period of time, [[Asbestos]] was also used, however, it caused health problems.\n\nWhen well insulated, a [[building]]:\n* energy efficient\n* provides more uniform temperatures throughout the space. There is less temperature gradient both vertically (between ankle height and head height) and horizontally from exterior walls, ceilings and windows to the interior walls, thus producing a more comfortable occupant environment when outside temperatures are extremely cold or hot.\n* cheap\n* reduces carbon footprint.\n\n[[Window insulation film]] can be applied in [[weatherization]] applications to reduce incoming thermal radiation in summer and loss in winter.\n\nIn industry, energy has to be expended to raise, lower, or maintain the temperature of objects or process fluids.  If these are not insulated, this increases the energy requirements of a process, and therefore the cost and environmental impact.\n\n===Mechanical systems===\n{{main|Pipe insulation}}\n[[File:Coloured ceramic thermal barrier coating on exhaust component.jpg|thumb|Thermal insulation applied to exhaust component by means of plasma spraying]]\nSpace heating and cooling systems distribute heat throughout buildings by means of pipes or ductwork. Insulating these pipes using pipe insulation reduces energy into unoccupied rooms and prevents [[condensation]] from occurring on cold and chilled pipework.\n\nPipe insulation is also used on water supply pipework to help delay pipe freezing for an acceptable length of time.\n\nMechanical insulation is commonly installed in industrial and commercial facilities.\n\n=== Refrigeration ===\nA [[refrigerator]] consists of a heat pump and a thermally insulated compartment.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090213114520/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bloom/actions/fridgefreezertips.shtml Keep your fridge-freezer clean and ice-free].

Re-entry through the atmosphere generates very high temperatures due to compression of the air at high speeds. Insulators must meet demanding physical properties beyond their thermal transfer retardant properties.

This can have a negative effect when it reaches various heat-sensitive components such as sensors, batteries, and starter motors. As a result, thermal insulation is necessary to prevent the heat from the exhaust from reaching these components.\n\nHigh performance cars often use thermal insulation as a means to increase engine performance.\n\n==Factors influencing performance==\nInsulation performance is influenced by many factors, the most prominent of which include:\n\n* [[Thermal conductivity]] (\"k\" or \"\u03bb\" value)\n* Surface [[emissivity]] (\"\u03b5\" value)\n* Insulation thickness\n* [[Density]]\n* [[Specific heat capacity]]\n* [[Thermal bridging]]\n\nIt is important to note that the factors influencing performance may vary over time as material ages or environmental conditions change.\n\n==Calculating requirements==\nIndustry standards are often rules of thumb, developed over many years, that offset many conflicting goals: what people will pay for, manufacturing cost, local climate, traditional building practices, and varying standards of comfort. Both heat transfer and layer analysis may be performed in large industrial applications, but in household situations (appliances and building insulation), airtightness is the key in reducing heat transfer due to air leakage (forced or natural convection). Once airtightness is achieved, it has often been sufficient to choose the thickness of the insulating layer based on rules of thumb. Diminishing returns are achieved with each successive doubling of the insulating layer.\nIt can be shown that for some systems, there is a minimum insulation thickness required for an improvement to be realized.<ref>{{cite book\n  | author = Frank P.

Four of his ballet scores were choreographed by [[Norman Morrice]]: ''The Travellers'' (1963), ''The Realms of Choice'' (1965), ''Hazard'' (1967) and ''The Empty Suit'' (1970). Salzedo was musical director of the [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] from 1967 to 1972 and principal conductor with the [[Scottish Ballet]] from 1972-74. He became musical director of the [[City Ballet of London]] in 1982 and devoted himself full-time to composition from 1986.\n\nHe wrote many film scores, including several for [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]], amongst them the war movie ''[[The Steel Bayonet]]'' (1957) and the horror film ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' (1958).

After some early lessons from [[William Lloyd Webber]] he went on to study composition under [[Herbert Howells]] and [[violin]] under [[Isolde Menges]] at the [[Royal College of Music]] in [[London]]. Other teachers included [[Gordon Jacob]] (orchestration) and [[George Dyson (composer)|George Dyson]] (conducting). His first acknowledged score was the String Quartet No 1 of 1942, op 1.<ref name=\"mpr\">Conway, Paul: Notes to CD [http://www.mikepurtonrecording.com/mpr-british-chamber-music-series MPR 104] (String Quartets 1,5 and 10), 2018</ref> On leaving the college in 1944 Salzedo immediately became a freelance composer, supplementing his earnings by playing violin with the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|Royal Philharmonic]].<ref>[https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000024439 Grove Music Online]</ref> He worked closely with the [[Ballet Rambert]], for whom his first ballet, ''The Fugitive'', was commissioned in 1944, receiving over 400 performances over the following six years. In 1945 Salzedo married the dancer Pat Clover, and the two of them were both closely involved with [[Les Ballets N\u00e8gres]], a mostly black dance group founded in 1946 by Berto Pasuka and [[Richie Riley]].<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/h/history-of-black-dance-black-british-dance/ Victoria and Albert Museum. ''History of Black Dance: British Black Dance'']</ref> He wrote four scores for the group for piano, tom tom and maracas: ''De Prophet'', ''They Came'', ''Market Day''<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/aug/05/artsfeatures1 Keith Watson on Les Ballets Negres, ''The Guardian'', 5 August, 1999]</ref> and ''Aggrey''.<ref name=\"mpr\"/>\n\nHis most successful ballet was ''The Witch Boy'' based on the \u2018Ballad of Barbara Allan\u2019 and premiered by the Ballet der Lage Landen in Amsterdam in May 1956. It received over 1,000 performance in 30 different countries, and also became popular as a concert suite. Salzedo was musical director of the [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] from 1967 to 1972 and principal conductor with the [[Scottish Ballet]] from 1972-74. He became musical director of the [[City Ballet of London]] in 1982 and devoted himself full-time to composition from 1986.\n\nHe wrote many film scores, including several for [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]], amongst them the war movie ''[[The Steel Bayonet]]'' (1957) and the horror film ''[[The Revenge of Frankenstein]]'' (1958). But chamber music was also central to his output, including 10 string quartets spanning his whole career - from No 1 in 1942 to No 10 (op 140) dating from 1997.<ref name=\"mpr\"/> Percussion forms another strand of his work, including a Percussion Concerto (1968) and several works for percussion ensemble. After 1986 he had more time to work on larger scale pieces such as the ''Requiem Sine Voxibus'' ('Requium without Voices') for large orchestra (1989), the ''Stabat Mater'' (1991), the Violin Concerto (1992) and the Piano Concerto (1994), which was written for [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]].<ref name=\"mpr\"/>\n\nThe fanfare which forms the first six bars of Salzedo's ''Divertimento for three trumpets and three trombones'', opus 49 (1959), was used as the theme tune for the [[Open University]]'s educational programmes on [[BBC]] television and radio from the 1970s to the 1990s.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyqX4tZ6d8Q Open University- early 1970s opening theme]</ref> Another of his tunes, ''Guadalajara'', was used by the BBC to accompany their \"pie chart\" schools' presentation during the 1960s and early 1970s, up until 1973.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntnMEOxCWXM BBC Schools Pie Chart, 1967]</ref>\n\nPer [[Sir Thomas Beecham]]'s widow, Shirley (see her letter published in Gramophone, June, 1999), [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Sir Eugene Goossens]] did not write the orchestration for Sir Thomas's notorious and still-controversial 1959 recording of Handel's \"Messiah.\"  Salzedo - who gets no credit on the current CD's packaging - wrote the orchestration.

The original French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation by producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] has been running in London since October 1985, making it the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running musical]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original Off-Broadway run of ''[[The Fantasticks]]''.\n\nSet in early [[France in the nineteenth century|19th-century France]], ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' is the story of [[Jean Valjean]], a French peasant, and his desire for redemption after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after a bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named [[Javert]]. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a [[June Rebellion|revolutionary period]] in France, where a group of [[Friends of the ABC|young idealists]] attempt to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\n==Background==\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was originally released as a French-language [[concept album]], and the first musical-stage adaptation of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was presented at the [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Behr1993\">{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&pg=PA51 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55970-156-3 |page=51}}</ref> However, the production closed after three months due to the expiry of the booking contract.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn 1983, about six months after producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] had opened ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], he received a copy of the French concept album from director Peter Farago. Farago had been impressed by the work and asked Mackintosh to produce an English-language version of the show. Initially reluctant, Mackintosh eventually agreed. Mackintosh, in conjunction with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], assembled a production team to adapt the French musical for a British audience. After two years in development, the English-language version opened in London on 8 October 1985, by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the [[Barbican Centre]], then the London home of the RSC. The success of the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical led to a Broadway production.\n\n==Critical reception and milestones==\n{{See also|Long-running musical theatre productions}}\nCritical reviews for ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' were initially negative.

It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The image is based on an etching by [[Gustave Brion]], which in turn was based on the drawing by [[\u00c9mile Bayard]]. Bayard's drawing appeared in several of the novel's<!-- Novel or musical? --> earliest French-language editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!--PLOT SHOULD BE OF THE MUSICAL ITSELF. DO NOT ADD DETAILS OF THE NOVEL AND ITS FILM ADAPTATIONS.-->\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1815 France, prisoners work at hard labor (\"Work Song\"). After 19 years in prison (five for stealing bread for his sister's starving son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), [[Jean Valjean]], \"prisoner 24601\", is released on [[parole]] by the prison guard [[Javert]]. By law, Valjean must display a yellow [[ticket of leave]], which identifies him as an ex-convict (\"On Parole\"). As a convict, Valjean is shunned wherever he goes and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]] offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, angering a farmer and other merchants as he flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver \"to become an honest man\" and that he has \"bought (Valjean's) soul for God\" (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins (\"Valjean's Soliloquy\" / \"What Have I Done?\"). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance to start a new life free from the stigma of his criminal past.\n\nEight years later, in 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. [[Fantine]] is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter [[Cosette]], who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labours in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers use the incident as a pretence to fire Fantine (\"At the End of the Day\"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both (\"[[I Dreamed a Dream]]\"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"), and attracts local sailors. When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realises she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nSoon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (\"The Runaway Cart\"). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (\"Who Am I?\u2014The Trial\"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (\"Come to Me (Fantine's Death)\"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (\"The Confrontation\").\n\nIn [[Montfermeil]], the duplicitous innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, [[\u00c9ponine]]. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (\"Castle on a Cloud\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (\"Master of the House\"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Th\u00e9nardiers payment to adopt her (\"The Bargain\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nNine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries [[Marius Pontmercy]] and [[Enjolras]], who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Th\u00e9nardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Th\u00e9nardier's daughter \u00c9ponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin [[Gavroche]], who knows everything that happens in the slums (\"Look Down\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Th\u00e9nardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars \u2013 which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin \u2013 that he will find Valjean and recapture him (\"Stars\"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\").\n\nAt a small caf\u00e9, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving [[Grantaire]] (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9\u2014Red and Black\"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (\"Rue Plumet\u2014In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken \u00c9ponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops them by screaming a warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.\n\nOn the eve of the [[June Rebellion|1832 Paris Uprising]], Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; \u00c9ponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Th\u00e9nardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (\"One Day More\").<ref name=\"mastersbbc\" />\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Owen-Jones]] as Jean Valjean]]\nAs the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to \"spy\" on the government troops. Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (\"Building the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. \u00c9ponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (\"On My Own\").\n\nThe French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (\"At the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\"). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (\"Javert's Arrival\"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (\"Little People\"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. \u00c9ponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (\"A Little Fall of Rain\"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (\"Night of Anguish\"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (\"The First Attack\").\n\nThe students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing \u00c9ponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (\"Drink with Me\"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (\"The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche\"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting \"Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!\". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (\"The Final Battle\"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.\n\nValjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Th\u00e9nardier, who has been looting bodies (\"Dog Eats Dog\"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]] (\"Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide\").\n\nIn the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (\"Turning\") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (\"Every Day\"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (\"Valjean's Confession\"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (\"Wedding Chorale\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers  [[Gate crashing#Wedding crashing|crash]] the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Th\u00e9nardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Th\u00e9nardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Th\u00e9nardier a punch in the face). The Th\u00e9nardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (\"Beggars at the Feast\").\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (\"Epilogue \u2013 Valjean's Death\"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God.\" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (\"Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{Main|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Act I\n|-\n! !! width=\"34%\" | Song !!

After being released from imprisonment for serving nineteen years (five for stealing a loaf of bread and fourteen for multiple escape attempts), he breaks parole and, after receiving mercy from Bishop Myriel, turns his life around to live for God, showing the effects of God's grace that bring a corrupt man into virtuous and selfless living.

While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.\n\nThe First National Tour opened at Boston's Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called \"The Fantine Company\") opened at Los Angeles' Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco's Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (called \"The Marius Company\") was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131122193641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2013 |title=Les Miz Tour's Final Stop Announced; Meet It in St. Louis |publisher=Playbill |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai's Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.\n\nAll US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5&nbsp;million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.\n\nA new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Th\u00e9nardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as \u00c9ponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and \u00c9ponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner. It uses much of the staging and technical work of the 2014 Broadway revival.<ref name=\"US 2017/18 Tour Dates\">{{cite web |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/shows/backstage.php?showid=331855 |title=Les Miserables - US Tour Schedule |website=BroadwayWorld.com |publisher=BroadwayWorld.com |accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== UK and Ireland tours ====\n=====1992\u20131993 Tour=====\nThe first tour of the UK and Ireland opened at the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester]] 14 April 1992<ref name=This_day1>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1992/april/14 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> with Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), Philip Quast (Javert, later replaced by [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]])<ref name=YouTube_Burman>{{cite AV media |people=Manchester cast: Jeff Leyton (Jean Valjean), [[Michael McCarthy (singer)|Michael McCarthy]] (Javert), Richard Burman (Marius), Sarah Ryan (Cosette), [[Meredith Braun]] (\u00c9ponine), [[Daniel Coll]] (Enjolras), Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), [[Louise Plowright]] (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier) |date=20 November 1992 |title=BBC Children in Need (regional: North West)  | trans-title = One Day More |medium=Television |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN3FGklAlfk |accessdate=12 August 2016 |time= |location=Manchester |publisher=Richard Burman: [[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ria Jones (Fantine), Meredith Braun (\u00c9ponine), Mike Sterling (Marius, later replaced by Richard Burman),<ref name=\"YouTube_Burman\" /> Tony Timberlake (Th\u00e9nardier), Louise Plowright (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Sarah Ryan (Cosette) and Daniel Coll (Enjolras).<ref name=Telegraph_180492>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Michael |title=Les Miserables - review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 April 1992}}</ref><ref name=Manchester_CD>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Highlights from Les Mis\u00e9rables, Manchester Company |year=1992 |last1=Leyton |first1=Jeff (Jean Valjean) |last2=Quast |first2=Philip (Javert) |last3=Sterling |first3=Mike (Marius) |last4=Braun |first4=Meredith (\u00c9ponine) |last5=Jones |first5=Ria (Fantine) |publisher=First Night Records |asin=B000026YOI |id=Barcode: 5014636503427 |url=http://first-night-records.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=&products_id=109}}</ref> The production then moved on to the [[Point Theatre]], Dublin, Ireland, opening 30 June 1993,<ref name=This_day2>{{cite web |title=What Happened on April 14th, 1992 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/june/30 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> and then to [[Edinburgh Playhouse|Playhouse, Edinburgh]], Scotland, opening 23 September 1993.<ref name=This_day3>{{cite web |title=What Happened on September 23rd, 1993 |url=http://www.onthisday.com/date/1993/september/23 |website=onthisday.com |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====1997\u20132000 Tour=====\nIn 1997 a second tour began at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], running from 6 May until 14 June,<ref name=UKTW_Plymouth>{{cite web |title=Les Miserables: Theatre Royal, Plymouth |url=http://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/Plymouth/Theatre-Royal/Musical/Les-Miserables/L921466477/ |website=uktw.co.uk |publisher=UK Theatre Web |accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> the cast featured: Stig Rossen (Jean Valjean), Michael McCarthy (Javert), Julia Worsley (Fantine), Gemma Sandy (\u00c9ponine), Norman Bowman (Marius), Cameron Blakely (Th\u00e9nardier), Cathy Breeze (Mdme Th\u00e9nardier), Rebecca Vere (Cosette) and Mark O'Malley (Enjolras).<ref name=Plymouth_programme>{{cite book |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables programme: Plymouth |url=http://www.ebay.ie/itm/272257057835 |publisher=John Good Holbrook Ltd |year=1997}}</ref> The tour then continued as detailed in the table below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 250px;\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 300px;\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Cast details\n|-\n!

The original French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein. Its English-language adaptation by producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] has been running in London since October 1985, making it the [[List of the longest-running West End shows|longest-running musical]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original Off-Broadway run of ''[[The Fantasticks]]''.\n\nSet in early [[France in the nineteenth century|19th-century France]], ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' is the story of [[Jean Valjean]], a French peasant, and his desire for redemption after serving nineteen years in jail for having stolen a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child. Valjean decides to break his parole and start his life anew after a bishop inspires him by a tremendous act of mercy, but he is relentlessly tracked down by a police inspector named [[Javert]]. Along the way, Valjean and a slew of characters are swept into a [[June Rebellion|revolutionary period]] in France, where a group of [[Friends of the ABC|young idealists]] attempt to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\n==Background==\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was originally released as a French-language [[concept album]], and the first musical-stage adaptation of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' was presented at the [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]] in 1980.<ref name=\"Behr1993\">{{cite book |last=Behr |first=Edward |title=The Complete Book of Les Miserables |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qiCO4XZ2K6IC&pg=PA51 |accessdate=10 November 2011 |year=1993 |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-1-55970-156-3 |page=51}}</ref> However, the production closed after three months due to the expiry of the booking contract.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn 1983, about six months after producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] had opened ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' on [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], he received a copy of the French concept album from director Peter Farago. Farago had been impressed by the work and asked Mackintosh to produce an English-language version of the show. Initially reluctant, Mackintosh eventually agreed. Mackintosh, in conjunction with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], assembled a production team to adapt the French musical for a British audience. After two years in development, the English-language version opened in London on 8 October 1985, by the Royal Shakespeare Company at the [[Barbican Centre]], then the London home of the RSC. The success of the [[West End theatre|West End]] musical led to a Broadway production.\n\n==Critical reception and milestones==\n{{See also|Long-running musical theatre productions}}\nCritical reviews for ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' were initially negative. At the opening of the London production, ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Francis King described the musical as \"a lurid Victorian melodrama produced with Victorian lavishness\" and Michael Ratcliffe of ''[[The Observer]]'' considered the show \"a witless and synthetic entertainment\", while literary scholars condemned the project for converting classic [[literature]] into a musical.<ref name=\"The Guardian\">{{cite news |last=Billington |first=Michael |title=Twenty-five years on, they ask me if I was wrong about Les Mis\u00e9rables ... |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2010/sep/21/les-miserables-25-year-anniversary |publisher=The Guardian Newspaper Online |accessdate=31 January 2013 |location=London |date=21 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Neon Tommy\">{{cite web |last=Kehe |first=Jason |title=Theater Review: \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" At The Ahmanson |url=http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/06/theater-review-les-mis-rables-ahmanson |publisher=USC Annenberg |accessdate=31 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619041019/http://www.neontommy.com/news/2011/06/theater-review-les-mis-rables-ahmanson|archive-date=19 June 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Public opinion differed: the box office received record orders.

It is usually cropped to a head-and-shoulders portrait, superimposed on the French flag. The image is based on an etching by [[Gustave Brion]], which in turn was based on the drawing by [[\u00c9mile Bayard]]. Bayard's drawing appeared in several of the novel's<!-- Novel or musical? --> earliest French-language editions.\n\n==Synopsis==\n<!--PLOT SHOULD BE OF THE MUSICAL ITSELF. DO NOT ADD DETAILS OF THE NOVEL AND ITS FILM ADAPTATIONS.-->\n\n===Act I===\nIn 1815 France, prisoners work at hard labor (\"Work Song\"). After 19 years in prison (five for stealing bread for his sister's starving son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), [[Jean Valjean]], \"prisoner 24601\", is released on [[parole]] by the prison guard [[Javert]]. By law, Valjean must display a yellow [[ticket of leave]], which identifies him as an ex-convict (\"On Parole\"). As a convict, Valjean is shunned wherever he goes and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of [[Digne-les-Bains|Digne]] offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, angering a farmer and other merchants as he flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver \"to become an honest man\" and that he has \"bought (Valjean's) soul for God\" (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins (\"Valjean's Soliloquy\" / \"What Have I Done?\"). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance to start a new life free from the stigma of his criminal past.\n\nEight years later, in 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais|Montreuil-sur-Mer]]. [[Fantine]] is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter [[Cosette]], who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labours in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers use the incident as a pretence to fire Fantine (\"At the End of the Day\"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both (\"[[I Dreamed a Dream]]\"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"), and attracts local sailors. When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realises she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nSoon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (\"The Runaway Cart\"). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (\"Who Am I?\u2014The Trial\"). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (\"Come to Me (Fantine's Death)\"). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (\"The Confrontation\").\n\nIn [[Montfermeil]], the duplicitous innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, [[\u00c9ponine]]. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (\"Castle on a Cloud\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (\"Master of the House\"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Th\u00e9nardiers payment to adopt her (\"The Bargain\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nNine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries [[Marius Pontmercy]] and [[Enjolras]], who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Th\u00e9nardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Th\u00e9nardier's daughter \u00c9ponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin [[Gavroche]], who knows everything that happens in the slums (\"Look Down\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Th\u00e9nardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Th\u00e9nardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars \u2013 which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin \u2013 that he will find Valjean and recapture him (\"Stars\"). Meanwhile, Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine's Errand\").\n\nAt a small caf\u00e9, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving [[Grantaire]] (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9\u2014Red and Black\"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (\"Rue Plumet\u2014In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken \u00c9ponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but \u00c9ponine stops them by screaming a warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.\n\nOn the eve of the [[June Rebellion|1832 Paris Uprising]], Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; \u00c9ponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Th\u00e9nardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (\"One Day More\").<ref name=\"mastersbbc\" />\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Owen-Jones]] as Jean Valjean]]\nAs the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to \"spy\" on the government troops. Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (\"Building the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. \u00c9ponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (\"On My Own\").\n\nThe French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (\"At the Barricade\u2014Upon These Stones\"). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (\"Javert's Arrival\"), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (\"Little People\"). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. \u00c9ponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (\"A Little Fall of Rain\"). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (\"Night of Anguish\"), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (\"The First Attack\").\n\nThe students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing \u00c9ponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (\"Drink with Me\"). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (\"The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche\"). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting \"Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!\". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (\"The Final Battle\"). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.\n\nValjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Th\u00e9nardier, who has been looting bodies (\"Dog Eats Dog\"), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the [[Seine]] (\"Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide\").\n\nIn the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (\"Turning\") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (\"Every Day\"). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (\"Valjean's Confession\"), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (\"Wedding Chorale\"). The Th\u00e9nardiers  [[Gate crashing#Wedding crashing|crash]] the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Th\u00e9nardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Th\u00e9nardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Th\u00e9nardier a punch in the face). The Th\u00e9nardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (\"Beggars at the Feast\").\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (\"Epilogue \u2013 Valjean's Death\"). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God.\" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (\"Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{Main|Songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Act I\n|-\n! !! width=\"34%\" | Song !!

After being released from imprisonment for serving nineteen years (five for stealing a loaf of bread and fourteen for multiple escape attempts), he breaks parole and, after receiving mercy from Bishop Myriel, turns his life around to live for God, showing the effects of God's grace that bring a corrupt man into virtuous and selfless living.

Minor changes included colourful projections blended into its existing lighting design, and a [[proscenium]] that extended out into the first two boxes on either side of the stage.\n\nSome cuts made to the show's prologue during its original Broadway run were restored, lyrics for Gavroche's death scene (known in the revival as \"Ten Little Bullets\") cut during the development of the original London production were restored, and much of the show was re-orchestrated by Christopher Jahnke, introducing a snare and timpani-heavy sound played by a 14-member band, a reduction of about 8 musicians from the original production's 22 musician orchestration.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe original 2006 Broadway revival cast included [[Alexander Gemignani]] as Jean Valjean, [[Norm Lewis]] as Javert, [[Daphne Rubin-Vega]] as Fantine, [[Celia Keenan-Bolger]] as \u00c9ponine, [[Aaron Lazar]] as Enjolras, Adam Jacobs as Marius, [[Ali Ewoldt]] as Cosette, [[Gary Beach]] as Th\u00e9nardier, [[Jenny Galloway]] as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Brian D\u2019Addario, Jacob Levine, Skye Rainforth and Austyn Myers as Gavroche, and Tess Adams, Kylie Liya Goldstein and [[Carly Rose Sonenclar]] as Young Cosette/Young \u00c9ponine.

While the touring production and the New York production were running simultaneously, the staff, cast members, crew, and musicians of the two productions interchanged often, which contributed to keeping both companies of the show in form. When the New York production closed in 2003, the Third National Tour continued for another three years, and enjoyed the influx of many members from the original and subsequent New York companies.\n\nThe First National Tour opened at Boston's Shubert Theatre on 12 December 1987, and continued to play major cities until late 1991. The Second National Tour (called \"The Fantine Company\") opened at Los Angeles' Shubert Theatre on 1 June 1988. The production played for fourteen months then transferred to San Francisco's Curran Theatre where it enjoyed a similar run. The Third National Tour of ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' (called \"The Marius Company\") was one of the longest running American touring musical productions. Opening on 28 November 1988, at the Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center in Florida, and closing on 23 July 2006, at the [[Fox Theatre (St. Louis)|Fox Theatre]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]],<ref>{{cite web |date=10 March 2006 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131122193641/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/98400-Les-Miz-Tours-Final-Stop-Announced-Meet-It-In-St-Louis |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 November 2013 |title=Les Miz Tour's Final Stop Announced; Meet It in St. Louis |publisher=Playbill |accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> the tour ran for seventeen years and 7,061 performances. The tour played in 145 cities in 43 states. The same touring company also frequently performed in Canada, made a 1994 diversion to Singapore, and another diversion in 2002 to be the first Western musical production to visit China, opening in Shanghai's Grand Theatre for a three-week engagement.\n\nAll US productions (including Broadway and its revival) were visually identical in scale and design but the third national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5&nbsp;million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set up and ready to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.\n\nA new national tour began on 21 September 2017 at the Providence Performing Arts Centre (PPAC). It starred Nick Cartell as Valjean, Josh Davis as Javert, Melissa Mitchell as Fantine, J. Anthony Crane as Th\u00e9nardier, Allison Guinn as Madame Th\u00e9nardier, Joshua Grosso as Marius, Phoenix Best as \u00c9ponine, Matt Shingledecker as Enjolras and Jillian Butler as Cosette. The roles of young Cosette and \u00c9ponine were shared by Zoe Glick and Sophie Knapp, while the role of Gavroche was shared by Jordan Cole and Julian Lerner.

Recorded in 1985, when the show premiered, it is closest to the original French concept album. For example, \"Stars\" appears before \"Look Down\" and shortly after, the original version of \"Little People\" plays, which was later incorporated into the revealing of Javert. It also features a song titled \"I Saw Him Once\", sung by Cosette, which was later incorporated into the first part of \"In My Life\".

It included several changes to the songs that are still evident in today's performances. As with its predecessor, it is incomplete, and leaves out songs or parts that are more important narratively than musically (e.g., \"Fantine's Arrest\", \"The Runaway Cart\", \"The Final Battle\").

(The Czech Revival Recording is the only other album, in any language, to feature the entire score; on the other hand, the four 2003 Japanese recordings feature the entire score after the cuts first made on Broadway at the end of 2000.)

All parts were sung live, giving the performance a different mood from other recording. The score was recorded consecutively without pauses or multiple recordings. The concert's encores are also included. As with the original recordings, however, they differed from the stage versions by excluding some songs (e.g., those vital to plot such as \"Fantine's Arrest\" and \"The Runaway Cart\" were kept, while unnecessary or complex songs, such as \"At the Barricade\", were left out).\n\nThe cast includes Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Philip Quast as Javert, [[Ruthie Henshall]] as Fantine, Alun Armstrong as Th\u00e9nardier, [[Jenny Galloway]] as Mme.

This recording featured new arrangements and reinspired orchestrations, and included [[John Owen-Jones]] as Valjean, [[Earl Carpenter]] as Javert, [[Madalena Alberto]] as Fantine, [[Ashley Artus]] as M.

Generally, people carrying infections that may be passed on during anilingus appear healthy. [[Intestinal parasite|Parasites]] may be in the feces if undercooked meat was consumed. The feces contain traces of [[hepatitis A]] only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food.\n\nAnother recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between [[oral sex]] and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in most [[cervical cancer]]s. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity. Those with more than five oral-sex partners had a 250% increased risk compared with those who never engaged in this activity.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11819\n|title=Oral sex can cause throat cancer\n|date=9 May 2007 |publisher=NewScientist.com news service\n|author =Roxanne Khamsi\n|accessdate=2007-10-12\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930045811/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11819| archivedate= 30 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Prevention===\n[[Safe sex]] practices may include thorough washing of the anal region before anilingus to wash away most external fecal particles and reduce the risk of contraction of fecal-sourced infection.

Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are [[microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.\n\n==As punishment==\nForced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners.

Generally, people carrying infections that may be passed on during anilingus appear healthy. [[Intestinal parasite|Parasites]] may be in the feces if undercooked meat was consumed. The feces contain traces of [[hepatitis A]] only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food.\n\nAnother recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between [[oral sex]] and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in most [[cervical cancer]]s. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity. Those with more than five oral-sex partners had a 250% increased risk compared with those who never engaged in this activity.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11819\n|title=Oral sex can cause throat cancer\n|date=9 May 2007 |publisher=NewScientist.com news service\n|author =Roxanne Khamsi\n|accessdate=2007-10-12\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930045811/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn11819| archivedate= 30 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Prevention===\n[[Safe sex]] practices may include thorough washing of the anal region before anilingus to wash away most external fecal particles and reduce the risk of contraction of fecal-sourced infection.

Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are [[microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.\n\n==As punishment==\nForced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners. The use of the practice in the [[Thirty Years' War]] was described by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]] in ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'' (1668).<ref>''Simplicissimus, The German Adventurer'', trans.

While Britain formed part of the [[Roman Empire]], Latin became the principal language of the elite, especially in the more Romanised south and east of the island. However, in the less Romanised north and west it never substantially replaced the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic language]] of the indigenous [[Britons (Celtic people)|Britons]]. In recent years, scholars have debated the extent to which British Latin was distinguishable from its continental counterparts, which developed into the [[Romance languages]].\n\nWith the end of Roman rule, Latin was displaced as a spoken language by [[Old English]] in most of what became [[England]] during the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|Anglo-Saxon settlement]] of the fifth and sixth centuries. It survived in the remaining Celtic regions of western Britain and had died out by about 700, when it was replaced by the local [[Brittonic languages]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Roman.Britain.Romanisation.jpg|thumb|300px|Relative degrees of Romanisation, based on archaeology.

At nine-years-old, he crossed the Cross Pass and moved to [[Tbilisi]], Georgia.  He completed a non-classical secondary school, was trained at the Special Gendarme Corps of the Russian Imperial Army, and subsequently was educated in law. Saad Gutseriev served as a Commissary of Western Georgia and Sukhumi. During this time, he moved to [[Vladikavkaz]], where he ran a business, owning the starch and distilling factories. After the [[Russian Revolution]], Saad Gutseriev occupied management positions in various enterprises under the Commissariat of Local Industry. In 1944 Saad was repressed, his house was confiscated and his whole family was exiled to [[Kazakhstan]], where he remained until his death in 1948. Nowadays, the most contemporary and chic hotel in [[Astana]], erected by funding from the Gutseriev family, bears the name of Gutseriev's grandfather \u2013 Saad-Mariott. <div class=\"tright\" style=\"clear:none\">\n\n</div>Mikhail Gutseriev`s father, Safarbek Saadovich, was born in 1920, graduated from Law School in 1941, and in 1971 graduated from the North Ossetian State University with a degree in Economics of Trade. During [[World War II]], he served in the procuratorial offices and at the age of 23 headed the district prosecutor's office. After the deportation of [[Ingush people]] to [[Kazakhstan]] in 1944, Safarbek Gutseriev served as a senior investigator for special cases of the [[Akmolinsk]] Regional Administration of the Russian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. In 1948 he was illegally repressed and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment and a subsequent 5-year exile settlement, having been fully deprived of his rights. \"For seven years, day by day, my father had been sending two letters to [[Stalin]]. One of them was written from his own name. The other one, signed by my mother, was composed by his friend, also a convict. My father sent over 5 000 letters in total\", recalls Mikhail Gutseriev. Half a year after [[Stalin]]'s death, Safarbek Gutseriev was freed, reinstated in the Party, and in 1955, he was fully rehabilitated. After the War, he took up various management positions of a regional level: Head of Production and Processing Equipment Agency of Tselinstroy, Head of Construction and Erection Directorate, and of number of other industrial and retail enterprises. He was given 11 state awards.\n\nGutseriev's mother, Marem Yakubovna Akhil`gova, was a [[housewife]].

His grandfather Michael O'Rahilly ([[The O'Rahilly]]) was an important figure in the quest for the independence of [[Ireland]], a leader in the [[Easter Rising]], who died in the fighting in Dublin in April 1916. \n\n===London club scene===\nPrior to his involvement with Radio Caroline, O'Rahilly ran the Scene club in London's [[Soho]] district and managed a number of pop music artists, including [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Alexis Korner]]. He recorded a Georgie Fame record on his own independent label, unheard of at the time. He took the record to the BBC to try to get it played. He discovered that the record industry was dominated by EMI and Decca. He then tried to get it played on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] and again found that the shows were 'owned' by [[major label]]s EMI, Decca, Pye and Philips.

During production of the 1969 [[James Bond]] movie ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', O'Rahilly talked Lazenby into refusing a seven-movie Bond contract on grounds that the James Bond character was out of touch with the times, and would not successfully continue into the 1970s.<ref>Masheter, Philip George Lazenby Interview ''The Making of On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' ''Movie Collector Magazine'' Vol Two Issue Two</ref> Of this advice, [[Roger Moore]] said in his autobiography, ''My Word Is My Bond'', \"George took some bad advice ...
