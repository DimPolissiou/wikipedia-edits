Pieczenik, as an international crisis manager and hostage negotiator in the [[State Department]], was sent to Italy on March 16, 1978, the day that Moro was kidnapped, and was involved in the negotiations for the release of Moro. He was part of a \"crisis committee\" headed by [[Francesco Cossiga]], the interior minister. Moro was held for 54 days, Pieczenik said the committee was jolted into action by the fear that Moro would reveal state secrets in an attempt to free himself. Moro's widow, Eleonora, later said Henry Kissinger had warned her husband against his strategy of [[Historic Compromise]] (Italian: Compromesso storico). \"You will pay dearly for it,\" he is alleged to have said. A false statement, attributed to the Red Brigades, was leaked saying that Moro was dead. Pieczenick revealed that this had a dual purpose; to prepare the Italian public for the worst, and to let the Red Brigades know that the state would not negotiate for Moro, and considered him already dead. Moro was shot and placed in the back of a car in central Rome, midway between the headquarters of the Communist Party and the Christian Democrats. In a documentary Cossiga admitted the committee had taken the decision to release the false statement. Pieczenik said that Moro had been \"sacrificed\" for the \"stability\" of Italy.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581425/US-envoy-admits-role-in-Aldo-Moro-killing.html|accessdate=May 5, 2011|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Malcolm|last=Moore|title=US envoy admits role in Aldo Moro killing|date=March 11, 2008|archivedate=September 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Auiebg0A?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581425/US-envoy-admits-role-in-Aldo-Moro-killing.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn September 17, 1978 the [[Camp David Accords]] were signed.

Pieczenik, as an international crisis manager and hostage negotiator in the [[State Department]], was sent to Italy on March 16, 1978, the day that Moro was kidnapped, and was involved in the negotiations for the release of Moro. He was part of a \"crisis committee\" headed by [[Francesco Cossiga]], the interior minister. Moro was held for 54 days, Pieczenik said the committee was jolted into action by the fear that Moro would reveal state secrets in an attempt to free himself. Moro's widow, Eleonora, later said Henry Kissinger had warned her husband against his strategy of [[Historic Compromise]] (Italian: Compromesso storico). \"You will pay dearly for it,\" he is alleged to have said. A false statement, attributed to the Red Brigades, was leaked saying that Moro was dead. Pieczenick revealed that this had a dual purpose; to prepare the Italian public for the worst, and to let the Red Brigades know that the state would not negotiate for Moro, and considered him already dead. Moro was shot and placed in the back of a car in central Rome, midway between the headquarters of the Communist Party and the Christian Democrats. In a documentary Cossiga admitted the committee had taken the decision to release the false statement. Pieczenik said that Moro had been \"sacrificed\" for the \"stability\" of Italy.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{citation|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581425/US-envoy-admits-role-in-Aldo-Moro-killing.html|accessdate=May 5, 2011|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Malcolm|last=Moore|title=US envoy admits role in Aldo Moro killing|date=March 11, 2008|archivedate=September 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Auiebg0A?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1581425/US-envoy-admits-role-in-Aldo-Moro-killing.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn September 17, 1978 the [[Camp David Accords]] were signed.

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n'''Books'''\n\nWestern Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize'''\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d        \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

We need, more than we know, for poetry to be made.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cEach tongue, it has been wisely said, speaks galaxies.\n\nAnd when a language dies, a world\u2014and all that has\n\nNo other being elsewhere\u2014fails; a silence falls\n\nWhere there was song, where there was something known no other\n\nLyric grasps.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from Litany: An Elegy\n\n\n\u201cUntil later, Bach kicked\n\nThe door in and sat with you on the couch,\n\nAnd you knew you\u2019d never spend\n\nA better day alive again on Earth.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry is to literature\u2014the wisdom we learn only there\u2014what love is to life. What fire is to a forest. What the trees say, leaving.\u201d\u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cA lasting poem wounds you forever. And it probably wounds you at once, or as soon as you're ready to bear it. And so with love. Poetry is a wound that heals and keeps on healing, saving you from yourself. And reading is all it takes to share its immortal life.\u201d\u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cIn a poem each of us is all of us.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry, all literature may be a trick humanity evolved to keep us sane.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cLet earth rehearse in us slow words for love. Let love rehearse in earth slow words for time.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cIn the lower branches a rufous fantail turns\n\nAnd demurs, displaying his tail the way a cardsharp\n\nShows his hand\u2014giving nothing but grace away.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cEverything is allowed in a poem, as long as it is well said\u2014in silence and rhythm and image and shapely sound and form. Can a poem break the Fourth Wall and speak to its reader of poetry, of the making of this very poem? The Fourth Wall is apt in fiction and it comes from theatre; poetry is neither of those forms (though it can be, if it chooses to be). The rules of the lyric are both more generous (you can go anywhere you like) and more exacting (only if each phrase aspires to the condition of the song). I have a new collection coming, The Beginner's Guide, which includes a lot of poems on poetry, on making. But where I speak of the poem, the poem may well mean the life. Doubleness (not duplicity, but multiplicity) is poetry's work.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cI have not a muse, but an anti muse, who tells me that everything is wrong.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cRhythm is the real god of poetry.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\"A poem is a window, it gives you the view and the viewer at once and the dance; but the poem is also the glass, it orchestrates a relationship.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry is what happens when we ask more of language.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cThe work of grief\u2019s the hardest work we get/ To do. It is ten thousand miles to go\u2026 Hope\u2019s the only harder/ Work I know. The stars in sorrow\u2019s sky.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from \u201cGrief\u2019s Work\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA poem is an architecture of utterance\u2014an act of speech become a nest or a pot. What a poem is, is not just what it says or how it sounds, but also how it looks\u2014its form. Most of a poem's poetry is how a poet's language, like an organism, adapts to where it finds itself\u2014to how it improvises in response to how it is constrained by its form.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from \"The Gospel of Mark: What I Believe and How I Work\"\n\n\n\"Poems\u2014such small things, like birds and bombs\u2014are a lot bigger than they look; they go off! They make more noise (not to mention mess and other kinds of useful damage) and they travel farther than seems possible. A poem is much larger and wilder, if it\u2019s any good, on the inside than the outside. A poem dances down the cage that keeps it\u2014the cage (the poem\u2019s form) that its making has depended on. What you see is the cage; what you get is the poem escaping it.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnickfrom \u201cThe Gospel of Mark: What I Believe and How I Work\" \n\n\n\"I\u2019m generalising, but not, I think, unfairly: poetry tells the big story small; fiction (most fiction) tells a small story big. Robert Bringshurst puts it this way: \u201cthought is a thread, and the raconteur is the spinner of yarns\u2014but the true storyteller, the poet, is a weaver.\u201d Textus, from which we get \u201ctext\u201d, means (or meant) \u201ccloth\u201d. The poem is a cloth, then; a textus, woven with pieces of a hundred threads (thoughts and stories and hypotheses and epigrams), amounting, at once, to less than any of them, and more than all of them. Leaving nearly all of what it says unsaid.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from \u201cThe Gospel of Mark: What I Believe and How I Work\" \n\n\n\"A poem is a leaf that tells a book; a page that tells a library.

As in yoga or meditation, the purpose of the rules is not mastery of the rules. The purpose is to free yourself and your writing \u2013 from distraction and chatter and banality and superficiality. What you can teach, what no writer can do without learning, are the technical matters that have their equivalent in other human arts and sports and pursuits: sentence craft, the things White and Hemingway and Kenyon taught me; grammar and punctuation; the ageless elements of style; and in poetry several thousand years of wisdom about prosody and form, metaphor and meter, sense and sensibility and the music of speech.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n'''Belonging''' \n\n\u201cThere is a practice of belonging, and it begins with forgetfulness of self.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from ''The Blue Plateau''\n\n\n\u201cI am made of pieces and of the spaces between them where other pieces used to be and no longer are.\u201d \u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from ''The Blue Plateau'' \n\n\u201cI am a landscape of loss. Most of me is the memory of where else, and who else, and with whom, I have been and no longer am. And so it is with the Plateau; she too, is a landscape of loss. We are not\u2013\u2013not I nor this place\u2013\u2013ever whole; we are never of a piece.

Perhaps it is many such places, an impossible tectonic collage.\"\n\n\u2013\u2013 Mark Tredinnick.\n\n\n\u201cTo live is to move among the lives of others.\u201d\u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cDespair like Job\u2019s may be understood, whatever causes it, as a falling out of wonder with the world, out of awe, a catastrophic failure of conviction about one\u2019s own miraculous part in the larger scheme of things. Life loses shape and refuses form; the hearth that held you lets you slip. One is unhoused from one\u2019s days and tortured by one\u2019s nights. One is beyond one\u2019s own or anyone\u2019s reach. My version of Job\u2019s lot has felt like profound disenchantment with myself and my work. Even the world of birds and ridgetops and rivers and trees lost its magic. Each morning I wake and my life is something less than a theoretical proposition. My unhearthing is a spiritual distemper; it is a loss of one\u2019s grip on the meaning of a life, a nihilism to which, perhaps, those of us most dedicated to the making of meaning are most vulnerable. And it falls especially hard on those who never learned how to care for themselves, who never, early, learned to feel what they said they knew\u2014that the nature of the universe is love, and that some of that love is meant for oneself, a birthright, and secure.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick 2018, \u201cTemple of the Word\u201d \n\n\n\u201cLived as a place, not just a story, lived as country, perhaps a life may become more habitable and happy. Perhaps a place is a mind one can learn to share. Perhaps a place is a body one can inhabit and care for as if it were one\u2019s family, one\u2019s lover.

A distinctly Australian poet but also a poet of the world, Tredinnick has been described as 'one of our great poets of place\u2014not just of geographic place, but of the spiritual and moral landscapes as well\u2014a Whitmanesque Emily Dickinson of the southern hemisphere.' Tredinnick's 'artlessly beautiful poetry' has won for him in recent years, as well as the international prizes, a number of major Australian awards\u2014[[Blake Poetry Prize|The Blake]] and [[Newcastle Poetry Prize|Newcastle Prizes]], among them, and a Premier's Literature Prize (for Fire Diary). His poems 'work elegantly and intimately over a huge terrain.' Tredinnick's poetry is poetry of witness: small moments, epiphanies, weather, birds, children, the divine comedy of everyday life, the \u2018beautiful struggle, the ordinary trouble\u2019 we find ourselves in, the beauty and peril of the natural world.\n\n\"I am a fool for places,\" Tredinnick has written, \"and for the vulgar, semantic music of sentences. I have grown deeply attached to the physicality and mystery of landforms and language. To the country people inhabit\u2014and which sometimes inhabits them\u2014and to the words people use to speak their truths and falsehoods.\"\n\nTredinnick also says: \"We need words and country more than we seem to remember; our futures may depend, now more than ever, on how well we use and how healthy we keep them both. Because I believe this, and because I cannot help it, my work often wanders the syntax of places and it tries the ecology of sentences; I want to hear and I\u2019d like to say what the land seems to know\u2014about us, I mean, and about itself and time and how we might use well what little we have.\"\n\nTredinnick's poetry explores \u2018ancient themes\u2014especially the theme of our human relationship with landscape\u2019, [[Andrew Motion|Sir Andrew Motion]] has written. Tredinnick's concern to divine both language and landscape and the way they interact led to his doctoral work on nature writing, completed in 2003, at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Although he hasn't pursued an academic career, Tredinnick could be understood, in and beyond his poetry, as an ecocritic. He has written and spoken widely and often on [[Henry David Thoreau]]'s theme: \u201cin wildness is the preservation of the world.\u201d His doctorate Writing the Wild: Place, Prose, and the Ecological Imagination became his second book, ''The Land\u2019s Wild Music'' (2004), and with Professor Kate Rigby, he cofounded the Australian chapter of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment. His poetry and nature writing have been the focus of doctoral work and scholarship, in particular in China, where ecocriticism is a strong emergent field of academic work.\n\nAlong with his volumes of poetry\u2014 ''Bluewren Cantos'' (2013), ''Fire Diary'' (2010), ''The Lyrebird'' (2011), and ''The Road South'' (spoken word CD, 2008)\u2014 ''Tredinnick's thirteen books include the landscape memoir,''  ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009), ''four books on the writing craft, including'', ''The Little Red Writing Book'' (2006), and ''Australian Love Poems,'' which he edited in 2013.\n\nA bilingual (Chinese/English) selection of his poems (''The Lyrebird'') is due out late in 2014, along with his third collection of poems, ''Body Copy.'' He is working on a memoir of a reading life, Reading Slowly at the End of Time (2015).\n\n[[File:Mark Tredinnick.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick no longer lives with his family along the Wingecarribee River, southwest of Sydney. He spends much of his time teaching and consulting in the city. Although his daily writing practice is poetry (\"poetry is most of what I write now; it is how I live\", he has said), Tredinnick continues to write essays, criticism, reviews, and other prose, from his desk in a cowshed outside Bowral. He spent a long writing apprenticeship in prose, and published several prose books and hundreds of essays, before his first poems were published in the early 2005. As well as poetry workshops, Tredinnick teaches literary journalism, creative writing, and creative nonfiction at the [[University of Sydney]], and he has three times been a judge of the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards|NSW Premier's Prize]] in the nonfiction category,  [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Douglas Stewart Prize for Non-Fiction|Douglas Stewart Prize]]. Tredinnick's work, The Blue Plateau, an extended lyric essay on the life of one place on earth, won the [[Queensland Premier's Literary Awards|Queensland Premier's Literary Award]] in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister's Literary Award the same year. Novelist Tony Birch nominated it as the one book he would give to anyone coming to Australia; 'it captures,' he said, 'what belonging to this antipodean place means and has meant through time.\u2019\nDrawing on his writing guides\u2014''The Little Red Writing Book, The Little Green Grammar Book'' and (with Geoff Whyte) ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing''\u2014Tredinnick also works with organisations in the government, education and private sectors to help them write with economy and grace. \nTredinnick's poetry and essays are widely anthologised and published in journals, blogs and newspapers, in Australia and internationally. and it has appeared in journals including Australian Book Review, Australian Poetry, Contrappasso, [[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]], Island, Isotope, Magma, Mascara, Meanjin, New Welsh Review, Orion, PAN, [[Poetry London]], The Scotsman, Southerly, Wet Ink, The Wonderbook of Poetry, and [[World Literature Today]]. \nFor nearly twenty years, Tredinnick has taught and lectured poetry, creative nonfiction, grammar, nature writing, and composition at universities (chiefly the University of Sydney). He has been a guest of many literary and poetry festivals around the world, including the Adelaide, Brisbane, Sydney, Perth, Oxford, and Ubud Festivals, and the Ottawa Poetry Festival (VerseFest). He has spent teaching residencies at the Universities of Alaska, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, the University of Aberystwyth and the [[University of Wales]], [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David|Trinity Saint David]].\n\nIn the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] Tredinnick was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for \"service to literature, and to education\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2005311|title=Dr Mark Tredinnick|last=|first=|date=|website=honours.pmc.gov.au|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nTredinnick, the grandson of Methodist minister, Wesley Tredinnick, the second of four sons of Bruce and Heather Tredinnick, was born in Epping, in suburban Sydney.  He went to primary school at North Epping Public School and won a bursary to [[Barker College]], Hornsby, an Anglican private school, where he completed his schooling in 1979. He took a double degree (with Honours) in Arts and Law at the University of Sydney University, majoring in history, and taking courses in philosophy, in addition to law.  In the last year of his degree, Tredinnick worked part-time as a paralegal for Allen Allen & Hemsley, before accepting a clerkship with Mallesons Stephen Jaques, one of Sydney's leading law firms. Tredinnick worked as a solicitor with Mallesons for a year, before moving into book publishing, where he stayed for nearly a decade; he worked as an editor and publisher at Butterworths, Allen & Unwin and HarperCollins. Tredinnick says of those years: \u2018they were part of my education as a writer, of course; I was learning what a sentence was; I was practising grammar and learning about design; I was learning what it took, the years and years sometimes, to make a book and to make it good enough to share.\u2019   \nTredinnick left the corporate world and began to write and teach writing (and some courses in leadership and organizational studies in Politics at the [[University of Sydney]]).\nIt was from Katoomba and a small apartment in Lavender Bay that Tredinnick wrote and published his first poems and won his first prizes. Tredinnick also travelled North America and worked on his doctoral thesis, a study of nature writing and an attempt to retheorise the capacity of prose to represent landscapes and the more than merely human world\u2014to 'catch the lyric of country', as he puts it. Tredinnick took his doctorate in 2003 and his thesis was published in 2005\n\nTredinnick's first book, an edited collection of nature writing essays from Australian and North America, ''A Place on Earth'', came out in 2003 in Australia (2004 in the United States). After that came ''The Land's Wild Music'' in 2005; ''The Little Red Writing Book'' in 2006; ''The Little Green Grammar Book'' in 2008; ''Writing Well'' (an adaptation of ''The Little Red Writing Book'' for the international market) also in 2008); ''The Blue Plateau'' (2009 in Australia; 2010 in the United States); ''The Little Black Book of Business Writing'' (with Geoff Whyte) in 2010; ''Australia's Wild Weather'' in 2011.\n\nTredinnick's first collection of poems, ''The Road South'', appeared as a spoken-word CD in 2008. His first volume of poems was Fire Diary, published in late 2010. That was followed by ''The Lyrebird'', a chapbook, in 2011 and ''Bluewren Cantos'' in 2013.\n\n[[File:10171025 634856153236106 2660669453524416387 n.jpg|thumb|Mark Tredinnick]]\n\nTredinnick's emergence as a poet was marked by a string of major Australian prizes, in particular the Newcastle Poetry Prize in 2007 and the Blake Poetry Prize in 2009. His work became better known outside Australia when he won the inaugural Montreal International Poetry Prize in 2011 and the Cardiff Prize the next year. In Australia, he won the Newcastle Prize second time in 2011 and took out some significant literary prizes for his books: the Queensland Premier's Literary Prize 2010 for ''The Blue Plateau'' and the West Australian Premier's Prize 2011 for ''Fire Diary''.\n\nIn 2013 he edited Australian Love Poems for a start-up literary press, Inkerman & Blunt. [[Pitt Street Poetry]], who published his second volume of poems, ''Bluewren Cantos'' in December 2013, released a second edition of ''Fire Diary'' early the following year.\n\nTredinnick's works and days\u2014the difficult dance between the silence of the desk, the higher frequencies of family life, the demands of earning a living to \"finance the silence\", as he puts it, and feed the family\u2014are discussed in a long interview he gave to ''Perilous Adventures'' magazine in 2010, and are glossed in a number of his poems, in particular \"Insolvency\", \"Eclogues\", and \"The Economics of Spring\" (in ''Fire Diary'').\n\n==Style==\n\nTredinnick's poetry often employs a long, stepped-down line. Poetry is an \"architecture of utterance\", he has said, \"a sculpture of voice.\" And his poems, though informal in voice, present themselves as small geographies, places, language worlds both sonic and visual. Although his architectures resemble sometimes the sestets of Charles Wright, whose influence and kinship Tredinnick has acknowledged, unlike Wright, Tredinnick's syntax is often complex, his sentences long, \"breathtakingly fluent\" (as Sinead Morrissey has put it), deltaic. His poetry, though painstakingly made and precise, is expansive, pushing against the forms it employs. Commenting on the tension between minute details and grandiosity, Australian novelist Greg Day has called him a \"failed minimalist.\" Bluewren Cantos, Mark's latest book of poetry, is praised as \"A gentle mix of the sublime and the mundane, so that we are invited to let such dualisms be undone in us.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref> The critic Michelle Borzi finds that Tredinnick's \"habit of relying on atmospheric image-making and self-intrusive references to impel the lines is a defining attribute of the poetry throughout ''Fire Diary''.\"<ref>[http://southerlyjournal.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/73.1_LP-Michelle-Borzi.pdf]</ref>\n\nTredinnick described his essays once as \"half chat, half chant\", and his poetic voice lies, similarly, between conversation and song. Informality is a key to his lyric. \nHe has named poets John Keats and Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Mary Oliver, Jane Kenyon, and Seamus Heaney, Robert Gray, Dylan Thomas, and Charles Wright, as influences and teachers. He also cites Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Debussy, and painters Van Gogh and Matisse. And the voices of lyric prose writers play in Tredinnick's poetry, as in his prose: Michael Ondaatje, Joan Didion, Barry Lopez, Peter Matthiessen, David Malouf, and Cormac McCarthy.\n\nTalking specifically of ''Bluewren Cantos'', poet and critic Jean Kent neatly summarises Tredinnick's poetics, including the way his work nearly always starts in place, but reaches out toward intimacy with a loved one, with the dead, with that which is most human in each of us.<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\n\"Like the singing of birds, it all feels artlessly beautiful, but only because of the exceptional art, which keeps the music of what\u2019s being said mesmerising. Behind the flowing lines and hypnotic melodies, there is as much control of the rhythm and counterpoint and harmony as there is in any of the compositions by Bach or Mozart or Debussy, composers who compete with all the real birds in Mark\u2019s Wingecarribee landscape.  Even before he began publishing poetry, Mark was renowned as a nature writer. His sensitivity to place and his ability to celebrate the Australian landscape are special joys in all his poems.\nOften, Mark\u2019s poems begin with nature \u2013 but invariably the solitary presence of the poet reaches out to another person \u2013 often a loved person \u2013 or, in an intimate connection, to the reader.\nThis is poetry like tightrope walking \u2013 a nonchalant, though thoughtful, ambling out into the world, which almost leads us into a transcendental state \u2013 only to be caught in a web of emotion and thought and connections to the daily reality of living. Tredinnick\u2019s poems are also full of playful paradoxes and wry humour.  His tone may be debonair, well-dressed and conscious of manners and historical allegiances, but for all the hypnotic oratory, his voice is both questing and self-deprecating, and the earth he walks over is emphatically today\u2019s.\"<ref>Jean Kent, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014</ref>\n\nPoet Anne Elvey has said that Tredinnick \"Weaves the tropes of attentiveness to the other, mortality, and finitude, together with his wry humour, to tell a loving engagement with place, persons and otherkind. This is poetry as blessing. It is a poetics of witness.\"<ref>Anne Elvey, launch of Bluewren Cantos, 2014.</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n'''Books'''\n\nWestern Australian Premier's Book Award (winner, poetry), 2011: ''Fire Diary''\n\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards (winner, nonfiction), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n                                                                                            \nPrime Minister's Literary Awards (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nACT Book of the Year (shortlisted), 2010: ''The Blue Plateau''\n\nAlec Bolton (ACT Arts prize for unpublished manuscript) (highly commended), 2010: ''Fire Diary''\n\n\n'''Poetry'''\n\n'''1<sup>st</sup> Prize'''\n\nRon Petty Poetry Prize, winner 2017: \u201cPanic Very Softly, Love\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, winner 2016: \u201cThe Horse\u201d\n\nCardiff International Poetry Prize, winner 2012: \u201cMargaret River Sestets\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cWalking Underwater\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2011: \u201cThe Wombat Vedas\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, winner 2008: \u201cHave You Seen\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, winner 2007: \u201cEclogues\u201d\n\nGwen Harwood Poetry Prize, winner 2005: \u201cThe Child & Time\u201d\n\n\n'''2<sup>nd</sup> Prize'''\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, second 2018: \u201cThe River Running Shallow\u201d\n\nACU Prize for Literature, second 2013: \u201cLight Years\u201d\n\nJosephine Ulrick Poetry Prize, runner up 2009: \u201cRed Tulips\u201d\n\n\n'''3<sup>rd</sup> Prize''' \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, third 2019: \u201cOctober Morning After Rain\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, third 2013: \u201cTwo or Three Days in late October with Claude Debussy\u201d        \n\n'''Shortlisted''' \n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, short listed 2019: \u201cRaven\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe Blue Pasture\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cThe News\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2019: \u201cGrace, and a Barking Owl\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cThe Reservoir\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2018: \u201cGrief Wears a Body\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cShred\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2016: \u201cEnd of Lonely Day\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cWeeding\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cSpring Snow, Reno\u201d\n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cFaith\u201d \n\nACU Poetry Prize for Literature, shortlisted 2013: \u201cThe Reader\u201d\n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cThe Kingfisher\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2011: \u201cAt Home on a Sunday Trying to Find Nothing to Do\u201d\n\nABR (now Peter Porter) Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2005: \u201cUbirr Rock\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2015: \u201cThe Propinquity of Snow\u201d\n\nRon Pretty Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2014: \u201cNightfishing\u201d\n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2009: \u201cBrisbane River Blues\u201d\n\nBlake Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2008: \u201cWindflowers\u201d \n\nNewcastle Poetry Prize, shortlisted 2006: \u201cLake St Clair Cycle\u201d\n\n\n\n'''Longlisted'''\n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cWalking My Name Back Home\u201d \n\nUniversity of Canberra Vice-Chancellor\u2019s International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2014: \u201cThat Day\u201d \n\nMontreal International Poetry Prize, longlisted 2011:\"You Over There;

poets, even more so. In particular, one's self. But poetry, as Basho said, is a Way, not an art, or not merely an art. If it's like that for a writer, as it is for Judith Beveridge\u2014as it was for Rumi and was for Heaney and is for me, I think, then there's no quitting it. Unless it quits you.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry recasts life\u2019s exquisite spell.\u201d \u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cLyric poetry, that deeper speaking, consoles like no other human accomplishment.\u201d \u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cA poem puts your pain and delight back among \u2018the family of things.\u2019 For a poem uses language connected to ecosystems of being and meaning and form and sense where one can feel whole, where one\u2019s sorrow has context, where one\u2019s solitude has company. And not merely social.\u201d \u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\nFrom the intro to ''A Gathered Distance''. \n\n\u201cPoetry reconciles two aspects of mind that are otherwise sundered in most of our waking lives: the making of sense and the making of music, the rational and the spiritual. Poetry reconciles two severed aspects of ourselves.\u201d \u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cMost of a poem, like love, is silence and rhythm.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cIf what poetry is chiefly for is helping restore to unravelling selves their integrity, and if one is a writer, one had better know a little of the self.\u201d\n\n\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\"It's the irrelevant things that take us down into our deepest, truest selves. We need, more than we know, for poetry to be made.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cEach tongue, it has been wisely said, speaks galaxies.\n\nAnd when a language dies, a world\u2014and all that has\n\nNo other being elsewhere\u2014fails; a silence falls\n\nWhere there was song, where there was something known no other\n\nLyric grasps.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from Litany: An Elegy\n\n\n\u201cUntil later, Bach kicked\n\nThe door in and sat with you on the couch,\n\nAnd you knew you\u2019d never spend\n\nA better day alive again on Earth.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry is to literature\u2014the wisdom we learn only there\u2014what love is to life. What fire is to a forest. What the trees say, leaving.\u201d\u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cA lasting poem wounds you forever. And it probably wounds you at once, or as soon as you're ready to bear it. And so with love. Poetry is a wound that heals and keeps on healing, saving you from yourself. And reading is all it takes to share its immortal life.\u201d\u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cIn a poem each of us is all of us.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry, all literature may be a trick humanity evolved to keep us sane.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cLet earth rehearse in us slow words for love. Let love rehearse in earth slow words for time.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cIn the lower branches a rufous fantail turns\n\nAnd demurs, displaying his tail the way a cardsharp\n\nShows his hand\u2014giving nothing but grace away.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cEverything is allowed in a poem, as long as it is well said\u2014in silence and rhythm and image and shapely sound and form. Can a poem break the Fourth Wall and speak to its reader of poetry, of the making of this very poem? The Fourth Wall is apt in fiction and it comes from theatre; poetry is neither of those forms (though it can be, if it chooses to be). The rules of the lyric are both more generous (you can go anywhere you like) and more exacting (only if each phrase aspires to the condition of the song). I have a new collection coming, The Beginner's Guide, which includes a lot of poems on poetry, on making. But where I speak of the poem, the poem may well mean the life. Doubleness (not duplicity, but multiplicity) is poetry's work.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cI have not a muse, but an anti muse, who tells me that everything is wrong.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cRhythm is the real god of poetry.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\"A poem is a window, it gives you the view and the viewer at once and the dance; but the poem is also the glass, it orchestrates a relationship.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cPoetry is what happens when we ask more of language.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cThe work of grief\u2019s the hardest work we get/ To do.

The stars in sorrow\u2019s sky.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from \u201cGrief\u2019s Work\u201d\n\n\n\u201cA poem is an architecture of utterance\u2014an act of speech become a nest or a pot. What a poem is, is not just what it says or how it sounds, but also how it looks\u2014its form. Most of a poem's poetry is how a poet's language, like an organism, adapts to where it finds itself\u2014to how it improvises in response to how it is constrained by its form.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from \"The Gospel of Mark: What I Believe and How I Work\"\n\n\n\"Poems\u2014such small things, like birds and bombs\u2014are a lot bigger than they look; they go off! They make more noise (not to mention mess and other kinds of useful damage) and they travel farther than seems possible. A poem is much larger and wilder, if it\u2019s any good, on the inside than the outside. A poem dances down the cage that keeps it\u2014the cage (the poem\u2019s form) that its making has depended on. What you see is the cage; what you get is the poem escaping it.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnickfrom \u201cThe Gospel of Mark: What I Believe and How I Work\" \n\n\n\"I\u2019m generalising, but not, I think, unfairly: poetry tells the big story small; fiction (most fiction) tells a small story big. Robert Bringshurst puts it this way: \u201cthought is a thread, and the raconteur is the spinner of yarns\u2014but the true storyteller, the poet, is a weaver.\u201d Textus, from which we get \u201ctext\u201d, means (or meant) \u201ccloth\u201d. The poem is a cloth, then; a textus, woven with pieces of a hundred threads (thoughts and stories and hypotheses and epigrams), amounting, at once, to less than any of them, and more than all of them. Leaving nearly all of what it says unsaid.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from \u201cThe Gospel of Mark: What I Believe and How I Work\" \n\n\n\"A poem is a leaf that tells a book; a page that tells a library.

As in yoga or meditation, the purpose of the rules is not mastery of the rules. The purpose is to free yourself and your writing \u2013 from distraction and chatter and banality and superficiality. What you can teach, what no writer can do without learning, are the technical matters that have their equivalent in other human arts and sports and pursuits: sentence craft, the things White and Hemingway and Kenyon taught me; grammar and punctuation; the ageless elements of style; and in poetry several thousand years of wisdom about prosody and form, metaphor and meter, sense and sensibility and the music of speech.\"\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n'''Belonging''' \n\n\u201cThere is a practice of belonging, and it begins with forgetfulness of self.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from ''The Blue Plateau''\n\n\n\u201cI am made of pieces and of the spaces between them where other pieces used to be and no longer are.\u201d \u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick from ''The Blue Plateau'' \n\n\u201cI am a landscape of loss. Most of me is the memory of where else, and who else, and with whom, I have been and no longer am. And so it is with the Plateau; she too, is a landscape of loss. We are not\u2013\u2013not I nor this place\u2013\u2013ever whole; we are never of a piece.

Home is the country that, whenever and wherever you find it, won\u2019t leave you. Perhaps it is many such places, an impossible tectonic collage.\"\n\n\u2013\u2013 Mark Tredinnick.\n\n\n\u201cTo live is to move among the lives of others.\u201d\u2014Mark Tredinnick\n\n\n\u201cDespair like Job\u2019s may be understood, whatever causes it, as a falling out of wonder with the world, out of awe, a catastrophic failure of conviction about one\u2019s own miraculous part in the larger scheme of things. Life loses shape and refuses form; the hearth that held you lets you slip. One is unhoused from one\u2019s days and tortured by one\u2019s nights. One is beyond one\u2019s own or anyone\u2019s reach. My version of Job\u2019s lot has felt like profound disenchantment with myself and my work. Even the world of birds and ridgetops and rivers and trees lost its magic. Each morning I wake and my life is something less than a theoretical proposition. My unhearthing is a spiritual distemper; it is a loss of one\u2019s grip on the meaning of a life, a nihilism to which, perhaps, those of us most dedicated to the making of meaning are most vulnerable. And it falls especially hard on those who never learned how to care for themselves, who never, early, learned to feel what they said they knew\u2014that the nature of the universe is love, and that some of that love is meant for oneself, a birthright, and secure.\u201d\u2013\u2013Mark Tredinnick 2018, \u201cTemple of the Word\u201d \n\n\n\u201cLived as a place, not just a story, lived as country, perhaps a life may become more habitable and happy. Perhaps a place is a mind one can learn to share. Perhaps a place is a body one can inhabit and care for as if it were one\u2019s family, one\u2019s lover.

The film follows a haunted red dress as it torments various owners. It stars [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]], [[Hayley Squires]], [[Leo Bill]], and [[Gwendoline Christie]]. \n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019 by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] and was released in the United States on 6 December 2019 by [[A24 (company)|A24]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSheila (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is a recently divorced bank teller who lives with her son Vince (Jaygann Ayeh). She is frequently chastised for insignificant work errors by her bosses Stash (Julian Barratt) and Clive (Steve Oram), and intimidated by Vince's new girlfriend Gwen (Gwendoline Christie). She visits department store Dentley and Soper's to buy a dress for an upcoming date in the sales. After meeting the enigmatic store clerk Miss Luckmoore (Fatma Mohamed), Sheila is drawn to a beautiful, flowing red dress which she tries on. Luckmoore convinces Sheila to purchase it. \n\nSheila notices a strange rash on her chest after wearing the dress. After putting the dress in the washing machine, the machine breaks down and Sheila injures her hand in the process. Sheila returns to the store to get a new size for the dress only to learn that there is only one version of the dress and that the store model was killed after wearing the dress for the store catalog. Sheila goes on a date with new suitor Zach (Barry Adamson) while Gwen and Vince have sex. As she climaxes, Gwen is almost killed when the dress floats above her and tries to suffocate her.  Sheila and Zach go for a walk together, where Sheila is attacked by an Alsatian, which cuts her leg and rips the dress in the process. Later that day, Vince returns home with the dress which is somehow now fully repaired. After hearing the dress move about in the wardrobe at night, an unsettled Sheila attempts to return the dress to the store but is refused by Luckmoore. Sheila is then killed in a car accident as she is driving en route to spending the night with Zach. \n\nThe dress comes into possession of washing machine repairman Reg Speaks (Leo Bill) who is made by his friends to wear it on a night out. He is engaged to Babs (Hayley Squires), who takes a liking to the dress and decides to wear it as well. Reg returns home and is hypnotised by the department store's TV advertisement while Babs is at the store shopping. Luckmoore is alarmed to see Babs is wearing the dress and demands she leaves. Meanwhile, Reg dies from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the dress manipulating the boiler. Babs recalls to Luckmoore a dream she had about her being the model for all the dresses in the catalogue but getting thinner and thinner as the dresses got larger and larger. She was then buried in the store by the workers. Babs goes to try on a dress while a fight soon breaks out in the store that quickly spirals into looting. \n\nThe dress catches fire and the flames spread quickly around the store. Babs burns to death, unable to escape her changing room, while Luckmoore flees down into the dumbwaiter with a dismembered mannequin.

The film follows a haunted red dress as it torments various owners. It stars [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]], [[Hayley Squires]], [[Leo Bill]], and [[Gwendoline Christie]]. \n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 13 September 2018. It was released in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2019 by [[Curzon Artificial Eye]] and was released in the United States on 6 December 2019 by [[A24 (company)|A24]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nSheila (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) is a recently divorced bank teller who lives with her son Vince (Jaygann Ayeh). She is frequently chastised for insignificant work errors by her bosses Stash (Julian Barratt) and Clive (Steve Oram), and intimidated by Vince's new girlfriend Gwen (Gwendoline Christie). She visits department store Dentley and Soper's to buy a dress for an upcoming date in the sales. After meeting the enigmatic store clerk Miss Luckmoore (Fatma Mohamed), Sheila is drawn to a beautiful, flowing red dress which she tries on. Luckmoore convinces Sheila to purchase it. \n\nSheila notices a strange rash on her chest after wearing the dress. After putting the dress in the washing machine, the machine breaks down and Sheila injures her hand in the process. Sheila returns to the store to get a new size for the dress only to learn that there is only one version of the dress and that the store model was killed after wearing the dress for the store catalog. Sheila goes on a date with new suitor Zach (Barry Adamson) while Gwen and Vince have sex. As she climaxes, Gwen is almost killed when the dress floats above her and tries to suffocate her.  Sheila and Zach go for a walk together, where Sheila is attacked by an Alsatian, which cuts her leg and rips the dress in the process. Later that day, Vince returns home with the dress which is somehow now fully repaired. After hearing the dress move about in the wardrobe at night, an unsettled Sheila attempts to return the dress to the store but is refused by Luckmoore. Sheila is then killed in a car accident as she is driving en route to spending the night with Zach. \n\nThe dress comes into possession of washing machine repairman Reg Speaks (Leo Bill) who is made by his friends to wear it on a night out. He is engaged to Babs (Hayley Squires), who takes a liking to the dress and decides to wear it as well. Reg returns home and is hypnotised by the department store's TV advertisement while Babs is at the store shopping. Luckmoore is alarmed to see Babs is wearing the dress and demands she leaves. Meanwhile, Reg dies from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the dress manipulating the boiler. Babs recalls to Luckmoore a dream she had about her being the model for all the dresses in the catalogue but getting thinner and thinner as the dresses got larger and larger. She was then buried in the store by the workers. Babs goes to try on a dress while a fight soon breaks out in the store that quickly spirals into looting. \n\nThe dress catches fire and the flames spread quickly around the store. Babs burns to death, unable to escape her changing room, while Luckmoore flees down into the dumbwaiter with a dismembered mannequin. As she descends deeper into the store, she sees the dead store model, Sheila, Reg, and Babs stitching together the dress from threads made of their blood; they are trapped in eternal servitude. A fireman observes the destroyed store and discovers the dress undamaged amongst the rubble.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] as Sheila\n* [[Hayley Squires]] as Babs\n* [[Leo Bill]] as Reg Speaks\n* [[Gwendoline Christie]] as Gwen\n* [[Julian Barratt]] as Stash\n* [[Steve Oram]] as Clive\n* [[Barry Adamson]] as Zach\n* Jaygann Ayeh as Vince\n* [[Richard Bremmer]] as Mr. Lundy\n* Terry Bird as Bananas Brian\n* Fatma Mohamed as Miss Luckmoore\n* [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] as Jill\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2017, it was announced [[Marianne Jean-Baptiste]] had joined the cast of the film, with [[Peter Strickland (director)|Peter Strickland]] directing from a screenplay he wrote.
