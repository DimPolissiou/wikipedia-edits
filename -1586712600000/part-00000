The official title of the current standard is {{nihongo|'''7-bit and 8-bit double byte coded KANJI sets for information interchange'''|7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u53ca\u30738\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u6f22\u5b57\u96c6\u5408|Nana-Bitto Oyobi Hachi-Bitto no Ni-Baito J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Fug\u014dka Kanji Sh\u016bg\u014d}}. It was originally established as '''JIS C 6226''' in 1978, and has been revised in 1983, 1990, and 1997. It is also called '''Code page 952''' by IBM. The 1978 version is also called '''Code page 955''' by IBM.\n\n== Scope of use and compatibility ==\nThe character set JIS X 0208 establishes is primarily for the purpose of {{nihongo|'''information interchange'''|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db|j\u014dh\u014d k\u014dkan}} between data processing systems and the devices connected to them, or mutually between data communication systems. This character set can be used for data processing and text processing.\n\nPartial implementations of the character set are not considered compatible. Because there are places where such things have happened as the original drafting committee of the first standard taking care to separate characters between level 1 and level 2 and the second standard then shuffling some variant characters (\u7570\u4f53\u5b57, ''[[itaiji]]'') between the levels, at least in the first and second standards, it is conjectured that non-[[kanji]] and level 1-only implementation Japanese computer systems were at one time considered for development. However, such implementations have never been specified as compatible, though an example like the early [[NEC PC-9801]] did exist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2008/05/05/why-japan-didnt-create-the-ipod/ |date=2008-05-05 |title=\nWhy Japan didn't create the iPod |website=Gatunka}}</ref>\n\nEven though there are provisions in the JIS X 0208:1997 standard concerning compatibility, at the present time, it is generally considered that this standard neither certifies compatibility nor is it an official manufacturing standard that amounts to a declaration of self-compatibility.<ref>JIS X 0208 was not one of the standards included in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205155442/http://www.jisc.go.jp/newstopics/2006/070117new_jis_list.htm list of applicable target systems for display of the new JIS mark] announced by the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] on 17 January 2007.</ref> Consequently, ''de facto'', JIS X 0208-\"compatible\" products are not considered to exist. Terminology such as {{nihongo|\"conformant\"|\u6e96\u62e0|junkyo}} and {{nihongo|\"support\"|\u5bfe\u5fdc|tai\u014d}} is included in JIS X 0208, but the semantics of these terms vary from person to person.\n\n== Code charts ==\n<!-- Note to editors:\nEUC (GR-delegated) forms are not included in the charts themselves because:\n\n(1) \"JIS encoding\" usually refers to ISO-2022-JP, not to EUC-JP or any superset thereof,\n(2) EUC-JP or any subset thereof is not usually called \"JIS X 0208\",\n(3) EUC-JP is eclipsed in usage by Shift_JIS.\n\nThis is in start contrast to both KS X 1001 and GB 2312, which are often used synonymously with their EUC forms, and for which EUC or EUC-superset encodings are vastly predominant.\n-->\n\n=== Lead byte ===\nThe first encoding byte corresponds to the row or cell number plus 0x20, or 32 in decimal (see below). Hence, the code set starting with 0x21 has a row number of 1, and its cell 1 has a continuation byte of 0x21 (or 33), and so forth.\n{| {{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|JIS X 0208 (lead

Including only a couple would be at best not particularly useful, and at worst misleading. As for including it in a separate article on Wikipedia, bear the concerns raised at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?type=delete&page=GB2312+Blocks in mind before attempting. -->\n\n== Code structure ==\nIn order to represent [[code point]]s, column/line numbers are used for one-byte codes and ''kuten'' numbers are used for two-byte codes. For a way to identify a character without depending on a code, character names are used.\n\n=== Single byte codes ===\nAlmost all JIS X 0208 [[graphic character]] codes are represented with two bytes of at least seven bits each. However, every [[control character]], as well as the plain [[whitespace character|space]] &ndash; although not the [[ideographic space]] &ndash; is represented with a one-byte code. In order to represent the {{nihongo|'''bit combination'''|\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u7d44\u5408\u305b|bitto kumiawase}} of a one-byte code, two decimal numbers \u2013 a '''column number''' and a '''line number''' \u2013 are used. Three high-order bits out of seven or four high-order bits out of eight, counting from zero to seven or from zero to fifteen respectively, form the column number. Four low-order bits counting from zero to fifteen form the line number. Each decimal number corresponds to one [[hexadecimal]] digit. For example, the bit combination corresponding to the graphic character \"space\" is 010 0000 as a 7-bit number, and 0010 0000 as an 8-bit number. In column/line notation, this is represented as 2/0. Other representations of the same single-byte code include 0x20 as hexadecimal, or 32 as a single decimal number.\n\n=== Code points and code numbers ===\nThe double-byte codes are laid out in 94 numbered groups, each called a {{nihongo|''row''|[[wikt:\u533a|\u533a]]|ku|lit. \"section\"}}. Every row contains 94 numbered codes, each called a {{nihongo|''cell''|[[wikt:\u70b9|\u70b9]]|ten|lit. \"point\"}}.{{efn|name=kuten}} This makes a total of 8836 (94 \u00d7 94) possible code points (although not all are assigned, see below); these are laid out in the standard in a 94-line, 94-column code table.\n\nA row number and a cell number (each numbered from 1 to 94) form a {{nihongo|'''kuten'''|[[wikt:\u533a\u70b9|\u533a\u70b9]]}} point, which is used to represent double-byte code points. A {{nihongo|code number or ''kuten'' number|\u533a\u70b9\u756a\u53f7|kuten bang\u014d}} is expressed in the form \"row-cell\", the row and cell numbers being separated by a [[hyphen]]. For example, the character \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u4e9c|\u4e9c]]}}\" has a code point at row 16, cell 1, so its code number is represented as \"16-01\".\n\nIn 7-bit JIS X 0208 (as might be switched to in JIS X 0202 / [[ISO-2022-JP]]), both bytes must be from the 94-byte range of [[hexadecimal|0x]]21 (used for row or cell number 1) through 0x7E (used for row or cell number 94) &ndash; exactly corresponding to the range used for 7-bit ASCII printing characters, not counting the space. Accordingly, the encoded bytes are obtained by adding 0x20 (16) to each number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/JIS/JIS0208.TXT |title=JIS X 0208 (1990) to Unicode |author=Unicode, Inc. |date=2011-10-14}}</ref> For instance, the above example of 16-01 (\"\u4e9c\") would be represented by the bytes <code>0x30 0x21</code>. The 8-bit [[EUC-JP]] instead uses the range 0xA1 through 0xFE (setting the high bit to 1), whereas other encodings such as [[Shift JIS]] use more complicated transforms.\n\nThis structure is also used in the Mainland Chinese [[GB 2312]] (where it is natively known as {{lang-zh|s=[[wikt:\u5340\u4f4d|\u533a\u4f4d]]|hp=q\u016bw\u00e8i|labels=no}}) and the South Korean KS C 5601 (currently [[KS X 1001]]; the ''ku'' and ''ten'' are respectively known as ''hang'' and ''yol'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/KSC/KSX1001.TXT |title=KSX1001.TXT: KS X 1001 to Unicode table |author=Jungshik Shin |publisher=Unicode, Inc |date=2011-10-14}}</ref> The later [[JIS X 0213]] extends this structure by having more than one {{nihongo|plane|[[wikt:\u9762|\u9762]]|men|lit. \"face\"}} of rows, which is also the structure used by [[CNS 11643]].\n\n=== Unassigned code points ===\nAmong the 2-byte codes, rows 9 to 15 and 85 to 94 are {{nihongo|'''unassigned code points'''|\u7a7a\u304d\u9818\u57df|aki ry\u014diki}}; that is, they are code points with no characters assigned to them. Also, some cells in other rows are also essentially unassigned code points.\n\nThese empty areas contain code points that should basically not be used. Except when there is prior agreement among the relevant parties, characters ([[gaiji]]) for information interchange should not be assigned to the unassigned code points.\n\nEven when assigning characters to unassigned code points, graphic characters defined in the standard should not be assigned to them, and the same character should not be assigned to multiple unassigned code points; characters should not be duplicated in the set.\n\nFurthermore, when assigning characters to unassigned code points, it is necessary to be cautious of [[Han unification|unification]] in regards to kanji glyphs. For example, row 25 cell 66 corresponds to the kanji meaning \"high\" or \"expensive\"; both the form with a component resembling the \"mouth\" character ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u53e3|\u53e3]]}}) in the middle ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9ad8|\u9ad8]]}}) and the less common form with a ladder-like construction in the same location ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9ad9|\u9ad9]]}}) are subsumed into the same code point. Consequently, limiting point 25-66 to the \"mouth\" form and assigning the latter \"ladder\" form to an unassigned code point would technically be in violation of the standard.\n\nIn practice, however, several vendor-specific [[Shift JIS]] variants, including [[Windows-932]] and [[MacJapanese]], encode vendor extensions in unallocated rows of the encoding space for JIS X 0208. Also, most of the codes unassigned in JIS X 0208 are assigned by the newer [[JIS X 0213]] standard.\n\n=== Character names ===\n{{see also|Unicode character property#Name}}\nEach JIS X 0208 character is given a '''name'''. By using a character's name, it is possible to identify characters without relying on their codes. The names of characters are coordinated with other character set standards, notably the [[Universal Coded Character Set]] (UCS/[[Unicode]]), so this is one possible source of character mappings to character sets such as Unicode. For example, both the character at [[ISO/IEC 646]] International Reference Version ([[US-ASCII]]) column 4 line 1 and the one at JIS X 0208 row 3 cell 33 have the name \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\". Therefore, the character at 4/1 in ASCII and the character at 3-33 in JIS X 0208 can be regarded as the same character (although, in practice, [[Halfwidth and fullwidth forms|alternative mapping]] is used for the JIS X 0208 character due to encodings providing ASCII separately). Conversely, ASCII characters 2/2 (quotation mark), 2/7 (apostrophe), 2/13 (hyphen-minus), and 7/14 (tilde) can be determined to be characters that do not exist in this standard.\n\nCharacter names of non-kanji characters use uppercase Roman letters, spaces, and hyphens. Non-kanji characters are given a {{nihongo|Japanese-language common name|\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u901a\u7528\u540d\u79f0|Nihongo ts\u016by\u014d meish\u014d}}, but some provisions for these names do not exist.{{efn|Character names are given in Roman letters and are used internationally, so they can be considered an international convention, somewhat like the [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]]s of living organisms. In regard to this analogy, the Japanese common names for the characters would be like using [[common name]]s for organisms.}} The names of kanji, on the other hand, are mechanically set according to the corresponding hexadecimal representation of their code in UCS/Unicode. The name of a kanji can be arrived at by prepending the Unicode codepoint with \"CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-\". For example, row 16 cell 1 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u4e9c|\u4e9c]]}}) corresponds to U+4E9C in UCS, so the name of it would be \"CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E9C\". Kanji are not given Japanese common names.\n\n== Kanji set ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nJIS X 0208 prescribes a set of 6879 graphical characters that correspond to two-byte codes with either seven or eight bits to the byte; in JIS X 0208, this is called the {{nihongo|'''kanji set'''|\u6f22\u5b57\u96c6\u5408|kanji sh\u016bg\u014d}}, which includes 6355 kanji as well as 524 {{nihongo|'''non-kanji'''|\u975e\u6f22\u5b57|hikanji}}, including characters such as [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]], [[kana]], and so forth.\n\n;Special characters\n:Occupies rows 1 and 2. There are 18 {{nihongo|'''descriptor symbols'''|\u8a18\u8ff0\u8a18\u53f7|kijutsu kig\u014d}} such as the \"ideographic space\" ([[wikt:|\u3000]]), and the Japanese [[Japanese punctuation#Comma|comma]] and [[Japanese punctuation#Full stop|period]]; eight '''[[Diacritic|diacritical marks]]''' such as [[dakuten|dakuten and handakuten]]; 10 characters for {{nihongo|'''things that follow kana or kanji'''|\u4eee\u540d\u53c8\u306f\u6f22\u5b57\u306b\u6e96\u3058\u308b\u3082\u306e|kana mata wa kanji ni junjiru mono}} such as the [[Iteration mark]]; 22 {{nihongo|'''bracket symbols'''|\u62ec\u5f27\u8a18\u53f7|kakko kig\u014d}}; 45 {{nihongo|'''mathematical symbols'''|\u5b66\u8853\u8a18\u53f7|gakujutsu kig\u014d}}; and 32 '''unit symbols''', which includes the [[currency sign]] and the [[Japan postal mark|postal mark]], for a total of 147 characters.\n;[[Numerical digit|Numerals]]\n:Occupies part of row 3. The ten digits from \"0\" to \"9\".\n;[[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]]\n:Occupies part of row 3.

Contains 48 unvoiced kana (including the obsolete ''[[Wi (kana)|wi]]'' and ''[[We (kana)|we]]''), 20 voiced kana ([[dakuten]]), 5 semi-voiced kana ([[dakuten|handakuten]]), 10 small kana for palatalized and assimilated sounds, for a total of 83 characters.\n;[[Katakana]]\n:Occupies row 5. There are 86 characters; in addition to the katakana equivalents of the hiragana characters, the [[small ke|small ''ka''/''ke'']] kana ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30f5|\u30f5]]}}/{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30f6|\u30f6]]}}) and the ''[[u (kana)|vu]]'' kana ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30f4|\u30f4]]}}).\n;[[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]\n:Occupies row 6. The 24 letters of the Greek alphabet in uppercase and lowercase form (minus the final [[sigma]]) for a total of 48.\n;[[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic letters]]\n:Occupies row 7. The 33 letters of the [[Russian alphabet]] in uppercase and lowercase form for a total of 66.\n;[[Box-drawing character]]s\n:Occupies row 8. Thin segments, thick segments, and mixed thin and thick segments, 32 total.\n;[[Kanji]]\n:The 2965 characters of {{nihongo|'''level 1'''|\u7b2c1\u6c34\u6e96|dai ichi suijun}} from row 16 to row 47, and the 3390 characters of {{nihongo|'''level 2'''|\u7b2c2\u6c34\u6e96|dai ni suijun}} from row 48 to row 84 for a total of 6355.\n\n=== Special characters, numerals, and Latin characters ===\nAs for the special characters in the kanji set, some characters from the graphic character set of the International Reference Version (IRV) of [[ISO/IEC 646]]:1991 (equivalent to [[ASCII]]) are absent from JIS X 0208. There are the aforementioned four characters \"QUOTATION MARK\", \"APOSTROPHE\", \"HYPHEN-MINUS\", and \"TILDE\". The former three are split into different code points in the kanji set (Nishimura, 1978; JIS X 0221-1:2001 standard, Section 3.8.7). The \"TILDE\" of IRV has no corresponding character in the kanji set.\n\nIn the following table, the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV characters in question are compared with their multiple equivalents in JIS X 0208, except for the IRV character \"TILDE\", which is compared with the \"WAVE DASH\" of JIS X 0208. The entries under the \"Symbol\" columns utilize UCS/Unicode code points, so the specifics of display may differ.\n\nThe ASCII/IRV characters without exact JIS X 0208 equivalents were later assigned code points by [[#Future|JIS X 0213]], these are also listed below, as are [[Windows-31J|Microsoft's mapping]] of the four characters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Non-strict correspondence between ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV (ASCII) and JIS X 0208\n!colspan=\"5\"|ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV\n!colspan=\"3\"|JIS X 0208\n|-\n!Column/Line\n!x0213<ref name=\"x02132004m1\">[https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/233.pdf ISO-IR-233 (JIS X 0213:2004 plane 1) code chart]</ref>\n!Microsoft\n!Symbol\n!Name\n!''Kuten''\n!Symbol\n!Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2/2\n|rowspan=\"4\"|1-2-16\n|rowspan=\"4\"|92-94{{efn-ua|name=w31jnec|1=From \"NEC selection of IBM extensions\".

The [[Tilde#ASCII tilde (U+007E)|ASCII / IRV tilde]] is an ambiguous code point which may appear either as a tilde accent mark (\u02dc) or as a dash with the same curvature (\u223c), although the dash is more common due to the spacing accent having a separate code point in [[Windows-1252]]; there is no JIS X 0208 character for a tilde accent. Character 1-2-18 in JIS X 0213 is shown as a tilde accent in the code chart.<ref name=\"x02132004m1\" />}}\n|}\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\nThis means that the kanji set is the most widespread non-upward-compatible character set in the world; it is counted as one of the weak points of this standard.\n\nEven with the 90 special characters, numerals, and Latin letters the kanji set and the IRV set have in common, this standard does not follow the arrangement of ISO/IEC 646. These 90 characters are split between rows 1 (punctuation) and 3 (letters and numbers), although row 3 does follow ISO 646 arrangement for the 62 letters and numbers alone (e.g. <code>4/1</code> (\"A\") in ISO 646 becomes <code>2/3 4/1</code> (i.e. 3-33) in JIS X 0208).\n\nAs to the cause of how these numerals, Latin letters, and so forth in the kanji set are the {{nihongo|\"full-width alphanumeric characters\"|\u5168\u89d2\u82f1\u6570\u5b57|zenkaku eis\u016bji}} and how the original implementation came forth with a differing interpretation compared to the IRV, it is thought that it is due to these incompatibilities.\n\nEver since the first standard, it has been possible to represent {{nihongo|'''composites'''|\u5408\u6210|g\u014dsei}} such as [[Enclosed Alphanumerics|encircled numbers]], ligatures for measurement unit names, and [[Roman numerals]];<ref>JIS C 6225-1979 (control character codes for the purpose of the Japanese graphic character set for information interchange) provided control characters for the beginning and end of composition. JIS C 6225 was re-termed [[JIS X 0207]] in 1987, and was withdrawn in 1997.</ref> they were not given independent ''kuten'' code points. Although individual companies that manufacture information systems can make an effort to represent these characters as customers may require by the composition of the characters, none has requested to have them added to the standard, instead choosing to proprietarily offer them as [[gaiji]].\n\nIn the fourth standard (1997), all these characters were explicitly defined as characters that accompany an advancement of the current position; that is to say, they are '''spacing characters'''. Furthermore, it was ruled that they should not be made by the composition of characters. For this reason, it became disallowed to represent Latin characters with [[diacritic]]s at all, with possibly the sole exception of the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] symbol ([[\u00c5]]) at row 2 cell 82.\n\n=== Hiragana and katakana ===\nThe [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] in JIS X 0208, unlike [[JIS X 0201]], includes [[dakuten]] and [[handakuten]] markings as part of a character. The katakana {{nihongo3||\u30f0|[[wi (kana)|wi]]}} and {{nihongo3||\u30f1|[[we (kana)|we]]}} (both obsolete in modern Japanese) as well as the small {{nihongo3||\u30ee|[[wa (kana)|wa]]}}, not in JIS X 0201, are also included.\n\nThe arrangement of kana in JIS X 0208 is different from the arrangement of katakana in JIS X 0201. In JIS X 0201, the syllabary starts with {{nihongo3||\u30f2|[[wo (kana)|wo]]}}, followed by the small kana sorted by ''[[goj\u016bon]]'' order, followed by the full-size kana, also in ''goj\u016bon'' order ({{lang|ja|\u30f2\u30a1\u30a3\u30a5\u30a7\u30a9\u30e3\u30e5\u30e7\u30c3\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4\u30a6\u30a8\u30aa......\u30e9\u30ea\u30eb\u30ec\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3}}). On the other hand, in JIS X 0208, the kana are sorted first by ''goj\u016bon'' order, then in the order of \"small kana, full-size kana, kana with dakuten, and kana with handakuten\" such that the same fundamental kana is grouped with its derivatives ({{lang|ja|\u3041\u3042\u3043\u3044\u3045\u3046\u3047\u3048\u3049\u304a......\u3063\u3064\u3065......\u306f\u3070\u3071\u3072\u3073\u3074\u3075\u3076\u3077\u3078\u3079\u307a\u307b\u307c\u307d......\u308e\u308f\u3090\u3091\u3092\u3093}}). This ordering was chosen in order to more simply facilitate the sorting of kana-based dictionary look-ups (Yasuoka, 2006).{{efn|For a fully featured kana-order search or sort, word readings, repetition marks, and so forth must be taken into account. The sorting of Japanese character strings is prescribed in [[JIS X 4061]] (Collation of Japanese character strings).}}\n\nAs mentioned above, in this standard, the previously defined katakana order in JIS X 0201 was not followed in JIS X 0208. It is thought that the JIS X 0201 katakana being \"[[half-width kana]]\" arose due to the incompatibility with the katakana of this standard. This point is also one of the weaknesses of this standard.\n\n=== Kanji ===\nHow the kanji in this standard were chosen from what sources, why they are split into level 1 and level 2, and how they are arranged are all explained in detail in the fourth standard (1997). Per that explanation, the kanji included in the following four kanji listings were reflected in the 6349 characters of the first standard (1978).\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Kanji Listing for Standard Code (Tentative)'''|\u6a19\u6e96\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u8868 (\u8a66\u6848)|Hy\u014djun K\u014ddo-y\u014d Kanjihy\u014d (Shian)}}\n:The [[Information Processing Society of Japan]] kanji code committee compiled this list in 1971.

For data for the purpose of selection, the Agency made a report which, starting with the \"Kanji Listing for Standard Code (Tentative)\", contrasted several kanji listings, the {{nihongo|\"Correspondence Analysis Results and Frequency of Use of Kanji for Administrative Data Processing Use Normal Kanji Selection\"|\u884c\u653f\u60c5\u5831\u51e6\u7406\u7528\u6a19\u6e96\u6f22\u5b57\u9078\u5b9a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u983b\u5ea6\u304a\u3088\u3073\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5206\u6790\u7d50\u679c|Gy\u014dsei J\u014dh\u014d Shoriy\u014d Kihon Kanji Sentei no Tame no Kanji no Shiy\u014d Hindo Oyobi Tai\u014d Bunseki Kekka}}, or {{nihongo|\"Correspondence Analysis Results\"|\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5206\u6790\u7d50\u679c|Tai\u014d Bunseki Kekka}} for short.\n*{{nihongo|'''Japanese Personality Registration Name Kanji'''|\u65e5\u672c\u751f\u547d\u53ce\u5bb9\u4eba\u540d\u6f22\u5b57|Nihon Seimei Sh\u016by\u014d Jinmei Kanji}}\n:One of the kanji listings that compose the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\", consisting of 3044 characters.

The original drafting committee did not investigate the listing itself; the kanji used from this list followed the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\".\n\nIn the second and third standards, they added four and two characters to level 2, respectively, bringing the total kanji to 6355. Also, in the second standard, character forms were changed as well as transposition among the levels; in the third standard as well, character forms were changed. These are described further below.\n\n==== Level partitioning ====\nThe 2,965 Level 1 kanji occupy rows 16 to 47. The 3,390 Level 2 kanji occupy rows 48 to 84.\n\nFor level 1, characters common to multiple kanji glyph listings were chosen, using the [[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]], the t\u014dy\u014d kanji correction draft, and the [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]] as a basis. Also, JIS C 6260 (\"To-Do-Fu-Ken (Prefecture) Identification Code\"; currently [[JIS X 0401]]) and JIS C 6261 (\"Identification code for cities, towns and villages\"; currently [[JIS X 0402]]) were consulted; kanji for nearly all Japanese [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], cities, districts, wards, towns, villages, and so forth were intentionally placed in level 1.{{efn|According to Yasuoka (2001a), it seems there were some accidental oversights. He notes, for example, that the {{nihongo3||\u65db|ba|58-57}} of [[Inba District, Chiba|Inba]] and the {{nihongo3||\u6cd7|shi|61-89}} of [[Shisui, Kumamoto]] are not part of level 1.}} Furthermore, amendments by experts were added.\n\nLevel 2 was dedicated to kanji that made an appearance in the aforementioned four major listings but were not selected for level 1. As noted below, the kanji of level 1 were ordered by their pronunciation, so among the kanji whose pronunciation were difficult to determine, there were those that were transferred from level 1 to level 2 on that basis (Nishimura, 1978).\n\nDue to these decisions, for the most part, level 1 contains more frequently used kanji, and level 2 contains more infrequently used kanji, but of course, those were judged by the standards of the day; over the passage of time, some level 2 kanji have become more frequently used, such as one meaning \"to soar\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7fd4|\u7fd4]]}}) and one meaning \"to glitter\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u714c|\u714c]]}}); and inversely, some level 1 kanji have become infrequent, notably the ones meaning \"centimeter\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7cce|\u7cce]]}}) and \"millimeter\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7c8d|\u7c8d]]}}). Also, a few jinmeiy\u014d kanji, being added after the kanji set was defined, fall into level 2.\n\n==== Arrangement ====\nThe kanji in level 1 are sorted in order of each one's \"representative reading\" (i.e. a canonical reading chosen for the purposes of this standard only); the reading of a kanji for this may be an [[on'yomi|''on'']] or a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading; readings are sorted in [[goj\u016bon]] order.{{efn|For row 19 cells 30 and 31, the order is mixed up for their representative readings. Consequently, where the correct order should be {{nihongo3|\"frog\"|[[wikt:\u86d9|\u86d9]]|kaeru}} followed by {{nihongo3|\"aroma\"|[[wikt:\u99a8|\u99a8]]|kaori}}, their positions are transposed so that ''kaori'' precedes ''kaeru''.}} As a general rule, the ''on'' (Chinese-sound) reading is considered the representative reading; where a kanji has multiple ''on'' readings, the reading judged to be predominant in use frequency is used for the representative reading (JIS C 6226-1978 standard, Section 3.4). For the small percentage of kanji that either do not have an ''on'' reading or have an ''on'' reading which is little known and not in common use, the ''kun'' reading was employed as the representative reading. Where a verb ''kun'' reading must be used as the representative reading, the ''[[wikt:\u9023\u7528\u5f62|ren'y\u014dkei]]'' (rather than the ''[[wikt:\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62|sh\u016bshikei]]'') form is used.\n\nFor example, cells 1 to 41 on row 16 are 41 characters sorted as starting with a reading of ''[[a (kana)|a]]''. Within these, 22 characters, including 16-10 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u8475|\u8475]]}}: ''on'' reading \"''ki''\"; ''kun'' reading \"''aoi''\") and 16-32 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7c9f|\u7c9f]]}}: ''on'' readings \"''zoku''\" and \"''shoku''\"; ''kun'' reading \"''awa''\") are there on the basis of their ''kun'' readings. 16-09 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9022|\u9022]]}}: ''on'' reading \"''h\u014d''\", ''kun'' reading \"''a(i)''\") and 16-23 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6271|\u6271]]}}: ''on'' readings \"''s\u014d''\" and \"''ky\u016b''\", ''kun'' reading \"''atsuka(i)''\") are just two examples of ''ren'y\u014dkei''-form verbs used for the representative reading.\n\nWhere the representative reading is the same between different kanji, a kanji that uses an ''on'' reading is placed ahead of one that uses a ''kun'' reading. Where the ''on'' or ''kun'' readings are the same between more than one kanji, they are then ordered by their [[Section headers of a Chinese dictionary|primary radical]] and [[stroke (CJK character)|stroke]] count.\n\nWhether on level 1 or level 2, [[itaiji]] are arranged to directly follow their exemplar form. For example, in level 2, right after row 49 cell 88 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u528d|\u528d]]}}), the immediately following characters deviate from the general rule (stroke count in this case) to include three variants of 49-88 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5294|\u5294]]}}, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5292|\u5292]]}}, and {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5271|\u5271]]}}).{{efn|In addition, the primarily used variant ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5263|\u5263]]}}) is at row 23 cell 85 on level 1, and one other variant ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u91fc|\u91fc]]}}) can be found grouped as having the [[radical 167|\"gold\" radical]] at row 78 cell 63 on level 2.}}\n\nThe kanji in level 2 are arranged in order of primary radical and stroke count. Where these two properties are the same for different kanji, they are then sorted by reading.\n\n==== Kanji from unknown sources ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin: 0.5em 0px 0.5em 1em;\"\n|+Kanji for which sources are unclear, unknown, or otherwise un&shy;iden&shy;ti&shy;fiable in JIS X 0208:1997 Appendix 7\n!''Kuten''\n!Symbol\n!Classi&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion\n|-\n|52-55\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u58b8}}\n|Unknown\n|-\n|52-63\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u58e5}}\n|Unknown\n|-\n|54-12\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u599b}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|55-27\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u5f41}}\n|Un&shy;iden&shy;ti&shy;fiable\n|-\n|57-43\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u6327}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|58-83\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u6683}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|59-91\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u6922}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|60-57\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u69de}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|74-12\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u87d0}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|74-57\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u88ae}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|79-64\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u95a0}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|81-50\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u99f2}}\n|Source unclear\n|}\nIt has been pointed out that there are kanji in the kanji set that are not found in comprehensive, unabridged kanji dictionaries, and that the sources thereof are unknown. For example, only one year after the first standard was established, Tajima (1979) reported that he had confirmed 63 kanji that were not to be found in ''Shinjigen'' (a large kanji dictionary published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]]), nor in ''[[Dai Kan-Wa jiten]]'', and they did not make sense as [[ryakuji]] of any sort; he noted that it would be preferable for kanji not available in kanji dictionaries to be selected from definite sources. These kanji came to be known as {{nihongo|\"ghost\" characters|\u5e7d\u970a\u6587\u5b57|y\u016brei moji}} or {{nihongo|\"ghost kanji\"|\u5e7d\u970a\u6f22\u5b57|y\u016brei kanji}}, among other names.\n\nThe drafting committee for the fourth version of the standard also saw the existence of kanji with sources unknown as a problem, and so made an inquiry into just what kind of sources the drafting committee of the first version referenced. As a result, it was discovered that the original drafting committee had heavily relied on the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\" to collect kanji. When the drafting committee investigated the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\", it became clear that many of the kanji included in the kanji set but not found in exhaustive kanji dictionaries supposedly came from the \"Japanese Personality Registration Name Kanji\" and \"Kanji for National Administrative District Listing\" lists mentioned in the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\".\n\nIt was confirmed that no original text for the \"Japanese Personality Registration Name Kanji\" referenced in the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\" exists. For the \"National Administrative District Listing\", [[Sasahara Hiroyuki]] of the fourth version's drafting committee examined the kanji that appeared on the in-progress development pages for the first standard. The committee also consulted many ancient writings, as well as many examples of personal names in a database of [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] phone books.\n\nDue to this thorough investigation, the committee was able to pare down the number of kanji for which the source cannot be confidently explained to twelve, shown on the adjacent table. Of these, it is conjectured that several glyphs came about due to copying errors. In particular, \u599b was probably created when printers tried to create \ud845\udeb4 by cutting and pasting \u5c71 and \u5973 together. A shadow from that process was misinterpreted as a line, resulting in \u599b (a picture of this can be found in the ''J\u014dy\u014d kanji jiten'').\n\n==== Unification of kanji variants ====\nAccording to the specifications in the fourth standard (1997), {{nihongo|'''unification'''|\u5305\u6442|h\u014dsetsu|not the same term used for [[Unicode]]'s \"[[Han unification|unification]]\" although it is nearly the same concept}} is the action of giving the same code point to a character without regard to its different character forms. In the fourth standard, the [[glyph]]s allowed are limited; the extent to which particular [[allograph]]ic glyphs are unified into a [[grapheme|graphemic]] code point is clearly defined.\n\nFurthermore, according to the specifications in the standard, a {{nihongo|'''glyph'''|[[wikt:\u5b57\u4f53|\u5b57\u4f53]]|jitai|lit. \"character body\"; }} is an abstract notion as to the graphical representation of a graphic character; a {{nihongo|'''character form'''|[[wikt:\u5b57\u5f62|\u5b57\u5f62]]|jikei|lit. \"character shape\"; also a \"glyph\" in a sense, but differentiated on a different level for standardization purposes}} is the representation as a graphical shape that a glyph takes in actuality (e.g. due to a glyph being handwritten, printed, displayed on a screen, etc.). For a single glyph, there exist an endless range of possible concretely and/or visibly different character forms. A variation between a character form of one glyph is termed a {{nihongo|\"design difference\"|\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5dee|dezain no sa}}.\n\nThe extent to which a glyph is unified to one code point is determined according to that code point's {{nihongo|\"example glyph\"|\u4f8b\u793a\u5b57\u4f53|reiji jitai}} and the {{nihongo|\"unification criteria\"|\u5305\u6442\u898f\u6e96|h\u014dsetsu kijun}} that can be applied to that example glyph; that is, the example glyph for a code point applies to that code point, and any glyphs for which the parts that compose the example glyph are replaced in accordance with the unification criteria ''also'' apply to that code point.\n\n<!-- TODO: make SVG diagram for people who don't have nice and proper multilingual font setups -->\nFor example, the example glyph at 33-46 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u50e7|\u50e7]]}}) is composed of [[radical 9]] ({{lang|ja|\u4ebb}}) and the kanji that eventually spawned the both the ''[[so (kana)|so]]'' kana ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u66fd|\u66fd]]}}). Also, in unification criterion 101, there are three kanji displayed: the first takes the form most often seen in Japanese ({{lang|ja|\u66fd}}); the second contains a more traditional form ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u66fe|\u66fe]]}}) in which the first two strokes form [[radical 12]] (the kanji numeral for the number 8: {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u516b|\u516b]]}}); and the third is like the second, except that radical 12 is inverted ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u66fe}}). Consequently, all three permutations ({{lang|ja|\u50e7}}, {{lang|ja|\u50e7}}, {{lang|zh-Hans|\u50e7}}) all apply to the code point at line 33 cell 46.\n\nIn the fourth standard, including one of the [[errata]] for the first printing, there are 186 unification criteria.\n\nWhen a code point's example glyph is composed of more than one part glyph, unification criteria can be applied to each part. After a unification criterion is applied to one part glyph, that part cannot have any more unification criteria applied to it. Also, a unification criterion is not allowed to apply if the resulting glyph would coincide with that of another code point entirely.\n\nAn example glyph is no more than an example for that code point; it is not a glyph \"endorsed\" by the standard. Also, the unification criteria need only be used for generally used kanji and for the purpose of assigning things to the code points of this standard. The standard requests that generally unused kanji not be created based on the example glyphs and unification criteria.\n\nThe kanji of the kanji set are not chosen completely consistently according to the unification criteria. For example, although 41-7 corresponds to the form where the third and fourth strokes cross ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5f65|\u5f65]]}}) as well as the form where they don't ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5f66|\u5f66]]}}) according to unification criterion 72, 20-73 only corresponds to the form where they do not cross ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9854|\u9854]]}}), and 80-90 only corresponds to the form where they do ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u984f|\u984f]]}}).\n\nThe terms \"unification\", \"unification criteria\", and \"example glyph\" were adopted in the fourth standard. From the first to the third version, kanji and relations between kanji were grouped into three types: {{nihongo|\"independent\"|\u72ec\u7acb|dokuritsu}}, {{nihongo|\"compatible\"|\u5bfe\u5fdc|tai\u014d}}, and {{nihongo|\"equivalent\"|\u540c\u5024|d\u014dchi}}; it was explained that the characters recognized as equivalent \"consolidate to just one point\". \"Equivalence\" included, other than kanji with exactly the same shape, kanji with differences due to style, and kanji where the difference in character form is small.\n\nIn the first standard, it was stipulated that \"this standard ... does not establish the particulars of character forms\" (Section 3.1); it also states that \"the aim of this standard is to establish the general idea of characters and their codes; the design of their character forms and such lie outside its scope.\" In the second and third standards as well, notes to the effect that specific designs of character forms lie outside its scope (the note on item 1). The fourth standard also stipulates that \"This standard regulates graphic characters as well as their bit patterns, and the use, specific designs of individual characters, and so forth are not within the scope of this standard\" (JIS X 0208:1997, item 1).\n\n==== Unification criteria for compatibility ====\nIn the fourth standard, {{nihongo|\"unification criteria for maintaining compatibility with previous standards\"|\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u898f\u683c\u3068\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u3092\u7dad\u6301\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5305\u6442\u898f\u6e96|kako no kikaku to no gokansei wo iji suru tame no h\u014dsetsu kijun}} is defined. Their application is limited to 29 code points whose glyphs vary greatly between the standards JIS C 6226-1983 on and after and JIS C 6226-1978. For those 29 code points, the glyphs from JIS C 6226-1983 on and after are displayed as \"A\", and the glyphs from JIS C 6226-1978 as \"B\". On each of them, both \"A\" and \"B\" glyphs may be applied. However, in order to claim compatibility with the standard, whether the \"A\" or \"B\" form has been used for each code point must be explicitly noted.\n\n== Character encodings ==\n\n=== Encoding schemes stipulated by JIS X 0208 ===\nIn JIS X 0208:1997, article 7 combined with appendices 1 and 2 define a total of eight encoding schemes.\n\nIn the descriptions below, the \"CL\" (control left), \"GL\" (graphic left), \"CR\" (control right), and \"GR\" (graphic right) regions are respectively, in column/line notation, from 0/0 to 1/15, from 2/1 to 7/14, from 8/0 to 9/15, and from 10/1 to 15/14. For each code, 2/0 is assigned the graphic character \"SPACE\" and 7/15 the control character \"DELETE\". The [[C0 control characters]] (defined in [[JIS X 0211]] and matching [[ISO/IEC 6429]]) are assigned to the CL region.\n\n;7-bit encoding for kanji\n:Stipulated in the standard itself.

ISO/IEC 646:IRV is assigned to the GL region, JIS X 0208 to the GR region.

The [[escape sequence]]s to designate JIS X 0208 to each of the four ISO 2022 code sets are listed below. Here, \"ESC\" refers to the control character \"[[ANSI escape code|Escape]]\" (0x1B, or 1/11).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ISO 2022 escape sequences to select JIS C 6226 and JIS X 0208\n!Standard\n!G0\n!G1\n!G2\n!G3\n|-\n!78\n|ESC 2/4 4/0\n|ESC 2/4 2/9 4/0\n|ESC 2/4 2/10 4/0\n|ESC 2/4 2/11 4/0\n|-\n!83\n|ESC 2/4 4/2\n|ESC 2/4 2/9 4/2\n|ESC 2/4 2/10 4/2\n|ESC 2/4 2/11 4/2\n|-\n!90 onward\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 4/2\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 2/9 4/2\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 2/10 4/2\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 2/11 4/2\n|-\n|}\n\nThe escape sequence starting ESC 2/4 selects a multi-byte character set. The escape sequence starting ESC 2/6 specifies a revision of the upcoming character set selection. JIS C 6226:1978 is identified by the multibyte-94-set identifier byte 4/0 (corresponding to ASCII <code>@</code>). JIS C 6226:1983 / JIS X 0208:1983 is identified by the multibyte-94-set identifier byte 4/2 (<code>B</code>). JIS X 0208:1990 is also identified by the 94-set identifier byte 4/2, but can be distinguished with the revision identifier 4/0 (<code>@</code>).\n\n=== Duplicate encodings of ASCII and JIS X 0201 ===\n{{further|Halfwidth and fullwidth forms|Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (Unicode block)}}\nWhen using the kanji set of this standard with either the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV graphic character set ([[ASCII]]) or JIS X 0201's graphic character set for Latin characters ([[JIS-Roman]]), the treatment of the characters common to both sets becomes problematic. Unless one takes special measures, the characters included in both sets do not all map to each other one-to-one, and a single character may be given more than one code point; that is, it may cause a duplicate encoding.\n\nJIS X 0208:1997, in regards to when a character is common to both sets, basically forbids the use of the code point in the kanji set (which is one of two code points), eliminating duplicate encodings. It is judged that characters that have the same name are the same character.\n\nFor example, both the name of the character corresponding to the bit pattern 4/1 in ASCII and the name of the character corresponding to row 3 cell 33 of the kanji set are \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\". In International Reference Version + 8-bit code for kanji, whether by the bit pattern 4/1 or by the bit pattern corresponding to the kanji set's row 3 cell 33 (10/3 12/1), the letter \"[[A]]\" (i.e. \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\") is represented. The standard forbids the use of the \"10/3 12/1\" bit pattern, in an attempt to eliminate the duplicate encoding.\n\nIn consideration to implementations that treat the characters of the code points in the kanji set as \"[[fullwidth form|full-width characters]]\" and those of ASCII or JIS-Roman as different characters, the use of the kanji set code points is permitted only for the sake of backwards compatibility. For example, for the purpose of backwards compatibility, it is permitted to consider 10/3 12/1 in International Reference Version + 8-bit code for kanji to correspond to a full-width \"A\".\n\nIf the kanji set is used along with ASCII or JIS-Roman, then even if the standard is abided by strictly, the unique encoding of a character is not guaranteed. For example, in the International Reference Version + 8-bit code for kanji, it is valid to represent a [[hyphen]] with the bit pattern 2/13 for the character \"HYPHEN-MINUS\", as well as with the kanji set's row 1 cell 30 (bit pattern 10/1 11/14) for the character \"HYPHEN\". In addition, the standard does not define which of the two to use for what, and so the hyphen is not given one unique encoding. The same problem affects the [[minus sign]], the [[quotation mark]]s, and so forth.\n\nMoreover, even if the kanji set is used as a separate code, there is no guarantee that the unique encoding of characters is implemented. In many cases, however, the full-width \"[[ideographic space|IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE]]\" at row 1 cell 1 and the half-width space (2/0) coexist. How the two should be different is not self-explanatory, and is not specified in the standard.\n\n=== Comparison of encoding schemes used in practice ===\n{{JIS X 0208 encoding comparison|efn-ua}}\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== History ==\nUntil five years have passed after a Japanese Industrial Standard has been established, reaffirmed, or revised, the prior standard undergoes a process of reaffirmation, revision, or withdrawal. Since establishment, the standard has been subject to revision three times, and at present, the fourth standard is valid.\n\n=== First standard ===\nThe first standard is '''JIS C 6226-1978''' {{nihongo|\"Code of Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange\"|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb|J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Kanji Fug\u014dkei}}, established by the Japanese [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Japan)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] on 1 January 1978.

The committee chairman was [[Motooka T\u014dru]].\n\nThe draft of the second standard was based on the consideration of factors such as the promulgation of the [[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]], the enforcement of the [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]], and the standardization of Japanese-language [[Teletex]] by the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (Japan)|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]]; also, the next modification was performed to keep pace with JIS C 6234-1983 (24-pixel matrix printer character forms; presently JIS X 9052).\n\n;Addition of special characters\n:39 characters were added to the special characters. Among these 39, per [[Japan Information Center of Science and Technology|JICST]] recommendations, and from such standards as JIS Z 8201-1981 (mathematical symbols) and JIS Z 8202-1982 (quantity, unit, and chemical symbols), things that could not be represented by composition were chosen.\n;Newly added box-drawing characters\n:32 [[box-drawing characters]] were added.\n;Swapping of ''itaiji'' code points\n:Code points for 22 [[itaiji|variant]] pairs of Kanji were swapped, such that the variant in level 2 was moved to level 1 and vice versa.<ref name=\"ibm208history\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781565922242/raw/master/AppQ/78-vs-83-3.sjs|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=Appendix Q \u00a7 78-vs-83-3|work=CJKV Information Processing (supplementary material)|publisher=O'Reilly}} Note inclusion of kuten codes with hyphen omitted.</ref> For example, (level 1's) row 36 cell 59 in the first standard ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u58fa|\u58fa]]}}) was moved to (level 2's) row 52 cell 68; the point originally at row 52 cell 68 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u58f7|\u58f7]]}}) was in turn moved to row 36 cell 59.\n;Additions to the level 2 kanji\n:Three characters from level 1 and one character from level 2 were given new code points at previously unassigned code points in row 84 as level 2 kanji. ''Itaiji'' for each of those code points were newly assigned to their original locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781565922242/raw/master/AppQ/78-vs-83-2.sjs|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=Appendix Q \u00a7 78-vs-83-2|work=CJKV Information Processing (supplementary material)|publisher=O'Reilly}} Note inclusion of kuten codes with hyphen omitted.</ref> For example, row 84 cell 1 in the second standard ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u582f|\u582f]]}}) was moved there to accommodate a different form not included in the first standard at row 22 cell 38 as a level 1 kanji ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5c2d|\u5c2d]]}}).\n;Modification of character forms\n:The character forms of approximately 300 kanji were amended.<ref>According to Nomura (1984), the number of character forms changed, including moves between code points, is 294. According to Shibano (1997a) and the text of the fourth standard, the number is of character forms changed is 300.</ref>\n\nAmong the changes in those 300 or so kanji character forms, many level 1 glyphs that were in the style of the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] were changed into variants, and especially more simplified forms (e.g. [[ryakuji]] and [[extended shinjitai]]). For example, a couple of code points that are often the subject of criticism due to being greatly changed are row 18 cell 10 (78JIS: {{lang|ja|\u9dd7}}, 83JIS: {{lang|ja|\u9d0e}}) and row 38 cell 34 (78JIS: {{lang|ja|\u7006}}, 83JIS: {{lang|ja|\u6d9c}}).\n\nThere were many smaller changes away from the Kangxi-style variants; for example, row 25 cell 84 ({{lang|ja|\u9d60}}) lost part of a stroke. Also, where some glyphs for level 1 kanji were not Kangxi-style forms, there were some changed into their Kangxi-style forms; for example, row 80 cell 49 ({{lang|ja|\u9760}}) gained part of a stroke (i.e., the same part of the stroke that 25-84 lost).\n\nIn order to elucidate the original intent of the first standard, these ended up falling into parameters for unification criteria in the fourth standard. The difference in form for the examples noted above (\"{{lang|ja|\u9d60}}\" and \"{{lang|ja|\u9760}}\") falls under the parameters for unification criterion 42 (concerning the component \"{{lang|ja|\u544a}}\").{{efn|The question of which glyphs within the unification criteria are to be used is left to the type designer. Depending on that (and the end-user's circumstances), it is possible that neither, both, one, or the other of these two will follow their Kangxi-style form.}}\n\nThe bulk of the changes to character forms are differences between level 1 and level 2 kanji. Specifically, simplification was done more often for level 1 kanji than for level 2 kanji; simplifications applied to level 1 kanji (e.g. \"{{lang|ja|\u6f51}}\" to \"{{lang|ja|\u6e8c}}\" and \"{{lang|ja|\u91b1}}\" to \"{{lang|ja|\u9197}}\") were not generally applied to kanji in level 2 (\"{{lang|ja|\u64a5}}\" stayed as-is). The aforementioned 25-84 ({{lang|ja|\u9d60}}) and 80-49 ({{lang|ja|\u9760}}) were given different treatment likewise, as the former is in level 1 and the latter is in level 2. Even so, there were some changes regardless of the level; for instance characters containing the \"door\" ({{lang|ja|\u6238}}) and \"winter\" ({{lang|ja|\u51ac}}) components were changed with no different treatment between level 1 and level 2 kanji.\n\nHowever, for 29 code points (such as the problematic 18-10 and 38-34 mentioned above), the forms inherited by the fourth standard contradicts the original intent of the first. For these, there are special unification criteria to maintain compatibility with the previous standards at these code points.\n\nWhen the new \"X\" category for Japanese Industrial Standards (for information-related fields) was introduced, the second standard was re-termed '''JIS X 0208-1983'''<ref name=\"ibm208history\" /> on 1 March 1987.\n\n=== Third standard ===\nThe third standard '''JIS X 0208-1990''' {{nihongo|\"Code of Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange\"|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7|J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Kanji Fug\u014d}} revised the second standard on 1 September 1990. It is also called '''90JIS''' for short. Entrusted by the AIST, a committee at the [[Japanese Standards Association]] for the revision of JIS X 0208 created the draft. The committee chairman was [[Tajima Kazuo]].\n\n225 kanji glyphs were changed, and two characters were added to level 2 (84-05 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u51dc|\u51dc]]}}\" and 84-06 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7199|\u7199]]}}\"). This was a disunification of ''itaiji'' for two characters already included (49-59 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u51db|\u51db]]}}\" and 63-70 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7155|\u7155]]}}\"). Some of the changes and the two additions corresponded to the 118 [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]] added in March 1990.<ref name=\"ibm208history\" /> The standard itself was set in [[Heisei Mincho]].\n\n=== Fourth standard ===\nThe fourth standard '''JIS X 0208:1997''' {{nihongo|\"7-bit and 8-bit double byte coded KANJI sets for information interchange\"|7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u53ca\u30738\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u6f22\u5b57\u96c6\u5408|Nana-Bitto Oyobi Hachi-Bitto no Ni-Baito J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Fug\u014dka Kanji Sh\u016bg\u014d}} revised the third standard on 20 January 1997. It is also called '''97JIS''' for short. Entrusted by the AIST, a JSA committee for research and study of coded character sets produced the draft. The committee chairman was [[Shibano K\u014dji]].\n\nThe basic policies of this revision were to perform no changes the character set, to clarify ambiguous provisions, and to make the standard relatively easier to use. Addition, removal, and code point rearrangement were not done, and without exception, the example glyphs were also left unchanged. However, the stipulations of the standard were completely re-written and/or supplemented. Whereas the third standard was 65 pages long without the explanations, the fourth standard was 374 pages without the explanations.\n\nThe main points of the revision are:\n\n;Definition of encoding methods\n:Until the third standard, only the encoding method based on JIS X 0202 code extension was defined. This is something unusual as far as coded character sets go. In the fourth standard, encoding methods that do not use escape sequences for the purpose of code extension were defined.\n;Definition of the general prohibition of the use of unassigned code points and methods of usage for unassigned code points\n:The third standard, in an explanation that was not part of the standard, described things as if there were places where for some unassigned code points, it was acceptable to assign gaiji. In the fourth standard, it was clarified that use of unassigned code points is generally prohibited. Also, the conditions for the usage of unassigned code points were specified.\n;General elimination of duplicate encodings\n:Each character was given a \"character name\" that maps to those of other standards. Also, encoding methods to use them together with the ISO/IEC 646's International Reference Version or JIS X 0201 were specified. When JIS X 0208 is used together with either, among two assigned code points for characters with the same name, only one is permitted; thus, duplicate encodings were generally eliminated.\n;Investigation into sources of kanji\n:Characters included in the standard so far that are found in neither the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] nor the [[Dai Kanwa Jiten]] were identified. Accordingly, exactly with what purpose for inclusion and from which sources these kanji came during compilation of the first standard was investigated.\n;Definition of kanji unification criteria\n:Based on things such as the materials for the drafting of the first standard, an attempt was made to restore the intent of the first standard for the scope of the glyphs each code point represents. Moreover, the criteria for unifying kanji glyphs were clearly defined.\n;Inclusion of de facto standards\n:By the time of the fourth standard, the encoding methods [[Shift JIS]] and [[ISO-2022-JP]] had become [[de facto standard]]s for personal computing and e-mail, respectively. These encoding methods were included as \"Shift-Coded Representation\" and \"<nowiki>RFC 1468</nowiki>-Coded Representation\" (described above).\n\n=== Successors {{anchor|Future}} ===\n[[JIS X 0213]] ([[extended kanji]]) was designed \"with the goal being to offer a sufficient character set for the purposes of encoding the modern Japanese language that JIS X 0208 intended to be from the start\";<ref name=\"goal\">Original Japanese: {{lang|ja|\u300cJIS X 0208\u304c\u5f53\u521d\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u3092\u610f\u56f3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5341\u5206\u306a\u6587\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u300d}}</ref> it defines a character set that expands upon the kanji set of JIS X 0208. The drafters of JIS X 0213 recommend migration from JIS X 0208 to JIS X 0213, among the advantages being JIS X 0213's compatibility with the [[Japanese script reform#Gaiji|Hy\u014dgai Kanji Glyph List]] and with newer [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]].\n\nContrary to the expectations of the drafters, adoption of JIS X 0213 has been anything but fast since its enactment in the year 2000. The drafting committee of JIS X 0213:2004 wrote (in the year 2004), \"The status where 'what the majority of information systems can use in common is JIS X 0208 only' still continues.\" (JIS X 0213:2000, Appendix 1:2004, section 2.9.7)\n\nFor [[Microsoft Windows]], the predominant [[operating system]] (and hence supplying the predominant [[desktop environment]]) in the personal computing sector, the JIS X 0213 [[character repertoire|repertoire]] has been included since [[Windows Vista]], released in November 2006. [[Mac OS X]] has been compatible with JIS X 0213 since version [[Mac OS X v10.1|10.1]] (released in 2001). Many [[Unix-like]]s such as [[Linux]] can (optionally) support JIS X 0213 if desired. Therefore, it is thought that with time, JIS X 0213 support on personal computers will not be an impediment to its eventual adoption.\n\nAmong the drafters of JIS X 0213, there are those who expect to see a mix of JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0213 before any adoption of JIS X 0213 (Sat\u014d, 2004). However, JIS X 0208 continues to be used for the present, and many predict it to endure as a standard. There are barriers that need to be overcome if JIS X 0213 is to supplant JIS X 0208 in common usage:\n\n* The character repertoires utilized in Japanese [[mobile phone]]s at the present time{{when|date=January 2018}} are based on JIS X 0208. There are no officially announced plans whatsoever to migrate these to JIS X 0213 compatibility. As mobile phones are now a pervasive aspect of Japanese textual communication (see [[Japanese mobile phone culture]]), being a widespread, commonly accessed medium for sending [[e-mail]] and accessing the [[World Wide Web]], a lack of adoption for mobile phones deters usage elsewhere.\n* JIS X 0213 is not strictly upward-compatible with JIS X 0208 in terms of unification criteria (see [[#JIS X 0213|below]]). For large-scale archives (e.g. [[bibliographic database]]s and [[Aozora Bunko]]) that use JIS X 0208 and follow its unification criteria strictly, it is thought that it would be extremely difficult work to both convert all the data to JIS X 0213 and preserve the same standard of textual integrity.\n* In practice, many systems define and use unassigned code points in JIS X 0208. For example, Windows assigns IBM and NEC extended characters and user-defined character areas (see [[Windows-932]]), and mobile phones assign [[emoji]] in some such places. The code points of these ''gaiji'' conflict with the code points that JIS X 0213 codes use, so there would be some difficulty in migrating these systems from JIS X 0208 to JIS X 0213. There are also plans to migrate to [[Universal Character Set|UCS]]/[[Unicode]] and use the JIS X 0213 repertoire from there, but until a system administrator is able to judge that the implementations of UCS/Unicode [[surrogate pair]]s and character compositions are sufficiently stable, he or she is likely to hesitate to use the repertoire of JIS X 0213 that requires those implementations.\n* The improvements provided by JIS X 0213 are mostly in the realm of characters that are not used as often as the ones already present in JIS X 0208. Because there are nearly twice as many glyphs that need to be implemented for less usage of those extra glyphs, it can be a low return on investment in many cases, especially where resources are constrained.\n\n== Implementations ==\nBecause JIS X 0208 / JIS C 6226 is primarily a [[character set]] and not a strictly defined [[character encoding]], several companies have implemented their own encodings of the character set.\n*[[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer Inc.]]: [[MacJapanese]] (Shift_JIS based)\n*[[Fujitsu]]: [[JEF kanji code]]\n*[[Hitachi Ltd.]]: [[KEIS]] (EBCDIC based)\n*[[IBM]]: various, including [[Code page 932 (IBM)|IBM-932]] and [[Code page 942|IBM-942]] (both Shift_JIS based)\n*[[Microsoft]]: [[Code page 932 (Microsoft Windows)|Windows-932]] (Shift_JIS based)\n*[[NEC]]: [[JIPS]]\n\nSeveral of these incorporate vendor-specific character assignments in place of unallocated regions of the standard. These include Windows-932 and MacJapanese, as well as [[NEC]]'s [[PC98]] character encoding. While IBM-932 and IBM-942 also include vendor assignments, they include them outside of the region used for JIS X 0208.\n\n== Relation to other standards ==\n\n=== ISO/IEC 646 IRV and ASCII ===\nAs noted above, the kanji set is not upwardly compatible with the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV (ASCII) graphic character set. The kanji set and the IRV graphic character set can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (IRV + 7-bit code for kanji and IRV + 8-bit code for kanji). They can be used together in [[EUC-JP]] as well.\n\n=== JIS X 0201 ===\nThe kanji set lacks three characters included in [[JIS X 0201]]'s graphic character set for Latin characters: 2/2 (QUOTATION MARK), 2/7 (APOSTROPHE), and 2/13 (HYPHEN-MINUS). The kanji set contains all character included in JIS X 0201's graphic character set for katakana.\n\nThe kanji set and the graphic character set for Latin characters can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (Latin characters + 7-bit code for kanji and the Latin characters + 8-bit code for kanji). The kanji set, graphic character set for Latin characters, and JIS X 0201's graphic character set for katakana can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (the shift-coded character set; i.e. [[Shift JIS]]). The kanji set and graphic character set for katakana can be used together in [[EUC-JP]].\n\n=== JIS X 0212 ===\n[[JIS X 0212]] (supplementary kanji) defines additional characters with code points for the purposes of information processing that requires characters not found in JIS X 0208. Rather than allocating characters within the main JIS X 0208 kanji set, it defines a second 94-by-94 kanji set containing supplementary characters.\n\nJIS X 0212 can be used with JIS X 0208 in [[EUC-JP]]. Also, JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212 are both source standards for UCS/Unicode's [[Han unification]], meaning that kanji from both sets can be included in one Unicode-format document.\n\nAmong the code points that the second version of JIS X 0208 changed, 28 code points in JIS X 0212 reflect the character forms from before the changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781565922242/raw/master/AppQ/TJ2.sjs|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=Appendix Q \u00a7 TJ2|work=CJKV Information Processing (supplementary material)|publisher=O'Reilly}} Note inclusion of kuten codes with hyphen omitted.</ref> Also, JIS X 0212 reassigns the \"[[List of Japanese typographic symbols#\u3006|closure mark]]\" that JIS X 0208 had assigned as a non-kanji ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3006|\u3006]]}}, at row 1 cell 26) as a kanji ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u4e44|\u4e44]]}}, at row 16 cell 17). JIS X 0212 has no characters in common with JIS X 0208 other than these. Hence, it is not suited for general use on its own.\n\nHowever, in the fourth version of JIS X 0208, the connection to JIS X 0212 was not defined at all. It is believed that this is because the drafting committee of the fourth JIS X 0208 standard had a critical opinion of the selection and identification methods of JIS X 0212.<ref>For example, Shibano K\u014dji (1997a), who served as the chairman of the drafting committee for the fourth standard, stated these about the selection method: \"It is based on a superficial understanding of JIS X 0208's character set selection; it is a mistaken understanding\" (original Japanese: {{lang|ja|\u300cJIS X 0208\u306e\u6587\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u9078\u5b9a\u306e\u8868\u5c64\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u9593\u9055\u3063\u305f\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300d}}) and \"There is a big problem in investigating all of a character set that exceeds 10000 characters.\" (original Japanese: {{lang|ja|\u300c1\u4e07\u5b57\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u6c34\u6e96\u306e\u6587\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u306e\u691c\u8a0e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u300d}})</ref> The character meanings and selection rationales were not properly documented, making it difficult to identify whether desired kanji corresponded to those in its repertoire.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup | url-status=dead | archive-date=2005-05-22 | title=JIS Character Sets \u2013 JIS X 0212:1990 | last=Marukawa | first=Kazushi}}</ref> The text of the fourth standard, as well as pointing out the problematic points of the character selection of JIS X 0212, states that \"it is thought that not only is character selection impossible, it is also impossible to use together; the connection to JIS X 0212 is not defined at all.\" (section 3.3.1)\n\n=== JIS X 0213 ===\n[[File:Euler diag for jp charsets.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] comparing repertoires of JIS X 0208, [[JIS X 0212]], [[JIS X 0213]], [[Windows-31J]], the Microsoft standard repertoire and [[Unicode]].]]\n[[JIS X 0213]] (extension kanji) defines a kanji set that expands upon the kanji set of JIS X 0208. According to this standard, it is \"designed with the goal being to offer a sufficient character set for the purposes of encoding the modern Japanese language that JIS X 0208 intended to be from the start.\"<ref name=\"goal\"/>\n\nThe kanji set of JIS X 0213 incorporates all characters that can be represented in the kanji set of JIS X 0208, with many additions. In total, JIS X 0213 defines 1183 non-kanji and 10,050 kanji (for a total of 11,233 characters), within two 94-by-94 {{nihongo|planes|\u9762|men}}. The first plane (non-kanji and level 1&ndash;3 kanji) is based on JIS X 0208, whereas the second plane (level 4 kanji) is designed to fit within the unallocated rows of JIS X 0212, allowing use in [[EUC-JP]].<ref name=\"python-eucjis\">{{cite web | url=https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/cjkcodecs/README | title=Readme for CJKCodecs | publisher=Python Software Foundation | work=cPython | last=Chang | first=Hyeshik}}</ref> JIS X 0213 also defines [[Shift JIS-2004|Shift_JISx0213]], a variant of Shift_JIS capable of encoding the entirety of JIS X 0213.\n\nFor most intents and purposes, JIS X 0213 plane 1 is a superset of JIS X 0208. However, different unification criteria are applied to some code points in JIS X 0213 compared to JIS X 0208. Consequently, some pairs of kanji glyphs that were represented by one JIS X 0208 code point, due to being unified, are given separate code points in JIS X 0213. For example, the glyph at row 33 cell 46 of JIS X 0208 (\"{{lang|ja|\u50e7}}\", described [[#Unification_of_kanji_variants|above]]) unifies a few variants due to its right-hand component. In JIS X 0213, two forms (the ones containing the component \"{{lang|ja|\u4e37}}\") are unified on plane 1 row 33 cell 46, and the other (containing the component \"{{lang|ja|\u516b}}\") is located at plane 1 row 14 cell 41. Therefore, whether JIS X 0208 row 33 cell 46 should be mapped to JIS X 0213 plane 1 row 33 cell 46 or plane 1 row 14 cell 41 cannot be determined automatically.{{efn|This is the same uncertainty as to whether the \"HYPHEN-MINUS\" in ISO/IEC 646 should be mapped to \"HYPHEN\" or \"MINUS SIGN\" in JIS X 0208.}} This limits the extent to which JIS X 0213 can be considered upwardly compatible with JIS X 0208, as admitted by the JIS X 0213 drafting committee.<ref>JIS X 0213:2000 section 5.3.2, JIS X 0213:2000 Appendix 1:2004 section 3.2.2</ref>\n\nHowever, for the most part, row ''m'' cell ''n'' in JIS X 0208 corresponds to plane 1 row ''m'' cell ''n'' in JIS X 0213; therefore, not much confusion arises in practice. This is because most typefaces have come to use the glyphs exemplified in JIS X 0208, and most users are not consciously aware of the unification criteria.\n\n=== ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===\nThe kanji set of JIS X 0208 is among the original source standards for the [[Han unification]] in [[ISO/IEC 10646]] (UCS) and [[Unicode]]. Every kanji in JIS X 0208 corresponds to its own code point in UCS/Unicode's [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP).\n\nThe non-kanji in JIS X 0208 also correspond to their own code points in the BMP.

The official title of the current standard is {{nihongo|'''7-bit and 8-bit double byte coded KANJI sets for information interchange'''|7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u53ca\u30738\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u6f22\u5b57\u96c6\u5408|Nana-Bitto Oyobi Hachi-Bitto no Ni-Baito J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Fug\u014dka Kanji Sh\u016bg\u014d}}. It was originally established as '''JIS C 6226''' in 1978, and has been revised in 1983, 1990, and 1997. It is also called '''Code page 952''' by IBM. The 1978 version is also called '''Code page 955''' by IBM.\n\n== Scope of use and compatibility ==\nThe character set JIS X 0208 establishes is primarily for the purpose of {{nihongo|'''information interchange'''|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db|j\u014dh\u014d k\u014dkan}} between data processing systems and the devices connected to them, or mutually between data communication systems. This character set can be used for data processing and text processing.\n\nPartial implementations of the character set are not considered compatible. Because there are places where such things have happened as the original drafting committee of the first standard taking care to separate characters between level 1 and level 2 and the second standard then shuffling some variant characters (\u7570\u4f53\u5b57, ''[[itaiji]]'') between the levels, at least in the first and second standards, it is conjectured that non-[[kanji]] and level 1-only implementation Japanese computer systems were at one time considered for development. However, such implementations have never been specified as compatible, though an example like the early [[NEC PC-9801]] did exist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2008/05/05/why-japan-didnt-create-the-ipod/ |date=2008-05-05 |title=\nWhy Japan didn't create the iPod |website=Gatunka}}</ref>\n\nEven though there are provisions in the JIS X 0208:1997 standard concerning compatibility, at the present time, it is generally considered that this standard neither certifies compatibility nor is it an official manufacturing standard that amounts to a declaration of self-compatibility.<ref>JIS X 0208 was not one of the standards included in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205155442/http://www.jisc.go.jp/newstopics/2006/070117new_jis_list.htm list of applicable target systems for display of the new JIS mark] announced by the [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] on 17 January 2007.</ref> Consequently, ''de facto'', JIS X 0208-\"compatible\" products are not considered to exist. Terminology such as {{nihongo|\"conformant\"|\u6e96\u62e0|junkyo}} and {{nihongo|\"support\"|\u5bfe\u5fdc|tai\u014d}} is included in JIS X 0208, but the semantics of these terms vary from person to person.\n\n== Code charts ==\n<!-- Note to editors:\nEUC (GR-delegated) forms are not included in the charts themselves because:\n\n(1) \"JIS encoding\" usually refers to ISO-2022-JP, not to EUC-JP or any superset thereof,\n(2) EUC-JP or any subset thereof is not usually called \"JIS X 0208\",\n(3) EUC-JP is eclipsed in usage by Shift_JIS.\n\nThis is in start contrast to both KS X 1001 and GB 2312, which are often used synonymously with their EUC forms, and for which EUC or EUC-superset encodings are vastly predominant.\n-->\n\n=== Lead byte ===\nThe first encoding byte corresponds to the row or cell number plus 0x20, or 32 in decimal (see below).

Including only a couple would be at best not particularly useful, and at worst misleading. As for including it in a separate article on Wikipedia, bear the concerns raised at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?type=delete&page=GB2312+Blocks in mind before attempting. -->\n\n== Code structure ==\nIn order to represent [[code point]]s, column/line numbers are used for one-byte codes and ''kuten'' numbers are used for two-byte codes. For a way to identify a character without depending on a code, character names are used.\n\n=== Single byte codes ===\nAlmost all JIS X 0208 [[graphic character]] codes are represented with two bytes of at least seven bits each. However, every [[control character]], as well as the plain [[whitespace character|space]] &ndash; although not the [[ideographic space]] &ndash; is represented with a one-byte code. In order to represent the {{nihongo|'''bit combination'''|\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u7d44\u5408\u305b|bitto kumiawase}} of a one-byte code, two decimal numbers \u2013 a '''column number''' and a '''line number''' \u2013 are used. Three high-order bits out of seven or four high-order bits out of eight, counting from zero to seven or from zero to fifteen respectively, form the column number. Four low-order bits counting from zero to fifteen form the line number. Each decimal number corresponds to one [[hexadecimal]] digit. For example, the bit combination corresponding to the graphic character \"space\" is 010 0000 as a 7-bit number, and 0010 0000 as an 8-bit number. In column/line notation, this is represented as 2/0. Other representations of the same single-byte code include 0x20 as hexadecimal, or 32 as a single decimal number.\n\n=== Code points and code numbers ===\nThe double-byte codes are laid out in 94 numbered groups, each called a {{nihongo|''row''|[[wikt:\u533a|\u533a]]|ku|lit. \"section\"}}. Every row contains 94 numbered codes, each called a {{nihongo|''cell''|[[wikt:\u70b9|\u70b9]]|ten|lit. \"point\"}}.{{efn|name=kuten}} This makes a total of 8836 (94 \u00d7 94) possible code points (although not all are assigned, see below); these are laid out in the standard in a 94-line, 94-column code table.\n\nA row number and a cell number (each numbered from 1 to 94) form a {{nihongo|'''kuten'''|[[wikt:\u533a\u70b9|\u533a\u70b9]]}} point, which is used to represent double-byte code points. A {{nihongo|code number or ''kuten'' number|\u533a\u70b9\u756a\u53f7|kuten bang\u014d}} is expressed in the form \"row-cell\", the row and cell numbers being separated by a [[hyphen]]. For example, the character \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u4e9c|\u4e9c]]}}\" has a code point at row 16, cell 1, so its code number is represented as \"16-01\".\n\nIn 7-bit JIS X 0208 (as might be switched to in JIS X 0202 / [[ISO-2022-JP]]), both bytes must be from the 94-byte range of [[hexadecimal|0x]]21 (used for row or cell number 1) through 0x7E (used for row or cell number 94) &ndash; exactly corresponding to the range used for 7-bit ASCII printing characters, not counting the space. Accordingly, the encoded bytes are obtained by adding 0x20 (16) to each number.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/JIS/JIS0208.TXT |title=JIS X 0208 (1990) to Unicode |author=Unicode, Inc. |date=2011-10-14}}</ref> For instance, the above example of 16-01 (\"\u4e9c\") would be represented by the bytes <code>0x30 0x21</code>. The 8-bit [[EUC-JP]] instead uses the range 0xA1 through 0xFE (setting the high bit to 1), whereas other encodings such as [[Shift JIS]] use more complicated transforms.\n\nThis structure is also used in the Mainland Chinese [[GB 2312]] (where it is natively known as {{lang-zh|s=[[wikt:\u5340\u4f4d|\u533a\u4f4d]]|hp=q\u016bw\u00e8i|labels=no}}) and the South Korean KS C 5601 (currently [[KS X 1001]]; the ''ku'' and ''ten'' are respectively known as ''hang'' and ''yol'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/OBSOLETE/EASTASIA/KSC/KSX1001.TXT |title=KSX1001.TXT: KS X 1001 to Unicode table |author=Jungshik Shin |publisher=Unicode, Inc |date=2011-10-14}}</ref> The later [[JIS X 0213]] extends this structure by having more than one {{nihongo|plane|[[wikt:\u9762|\u9762]]|men|lit. \"face\"}} of rows, which is also the structure used by [[CNS 11643]].\n\n=== Unassigned code points ===\nAmong the 2-byte codes, rows 9 to 15 and 85 to 94 are {{nihongo|'''unassigned code points'''|\u7a7a\u304d\u9818\u57df|aki ry\u014diki}}; that is, they are code points with no characters assigned to them. Also, some cells in other rows are also essentially unassigned code points.\n\nThese empty areas contain code points that should basically not be used. Except when there is prior agreement among the relevant parties, characters ([[gaiji]]) for information interchange should not be assigned to the unassigned code points.\n\nEven when assigning characters to unassigned code points, graphic characters defined in the standard should not be assigned to them, and the same character should not be assigned to multiple unassigned code points; characters should not be duplicated in the set.\n\nFurthermore, when assigning characters to unassigned code points, it is necessary to be cautious of [[Han unification|unification]] in regards to kanji glyphs. For example, row 25 cell 66 corresponds to the kanji meaning \"high\" or \"expensive\"; both the form with a component resembling the \"mouth\" character ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u53e3|\u53e3]]}}) in the middle ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9ad8|\u9ad8]]}}) and the less common form with a ladder-like construction in the same location ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9ad9|\u9ad9]]}}) are subsumed into the same code point. Consequently, limiting point 25-66 to the \"mouth\" form and assigning the latter \"ladder\" form to an unassigned code point would technically be in violation of the standard.\n\nIn practice, however, several vendor-specific [[Shift JIS]] variants, including [[Windows-932]] and [[MacJapanese]], encode vendor extensions in unallocated rows of the encoding space for JIS X 0208. Also, most of the codes unassigned in JIS X 0208 are assigned by the newer [[JIS X 0213]] standard.\n\n=== Character names ===\n{{see also|Unicode character property#Name}}\nEach JIS X 0208 character is given a '''name'''. By using a character's name, it is possible to identify characters without relying on their codes. The names of characters are coordinated with other character set standards, notably the [[Universal Coded Character Set]] (UCS/[[Unicode]]), so this is one possible source of character mappings to character sets such as Unicode. For example, both the character at [[ISO/IEC 646]] International Reference Version ([[US-ASCII]]) column 4 line 1 and the one at JIS X 0208 row 3 cell 33 have the name \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\". Therefore, the character at 4/1 in ASCII and the character at 3-33 in JIS X 0208 can be regarded as the same character (although, in practice, [[Halfwidth and fullwidth forms|alternative mapping]] is used for the JIS X 0208 character due to encodings providing ASCII separately). Conversely, ASCII characters 2/2 (quotation mark), 2/7 (apostrophe), 2/13 (hyphen-minus), and 7/14 (tilde) can be determined to be characters that do not exist in this standard.\n\nCharacter names of non-kanji characters use uppercase Roman letters, spaces, and hyphens. Non-kanji characters are given a {{nihongo|Japanese-language common name|\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u901a\u7528\u540d\u79f0|Nihongo ts\u016by\u014d meish\u014d}}, but some provisions for these names do not exist.{{efn|Character names are given in Roman letters and are used internationally, so they can be considered an international convention, somewhat like the [[binomial nomenclature|scientific name]]s of living organisms. In regard to this analogy, the Japanese common names for the characters would be like using [[common name]]s for organisms.}} The names of kanji, on the other hand, are mechanically set according to the corresponding hexadecimal representation of their code in UCS/Unicode. The name of a kanji can be arrived at by prepending the Unicode codepoint with \"CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-\". For example, row 16 cell 1 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u4e9c|\u4e9c]]}}) corresponds to U+4E9C in UCS, so the name of it would be \"CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-4E9C\". Kanji are not given Japanese common names.\n\n== Kanji set ==\n\n=== Overview ===\nJIS X 0208 prescribes a set of 6879 graphical characters that correspond to two-byte codes with either seven or eight bits to the byte; in JIS X 0208, this is called the {{nihongo|'''kanji set'''|\u6f22\u5b57\u96c6\u5408|kanji sh\u016bg\u014d}}, which includes 6355 kanji as well as 524 {{nihongo|'''non-kanji'''|\u975e\u6f22\u5b57|hikanji}}, including characters such as [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]], [[kana]], and so forth.\n\n;Special characters\n:Occupies rows 1 and 2. There are 18 {{nihongo|'''descriptor symbols'''|\u8a18\u8ff0\u8a18\u53f7|kijutsu kig\u014d}} such as the \"ideographic space\" ([[wikt:|\u3000]]), and the Japanese [[Japanese punctuation#Comma|comma]] and [[Japanese punctuation#Full stop|period]]; eight '''[[Diacritic|diacritical marks]]''' such as [[dakuten|dakuten and handakuten]]; 10 characters for {{nihongo|'''things that follow kana or kanji'''|\u4eee\u540d\u53c8\u306f\u6f22\u5b57\u306b\u6e96\u3058\u308b\u3082\u306e|kana mata wa kanji ni junjiru mono}} such as the [[Iteration mark]]; 22 {{nihongo|'''bracket symbols'''|\u62ec\u5f27\u8a18\u53f7|kakko kig\u014d}}; 45 {{nihongo|'''mathematical symbols'''|\u5b66\u8853\u8a18\u53f7|gakujutsu kig\u014d}}; and 32 '''unit symbols''', which includes the [[currency sign]] and the [[Japan postal mark|postal mark]], for a total of 147 characters.\n;[[Numerical digit|Numerals]]\n:Occupies part of row 3. The ten digits from \"0\" to \"9\".\n;[[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]]\n:Occupies part of row 3. The 26 letters of the English alphabet in uppercase and lowercase form for a total of 52.\n;[[Hiragana]]\n:Occupies row 4. Contains 48 unvoiced kana (including the obsolete ''[[Wi (kana)|wi]]'' and ''[[We (kana)|we]]''), 20 voiced kana ([[dakuten]]), 5 semi-voiced kana ([[dakuten|handakuten]]), 10 small kana for palatalized and assimilated sounds, for a total of 83 characters.\n;[[Katakana]]\n:Occupies row 5. There are 86 characters; in addition to the katakana equivalents of the hiragana characters, the [[small ke|small ''ka''/''ke'']] kana ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30f5|\u30f5]]}}/{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30f6|\u30f6]]}}) and the ''[[u (kana)|vu]]'' kana ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u30f4|\u30f4]]}}).\n;[[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]]\n:Occupies row 6. The 24 letters of the Greek alphabet in uppercase and lowercase form (minus the final [[sigma]]) for a total of 48.\n;[[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic letters]]\n:Occupies row 7. The 33 letters of the [[Russian alphabet]] in uppercase and lowercase form for a total of 66.\n;[[Box-drawing character]]s\n:Occupies row 8. Thin segments, thick segments, and mixed thin and thick segments, 32 total.\n;[[Kanji]]\n:The 2965 characters of {{nihongo|'''level 1'''|\u7b2c1\u6c34\u6e96|dai ichi suijun}} from row 16 to row 47, and the 3390 characters of {{nihongo|'''level 2'''|\u7b2c2\u6c34\u6e96|dai ni suijun}} from row 48 to row 84 for a total of 6355.\n\n=== Special characters, numerals, and Latin characters ===\nAs for the special characters in the kanji set, some characters from the graphic character set of the International Reference Version (IRV) of [[ISO/IEC 646]]:1991 (equivalent to [[ASCII]]) are absent from JIS X 0208. There are the aforementioned four characters \"QUOTATION MARK\", \"APOSTROPHE\", \"HYPHEN-MINUS\", and \"TILDE\". The former three are split into different code points in the kanji set (Nishimura, 1978; JIS X 0221-1:2001 standard, Section 3.8.7). The \"TILDE\" of IRV has no corresponding character in the kanji set.\n\nIn the following table, the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV characters in question are compared with their multiple equivalents in JIS X 0208, except for the IRV character \"TILDE\", which is compared with the \"WAVE DASH\" of JIS X 0208. The entries under the \"Symbol\" columns utilize UCS/Unicode code points, so the specifics of display may differ.\n\nThe ASCII/IRV characters without exact JIS X 0208 equivalents were later assigned code points by [[#Future|JIS X 0213]], these are also listed below, as are [[Windows-31J|Microsoft's mapping]] of the four characters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Non-strict correspondence between ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV (ASCII) and JIS X 0208\n!colspan=\"5\"|ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV\n!colspan=\"3\"|JIS X 0208\n|-\n!Column/Line\n!x0213<ref name=\"x02132004m1\">[https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/233.pdf ISO-IR-233 (JIS X 0213:2004 plane 1) code chart]</ref>\n!Microsoft\n!Symbol\n!Name\n!''Kuten''\n!Symbol\n!Name\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2/2\n|rowspan=\"4\"|1-2-16\n|rowspan=\"4\"|92-94{{efn-ua|name=w31jnec|1=From \"NEC selection of IBM extensions\".

Character 1-2-18 in JIS X 0213 is shown as a tilde accent in the code chart.<ref name=\"x02132004m1\" />}}\n|}\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\nThis means that the kanji set is the most widespread non-upward-compatible character set in the world; it is counted as one of the weak points of this standard.\n\nEven with the 90 special characters, numerals, and Latin letters the kanji set and the IRV set have in common, this standard does not follow the arrangement of ISO/IEC 646. These 90 characters are split between rows 1 (punctuation) and 3 (letters and numbers), although row 3 does follow ISO 646 arrangement for the 62 letters and numbers alone (e.g. <code>4/1</code> (\"A\") in ISO 646 becomes <code>2/3 4/1</code> (i.e. 3-33) in JIS X 0208).\n\nAs to the cause of how these numerals, Latin letters, and so forth in the kanji set are the {{nihongo|\"full-width alphanumeric characters\"|\u5168\u89d2\u82f1\u6570\u5b57|zenkaku eis\u016bji}} and how the original implementation came forth with a differing interpretation compared to the IRV, it is thought that it is due to these incompatibilities.\n\nEver since the first standard, it has been possible to represent {{nihongo|'''composites'''|\u5408\u6210|g\u014dsei}} such as [[Enclosed Alphanumerics|encircled numbers]], ligatures for measurement unit names, and [[Roman numerals]];<ref>JIS C 6225-1979 (control character codes for the purpose of the Japanese graphic character set for information interchange) provided control characters for the beginning and end of composition. JIS C 6225 was re-termed [[JIS X 0207]] in 1987, and was withdrawn in 1997.</ref> they were not given independent ''kuten'' code points. Although individual companies that manufacture information systems can make an effort to represent these characters as customers may require by the composition of the characters, none has requested to have them added to the standard, instead choosing to proprietarily offer them as [[gaiji]].\n\nIn the fourth standard (1997), all these characters were explicitly defined as characters that accompany an advancement of the current position; that is to say, they are '''spacing characters'''. Furthermore, it was ruled that they should not be made by the composition of characters. For this reason, it became disallowed to represent Latin characters with [[diacritic]]s at all, with possibly the sole exception of the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] symbol ([[\u00c5]]) at row 2 cell 82.\n\n=== Hiragana and katakana ===\nThe [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] in JIS X 0208, unlike [[JIS X 0201]], includes [[dakuten]] and [[handakuten]] markings as part of a character. The katakana {{nihongo3||\u30f0|[[wi (kana)|wi]]}} and {{nihongo3||\u30f1|[[we (kana)|we]]}} (both obsolete in modern Japanese) as well as the small {{nihongo3||\u30ee|[[wa (kana)|wa]]}}, not in JIS X 0201, are also included.\n\nThe arrangement of kana in JIS X 0208 is different from the arrangement of katakana in JIS X 0201. In JIS X 0201, the syllabary starts with {{nihongo3||\u30f2|[[wo (kana)|wo]]}}, followed by the small kana sorted by ''[[goj\u016bon]]'' order, followed by the full-size kana, also in ''goj\u016bon'' order ({{lang|ja|\u30f2\u30a1\u30a3\u30a5\u30a7\u30a9\u30e3\u30e5\u30e7\u30c3\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4\u30a6\u30a8\u30aa......\u30e9\u30ea\u30eb\u30ec\u30ed\u30ef\u30f3}}). On the other hand, in JIS X 0208, the kana are sorted first by ''goj\u016bon'' order, then in the order of \"small kana, full-size kana, kana with dakuten, and kana with handakuten\" such that the same fundamental kana is grouped with its derivatives ({{lang|ja|\u3041\u3042\u3043\u3044\u3045\u3046\u3047\u3048\u3049\u304a......\u3063\u3064\u3065......\u306f\u3070\u3071\u3072\u3073\u3074\u3075\u3076\u3077\u3078\u3079\u307a\u307b\u307c\u307d......\u308e\u308f\u3090\u3091\u3092\u3093}}). This ordering was chosen in order to more simply facilitate the sorting of kana-based dictionary look-ups (Yasuoka, 2006).{{efn|For a fully featured kana-order search or sort, word readings, repetition marks, and so forth must be taken into account. The sorting of Japanese character strings is prescribed in [[JIS X 4061]] (Collation of Japanese character strings).}}\n\nAs mentioned above, in this standard, the previously defined katakana order in JIS X 0201 was not followed in JIS X 0208. It is thought that the JIS X 0201 katakana being \"[[half-width kana]]\" arose due to the incompatibility with the katakana of this standard. This point is also one of the weaknesses of this standard.\n\n=== Kanji ===\nHow the kanji in this standard were chosen from what sources, why they are split into level 1 and level 2, and how they are arranged are all explained in detail in the fourth standard (1997). Per that explanation, the kanji included in the following four kanji listings were reflected in the 6349 characters of the first standard (1978).\n\n*{{nihongo|'''Kanji Listing for Standard Code (Tentative)'''|\u6a19\u6e96\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u8868 (\u8a66\u6848)|Hy\u014djun K\u014ddo-y\u014d Kanjihy\u014d (Shian)}}\n:The [[Information Processing Society of Japan]] kanji code committee compiled this list in 1971.

For data for the purpose of selection, the Agency made a report which, starting with the \"Kanji Listing for Standard Code (Tentative)\", contrasted several kanji listings, the {{nihongo|\"Correspondence Analysis Results and Frequency of Use of Kanji for Administrative Data Processing Use Normal Kanji Selection\"|\u884c\u653f\u60c5\u5831\u51e6\u7406\u7528\u6a19\u6e96\u6f22\u5b57\u9078\u5b9a\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6f22\u5b57\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u983b\u5ea6\u304a\u3088\u3073\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5206\u6790\u7d50\u679c|Gy\u014dsei J\u014dh\u014d Shoriy\u014d Kihon Kanji Sentei no Tame no Kanji no Shiy\u014d Hindo Oyobi Tai\u014d Bunseki Kekka}}, or {{nihongo|\"Correspondence Analysis Results\"|\u5bfe\u5fdc\u5206\u6790\u7d50\u679c|Tai\u014d Bunseki Kekka}} for short.\n*{{nihongo|'''Japanese Personality Registration Name Kanji'''|\u65e5\u672c\u751f\u547d\u53ce\u5bb9\u4eba\u540d\u6f22\u5b57|Nihon Seimei Sh\u016by\u014d Jinmei Kanji}}\n:One of the kanji listings that compose the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\", consisting of 3044 characters.

They are the kanji used in the list of all administrative place names compiled by the [[Japan Geographic Data Center]], the {{nihongo|\"National Administrative District Listing\"|\u56fd\u571f\u884c\u653f\u533a\u753b\u7dcf\u89a7|Kokudo Gy\u014dsei Kukaku S\u014dran}}. The original drafting committee did not investigate the listing itself; the kanji used from this list followed the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\".\n\nIn the second and third standards, they added four and two characters to level 2, respectively, bringing the total kanji to 6355. Also, in the second standard, character forms were changed as well as transposition among the levels; in the third standard as well, character forms were changed. These are described further below.\n\n==== Level partitioning ====\nThe 2,965 Level 1 kanji occupy rows 16 to 47. The 3,390 Level 2 kanji occupy rows 48 to 84.\n\nFor level 1, characters common to multiple kanji glyph listings were chosen, using the [[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]], the t\u014dy\u014d kanji correction draft, and the [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]] as a basis. Also, JIS C 6260 (\"To-Do-Fu-Ken (Prefecture) Identification Code\"; currently [[JIS X 0401]]) and JIS C 6261 (\"Identification code for cities, towns and villages\"; currently [[JIS X 0402]]) were consulted; kanji for nearly all Japanese [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], cities, districts, wards, towns, villages, and so forth were intentionally placed in level 1.{{efn|According to Yasuoka (2001a), it seems there were some accidental oversights. He notes, for example, that the {{nihongo3||\u65db|ba|58-57}} of [[Inba District, Chiba|Inba]] and the {{nihongo3||\u6cd7|shi|61-89}} of [[Shisui, Kumamoto]] are not part of level 1.}} Furthermore, amendments by experts were added.\n\nLevel 2 was dedicated to kanji that made an appearance in the aforementioned four major listings but were not selected for level 1. As noted below, the kanji of level 1 were ordered by their pronunciation, so among the kanji whose pronunciation were difficult to determine, there were those that were transferred from level 1 to level 2 on that basis (Nishimura, 1978).\n\nDue to these decisions, for the most part, level 1 contains more frequently used kanji, and level 2 contains more infrequently used kanji, but of course, those were judged by the standards of the day; over the passage of time, some level 2 kanji have become more frequently used, such as one meaning \"to soar\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7fd4|\u7fd4]]}}) and one meaning \"to glitter\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u714c|\u714c]]}}); and inversely, some level 1 kanji have become infrequent, notably the ones meaning \"centimeter\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7cce|\u7cce]]}}) and \"millimeter\" ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7c8d|\u7c8d]]}}). Also, a few jinmeiy\u014d kanji, being added after the kanji set was defined, fall into level 2.\n\n==== Arrangement ====\nThe kanji in level 1 are sorted in order of each one's \"representative reading\" (i.e. a canonical reading chosen for the purposes of this standard only); the reading of a kanji for this may be an [[on'yomi|''on'']] or a [[kun'yomi|''kun'']] reading; readings are sorted in [[goj\u016bon]] order.{{efn|For row 19 cells 30 and 31, the order is mixed up for their representative readings. Consequently, where the correct order should be {{nihongo3|\"frog\"|[[wikt:\u86d9|\u86d9]]|kaeru}} followed by {{nihongo3|\"aroma\"|[[wikt:\u99a8|\u99a8]]|kaori}}, their positions are transposed so that ''kaori'' precedes ''kaeru''.}} As a general rule, the ''on'' (Chinese-sound) reading is considered the representative reading; where a kanji has multiple ''on'' readings, the reading judged to be predominant in use frequency is used for the representative reading (JIS C 6226-1978 standard, Section 3.4). For the small percentage of kanji that either do not have an ''on'' reading or have an ''on'' reading which is little known and not in common use, the ''kun'' reading was employed as the representative reading. Where a verb ''kun'' reading must be used as the representative reading, the ''[[wikt:\u9023\u7528\u5f62|ren'y\u014dkei]]'' (rather than the ''[[wikt:\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62|sh\u016bshikei]]'') form is used.\n\nFor example, cells 1 to 41 on row 16 are 41 characters sorted as starting with a reading of ''[[a (kana)|a]]''. Within these, 22 characters, including 16-10 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u8475|\u8475]]}}: ''on'' reading \"''ki''\"; ''kun'' reading \"''aoi''\") and 16-32 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7c9f|\u7c9f]]}}: ''on'' readings \"''zoku''\" and \"''shoku''\"; ''kun'' reading \"''awa''\") are there on the basis of their ''kun'' readings. 16-09 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9022|\u9022]]}}: ''on'' reading \"''h\u014d''\", ''kun'' reading \"''a(i)''\") and 16-23 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6271|\u6271]]}}: ''on'' readings \"''s\u014d''\" and \"''ky\u016b''\", ''kun'' reading \"''atsuka(i)''\") are just two examples of ''ren'y\u014dkei''-form verbs used for the representative reading.\n\nWhere the representative reading is the same between different kanji, a kanji that uses an ''on'' reading is placed ahead of one that uses a ''kun'' reading. Where the ''on'' or ''kun'' readings are the same between more than one kanji, they are then ordered by their [[Section headers of a Chinese dictionary|primary radical]] and [[stroke (CJK character)|stroke]] count.\n\nWhether on level 1 or level 2, [[itaiji]] are arranged to directly follow their exemplar form. For example, in level 2, right after row 49 cell 88 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u528d|\u528d]]}}), the immediately following characters deviate from the general rule (stroke count in this case) to include three variants of 49-88 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5294|\u5294]]}}, {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5292|\u5292]]}}, and {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5271|\u5271]]}}).{{efn|In addition, the primarily used variant ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5263|\u5263]]}}) is at row 23 cell 85 on level 1, and one other variant ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u91fc|\u91fc]]}}) can be found grouped as having the [[radical 167|\"gold\" radical]] at row 78 cell 63 on level 2.}}\n\nThe kanji in level 2 are arranged in order of primary radical and stroke count. Where these two properties are the same for different kanji, they are then sorted by reading.\n\n==== Kanji from unknown sources ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin: 0.5em 0px 0.5em 1em;\"\n|+Kanji for which sources are unclear, unknown, or otherwise un&shy;iden&shy;ti&shy;fiable in JIS X 0208:1997 Appendix 7\n!''Kuten''\n!Symbol\n!Classi&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion\n|-\n|52-55\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u58b8}}\n|Unknown\n|-\n|52-63\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u58e5}}\n|Unknown\n|-\n|54-12\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u599b}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|55-27\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u5f41}}\n|Un&shy;iden&shy;ti&shy;fiable\n|-\n|57-43\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u6327}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|58-83\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u6683}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|59-91\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u6922}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|60-57\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u69de}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|74-12\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u87d0}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|74-57\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u88ae}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|79-64\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u95a0}}\n|Source unclear\n|-\n|81-50\n|style=\"text-align: center\"|{{lang|ja|\u99f2}}\n|Source unclear\n|}\nIt has been pointed out that there are kanji in the kanji set that are not found in comprehensive, unabridged kanji dictionaries, and that the sources thereof are unknown. For example, only one year after the first standard was established, Tajima (1979) reported that he had confirmed 63 kanji that were not to be found in ''Shinjigen'' (a large kanji dictionary published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]]), nor in ''[[Dai Kan-Wa jiten]]'', and they did not make sense as [[ryakuji]] of any sort; he noted that it would be preferable for kanji not available in kanji dictionaries to be selected from definite sources. These kanji came to be known as {{nihongo|\"ghost\" characters|\u5e7d\u970a\u6587\u5b57|y\u016brei moji}} or {{nihongo|\"ghost kanji\"|\u5e7d\u970a\u6f22\u5b57|y\u016brei kanji}}, among other names.\n\nThe drafting committee for the fourth version of the standard also saw the existence of kanji with sources unknown as a problem, and so made an inquiry into just what kind of sources the drafting committee of the first version referenced. As a result, it was discovered that the original drafting committee had heavily relied on the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\" to collect kanji. When the drafting committee investigated the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\", it became clear that many of the kanji included in the kanji set but not found in exhaustive kanji dictionaries supposedly came from the \"Japanese Personality Registration Name Kanji\" and \"Kanji for National Administrative District Listing\" lists mentioned in the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\".\n\nIt was confirmed that no original text for the \"Japanese Personality Registration Name Kanji\" referenced in the \"Correspondence Analysis Results\" exists. For the \"National Administrative District Listing\", [[Sasahara Hiroyuki]] of the fourth version's drafting committee examined the kanji that appeared on the in-progress development pages for the first standard. The committee also consulted many ancient writings, as well as many examples of personal names in a database of [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] phone books.\n\nDue to this thorough investigation, the committee was able to pare down the number of kanji for which the source cannot be confidently explained to twelve, shown on the adjacent table. Of these, it is conjectured that several glyphs came about due to copying errors. In particular, \u599b was probably created when printers tried to create \ud845\udeb4 by cutting and pasting \u5c71 and \u5973 together. A shadow from that process was misinterpreted as a line, resulting in \u599b (a picture of this can be found in the ''J\u014dy\u014d kanji jiten'').\n\n==== Unification of kanji variants ====\nAccording to the specifications in the fourth standard (1997), {{nihongo|'''unification'''|\u5305\u6442|h\u014dsetsu|not the same term used for [[Unicode]]'s \"[[Han unification|unification]]\" although it is nearly the same concept}} is the action of giving the same code point to a character without regard to its different character forms. In the fourth standard, the [[glyph]]s allowed are limited; the extent to which particular [[allograph]]ic glyphs are unified into a [[grapheme|graphemic]] code point is clearly defined.\n\nFurthermore, according to the specifications in the standard, a {{nihongo|'''glyph'''|[[wikt:\u5b57\u4f53|\u5b57\u4f53]]|jitai|lit. \"character body\"; }} is an abstract notion as to the graphical representation of a graphic character; a {{nihongo|'''character form'''|[[wikt:\u5b57\u5f62|\u5b57\u5f62]]|jikei|lit. \"character shape\"; also a \"glyph\" in a sense, but differentiated on a different level for standardization purposes}} is the representation as a graphical shape that a glyph takes in actuality (e.g. due to a glyph being handwritten, printed, displayed on a screen, etc.). For a single glyph, there exist an endless range of possible concretely and/or visibly different character forms. A variation between a character form of one glyph is termed a {{nihongo|\"design difference\"|\u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3\u306e\u5dee|dezain no sa}}.\n\nThe extent to which a glyph is unified to one code point is determined according to that code point's {{nihongo|\"example glyph\"|\u4f8b\u793a\u5b57\u4f53|reiji jitai}} and the {{nihongo|\"unification criteria\"|\u5305\u6442\u898f\u6e96|h\u014dsetsu kijun}} that can be applied to that example glyph; that is, the example glyph for a code point applies to that code point, and any glyphs for which the parts that compose the example glyph are replaced in accordance with the unification criteria ''also'' apply to that code point.\n\n<!-- TODO: make SVG diagram for people who don't have nice and proper multilingual font setups -->\nFor example, the example glyph at 33-46 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u50e7|\u50e7]]}}) is composed of [[radical 9]] ({{lang|ja|\u4ebb}}) and the kanji that eventually spawned the both the ''[[so (kana)|so]]'' kana ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u66fd|\u66fd]]}}). Also, in unification criterion 101, there are three kanji displayed: the first takes the form most often seen in Japanese ({{lang|ja|\u66fd}}); the second contains a more traditional form ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u66fe|\u66fe]]}}) in which the first two strokes form [[radical 12]] (the kanji numeral for the number 8: {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u516b|\u516b]]}}); and the third is like the second, except that radical 12 is inverted ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u66fe}}). Consequently, all three permutations ({{lang|ja|\u50e7}}, {{lang|ja|\u50e7}}, {{lang|zh-Hans|\u50e7}}) all apply to the code point at line 33 cell 46.\n\nIn the fourth standard, including one of the [[errata]] for the first printing, there are 186 unification criteria.\n\nWhen a code point's example glyph is composed of more than one part glyph, unification criteria can be applied to each part. After a unification criterion is applied to one part glyph, that part cannot have any more unification criteria applied to it. Also, a unification criterion is not allowed to apply if the resulting glyph would coincide with that of another code point entirely.\n\nAn example glyph is no more than an example for that code point; it is not a glyph \"endorsed\" by the standard. Also, the unification criteria need only be used for generally used kanji and for the purpose of assigning things to the code points of this standard. The standard requests that generally unused kanji not be created based on the example glyphs and unification criteria.\n\nThe kanji of the kanji set are not chosen completely consistently according to the unification criteria. For example, although 41-7 corresponds to the form where the third and fourth strokes cross ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5f65|\u5f65]]}}) as well as the form where they don't ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5f66|\u5f66]]}}) according to unification criterion 72, 20-73 only corresponds to the form where they do not cross ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u9854|\u9854]]}}), and 80-90 only corresponds to the form where they do ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u984f|\u984f]]}}).\n\nThe terms \"unification\", \"unification criteria\", and \"example glyph\" were adopted in the fourth standard. From the first to the third version, kanji and relations between kanji were grouped into three types: {{nihongo|\"independent\"|\u72ec\u7acb|dokuritsu}}, {{nihongo|\"compatible\"|\u5bfe\u5fdc|tai\u014d}}, and {{nihongo|\"equivalent\"|\u540c\u5024|d\u014dchi}}; it was explained that the characters recognized as equivalent \"consolidate to just one point\". \"Equivalence\" included, other than kanji with exactly the same shape, kanji with differences due to style, and kanji where the difference in character form is small.\n\nIn the first standard, it was stipulated that \"this standard ... does not establish the particulars of character forms\" (Section 3.1); it also states that \"the aim of this standard is to establish the general idea of characters and their codes; the design of their character forms and such lie outside its scope.\" In the second and third standards as well, notes to the effect that specific designs of character forms lie outside its scope (the note on item 1). The fourth standard also stipulates that \"This standard regulates graphic characters as well as their bit patterns, and the use, specific designs of individual characters, and so forth are not within the scope of this standard\" (JIS X 0208:1997, item 1).\n\n==== Unification criteria for compatibility ====\nIn the fourth standard, {{nihongo|\"unification criteria for maintaining compatibility with previous standards\"|\u904e\u53bb\u306e\u898f\u683c\u3068\u306e\u4e92\u63db\u6027\u3092\u7dad\u6301\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e\u5305\u6442\u898f\u6e96|kako no kikaku to no gokansei wo iji suru tame no h\u014dsetsu kijun}} is defined. Their application is limited to 29 code points whose glyphs vary greatly between the standards JIS C 6226-1983 on and after and JIS C 6226-1978. For those 29 code points, the glyphs from JIS C 6226-1983 on and after are displayed as \"A\", and the glyphs from JIS C 6226-1978 as \"B\". On each of them, both \"A\" and \"B\" glyphs may be applied. However, in order to claim compatibility with the standard, whether the \"A\" or \"B\" form has been used for each code point must be explicitly noted.\n\n== Character encodings ==\n\n=== Encoding schemes stipulated by JIS X 0208 ===\nIn JIS X 0208:1997, article 7 combined with appendices 1 and 2 define a total of eight encoding schemes.\n\nIn the descriptions below, the \"CL\" (control left), \"GL\" (graphic left), \"CR\" (control right), and \"GR\" (graphic right) regions are respectively, in column/line notation, from 0/0 to 1/15, from 2/1 to 7/14, from 8/0 to 9/15, and from 10/1 to 15/14. For each code, 2/0 is assigned the graphic character \"SPACE\" and 7/15 the control character \"DELETE\". The [[C0 control characters]] (defined in [[JIS X 0211]] and matching [[ISO/IEC 6429]]) are assigned to the CL region.\n\n;7-bit encoding for kanji\n:Stipulated in the standard itself. The JIS X 0208 double-byte set is assigned to the GL region.\n;8-bit encoding for kanji\n:Stipulated in the standard itself. Same as the 7-bit encoding, but defined in terms of 8-bit bytes. The CR region may be unused, or encode the [[C1 control code set|C1 control characters]] from JIS X 0211. The GR region is unused.\n;International Reference Version + 7-bit encoding for kanji\n:Stipulated in the standard itself. The [[shift in]] control character designates the [[ISO/IEC 646]]:1991 IRV (International Reference Version, equivalent to [[US-ASCII]]) to the GL region. [[Shift out]] designates the JIS X 0208 double-byte set to the same region.\n;Latin characters + 7-bit encoding for kanji\n:Stipulated in the standard itself. As with IRV+7-bit, but with ISO/IEC 646:IRV replaced with [[JISCII|ISO/IEC 646:JP]] (the Roman set of [[JIS X 0201]]).\n;International Reference Version + 8-bit encoding for kanji\n:Stipulated in the standard itself. ISO/IEC 646:IRV is assigned to the GL region, JIS X 0208 to the GR region.

Resembles [[ISO-2022-JP]] (which is authoritatively defined in <nowiki>RFC 1468</nowiki>) but is defined in terms of eight-bit bytes, whereas ISO-2022-JP is defined in terms of seven-bit bytes.\n\nAmong the encodings stipulated in the fourth standard, only the \"Shift\" coded character set is registered by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]].<ref>In the IANA [http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets character sets], Shift JIS is defined by referring to JIS X 0208:1997 Appendix 1.</ref> However, certain others are closely related to IANA-registered encodings defined elsewhere (EUC-JP and ISO-2022-JP).\n\n=== Escape sequences for JIS X 0202 / ISO 2022 ===\nJIS X 0208 may be used within [[ISO 2022]]/JIS X 0202 (of which ISO-2022-JP is a subset). The [[escape sequence]]s to designate JIS X 0208 to each of the four ISO 2022 code sets are listed below. Here, \"ESC\" refers to the control character \"[[ANSI escape code|Escape]]\" (0x1B, or 1/11).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ISO 2022 escape sequences to select JIS C 6226 and JIS X 0208\n!Standard\n!G0\n!G1\n!G2\n!G3\n|-\n!78\n|ESC 2/4 4/0\n|ESC 2/4 2/9 4/0\n|ESC 2/4 2/10 4/0\n|ESC 2/4 2/11 4/0\n|-\n!83\n|ESC 2/4 4/2\n|ESC 2/4 2/9 4/2\n|ESC 2/4 2/10 4/2\n|ESC 2/4 2/11 4/2\n|-\n!90 onward\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 4/2\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 2/9 4/2\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 2/10 4/2\n|ESC 2/6 4/0 ESC 2/4 2/11 4/2\n|-\n|}\n\nThe escape sequence starting ESC 2/4 selects a multi-byte character set. The escape sequence starting ESC 2/6 specifies a revision of the upcoming character set selection. JIS C 6226:1978 is identified by the multibyte-94-set identifier byte 4/0 (corresponding to ASCII <code>@</code>). JIS C 6226:1983 / JIS X 0208:1983 is identified by the multibyte-94-set identifier byte 4/2 (<code>B</code>). JIS X 0208:1990 is also identified by the 94-set identifier byte 4/2, but can be distinguished with the revision identifier 4/0 (<code>@</code>).\n\n=== Duplicate encodings of ASCII and JIS X 0201 ===\n{{further|Halfwidth and fullwidth forms|Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms (Unicode block)}}\nWhen using the kanji set of this standard with either the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV graphic character set ([[ASCII]]) or JIS X 0201's graphic character set for Latin characters ([[JIS-Roman]]), the treatment of the characters common to both sets becomes problematic. Unless one takes special measures, the characters included in both sets do not all map to each other one-to-one, and a single character may be given more than one code point; that is, it may cause a duplicate encoding.\n\nJIS X 0208:1997, in regards to when a character is common to both sets, basically forbids the use of the code point in the kanji set (which is one of two code points), eliminating duplicate encodings. It is judged that characters that have the same name are the same character.\n\nFor example, both the name of the character corresponding to the bit pattern 4/1 in ASCII and the name of the character corresponding to row 3 cell 33 of the kanji set are \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\". In International Reference Version + 8-bit code for kanji, whether by the bit pattern 4/1 or by the bit pattern corresponding to the kanji set's row 3 cell 33 (10/3 12/1), the letter \"[[A]]\" (i.e. \"LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A\") is represented. The standard forbids the use of the \"10/3 12/1\" bit pattern, in an attempt to eliminate the duplicate encoding.\n\nIn consideration to implementations that treat the characters of the code points in the kanji set as \"[[fullwidth form|full-width characters]]\" and those of ASCII or JIS-Roman as different characters, the use of the kanji set code points is permitted only for the sake of backwards compatibility. For example, for the purpose of backwards compatibility, it is permitted to consider 10/3 12/1 in International Reference Version + 8-bit code for kanji to correspond to a full-width \"A\".\n\nIf the kanji set is used along with ASCII or JIS-Roman, then even if the standard is abided by strictly, the unique encoding of a character is not guaranteed. For example, in the International Reference Version + 8-bit code for kanji, it is valid to represent a [[hyphen]] with the bit pattern 2/13 for the character \"HYPHEN-MINUS\", as well as with the kanji set's row 1 cell 30 (bit pattern 10/1 11/14) for the character \"HYPHEN\". In addition, the standard does not define which of the two to use for what, and so the hyphen is not given one unique encoding. The same problem affects the [[minus sign]], the [[quotation mark]]s, and so forth.\n\nMoreover, even if the kanji set is used as a separate code, there is no guarantee that the unique encoding of characters is implemented. In many cases, however, the full-width \"[[ideographic space|IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE]]\" at row 1 cell 1 and the half-width space (2/0) coexist. How the two should be different is not self-explanatory, and is not specified in the standard.\n\n=== Comparison of encoding schemes used in practice ===\n{{JIS X 0208 encoding comparison|efn-ua}}\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== History ==\nUntil five years have passed after a Japanese Industrial Standard has been established, reaffirmed, or revised, the prior standard undergoes a process of reaffirmation, revision, or withdrawal. Since establishment, the standard has been subject to revision three times, and at present, the fourth standard is valid.\n\n=== First standard ===\nThe first standard is '''JIS C 6226-1978''' {{nihongo|\"Code of Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange\"|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb|J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Kanji Fug\u014dkei}}, established by the Japanese [[Minister of International Trade and Industry (Japan)|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] on 1 January 1978. It is also called '''78JIS''' for short. Entrusted by the [[Agency of Industrial Science and Technology]], a [[JIPDEC]] kanji code standardization research and study committee produced the draft. The committee chairman was [[Moriguchi Shigeichi]].\n\nThe code included 453 non-Kanji (including Hiragana, Katakana, the Roman, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets and punctuation) and 6349 Kanji (2965 level 1 Kanji and 3384 level 2 Kanji) for a total of 6802 characters.<ref name=\"ibm208history\">{{citation | url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/as400/products/clientaccess/win32/files/globalization/Japanese_EUC.pdf | chapter=15.

The standard itself was set in [[Shaken Co., Ltd]]'s Ishii Mincho typeface.\n\n=== Second standard ===\nThe second standard '''JIS C 6226-1983''' {{nihongo|\"Code of Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange\"|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb|J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Kanji Fug\u014dkei}} revised the first standard on 1 September 1983. It is also called '''83JIS'''. Entrusted by the AIST, a JIPDEC kanji code-related JIS committee produced the draft. The committee chairman was [[Motooka T\u014dru]].\n\nThe draft of the second standard was based on the consideration of factors such as the promulgation of the [[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]], the enforcement of the [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]], and the standardization of Japanese-language [[Teletex]] by the [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (Japan)|Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications]]; also, the next modification was performed to keep pace with JIS C 6234-1983 (24-pixel matrix printer character forms; presently JIS X 9052).\n\n;Addition of special characters\n:39 characters were added to the special characters. Among these 39, per [[Japan Information Center of Science and Technology|JICST]] recommendations, and from such standards as JIS Z 8201-1981 (mathematical symbols) and JIS Z 8202-1982 (quantity, unit, and chemical symbols), things that could not be represented by composition were chosen.\n;Newly added box-drawing characters\n:32 [[box-drawing characters]] were added.\n;Swapping of ''itaiji'' code points\n:Code points for 22 [[itaiji|variant]] pairs of Kanji were swapped, such that the variant in level 2 was moved to level 1 and vice versa.<ref name=\"ibm208history\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781565922242/raw/master/AppQ/78-vs-83-3.sjs|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=Appendix Q \u00a7 78-vs-83-3|work=CJKV Information Processing (supplementary material)|publisher=O'Reilly}} Note inclusion of kuten codes with hyphen omitted.</ref> For example, (level 1's) row 36 cell 59 in the first standard ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u58fa|\u58fa]]}}) was moved to (level 2's) row 52 cell 68; the point originally at row 52 cell 68 ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u58f7|\u58f7]]}}) was in turn moved to row 36 cell 59.\n;Additions to the level 2 kanji\n:Three characters from level 1 and one character from level 2 were given new code points at previously unassigned code points in row 84 as level 2 kanji. ''Itaiji'' for each of those code points were newly assigned to their original locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781565922242/raw/master/AppQ/78-vs-83-2.sjs|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=Appendix Q \u00a7 78-vs-83-2|work=CJKV Information Processing (supplementary material)|publisher=O'Reilly}} Note inclusion of kuten codes with hyphen omitted.</ref> For example, row 84 cell 1 in the second standard ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u582f|\u582f]]}}) was moved there to accommodate a different form not included in the first standard at row 22 cell 38 as a level 1 kanji ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u5c2d|\u5c2d]]}}).\n;Modification of character forms\n:The character forms of approximately 300 kanji were amended.<ref>According to Nomura (1984), the number of character forms changed, including moves between code points, is 294. According to Shibano (1997a) and the text of the fourth standard, the number is of character forms changed is 300.</ref>\n\nAmong the changes in those 300 or so kanji character forms, many level 1 glyphs that were in the style of the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] were changed into variants, and especially more simplified forms (e.g. [[ryakuji]] and [[extended shinjitai]]). For example, a couple of code points that are often the subject of criticism due to being greatly changed are row 18 cell 10 (78JIS: {{lang|ja|\u9dd7}}, 83JIS: {{lang|ja|\u9d0e}}) and row 38 cell 34 (78JIS: {{lang|ja|\u7006}}, 83JIS: {{lang|ja|\u6d9c}}).\n\nThere were many smaller changes away from the Kangxi-style variants; for example, row 25 cell 84 ({{lang|ja|\u9d60}}) lost part of a stroke. Also, where some glyphs for level 1 kanji were not Kangxi-style forms, there were some changed into their Kangxi-style forms; for example, row 80 cell 49 ({{lang|ja|\u9760}}) gained part of a stroke (i.e., the same part of the stroke that 25-84 lost).\n\nIn order to elucidate the original intent of the first standard, these ended up falling into parameters for unification criteria in the fourth standard. The difference in form for the examples noted above (\"{{lang|ja|\u9d60}}\" and \"{{lang|ja|\u9760}}\") falls under the parameters for unification criterion 42 (concerning the component \"{{lang|ja|\u544a}}\").{{efn|The question of which glyphs within the unification criteria are to be used is left to the type designer. Depending on that (and the end-user's circumstances), it is possible that neither, both, one, or the other of these two will follow their Kangxi-style form.}}\n\nThe bulk of the changes to character forms are differences between level 1 and level 2 kanji. Specifically, simplification was done more often for level 1 kanji than for level 2 kanji; simplifications applied to level 1 kanji (e.g. \"{{lang|ja|\u6f51}}\" to \"{{lang|ja|\u6e8c}}\" and \"{{lang|ja|\u91b1}}\" to \"{{lang|ja|\u9197}}\") were not generally applied to kanji in level 2 (\"{{lang|ja|\u64a5}}\" stayed as-is). The aforementioned 25-84 ({{lang|ja|\u9d60}}) and 80-49 ({{lang|ja|\u9760}}) were given different treatment likewise, as the former is in level 1 and the latter is in level 2. Even so, there were some changes regardless of the level; for instance characters containing the \"door\" ({{lang|ja|\u6238}}) and \"winter\" ({{lang|ja|\u51ac}}) components were changed with no different treatment between level 1 and level 2 kanji.\n\nHowever, for 29 code points (such as the problematic 18-10 and 38-34 mentioned above), the forms inherited by the fourth standard contradicts the original intent of the first. For these, there are special unification criteria to maintain compatibility with the previous standards at these code points.\n\nWhen the new \"X\" category for Japanese Industrial Standards (for information-related fields) was introduced, the second standard was re-termed '''JIS X 0208-1983'''<ref name=\"ibm208history\" /> on 1 March 1987.\n\n=== Third standard ===\nThe third standard '''JIS X 0208-1990''' {{nihongo|\"Code of Japanese Graphic Character Set for Information Interchange\"|\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u6f22\u5b57\u7b26\u53f7|J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Kanji Fug\u014d}} revised the second standard on 1 September 1990. It is also called '''90JIS''' for short. Entrusted by the AIST, a committee at the [[Japanese Standards Association]] for the revision of JIS X 0208 created the draft. The committee chairman was [[Tajima Kazuo]].\n\n225 kanji glyphs were changed, and two characters were added to level 2 (84-05 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u51dc|\u51dc]]}}\" and 84-06 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7199|\u7199]]}}\"). This was a disunification of ''itaiji'' for two characters already included (49-59 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u51db|\u51db]]}}\" and 63-70 \"{{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u7155|\u7155]]}}\"). Some of the changes and the two additions corresponded to the 118 [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]] added in March 1990.<ref name=\"ibm208history\" /> The standard itself was set in [[Heisei Mincho]].\n\n=== Fourth standard ===\nThe fourth standard '''JIS X 0208:1997''' {{nihongo|\"7-bit and 8-bit double byte coded KANJI sets for information interchange\"|7\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u53ca\u30738\u30d3\u30c3\u30c8\u306e2\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u4ea4\u63db\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u6f22\u5b57\u96c6\u5408|Nana-Bitto Oyobi Hachi-Bitto no Ni-Baito J\u014dh\u014d K\u014dkan'y\u014d Fug\u014dka Kanji Sh\u016bg\u014d}} revised the third standard on 20 January 1997. It is also called '''97JIS''' for short. Entrusted by the AIST, a JSA committee for research and study of coded character sets produced the draft. The committee chairman was [[Shibano K\u014dji]].\n\nThe basic policies of this revision were to perform no changes the character set, to clarify ambiguous provisions, and to make the standard relatively easier to use. Addition, removal, and code point rearrangement were not done, and without exception, the example glyphs were also left unchanged. However, the stipulations of the standard were completely re-written and/or supplemented. Whereas the third standard was 65 pages long without the explanations, the fourth standard was 374 pages without the explanations.\n\nThe main points of the revision are:\n\n;Definition of encoding methods\n:Until the third standard, only the encoding method based on JIS X 0202 code extension was defined. This is something unusual as far as coded character sets go. In the fourth standard, encoding methods that do not use escape sequences for the purpose of code extension were defined.\n;Definition of the general prohibition of the use of unassigned code points and methods of usage for unassigned code points\n:The third standard, in an explanation that was not part of the standard, described things as if there were places where for some unassigned code points, it was acceptable to assign gaiji. In the fourth standard, it was clarified that use of unassigned code points is generally prohibited. Also, the conditions for the usage of unassigned code points were specified.\n;General elimination of duplicate encodings\n:Each character was given a \"character name\" that maps to those of other standards. Also, encoding methods to use them together with the ISO/IEC 646's International Reference Version or JIS X 0201 were specified. When JIS X 0208 is used together with either, among two assigned code points for characters with the same name, only one is permitted; thus, duplicate encodings were generally eliminated.\n;Investigation into sources of kanji\n:Characters included in the standard so far that are found in neither the [[Kangxi Dictionary]] nor the [[Dai Kanwa Jiten]] were identified. Accordingly, exactly with what purpose for inclusion and from which sources these kanji came during compilation of the first standard was investigated.\n;Definition of kanji unification criteria\n:Based on things such as the materials for the drafting of the first standard, an attempt was made to restore the intent of the first standard for the scope of the glyphs each code point represents. Moreover, the criteria for unifying kanji glyphs were clearly defined.\n;Inclusion of de facto standards\n:By the time of the fourth standard, the encoding methods [[Shift JIS]] and [[ISO-2022-JP]] had become [[de facto standard]]s for personal computing and e-mail, respectively. These encoding methods were included as \"Shift-Coded Representation\" and \"<nowiki>RFC 1468</nowiki>-Coded Representation\" (described above).\n\n=== Successors {{anchor|Future}} ===\n[[JIS X 0213]] ([[extended kanji]]) was designed \"with the goal being to offer a sufficient character set for the purposes of encoding the modern Japanese language that JIS X 0208 intended to be from the start\";<ref name=\"goal\">Original Japanese: {{lang|ja|\u300cJIS X 0208\u304c\u5f53\u521d\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u3092\u610f\u56f3\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u73fe\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u3092\u7b26\u53f7\u5316\u3059\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5341\u5206\u306a\u6587\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3092\u76ee\u7684\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8a2d\u8a08\u3055\u308c\u305f\u300d}}</ref> it defines a character set that expands upon the kanji set of JIS X 0208. The drafters of JIS X 0213 recommend migration from JIS X 0208 to JIS X 0213, among the advantages being JIS X 0213's compatibility with the [[Japanese script reform#Gaiji|Hy\u014dgai Kanji Glyph List]] and with newer [[jinmeiy\u014d kanji]].\n\nContrary to the expectations of the drafters, adoption of JIS X 0213 has been anything but fast since its enactment in the year 2000. The drafting committee of JIS X 0213:2004 wrote (in the year 2004), \"The status where 'what the majority of information systems can use in common is JIS X 0208 only' still continues.\" (JIS X 0213:2000, Appendix 1:2004, section 2.9.7)\n\nFor [[Microsoft Windows]], the predominant [[operating system]] (and hence supplying the predominant [[desktop environment]]) in the personal computing sector, the JIS X 0213 [[character repertoire|repertoire]] has been included since [[Windows Vista]], released in November 2006. [[Mac OS X]] has been compatible with JIS X 0213 since version [[Mac OS X v10.1|10.1]] (released in 2001). Many [[Unix-like]]s such as [[Linux]] can (optionally) support JIS X 0213 if desired. Therefore, it is thought that with time, JIS X 0213 support on personal computers will not be an impediment to its eventual adoption.\n\nAmong the drafters of JIS X 0213, there are those who expect to see a mix of JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0213 before any adoption of JIS X 0213 (Sat\u014d, 2004). However, JIS X 0208 continues to be used for the present, and many predict it to endure as a standard. There are barriers that need to be overcome if JIS X 0213 is to supplant JIS X 0208 in common usage:\n\n* The character repertoires utilized in Japanese [[mobile phone]]s at the present time{{when|date=January 2018}} are based on JIS X 0208. There are no officially announced plans whatsoever to migrate these to JIS X 0213 compatibility. As mobile phones are now a pervasive aspect of Japanese textual communication (see [[Japanese mobile phone culture]]), being a widespread, commonly accessed medium for sending [[e-mail]] and accessing the [[World Wide Web]], a lack of adoption for mobile phones deters usage elsewhere.\n* JIS X 0213 is not strictly upward-compatible with JIS X 0208 in terms of unification criteria (see [[#JIS X 0213|below]]). For large-scale archives (e.g. [[bibliographic database]]s and [[Aozora Bunko]]) that use JIS X 0208 and follow its unification criteria strictly, it is thought that it would be extremely difficult work to both convert all the data to JIS X 0213 and preserve the same standard of textual integrity.\n* In practice, many systems define and use unassigned code points in JIS X 0208. For example, Windows assigns IBM and NEC extended characters and user-defined character areas (see [[Windows-932]]), and mobile phones assign [[emoji]] in some such places. The code points of these ''gaiji'' conflict with the code points that JIS X 0213 codes use, so there would be some difficulty in migrating these systems from JIS X 0208 to JIS X 0213. There are also plans to migrate to [[Universal Character Set|UCS]]/[[Unicode]] and use the JIS X 0213 repertoire from there, but until a system administrator is able to judge that the implementations of UCS/Unicode [[surrogate pair]]s and character compositions are sufficiently stable, he or she is likely to hesitate to use the repertoire of JIS X 0213 that requires those implementations.\n* The improvements provided by JIS X 0213 are mostly in the realm of characters that are not used as often as the ones already present in JIS X 0208. Because there are nearly twice as many glyphs that need to be implemented for less usage of those extra glyphs, it can be a low return on investment in many cases, especially where resources are constrained.\n\n== Implementations ==\nBecause JIS X 0208 / JIS C 6226 is primarily a [[character set]] and not a strictly defined [[character encoding]], several companies have implemented their own encodings of the character set.\n*[[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer Inc.]]: [[MacJapanese]] (Shift_JIS based)\n*[[Fujitsu]]: [[JEF kanji code]]\n*[[Hitachi Ltd.]]: [[KEIS]] (EBCDIC based)\n*[[IBM]]: various, including [[Code page 932 (IBM)|IBM-932]] and [[Code page 942|IBM-942]] (both Shift_JIS based)\n*[[Microsoft]]: [[Code page 932 (Microsoft Windows)|Windows-932]] (Shift_JIS based)\n*[[NEC]]: [[JIPS]]\n\nSeveral of these incorporate vendor-specific character assignments in place of unallocated regions of the standard. These include Windows-932 and MacJapanese, as well as [[NEC]]'s [[PC98]] character encoding. While IBM-932 and IBM-942 also include vendor assignments, they include them outside of the region used for JIS X 0208.\n\n== Relation to other standards ==\n\n=== ISO/IEC 646 IRV and ASCII ===\nAs noted above, the kanji set is not upwardly compatible with the ISO/IEC 646:1991 IRV (ASCII) graphic character set. The kanji set and the IRV graphic character set can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (IRV + 7-bit code for kanji and IRV + 8-bit code for kanji). They can be used together in [[EUC-JP]] as well.\n\n=== JIS X 0201 ===\nThe kanji set lacks three characters included in [[JIS X 0201]]'s graphic character set for Latin characters: 2/2 (QUOTATION MARK), 2/7 (APOSTROPHE), and 2/13 (HYPHEN-MINUS). The kanji set contains all character included in JIS X 0201's graphic character set for katakana.\n\nThe kanji set and the graphic character set for Latin characters can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (Latin characters + 7-bit code for kanji and the Latin characters + 8-bit code for kanji). The kanji set, graphic character set for Latin characters, and JIS X 0201's graphic character set for katakana can be used together as specified in JIS X 0208 (the shift-coded character set; i.e. [[Shift JIS]]). The kanji set and graphic character set for katakana can be used together in [[EUC-JP]].\n\n=== JIS X 0212 ===\n[[JIS X 0212]] (supplementary kanji) defines additional characters with code points for the purposes of information processing that requires characters not found in JIS X 0208. Rather than allocating characters within the main JIS X 0208 kanji set, it defines a second 94-by-94 kanji set containing supplementary characters.\n\nJIS X 0212 can be used with JIS X 0208 in [[EUC-JP]]. Also, JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212 are both source standards for UCS/Unicode's [[Han unification]], meaning that kanji from both sets can be included in one Unicode-format document.\n\nAmong the code points that the second version of JIS X 0208 changed, 28 code points in JIS X 0212 reflect the character forms from before the changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9781565922242/raw/master/AppQ/TJ2.sjs|last=Lunde|first=Ken|title=Appendix Q \u00a7 TJ2|work=CJKV Information Processing (supplementary material)|publisher=O'Reilly}} Note inclusion of kuten codes with hyphen omitted.</ref> Also, JIS X 0212 reassigns the \"[[List of Japanese typographic symbols#\u3006|closure mark]]\" that JIS X 0208 had assigned as a non-kanji ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u3006|\u3006]]}}, at row 1 cell 26) as a kanji ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u4e44|\u4e44]]}}, at row 16 cell 17). JIS X 0212 has no characters in common with JIS X 0208 other than these. Hence, it is not suited for general use on its own.\n\nHowever, in the fourth version of JIS X 0208, the connection to JIS X 0212 was not defined at all. It is believed that this is because the drafting committee of the fourth JIS X 0208 standard had a critical opinion of the selection and identification methods of JIS X 0212.<ref>For example, Shibano K\u014dji (1997a), who served as the chairman of the drafting committee for the fourth standard, stated these about the selection method: \"It is based on a superficial understanding of JIS X 0208's character set selection; it is a mistaken understanding\" (original Japanese: {{lang|ja|\u300cJIS X 0208\u306e\u6587\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u9078\u5b9a\u306e\u8868\u5c64\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u306b\u57fa\u3065\u304f\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308a\u3001\u9593\u9055\u3063\u305f\u7406\u89e3\u3067\u3042\u308b\u300d}}) and \"There is a big problem in investigating all of a character set that exceeds 10000 characters.\" (original Japanese: {{lang|ja|\u300c1\u4e07\u5b57\u3092\u8d8a\u3048\u308b\u6c34\u6e96\u306e\u6587\u5b57\u96c6\u5408\u306e\u691c\u8a0e\u3068\u3057\u3066\u306f\u3001\u5927\u304d\u306a\u554f\u984c\u304c\u3042\u308b\u300d}})</ref> The character meanings and selection rationales were not properly documented, making it difficult to identify whether desired kanji corresponded to those in its repertoire.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup | url-status=dead | archive-date=2005-05-22 | title=JIS Character Sets \u2013 JIS X 0212:1990 | last=Marukawa | first=Kazushi}}</ref> The text of the fourth standard, as well as pointing out the problematic points of the character selection of JIS X 0212, states that \"it is thought that not only is character selection impossible, it is also impossible to use together; the connection to JIS X 0212 is not defined at all.\" (section 3.3.1)\n\n=== JIS X 0213 ===\n[[File:Euler diag for jp charsets.svg|thumb|[[Euler diagram]] comparing repertoires of JIS X 0208, [[JIS X 0212]], [[JIS X 0213]], [[Windows-31J]], the Microsoft standard repertoire and [[Unicode]].]]\n[[JIS X 0213]] (extension kanji) defines a kanji set that expands upon the kanji set of JIS X 0208. According to this standard, it is \"designed with the goal being to offer a sufficient character set for the purposes of encoding the modern Japanese language that JIS X 0208 intended to be from the start.\"<ref name=\"goal\"/>\n\nThe kanji set of JIS X 0213 incorporates all characters that can be represented in the kanji set of JIS X 0208, with many additions. In total, JIS X 0213 defines 1183 non-kanji and 10,050 kanji (for a total of 11,233 characters), within two 94-by-94 {{nihongo|planes|\u9762|men}}. The first plane (non-kanji and level 1&ndash;3 kanji) is based on JIS X 0208, whereas the second plane (level 4 kanji) is designed to fit within the unallocated rows of JIS X 0212, allowing use in [[EUC-JP]].<ref name=\"python-eucjis\">{{cite web | url=https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/cjkcodecs/README | title=Readme for CJKCodecs | publisher=Python Software Foundation | work=cPython | last=Chang | first=Hyeshik}}</ref> JIS X 0213 also defines [[Shift JIS-2004|Shift_JISx0213]], a variant of Shift_JIS capable of encoding the entirety of JIS X 0213.\n\nFor most intents and purposes, JIS X 0213 plane 1 is a superset of JIS X 0208. However, different unification criteria are applied to some code points in JIS X 0213 compared to JIS X 0208. Consequently, some pairs of kanji glyphs that were represented by one JIS X 0208 code point, due to being unified, are given separate code points in JIS X 0213. For example, the glyph at row 33 cell 46 of JIS X 0208 (\"{{lang|ja|\u50e7}}\", described [[#Unification_of_kanji_variants|above]]) unifies a few variants due to its right-hand component. In JIS X 0213, two forms (the ones containing the component \"{{lang|ja|\u4e37}}\") are unified on plane 1 row 33 cell 46, and the other (containing the component \"{{lang|ja|\u516b}}\") is located at plane 1 row 14 cell 41. Therefore, whether JIS X 0208 row 33 cell 46 should be mapped to JIS X 0213 plane 1 row 33 cell 46 or plane 1 row 14 cell 41 cannot be determined automatically.{{efn|This is the same uncertainty as to whether the \"HYPHEN-MINUS\" in ISO/IEC 646 should be mapped to \"HYPHEN\" or \"MINUS SIGN\" in JIS X 0208.}} This limits the extent to which JIS X 0213 can be considered upwardly compatible with JIS X 0208, as admitted by the JIS X 0213 drafting committee.<ref>JIS X 0213:2000 section 5.3.2, JIS X 0213:2000 Appendix 1:2004 section 3.2.2</ref>\n\nHowever, for the most part, row ''m'' cell ''n'' in JIS X 0208 corresponds to plane 1 row ''m'' cell ''n'' in JIS X 0213; therefore, not much confusion arises in practice. This is because most typefaces have come to use the glyphs exemplified in JIS X 0208, and most users are not consciously aware of the unification criteria.\n\n=== ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===\nThe kanji set of JIS X 0208 is among the original source standards for the [[Han unification]] in [[ISO/IEC 10646]] (UCS) and [[Unicode]]. Every kanji in JIS X 0208 corresponds to its own code point in UCS/Unicode's [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP).\n\nThe non-kanji in JIS X 0208 also correspond to their own code points in the BMP. However, for some special characters, some systems implement a different correspondences from those of UCS/Unicode's (which are based on the character names given JIS X 0208:1997).\n\n== Footnotes ==\n=== Explanatory ===\n{{notelist|refs=\n{{efn|name=kuten|1=As shown in the code tables registered at the International Register of Coded Character Sets To Be Used With Escape Sequences, prior to the fourth standard (1997), the {{nihongo3||\u533a|ku}} and {{nihongo3||\u70b9|ten}} were called \"section\" and \"position\" respectively in English. As to the background of the change in the English, in the JIS X 0221-1995 (UCS) standard that translated ISO/IEC 10646-1:1993, \"group\", \"plane\", \"row\", and \"cell\" can be translated into {{nihongo3||[[wikt:\u7fa4|\u7fa4]]|gun}}, {{nihongo3||[[wikt:\u9762|\u9762]]|men}}, {{nihongo3||\u533a|ku}}, and {{nihongo3||\u70b9|ten}}.

In 1124 it was mentioned as ''monasterium Sancti Martini cum villa quae dicitur Lustriacus'' and in 1147 it was ''Lustriey''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[File:Lutry menhir1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Menhirs]] in Lutry]]\nIn 1835 and again in 1894, [[neolithic]] graves were discovered in Ch\u00e2telard.  The graves contained a total of some thirty stone box graves of the so-called Chamblandes type.  They contained three ax blades of worked [[flint]], as well as parts of a shell necklace.  In 1895, several graves of the same type were discovered in Montagny.  They contained important new items such as antler shafts made for axes, a polished stone ax and stone spindle whorls.  While these type of items were often found in the remains of [[littoral]] neolithic settlements, they are rarely found in graves, which made the discovery at Montagny especially significant.  However, in 1927, archaeologists incorrectly assumed that these findings were assigned to the tombs in error.  Without further evidence, they wrote that there was an undiscovered littoral settlement below Montagny.<ref name=HDS_Prehistory>{{HDS|2420<!--Section 1-1-->|Lutry \u2013 Prehistory}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1984, during the construction of the underground car park in La Possession, an arraignment of 24 standing stones ([[menhir]]) were discovered.  18 of the stones were re-erected next to it in the original formation.  The thirteen large standing stones ({{convert|2|-|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high) were arranged in a line, while the eleven subsequent smaller stones (from {{convert|0.3|to|0.8|m|in|abbr=on}} high) described a curve to the south.  The standing stones are traditionally assigned to the beginning of the middle neolithic period.  However local pottery indicates a later date, to the late Neolithic or early [[Bronze Age]].  Menhir No. 14 is a figurative [[stele]], in which geometric ornamentation (x-shaped lines, balanced circles, zigzag line) were carved.  Similar symbols can also be found on standing stones in southern France, but their meaning is unknown.<ref name=HDS_Prehistory/>\n\nAt various places in the municipality, including Curtinaux, Le Ch\u00e2telard, Savuit and Gantennaz, there are traces of [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] settlements.  These include bricks, walls, parts of buildings and ornaments and the remains of an aqueduct.\n\n===Medieval town===\n[[File:BertholodTurm.JPG|thumb|left|Bertholod tower and surrounding vineyards]]\nLutry was a royal estate of the [[Elder House of Welf|Burgundian House of Welf]].  A fortified tower was built in the 11th century in Cr\u00eat-Bernard to help govern the estate.  After the death of [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] the estate passed to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad of Swabia]] and became an [[Holy Roman Emperor|imperial]] estate.  In 1079, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]] donated the estate to the [[Bishop of Lausanne]].  The Bishop held the estate until 1536.  By 1263, the Abbey of Saint-Maurice possessed some land in Lutry, which they had received in 1017 from the [[Kings of Burgundy]].  Between 1025 and 1124, due to the donation of a man named Anselme, a [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] was founded on the [[alluvial]] delta of the Lutrive river.  The priory was under the [[Savigny Abbey, Rh\u00f4ne|abbey of Savigny-en-Lyonnais]] (Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes).  The priory was the recipient of numerous gifts and church records from the dioceses of Lausanne, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion|Sion]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Geneva]].  Initially it held about fifteen monks, but it quickly expanded and had authority over the villages of Lutry, Villette and Paudex until 1548.  At the beginning of the 15th century, the priory freed its [[serf]]s.  The town of Lutry, which was granted certain freedoms by the bishop, began to develop in the first quarter of the 12th century around the priory.  In 1368 the soldiers of Lutry marched under the double banners of the priory and the diocese.  Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] there were conflicts in the relationship between the mother abbey, the priory, the Bishop and towns.<ref name=HDS_Priory>{{HDS|2420<!--Section 1-2-->|Lutry priory and municipality}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lutry street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lutry street]]\nThe village of Corsy (which is now part of the municipality of Lutry) was under the direct rule of [[Corsier]] until 1798.\n\nLutry began to become a town at the beginning of the 13th century when it was encircled by a circular wall created by the Bishop (1212\u201319).  The wall was supported by a square tower, the Tour de l'Eveque, which was built by William of Ecublens in 1221\u201329.  The hamlets Curtinaux, Savuit, Le Ch\u00e2telard and Corsy as well as the neighborhoods of Friporte, Voisinand and Bourg Neuf were outside the walls, and soon a second [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] was built around the latter.  In 1291 there was a hospital in the priory and in 1348 another one was built in the town.  With the construction of an inner harbor, market buildings were created in 1408.  At the instigation of the monks, a [[vineyard]] was placed around the town.  An organization known as the  Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit, in 1307, marked the beginning of a civic organization.  Starting in the 13th century, the town began an effort to deforest the neighboring Monts-de-Lutry, an effort that was completed in the 17th century.  The newly available fields, pastures and forests were managed by farmers, who were also [[B\u00fcrgergemeinde|citizens of the town]].<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nThe [[parish]] of Lutry is first mentioned in 1228.  The original parish also included Savigny (separated 1598), Belmont-sur-Lausanne (1766\u20131846) and Villette (1846\u201363).  The Priory Church of Saint-Martin also served as the [[parish church]].  The church was built in 1250\u201360 over a building from the 11th century.  It was rebuilt in 1344 following a fire.  It was restored and extended in 1569\u20131591 and renovated from 1889 to 1907.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\n===Early Modern Lutry===\nTo manage Lutry, the priory appointed a governor and the Bishop appointed a ''Meier'' or ecclesiastical [[bailiff]], both of which were based in the castle. The ''Meier'''s office was hereditary in the Mayor de Lutry noble family.  The family retained their position even after the conquest of Vaud by the [[Bern]]ese.  The last of the family, Claude Mayor de Lutry died in 1598 and was replaced by a [[castellan]].  The castellan ruled over the town as well as the estates of Corsier until 1798.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nIn 1536 Lutry unsuccessfully opposed the Bernese conquest and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  The Priory was closed in 1537 and the episcopal properties were secularized.   From 1536 until 1798 Lutry was part of the Bailiwick of Lausanne.  During this period it was ruled by an eighteen-member council and a twelve-member council, which was led by a [[knight banneret]].  There were four judicial courts over the town and the surrounding villages; the courts of Letry and Savigny, the court of the castellan and the court of the Lords of Corsier.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\n===Modern Lutry===\n[[File:RoyLindmanLutry 002.jpg|thumb|Lutry port]]\n[[File:Lutry Harbor(Hometown).JPG|thumb|View on [[Lac L\u00e9man]] and the [[Alps]] from Lutry heights.]]\nIn 1798, Lutry joined, at the last minute, the Vaud revolution against Bern.  Following the French invasion in 1798 and the creation of the [[Helvetic Republic]], it was part of the district of Lavaux.  Lutry was administered by an eleven-member council which was led by a Syndic.  Between 1803\u201325 there were 15 municipal councils and officials, which after 1815 met in an upper council.  Starting in 1826, Lutry and Savigny separated to form two independent municipalities.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nIn 1854, the owner of the castle of Lutry was given the town by its owner, Juste Charles Antoine de Crousaz.\n\nThe vineyards, which during the Ancien R\u00e9gime were partly owned by Fribourg, Bern, Lausanne and Yverdon patricians and partly owned by the citizens of Lutry, became the most important source of income in 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century.  The construction of a harbor (1836\u201338), a quay (1863) and a dock (1816, 1912) opened the city to the lake.  In 1822 the market building was changed into a school.  In 1885, the former school building was demolished to make way for a customs house.  The train station of Lutry on the [[Lausanne\u2013Brig railway line|Lausanne\u2013Brig line]] opened in 1861.  Followed in 1862 by the La Conversion station on the Bern rail line, followed in 1920 by the stop at Bossi\u00e8re.  Starting in 1896, a tram line connected Lutry with Lausanne.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nThe period around the turn of the 20th century was characterized both by the influx of many new, non-local families and by [[phylloxera]] disease outbreaks in the vineyards.  The latter triggered an unprecedented economic crisis.  In the 1950s, the decline of viticulture and the parallel urbanization of Lutry encouraged a number of small and medium-sized enterprises.  In 2000 there were approximately 400 businesses in the town.  Starting in the 1960s Lutry grew into Lausanne [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] and became a popular residential area for the wealthy classes.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nIn 1998, a new port was built.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:A Day in the Wine Country.jpg|thumb|Vineyards and Bertholo tower outside Lutry]]\nLutry has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{Convert|8.45|km2|mi2}}.

The graves contained a total of some thirty stone box graves of the so-called Chamblandes type.  They contained three ax blades of worked [[flint]], as well as parts of a shell necklace.  In 1895, several graves of the same type were discovered in Montagny.  They contained important new items such as antler shafts made for axes, a polished stone ax and stone spindle whorls.  While these type of items were often found in the remains of [[littoral]] neolithic settlements, they are rarely found in graves, which made the discovery at Montagny especially significant.  However, in 1927, archaeologists incorrectly assumed that these findings were assigned to the tombs in error.  Without further evidence, they wrote that there was an undiscovered littoral settlement below Montagny.<ref name=HDS_Prehistory>{{HDS|2420<!--Section 1-1-->|Lutry \u2013 Prehistory}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1984, during the construction of the underground car park in La Possession, an arraignment of 24 standing stones ([[menhir]]) were discovered.  18 of the stones were re-erected next to it in the original formation.  The thirteen large standing stones ({{convert|2|-|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high) were arranged in a line, while the eleven subsequent smaller stones (from {{convert|0.3|to|0.8|m|in|abbr=on}} high) described a curve to the south.  The standing stones are traditionally assigned to the beginning of the middle neolithic period.  However local pottery indicates a later date, to the late Neolithic or early [[Bronze Age]].  Menhir No. 14 is a figurative [[stele]], in which geometric ornamentation (x-shaped lines, balanced circles, zigzag line) were carved.  Similar symbols can also be found on standing stones in southern France, but their meaning is unknown.<ref name=HDS_Prehistory/>\n\nAt various places in the municipality, including Curtinaux, Le Ch\u00e2telard, Savuit and Gantennaz, there are traces of [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] settlements.  These include bricks, walls, parts of buildings and ornaments and the remains of an aqueduct.\n\n===Medieval town===\n[[File:BertholodTurm.JPG|thumb|left|Bertholod tower and surrounding vineyards]]\nLutry was a royal estate of the [[Elder House of Welf|Burgundian House of Welf]].  A fortified tower was built in the 11th century in Cr\u00eat-Bernard to help govern the estate.  After the death of [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] the estate passed to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad of Swabia]] and became an [[Holy Roman Emperor|imperial]] estate.  In 1079, [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]] donated the estate to the [[Bishop of Lausanne]].  The Bishop held the estate until 1536.  By 1263, the Abbey of Saint-Maurice possessed some land in Lutry, which they had received in 1017 from the [[Kings of Burgundy]].  Between 1025 and 1124, due to the donation of a man named Anselme, a [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] was founded on the [[alluvial]] delta of the Lutrive river.  The priory was under the [[Savigny Abbey, Rh\u00f4ne|abbey of Savigny-en-Lyonnais]] (Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes).  The priory was the recipient of numerous gifts and church records from the dioceses of Lausanne, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Sion|Sion]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Geneva]].  Initially it held about fifteen monks, but it quickly expanded and had authority over the villages of Lutry, Villette and Paudex until 1548.  At the beginning of the 15th century, the priory freed its [[serf]]s.  The town of Lutry, which was granted certain freedoms by the bishop, began to develop in the first quarter of the 12th century around the priory.  In 1368 the soldiers of Lutry marched under the double banners of the priory and the diocese.  Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] there were conflicts in the relationship between the mother abbey, the priory, the Bishop and towns.<ref name=HDS_Priory>{{HDS|2420<!--Section 1-2-->|Lutry priory and municipality}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lutry street.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lutry street]]\nThe village of Corsy (which is now part of the municipality of Lutry) was under the direct rule of [[Corsier]] until 1798.\n\nLutry began to become a town at the beginning of the 13th century when it was encircled by a circular wall created by the Bishop (1212\u201319).  The wall was supported by a square tower, the Tour de l'Eveque, which was built by William of Ecublens in 1221\u201329.  The hamlets Curtinaux, Savuit, Le Ch\u00e2telard and Corsy as well as the neighborhoods of Friporte, Voisinand and Bourg Neuf were outside the walls, and soon a second [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] was built around the latter.  In 1291 there was a hospital in the priory and in 1348 another one was built in the town.  With the construction of an inner harbor, market buildings were created in 1408.  At the instigation of the monks, a [[vineyard]] was placed around the town.  An organization known as the  Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit, in 1307, marked the beginning of a civic organization.  Starting in the 13th century, the town began an effort to deforest the neighboring Monts-de-Lutry, an effort that was completed in the 17th century.  The newly available fields, pastures and forests were managed by farmers, who were also [[B\u00fcrgergemeinde|citizens of the town]].<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nThe [[parish]] of Lutry is first mentioned in 1228.  The original parish also included Savigny (separated 1598), Belmont-sur-Lausanne (1766\u20131846) and Villette (1846\u201363).  The Priory Church of Saint-Martin also served as the [[parish church]].  The church was built in 1250\u201360 over a building from the 11th century.  It was rebuilt in 1344 following a fire.  It was restored and extended in 1569\u20131591 and renovated from 1889 to 1907.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\n===Early Modern Lutry===\nTo manage Lutry, the priory appointed a governor and the Bishop appointed a ''Meier'' or ecclesiastical [[bailiff]], both of which were based in the castle. The ''Meier'''s office was hereditary in the Mayor de Lutry noble family.  The family retained their position even after the conquest of Vaud by the [[Bern]]ese.  The last of the family, Claude Mayor de Lutry died in 1598 and was replaced by a [[castellan]].  The castellan ruled over the town as well as the estates of Corsier until 1798.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nIn 1536 Lutry unsuccessfully opposed the Bernese conquest and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  The Priory was closed in 1537 and the episcopal properties were secularized.   From 1536 until 1798 Lutry was part of the Bailiwick of Lausanne.  During this period it was ruled by an eighteen-member council and a twelve-member council, which was led by a [[knight banneret]].  There were four judicial courts over the town and the surrounding villages; the courts of Letry and Savigny, the court of the castellan and the court of the Lords of Corsier.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\n===Modern Lutry===\n[[File:RoyLindmanLutry 002.jpg|thumb|Lutry port]]\n[[File:Lutry Harbor(Hometown).JPG|thumb|View on [[Lac L\u00e9man]] and the [[Alps]] from Lutry heights.]]\nIn 1798, Lutry joined, at the last minute, the Vaud revolution against Bern.  Following the French invasion in 1798 and the creation of the [[Helvetic Republic]], it was part of the district of Lavaux.  Lutry was administered by an eleven-member council which was led by a Syndic.  Between 1803\u201325 there were 15 municipal councils and officials, which after 1815 met in an upper council.  Starting in 1826, Lutry and Savigny separated to form two independent municipalities.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nIn 1854, the owner of the castle of Lutry was given the town by its owner, Juste Charles Antoine de Crousaz.\n\nThe vineyards, which during the Ancien R\u00e9gime were partly owned by Fribourg, Bern, Lausanne and Yverdon patricians and partly owned by the citizens of Lutry, became the most important source of income in 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century.  The construction of a harbor (1836\u201338), a quay (1863) and a dock (1816, 1912) opened the city to the lake.  In 1822 the market building was changed into a school.  In 1885, the former school building was demolished to make way for a customs house.  The train station of Lutry on the [[Lausanne\u2013Brig railway line|Lausanne\u2013Brig line]] opened in 1861.  Followed in 1862 by the La Conversion station on the Bern rail line, followed in 1920 by the stop at Bossi\u00e8re.  Starting in 1896, a tram line connected Lutry with Lausanne.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nThe period around the turn of the 20th century was characterized both by the influx of many new, non-local families and by [[phylloxera]] disease outbreaks in the vineyards.  The latter triggered an unprecedented economic crisis.  In the 1950s, the decline of viticulture and the parallel urbanization of Lutry encouraged a number of small and medium-sized enterprises.  In 2000 there were approximately 400 businesses in the town.  Starting in the 1960s Lutry grew into Lausanne [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] and became a popular residential area for the wealthy classes.<ref name=HDS_Priory/>\n\nIn 1998, a new port was built.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:A Day in the Wine Country.jpg|thumb|Vineyards and Bertholo tower outside Lutry]]\nLutry has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{Convert|8.45|km2|mi2}}.

After he was dismissed from the group in 1962, he started his own band, the Pete Best Four, and later joined many other bands over the years. He is one of several people who have been referred to as the [[Fifth Beatle]].\n\nBest was born in the city of [[Chennai|Madras]], then part of [[British Raj|British India]]. After Best's mother, [[Mona Best]] (1924\u20131988), moved to [[Liverpool]] in 1945, she opened [[the Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the Bests' house in Liverpool. The Beatles (at the time known as [[the Quarrymen]]) played some of their first concerts at the club.\n\nThe Beatles invited Best to join on 12 August 1960, on the eve of the group's first [[Hamburg]] season of club dates. [[Ringo Starr]] eventually replaced Best on 16 August 1962, when the group's manager, [[Brian Epstein]], fired Best at the request of [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] following the band's first recording session at [[EMI Studios|Abbey Road Studios]] in London. Over 30 years later, Best received a major monetary payout for his work with the Beatles after the release of their 1995 compilation of their early recordings on ''[[Anthology 1]]'', with Best on drums on a number of the album's tracks.\n\nAfter working in a number of commercially unsuccessful groups, Best gave up the music industry to work as a civil servant for 20 years, before starting the Pete Best Band. He has been married for over 50 years to Kathy Best; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.\n\n== Early life ==\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nBest's mother, [[Mona Best]] (born Alice Mona Shaw), was born in Delhi, India, and was the daughter of Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw.{{sfn|Goldsmith|2004|p=35}} Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), her first child, was born in Madras (now [[Chennai]]), [[Madras Presidency]], British India, on 24 November 1941.

Eventually, after a very long delay, they asked Epstein to dismiss Best from the band.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=119}} Epstein agonised over the decision. As he wrote in his autobiography, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he \"wasn't sure\" about Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and \"was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles at a time when they were developing as personalities \u2026 I asked the Beatles to leave the group as it was\".{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein also asked Liverpool DJ [[Bob Wooler]], who knew the Beatles intimately, for advice, to which Wooler replied that it was not a good idea, as Best was very popular with the fans.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=329}} Part of the dilemma for Epstein that arose at that time, (when the band had not yet achieved national success, but rather local status as a good band with limited income), was that Best was an asset at gigs, particularly with the girl fans, and who put on a good show, ensuring venues would have a solid audience. The counter-argument, however, was the larger consideration of the band's having the best music producible for record sales. John, Paul and George ultimately decided that record production was more important than having a drummer for live stage performances who was more image than substance. In the meantime, Epstein withheld telling Best that EMI had made a recording contract with the band (verbally since June & in writing at the end of July 1962), which meant that a new drummer was now inevitable. There may have been legal issues had Pete known.{{sfn|Shout \u2013 Philip Norman|1981|p=149-150}}\n\nEpstein ultimately decided that \"If the group was to remain happy, Pete Best must go.\"{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein summoned Best to his office and dismissed him on Thursday, 16 August, ten weeks and one day after the first recording session.

The drums were important to me for a record, but they didn't matter much otherwise. Fans don't pay particular attention to the quality of the drumming.{{sfn|Harry|2001}}}}\n\nMcCartney remembered:\n{{quote|George Martin was used to drummers being very 'in time', because all the big-band session drummers he used had a great sense of time. Now, our Liverpool drummers had a sense of spirit, emotion, economy even, but not a deadly sense of time. This would bother producers making a record. George took us to one side and said, 'I'm really unhappy with the drummer. Would you consider changing him?' We said, 'No, we can't!' It was one of those terrible things you go through as kids. Can we betray him? No. But our career was on the line.

Martin (see above) deemed Best's drumming to be inadequate for a recording. As stated in Bob Spitz's 2005 biography: \"All Pete could do was play '[[Four on the floor (music)|Fours]],'\" a style of drumming that uses kick drum notes on every quarter note to hold down the beat. Spitz's book also contains engineer [[Ron Richards (producer)|Ron Richards]]'s account of his failed attempts to teach Best somewhat more complicated beats for different songs.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=318}}\n\nCritic [[Richie Unterberger]] described Best's drumming at the Decca session as \"thinly textured and rather unimaginative,\"{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=19}} adding that Best \"pushes the beat a little too fast for comfort.\"{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=22}} Unterberger thought Starr to be \"more talented.\"{{sfn|Unterberger|2006|p=24}} Beatles' critic [[Alan W.

According to promoter and manager Joe Flannery,<ref>Series of interviews with Liverpool promoter and manager Joe Flannery 1996\u20131999, recounted by Michael Brocken in Chapter 4 of his book ''Hidden Voices: Hidden Histories of Liverpool's popular music scenes, 1930s\u20131970s''. Burlington VT, Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010</ref> Mona had done a great deal for the band by arranging a number of important early gigs and lending them a badly needed helping hand when they returned from Hamburg the first time, but this came at the cost of having to contend with her overbearing nature. At this crucial time in the history of the Beatles, John Lennon confided to Flannery that he considered Mona \"bossy like [his aunt] Mimi\" and believed that she was using the Beatles only for the sake of her son,<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\">Brocken 2010</ref> though this should be weighed against the fact that the Beatles' cordial relations with Mona soon resumed. She often met them while visiting Neil Aspinall at his London home. On these occasions, the Beatles often had small gifts for her which they had acquired on their travels. For her part, Mona allowed them to use her father's military medals in the photo shoot for the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' album cover.<ref>Roag Best et al. ''The Beatles: The True Beginnings''. p170</ref>\n\nAlthough Brian Epstein's publicly stated reluctance to fire Best quickly became a matter of record in the early biographies,{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=138}} he had found Mona Best to be the cause of mounting aggravation. Epstein's distaste for her interference in the Beatles' management, including her \"aggressive opinions about his handling of her son's career\", was obvious to everyone,<ref>Carlin, Peter Ames, ''Paul: A Life''. Touchstone Books, New York 2009 p73</ref> and he also reportedly considered Mona Best a loose cannon who must not be allowed to interfere in his operations.<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\" /> Moreover, the very recent birth of Roag further complicated matters. Although Best himself was not personally responsible for this development, it would still have caused a grave scandal had it become generally known, and Epstein may have been horrified at the prospect.<ref>Inglis, Ian, ''The Beatles In Hamburg'', Reaktion Press, London 2009 p142 et seq.</ref>\n\n=== Popularity ===\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nBest's popularity with fans was reportedly a source of friction, as many female fans considered him to be the band's best-looking member.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=322}} Radio Merseyside presenter [[Spencer Leigh (radio presenter)|Spencer Leigh]] wrote a book chronicling Best's firing, suggesting that the other members, McCartney in particular, were jealous.{{sfn|Leigh|1998}} In the 31 August 1961 issue of [[Bill Harry]]'s ''[[Mersey Beat]]'' music publication in Liverpool, [[Bob Wooler]] reported on the Beatles' local musical impact and singled out Best for special praise, calling the group \"musically authoritative and physically magnetic, example the mean, moody magnificence of drummer Pete Best \u2013 a sort of teenage [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/petebest2.shtml |title=Pete Best \u2013 Bill Harry \u2013 Mersey Beat |publisher=Triumphpc.com |accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> During the ''Teenagers' Turn'' showcase in [[Manchester]], Lennon, McCartney and Harrison walked on stage to applause, but when Best walked on, the girls screamed.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=322}} Afterwards, attentive females surrounded Best at the stage door, while the other members were ignored after signing a few autographs. McCartney's father, [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]], was present at the time and admonished Best: \"Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you\".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=322}} Lennon called the accusations of jealousy a \"myth.\"{{sfn|Anthology|2000|pp=70\u201372}}\n\nIn 1963 on British television, Mona Best, with her son present, said of his dismissal: \"From the point of [[clash of personalities]], well, probably that may be it because Peter did have a terrific fan club, you know, compared to the others. [''Interviewer:'' Too good looking perhaps?] I'll leave that for other people to say but from my point of view we haven't come here to sort of throw sticks and stones at the boys because there is no really hard feeling. There was at first, but it's just the way that it was done that has annoyed us. If it had been done a bit more straightforward it would have been more to the mark.\"<ref>\"Best of the Beatles\" DVD 2005 (1:48:48) Mona and Pete Best reflecting on the dismissal, in vintage television clip</ref> Davies agreed: \"There is some justification for a little of Mrs. Best's anger. The sacking of Pete Best is one of the few murky incidents in the Beatles' history. There was something sneaky about the way it was done.\"{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=139}}\n\n== After the Beatles ==\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nSoon after Best was dismissed, Epstein attempted to console him by offering to build another group around him, but Best refused. Feeling let down and depressed, he sat at home for two weeks, not wanting to face anybody or answer the inevitable questions about why he had been sacked.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=119}} Epstein secretly arranged with his booking agent partner, Joe Flannery, for Best to join [[Lee Curtis and the All-Stars]],{{sfn|Brocken|2010|p=102}} which then broke off from Curtis to become Pete Best & the All Stars. They signed to Decca Records, releasing the single \"I'm Gonna Knock On Your Door\", which was not successful.<ref name=\"AftertheBeatles\" />\n\n=== The Pete Best Combo {{anchor|best_of_the_beatles}} ===\n\nBest later moved to the United States along with songwriters [[Wayne Bickerton]] and [[Tony Waddington (songwriter)|Tony Waddington]]. As the Pete Best Four, and later as the Pete Best Combo (a [[quintet]]), they toured the United States with a combination of 1950s songs and original tunes, recording for small labels, but they had little success.<ref name=\"AftertheBeatles\">[http://www.petebest.com/1963.asp After The Beatles], petebest.com.

The group disbanded shortly afterwards. Bickerton and Waddington were to find greater success as songwriters in the 1960s and 1970s, writing a series of hits for the American female group [[The Flirtations (R&B musical group)|the Flirtations]] and the British group [[the Rubettes]].<ref name=\"Rub\">[http://www.therubettes.de/ The Rubettes feat.

Years later he stated in his autobiography, \"the Beatles themselves certainly never held out a helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I had never really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them\".{{sfn|Best|Doncaster|1985|p=179}} This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that \"Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill.

After he was dismissed from the group in 1962, he started his own band, the Pete Best Four, and later joined many other bands over the years. He is one of several people who have been referred to as the [[Fifth Beatle]].\n\nBest was born in the city of [[Chennai|Madras]], then part of [[British Raj|British India]]. After Best's mother, [[Mona Best]] (1924\u20131988), moved to [[Liverpool]] in 1945, she opened [[the Casbah Coffee Club]] in the cellar of the Bests' house in Liverpool. The Beatles (at the time known as [[the Quarrymen]]) played some of their first concerts at the club.\n\nThe Beatles invited Best to join on 12 August 1960, on the eve of the group's first [[Hamburg]] season of club dates. [[Ringo Starr]] eventually replaced Best on 16 August 1962, when the group's manager, [[Brian Epstein]], fired Best at the request of [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[George Harrison]] following the band's first recording session at [[EMI Studios|Abbey Road Studios]] in London. Over 30 years later, Best received a major monetary payout for his work with the Beatles after the release of their 1995 compilation of their early recordings on ''[[Anthology 1]]'', with Best on drums on a number of the album's tracks.\n\nAfter working in a number of commercially unsuccessful groups, Best gave up the music industry to work as a civil servant for 20 years, before starting the Pete Best Band. He has been married for over 50 years to Kathy Best; they have two daughters and four grandchildren.\n\n== Early life ==\n<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->\nBest's mother, [[Mona Best]] (born Alice Mona Shaw), was born in Delhi, India, and was the daughter of Thomas (an Irish major) and Mary Shaw.{{sfn|Goldsmith|2004|p=35}} Randolph Peter Scanland (later surnamed Best), her first child, was born in Madras (now [[Chennai]]), [[Madras Presidency]], British India, on 24 November 1941.

Eventually, after a very long delay, they asked Epstein to dismiss Best from the band.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=119}} Epstein agonised over the decision. As he wrote in his autobiography, ''[[A Cellarful of Noise]]'', he \"wasn't sure\" about Martin's assessment of Best's drumming and \"was not anxious to change the membership of the Beatles at a time when they were developing as personalities \u2026 I asked the Beatles to leave the group as it was\".{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein also asked Liverpool DJ [[Bob Wooler]], who knew the Beatles intimately, for advice, to which Wooler replied that it was not a good idea, as Best was very popular with the fans.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=329}} Part of the dilemma for Epstein that arose at that time, (when the band had not yet achieved national success, but rather local status as a good band with limited income), was that Best was an asset at gigs, particularly with the girl fans, and who put on a good show, ensuring venues would have a solid audience. The counter-argument, however, was the larger consideration of the band's having the best music producible for record sales. John, Paul and George ultimately decided that record production was more important than having a drummer for live stage performances who was more image than substance. In the meantime, Epstein withheld telling Best that EMI had made a recording contract with the band (verbally since June & in writing at the end of July 1962), which meant that a new drummer was now inevitable. There may have been legal issues had Pete known.{{sfn|Shout \u2013 Philip Norman|1981|p=149-150}}\n\nEpstein ultimately decided that \"If the group was to remain happy, Pete Best must go.\"{{sfn|Epstein|1964|p=63}} Epstein summoned Best to his office and dismissed him on Thursday, 16 August, ten weeks and one day after the first recording session.

Martin (see above) deemed Best's drumming to be inadequate for a recording.

Burlington VT, Ashgate Publishing Company, 2010</ref> Mona had done a great deal for the band by arranging a number of important early gigs and lending them a badly needed helping hand when they returned from Hamburg the first time, but this came at the cost of having to contend with her overbearing nature. At this crucial time in the history of the Beatles, John Lennon confided to Flannery that he considered Mona \"bossy like [his aunt] Mimi\" and believed that she was using the Beatles only for the sake of her son,<ref name=\"Brocken 2010\">Brocken 2010</ref> though this should be weighed against the fact that the Beatles' cordial relations with Mona soon resumed. She often met them while visiting Neil Aspinall at his London home. On these occasions, the Beatles often had small gifts for her which they had acquired on their travels. For her part, Mona allowed them to use her father's military medals in the photo shoot for the ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' album cover.<ref>Roag Best et al.
