She sang in [[Kannada]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]].<ref name=Shriram/> Her special musical forte included [[Harikatha]]. Her talent in dance attracted the attention of the Mysore ruler [[Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar]] who, impressed with her talent, made her the [[Asthana Vidushi]] (court dancer) in Mysore. Following the death of the ruler, she moved to [[Bangalore]]. She attained popularity in Bangalore not only in music but also in dance.<ref name=Venkataraman/> She was also patronized by many other royal houses such as those of [[Travancore]], [[Bobbili]], and [[Vijayanagaram]]. [[Narahari Rao]], a judge in the [[High Court of Mysore]], was one of Nagarathnamma's patrons and he suggested to her to move to Madras (now known as [[Chennai]]) to further her career as a musician and dancer. She shifted to there as it was considered the \"Mecca of Carnatic music\" and her musical talent was further developed. Here, she specifically identified herself as Bangalore Nagarathnamma.<ref name=Venkataraman/>\n\nThe patronage she received from Justice Narahari Rao made her famous as a \"concert artist\" in Madras. As promoter of Tyagaraja Aradhana, she was the \"first female artist to pay income tax\" in Madras, India.{{sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=xvii}}\n\n==Thyagaraja memorial and Aradhana==\n[[File:Marble notice board at ashram of singer Tyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru.jpg|right|thumb|Marble notice board at ashram of singer Tyagaraja at Thiruvaiyaru]]\nAccording to Nagarathnamma, she was directed in a dream to build a memorial in honour of [[Thyagaraja]] and create a platform for perpetuating Carnatic music. Following this, she turned to an [[ascetic]] way of life and donated all her earnings to this cause.{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=17}}\n\nWhile in Madras, Nagarathnamma was informed by her guru, [[Bidaram Krishnappa]], of the dilapidated status of the [[samadhi]] or tomb of saint Thyagaraja.<ref name=Venkataraman/> Bidaram Krishnappa's disciples, Krishna Bhagavatar and Sundara Bhagavatar, had erected a small edifice made of marble in 1903 and held annual music festivals in honour of Thyagaraja thereafter.<ref name=Shriram/> Within a few years, a feud had erupted among people interested in honouring the saint, and two rival groups were holding two rival concerts at the saint's samadhi. Upkeep of the tiny ediface had suffered and it had quickly fallen into dilapidation. This prompted Nagarathnamma to take steps to restore the samadhi and convert it into a memorial in honour of the Thyagaraja. She acquired the land where Thyagaraja's samadhi was located and built a larger ediface embodying a temple in his honour with her own financial resources. She arranged for an idol of sri Thyagaraja to be installed and consecrated by Brahmin priests and for prayers to be offered daily. The Thyagaraja Temple thus constructed was consecrated in 1921.\n\nAt that time, the music festival held at this location was male-dominated for the simple reason that in thosen days, decent woman would never sing or dance, and these skills were strictly the preserve of the courtesan and the devadasi, the two types of prostitutes found in south India at that time. The idea of one or more prostitutes singing and participating in the annual functions of the shrine was anathema to society, and the rival performing groups therefore prevented Nagarathnamma from participating in the festival, even though she had paid for the renovation and she said that she would not sing or dance like a courtesan, but would only recite [[Harikatha]] in front of the deity. Nevertheless, she was refused. She took this as a challenge and started organizing a parallel music festival at the back of the saint's temple.<ref name=Venkataraman/> Her group was named \"Pengal Katchi\" (women's group), and the Aradhana organized by her was held concurrently with the one organized by the male centric groups of the music festival, known as the \"Periya Katchi\" or \"major group\".<ref name=Shriram/> Eventually, in 1941, her activism paid off, and the opposing groups involved with the festival merged into a single entity, allowing both men and women to sing in the festival.<ref name=Venkataraman/>\n\nThis music festival has become renowned as one of the most popular musical event in [[South India]].{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=17}} This tradition of women musicians' participation at the annual festival, known popularly as the \"[[Thyagaraja Aradhana]]\", along with male musicians, has continued over the years.<ref name=Venkataraman/> In 1927, Nagarathnamma and other devadasis established the Association of the Devadasis of Madras Presidency; she was elected its first president.{{sfn|Muthiah|2011|p=479}}\n\n==Literary pursuits==\nAs an erudite and scholarly person, Nagarathnamma dabbled in editing and publishing books on [[poetry]] and [[anthologies]]. She was a [[linguist]] who held religious discourses not only in Kannada, her mother tongue, but also in other languages such as Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit. During her foray into [[literature]], she came across an old poem called the ''[[Radhika Santawanam]]'' (Appeasing Radhika), which she found inadequately covered vis-a-vis the original version written by [[Muddupalani]], a courtesan herself,{{sfn|Chandra|2014|p=165}} in Telugu verses. This was a book which [[Paidipati Venkatanarasu]] had edited based on the ready to print version, which [[Charles Phillip Brown]], an eminent scholar in Telugu, had prepared and deposited in the [[Oriental Research Institute & Manuscripts Library|Oriental Manuscripts Library]] in 1855.{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=18}} However, Venkatanarasu, an associate of Brown, had printed an annotated version in 1887 (reprinted in 1907),{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=18}} but had deliberately dropped a few erotic verses and also the prologue from the original version as he had considered them inappropriate to the then prevailing social norms. The prologue which he had deleted was related to the devadasi tradition that had been adopted by Nagarathnamma's mother and grandmother. This exclusion was particularly disliked by Nagarthnamma and she made efforts to get the original version written on palm leaves. Once she found the original version, she reedited the ''Radhika Santawanam'', which fully conformed to the palm leaf manuscript version. In 1910,{{sfn|Kramarae|Spender|2000|p=1278}} she published this book with a preface in which she noted that she had read and reread the poetic verses of the book several times for its aesthetic quality. The book, published 150 years after the original manuscript was written by Muddupalani in Telugu, was reviewed by [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]], who, though a supporter of women's causes, attacked some of the erotic contents of the book as totally \"inappropriate for women to hear let alone be uttered from a woman's mouth.\"{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=18}} Nagarathnamma strongly defended her version of the book and counterattacked saying that there was very much more  titillating content included in the book titled ''Vaijayantivilasam'', which the critic (Veeresalingam) had reviewed and accepted for printing. She protested against this double standard and wondered \"Does the question of propriety and embarrassment apply only in the case of women and not men\".{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=19}}\n\nMuddupalani's ''Radhika Santawanam'', edited by Nagarathnamma, was published but received criticism, with one Telugu magazine even noting that \"a prostitute had composed the book and another prostitute had edited it.\"{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=20}} Following the adverse reaction to the book, it was banned. However, with the intervention by Raja Venkatagiri the issue was \"soft-pedaled\". It was alleged that it was a vindictive action by the Veerasilingham lobby, as books with much more  suggestive content had been published. However, after India attained [[Independence of India|independence]] the ban on the book was lifted by [[Tanguturi Prakasam]], the then Chief Minister of Madras, with a comment that \"he was restoring a few pearls to the necklace of [[Telugu literature]]\".{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=20}}\n\n==Death==\nNagarathnamma died in 1952 at the age of 74; a memorial in her honour was erected next to Thyagaraja's samadhi.{{Sfn|Pa\u1e37ani|2011|p=21}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|author=C.

It was engineered by [[Michael Tretow]] who aimed to create a [[Phil Spector]]-like [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]] on the recording.\n\nAlthough their debut album did not bring them to global attention, it follows some standards of ABBA's style. The [[ballad]] is about what people can give each other to make their lives easier and create a better world.\n\n==Reception==\nThe basic aim of the \"People Need Love\" single was not to promote the quartet, since all four individuals had other commitments and did not have the time to form a permanent group (an example of this is the crediting; the single in most of the territories is credited to \"Bj\u00f6rn & Benny, Agnetha & Anni-Frid\"), but to promote the \"Bj\u00f6rn & Benny\" duo, which was the singing and songwriting partnership of the two men. The women were simply guesting on the new \"Bj\u00f6rn & Benny\" single. However, the very positive audience reaction was unexpected.\n\n\"People Need Love\" made the Top 20 of the combined Swedish singles and albums chart, and reached No. 3 on the popular Swedish radio chart show, ''Tio i topp'' (The Top Ten). It was the foursome's first charting record in the [[United States]], where it peaked at No. 114 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] singles chart and No. 117 on [[Record World]] singles chart.

However, the song was included on the album the following year. Although recorded earlier than most of the album, it can retroactively be considered the lead single from ''Ring Ring''.\n\nIn the Netherlands and Belgium the single had its release in August 1973 as the follow-up to the highly successful single ''Ring Ring''.

He recruits baccarat player Evelyn Tremble to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft. Tremble stops Le Chiffre's cheating and beats him in a game of baccarat. Tremble is captured, tortured and killed. Bond establishes that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah; he and Moneypenny travel there to investigate. Dr. Noah turns out to be Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, who plans to use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all tall men, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues, but the building explodes, killing all inside.\n\n===''Never Say Never Again'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Never Say Never Again}}\n\nBond investigates the hijacking of two [[cruise missiles]] with live nuclear warheads which had been taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, SPECTRE's Number One, who directly responds to Blofeld. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima Blush, another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.\n\n==Awards==\nThe Bond films have been nominated for a number of awards throughout their fifty-year history, with most films winning an award; these include successes at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s and [[Academy Award]]s. In addition, in 1982 Albert R. Broccoli received the [[Irving G.

He was a [[Burt Reynolds]] [[lookalike]], which he capitalized on, including working as a stand in for Reynolds in films. In 1982, Gabor met [[Ron Jeremy]] while filming the [[Jerry Lewis]] comedy ''[[Cracking Up (film)|Cracking Up]]''.<ref name=\"Warren\">{{cite news |last1=Warren |first1=Peter |title=Ron Jeremy Remembers Sasha Gabor AVN |url=https://avn.com/business/articles/video/ron-jeremy-remembers-sasha-gabor-53677.html |accessdate=18 January 2020 |work=AVN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711063951/https://avn.com/business/articles/video/ron-jeremy-remembers-sasha-gabor-53677.html |archivedate=10 July 2008}}</ref> Gabor and Jeremy saw each other again at an [[Adult Film Association of America]] gala in 1983. Attendees usually dressed in costumes and Gabor did his Burt Reynolds [[shtick]] including arriving in a black sports car complete with a vanity license plate reading \"[[Smokey and the Bandit|Bandit]]\".<ref name=\"Warren\"/> Gabor told Jeremy he was interested in the [[porn]] industry and Jeremy introduced Gabor to his adult film industry contacts. He was 38 when he made his first adult film.<ref name=\"Hunter\"/>\n\nGabor acted regularly in films by Bobby Bouchard. He performed in Burt Reynolds parody porn films, using the stage name '''Turd Wrenolds'''. He co-starred in the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' parody ''All-American Girls in Heat''.<ref name=\"Warren\"/><ref name=\"Stenerud\">{{cite web |last1=Stenerud |first1=David |title=Pornoen stjeler stjernene |url=https://www.seher.no/kjendis/pornoen-stjeler-stjernene/64920637 |website=Se og H\u00f8r |accessdate=18 January 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929023812/http://www.seher.no/kjendis/pornoen-stjeler-stjernene-16262 |archivedate=29 September 2015 |language=no |date=10 August 2007}}</ref> Gabor also had [[plastic surgery]] to appear more like Reynolds.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nGabor was also a regular in Jeremy's films in the late 1980s, when Jeremy was a director for Leisure Time Entertainment. They filmed many films together, including 20 to 30 films on [[houseboat]]s at [[Lake Mead]] with Samantha Strong and [[Tracey Adams]], the result of having to film out of state due to [[obscenity]] laws in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Hunter\"/> Gabor's alcohol abuse often impacted his ability to get an [[erection]], and Jeremy would often stand in for Gabor. Jeremy estimated that one-third of Gabor's films showed Jeremy's circumcised penis in lieu of Gabors uncircumcised penis. Jeremy would serve as one of Gabor's bestfriends throughout Gabor's life.<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nHe traveled frequently to [[Thailand]], where he'd vacation and also get plastic surgery, which he documented in photographs. Gabor stopped dying his hair black and let it go gray and got plastic surgery to look more like [[Sean Connery]]. Back in the United States, he worked as a Connery lookalike outside of porn, attending special events. Gabor lived in [[Marina del Rey, California]] followed by [[Tampa, Florida]].<ref name=\"Warren\"/>\n\nHe retired from acting in 2001 and moved back to Norway after too many alcohol-related arrests and to escape from paying [[child support]].<ref name=\"Hunter\"/><ref name=\"Warren\"/> In Norway, Gabor planned to direct the first Norwegian professional porn film.<ref name=\"Haga\"/> In 2007, Gabor said he was going to direct a [[S\u00e1mi people|S\u00e1mi]]-themed adult film in [[Kautokeino]], Norway.
