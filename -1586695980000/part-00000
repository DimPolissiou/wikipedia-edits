He was known by the nickname '''Colonel House''', although he had performed no military service.  He was a highly influential back-stage politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912.  Having a self-effacing manner, he did not hold office but was an \"executive agent\", Wilson's chief advisor on European politics and diplomacy during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318) and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. In 1919 Wilson, suffering from a series of small strokes, broke with House and many other top advisors, believing they had deceived him at Paris.\n\n==Early years==\n\nHe was born July 26, 1858 in [[Houston, Texas]], the last of seven children<!-- He was the son of Houston mayor [[Thomas William House Sr.]], a gunrunner during the [[US Civil War]] who amassed a fortune.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} --> of Mary Elizabeth (Shearn) and [[Thomas William House Sr.]] His father an emigrant from England by way of New Orleans, who became a prominent Houston businessman, with a large role in developing the city and served a term as its mayor.  An ardent Confederate, he had also sent blockade runners against the [[Union blockade]] in the Gulf of Mexico during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=TSHA/><ref>{{cite web\n  |<!-- authorlink=Julia Beazley --> |first=Julia |last=Beazley |title=HOUSE, THOMAS WILLIAM\n  |work=Handbook of Texas Online  |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association\n  |accessdate=2014-07-12 |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho68}}</ref>\n\nHouse attended Houston Academy<!-- probably not the one founded 1970 in Alabama -->, a school in [[Bath, England]], a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in [[Virginia]], and [[Hopkins Grammar School]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref name=TSHA/>\nHe went on to study at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], in 1877 where he was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity.

He eventually sold the [[cotton]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s, and invested in [[banking]]. He was a founder of the [[Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway]].  House moved to New York City about 1902.\n\nIn 1912, House published anonymously a novel called ''[[Philip Dru: Administrator]]'', in which the title character leads the democratic western U.S. in a civil war against the [[plutocratic]] East, becoming the dictator of America. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms which resemble the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Moose platform of 1912]] and then vanishes.<ref>Lasch, pp. 230\u201335.</ref>\n\nHouse helped to make four men [[governor of Texas]]: [[Jim Hogg|James S. Hogg]] (1892), [[Charles Allen Culberson|Charles A. Culberson]] (1894), [[Joseph D. Sayers]] (1898), and [[S. W. T. Lanham]] (1902). After their elections, House acted as unofficial advisor to each.  In 1893, Hogg appointed House to his military staff with the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], a position which came with a title but no actual military responsibilities.<ref name=Volume_1>{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Rupert Norval |date=1964 |title=Colonel Edward M.

Plate LXXXV]]\n\nA \"cosmopolitan progressive\" who examined political developments in Europe, House was an admirer of the British [[Liberal welfare reforms]] instigated between 1906 and 1914, noting to a friend in June 1911 that [[David Lloyd George]]\n\n<blockquote>is working out the problems which are nearest my heart and that is the equalization of opportunity \u2026.

He became an intimate of Wilson and helped set up his administration.\n\nHouse was offered the cabinet position of his choice (except for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], which was already pledged to [[William Jennings Bryan]]) but declined, choosing instead \"to serve wherever and whenever possible.\" House was even provided living quarters within the White House.\n\nHe continued as an advisor to Wilson particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson's chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917\u20131919) and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nIn the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 presidential election]], House declined any public role but was Wilson's top campaign advisor: \"he planned its structure; set its tone; guided its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign's greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Godfrey Hodgson|title=Woodrow Wilson's right hand: the life of Colonel Edward M.

However, Wilson's second wife, [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith]], of whom he had commissioned the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury]] (1862\u20131947) to paint a portrait in 1916, disliked House, and his position weakened. It is believed that her personal animosity was significantly responsible for Wilson's eventual decision to break with House.\n\n[[File:ColonelHouse.PNG|thumb|right|225px|Col.

He spent much of 1915 and 1916 in Europe, trying to negotiate peace through diplomacy. He was enthusiastic but lacked deep insight into European affairs and relied on the information received from British diplomats, especially the British foreign secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], to shape his outlook.  Nicholas Ferns argues that  Grey's ideas meshed with House's. Grey's diplomatic goal was to establish close Anglo-American relations; he deliberately built  a close connection to further that aim. Thereby Grey re-enforced House's pro-Allied proclivities so that Wilson's chief advisor promoted the British position.<ref>Nicolas Ferns, \"Loyal Advisor? Colonel Edward House's Confidential Trips to Europe, 1913\u20131917.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 24.3 (2013): 365-382.</ref>\n\nAfter a German U-boat sank without warning the British passenger liner {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} on 7 May 1915, with  128  Americans among the 1198 dead, many Americans called for war. The ship was carrying war munitions, although this was not publicly revealed at the time.<ref>http://www.centenarynews.com/article?id=1616</ref>{{vc|date=April 2018}} Wilson demanded that Germany respect American neutral rights, and especially not sink merchant ships or passenger liners without giving the passengers and crew the opportunity to get into lifeboats, as required by international law.  Tension escalated with Germany, until Germany agreed to Wilson's terms. House felt that the war was an epic battle between democracy and autocracy; he argued the United States ought to help Britain and France win a limited Allied victory. However, Wilson still insisted on neutrality.\n\nHouse played a major role in shaping wartime diplomacy. He supported [[Thomas Garrigue Masaryk]] Czechoslovak legions especially in Russia as well<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

Wilson had House assemble \"[[The Inquiry]]\", a team of academic experts to devise efficient postwar solutions to all the world's problems. In September 1918, Wilson gave House the responsibility for preparing a constitution for a [[League of Nations]]. In October 1918, when Germany petitioned for peace based on the [[Fourteen Points]], Wilson charged House with working out details of an [[armistice]] with the Allies.\n\n[[File:Edward Mandell House cph.3b17553.jpg|thumb|left|237px|Edward M. House in 1920]]\n\n==Paris conference==\n\nHouse helped Wilson outline his [[Fourteen Points]] and worked with the president on the drafting of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. House served on the [[League of Nations Mandate|League of Nations Commission on Mandates]] with [[Lord Milner]] and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] of Great Britain, Henri Simon<ref>[[Margaret MacMillan|MacMillan, Margaret]]. ''Paris 1919''. New York, Random House, 2002</ref> of France, [[Chinda Sutemi|Viscount Chinda]] of Japan, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] of Italy, and [[George Louis Beer]] as adviser. On May 30, 1919 House participated in a meeting in Paris which laid the groundwork for establishment of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR). Throughout 1919, House urged Wilson to work with Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] to achieve ratification of the [[Versailles Treaty]], but Wilson refused to deal with Lodge or any other senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].\n   \nThe conference revealed serious policy disagreements and personality conflicts between Wilson and House. Wilson became less tolerant and broke with his closest advisors, one after another. Later, he dismissed House's son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, from the American peace commission when it became known the young man was making derogatory comments about him.<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.

The following month, Wilson returned to Paris. He decided that House had taken too many liberties in negotiations,  and relegated him to the sidelines. After they returned to the US later that year, the two men never saw or spoke to each other again.<ref name=Berg/><!--page=601}}-->\n\nIn the 1920s, House strongly supported membership of both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].\n\nIn 1932, House supported [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the presidency without joining his inner circle. Although he became disillusioned with the course of the [[New Deal]] after Roosevelt's election, he expressed his reservations only privately.  House was a confidant of [[William E. Dodd]], Roosevelt's first Ambassador to [[Nazi Germany]], acting at times as Dodd's intermediary with the White House and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].<ref>[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks. pp. 38, 136, 152, 217, 245 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nHouse died on March 28, 1938 in [[Manhattan, New York City]], following a bout of [[pleurisy]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Colonel House Dies Here At Age Of 79.

He was known by the nickname '''Colonel House''', although he had performed no military service.  He was a highly influential back-stage politician in Texas before becoming a key supporter of the presidential bid of Wilson in 1912.  Having a self-effacing manner, he did not hold office but was an \"executive agent\", Wilson's chief advisor on European politics and diplomacy during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318) and at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. In 1919 Wilson, suffering from a series of small strokes, broke with House and many other top advisors, believing they had deceived him at Paris.\n\n==Early years==\n\nHe was born July 26, 1858 in [[Houston, Texas]], the last of seven children<!-- He was the son of Houston mayor [[Thomas William House Sr.]], a gunrunner during the [[US Civil War]] who amassed a fortune.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} --> of Mary Elizabeth (Shearn) and [[Thomas William House Sr.]] His father an emigrant from England by way of New Orleans who became a prominent Houston businessman with a large role in developing the city and served a term as its mayor.  An ardent Confederate, he had also sent blockade runners against the [[Union blockade]] in the Gulf of Mexico during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=TSHA/><ref>{{cite web\n  |<!-- authorlink=Julia Beazley --> |first=Julia |last=Beazley |title=HOUSE, THOMAS WILLIAM\n  |work=Handbook of Texas Online  |date=June 15, 2010 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association\n  |accessdate=2014-07-12 |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fho68}}</ref>\n\nHouse attended Houston Academy<!-- probably not the one founded 1970 in Alabama -->, a school in [[Bath, England]], a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] in [[Virginia]], and [[Hopkins Grammar School]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref name=TSHA/>\nHe went on to study at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]], in 1877 where he was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity.

He eventually sold the [[cotton]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s, and invested in [[banking]]. He was a founder of the [[Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway]].  House moved to New York City about 1902.\n\nIn 1912, House published anonymously a novel called ''[[Philip Dru: Administrator]]'', in which the title character leads the democratic western U.S. in a civil war against the [[plutocratic]] East, becoming the dictator of America. Dru as dictator imposes a series of reforms which resemble the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Bull Moose platform of 1912]] and then vanishes.<ref>Lasch, pp. 230\u201335.</ref>\n\nHouse helped to make four men [[governor of Texas]]: [[Jim Hogg|James S. Hogg]] (1892), [[Charles Allen Culberson|Charles A. Culberson]] (1894), [[Joseph D. Sayers]] (1898), and [[S. W. T. Lanham]] (1902). After their elections, House acted as unofficial advisor to each.  In 1893, Hogg appointed House to his military staff with the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], a position which came with a title but no actual military responsibilities.<ref name=Volume_1>{{cite book |last=Richardson |first=Rupert Norval |date=1964 |title=Colonel Edward M.

He became an intimate of Wilson and helped set up his administration.\n\nHouse was offered the cabinet position of his choice (except for [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], which was already pledged to [[William Jennings Bryan]]) but declined, choosing instead \"to serve wherever and whenever possible.\" House was even provided living quarters within the White House.\n\nHe continued as an advisor to Wilson particularly in the area of foreign affairs. House functioned as Wilson's chief negotiator in Europe during the negotiations for peace (1917\u20131919) and as chief deputy for Wilson at the Paris Peace Conference.\n\nIn the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 presidential election]], House declined any public role but was Wilson's top campaign advisor: \"he planned its structure; set its tone; guided its finance; chose speakers, tactics, and strategy; and, not least, handled the campaign's greatest asset and greatest potential liability: its brilliant but temperamental candidate.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Godfrey Hodgson|title=Woodrow Wilson's right hand: the life of Colonel Edward M.

However, Wilson's second wife, [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson|Edith]], of whom he had commissioned the Swiss-born American artist [[Adolfo M\u00fcller-Ury]] (1862\u20131947) to paint a portrait in 1916, disliked House, and his position weakened. It is believed that her personal animosity was significantly responsible for Wilson's eventual decision to break with House.\n\n[[File:ColonelHouse.PNG|thumb|right|225px|Col.

He spent much of 1915 and 1916 in Europe, trying to negotiate peace through diplomacy. He was enthusiastic but lacked deep insight into European affairs and relied on the information received from British diplomats, especially the British foreign secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], to shape his outlook.  Nicholas Ferns argues that  Grey's ideas meshed with House's. Grey's diplomatic goal was to establish close Anglo-American relations; he deliberately built  a close connection to further that aim. Thereby Grey re-enforced House's pro-Allied proclivities so that Wilson's chief advisor promoted the British position.<ref>Nicolas Ferns, \"Loyal Advisor? Colonel Edward House's Confidential Trips to Europe, 1913\u20131917.\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' 24.3 (2013): 365-382.</ref>\n\nAfter a German U-boat sank without warning the British passenger liner {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} on 7 May 1915, with  128  Americans among the 1198 dead, many Americans called for war. The ship was carrying war munitions, although this was not publicly revealed at the time.<ref>http://www.centenarynews.com/article?id=1616</ref>{{vc|date=April 2018}} Wilson demanded that Germany respect American neutral rights, and especially not sink merchant ships or passenger liners without giving the passengers and crew the opportunity to get into lifeboats, as required by international law.  Tension escalated with Germany, until Germany agreed to Wilson's terms. House felt that the war was an epic battle between democracy and autocracy; he argued the United States ought to help Britain and France win a limited Allied victory. However, Wilson still insisted on neutrality.\n\nHouse played a major role in shaping wartime diplomacy. He supported [[Thomas Garrigue Masaryk]] Czechoslovak legions especially in Russia as well<ref>PRECL\u00cdK, Vratislav.

Wilson had House assemble \"[[The Inquiry]]\", a team of academic experts to devise efficient postwar solutions to all the world's problems. In September 1918, Wilson gave House the responsibility for preparing a constitution for a [[League of Nations]]. In October 1918, when Germany petitioned for peace based on the [[Fourteen Points]], Wilson charged House with working out details of an [[armistice]] with the Allies.\n\n[[File:Edward Mandell House cph.3b17553.jpg|thumb|left|237px|Edward M. House in 1920]]\n\n==Paris conference==\n\nHouse helped Wilson outline his [[Fourteen Points]] and worked with the president on the drafting of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. House served on the [[League of Nations Mandate|League of Nations Commission on Mandates]] with [[Lord Milner]] and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]] of Great Britain, Henri Simon<ref>[[Margaret MacMillan|MacMillan, Margaret]]. ''Paris 1919''. New York, Random House, 2002</ref> of France, [[Chinda Sutemi|Viscount Chinda]] of Japan, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] of Italy, and [[George Louis Beer]] as adviser. On May 30, 1919 House participated in a meeting in Paris which laid the groundwork for establishment of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR). Throughout 1919, House urged Wilson to work with Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] to achieve ratification of the [[Versailles Treaty]], but Wilson refused to deal with Lodge or any other senior [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].\n   \nThe conference revealed serious policy disagreements and personality conflicts between Wilson and House. Wilson became less tolerant and broke with his closest advisors, one after another. Later, he dismissed House's son-in-law, Gordon Auchincloss, from the American peace commission when it became known the young man was making derogatory comments about him.<ref name=Berg>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=A.

The following month, Wilson returned to Paris. He decided that House had taken too many liberties in negotiations,  and relegated him to the sidelines. After they returned to the US later that year, the two men never saw or spoke to each other again.<ref name=Berg/><!--page=601}}-->\n\nIn the 1920s, House strongly supported membership of both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].\n\nIn 1932, House supported [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for the presidency without joining his inner circle. Although he became disillusioned with the course of the [[New Deal]] after Roosevelt's election, he expressed his reservations only privately.  House was a confidant of [[William E. Dodd]], Roosevelt's first Ambassador to [[Nazi Germany]], acting at times as Dodd's intermediary with the White House and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].<ref>[[Erik Larson (author)|Larson, Erik]] (2011) ''[[In the Garden of Beasts]]'' New York: Broadway Paperbacks. pp. 38, 136, 152, 217, 245 {{isbn|978-0-307-40885-3}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\n\nHouse died on March 28, 1938 in [[Manhattan, New York City]], following a bout of [[pleurisy]].<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=Colonel House Dies Here At Age Of 79.

He believes that Nina overdosed when she found out about his affair with [[Ava Jerome]], and has been in a coma for 20 years. However, Nina's brother, Detective [[Nathan West (General Hospital)|Nathan West]], believes Silas tried to kill her, and investigates the case. He finds out that it was actually Nina's mother [[Madeline Reeves]], who tried to kill Nina, because Nina was pregnant with Silas' child. She wanted to get rid of Nina's baby, and accidentally put her own daughter in a coma. Madeline tells Nathan that Nina has died, but later says that she only had Nina declared dead to get the inheritance that was left to Nina by Madeline's late husband.\n\nNina first appears onscreen in May 2014, waking up from her coma. Roughly a month later, Nina arrives in Port Charles, and shocks a bewildered Silas with her presence. Both Silas and Nathan are happy that she's alive, but Nina soon has to find out that much has changed. She is introduced to [[Kiki Jerome]], Silas' daughter with Ava. Silas is also now dating [[Sam McCall|Sam Morgan]], despite Nina still showing an interest in him. After first not being aware that Silas and Sam are a couple, Nina claims to be fine with it; accepting the end of her marriage; and tells Silas that it would only be natural for his life to go on. However it is later revealed that Nina has been awake for longer than she says and that she trashed Silas' apartment a few months back. Nina in fact wants revenge on everyone that wronged her. Nina married [[Ric Lansing]] on May 18, 2015.\n\nIn November 2015, Nina goes to [[Julian Jerome]], who owns ''Crimson'' magazine under his media empire, for a job. She ends up getting the job of [[editor-in-chief]] since the former had left the magazine. She works closely with [[Maxie Jones]]. When Nina and Maxie need someone to take pictures for the Nutcracker Gala, Maxie has an idea that [[Dillon Quartermaine]] (Robert Palmer Watkins) should stay in town, work for Nina, and take pictures of everyone at the Gala.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/general-hospital-previews-their-nutcracker-gala-with-first-look-photos/2015/12/06/|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 6, 2015|work=Michael Fairman On-Air On-Soaps|last1=Fairman|first1=Michael|title=General Hospital Previews Their Nutcracker Gala With First Look Photos!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghdailydish.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-nutcracker-gala.html|accessdate=December 29, 2015|date=December 21, 2015|work=GH Daily Blog|title=The Nutcracker Gala}}</ref> In October 2018, a DNA test is arranged by Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) and confirms that Sasha Gilmore is Nina's daughter; however, it is later revealed that Valentin hired her to pretend to be her daughter.

It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it is [[Claude Rains]]'s final film role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] ([[magi]]) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence{{mdash}}and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple{{mdash}}[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]{{mdash}}laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child\" and \"flee\".\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies shortly after being informed that apparently \"not one is alive\". However, Joseph and Mary have [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's son, [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come\".\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan, baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[Hermit|hermit]]{{mdash}}a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men{{mdash}}[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]{{mdash}}ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter\". They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James's brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them. After some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[Synagogue|synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land and two more men, named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate--among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with his wife's encouragement--she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms that Jesus has escaped from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]] by beheading, which occurs while [[Salome]], Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus's miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], prompting Jesus to anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church\".\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnesses Jerusalem citizens but concerns the Pharisees.\n\nSoon after, when Judas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], he explains that she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates. Many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him. The Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do\".\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[Thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus{{mdash}}who refuses to take part{{mdash}}notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus. Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus's reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to the tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus{{mdash}}and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]{{mdash}}finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Herod, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises: that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice. They choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world\", something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then carries his cross [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures to the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers allow a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do\", and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus give to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus ask why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges. As an earthquake begins, a centurion states that \"truly this man was the son of God\".\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, though Thomas has weakened faith, Mary Magdalene{{mdash}}along with Peter and others{{mdash}}recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb. Word quickly spreads throughout Jerusalem, the miraculous event bewildering the Pharisees. Caiaphas claims that \"the whole thing will be forgotten in a week\", while an elder scribe doubts this.\n\n[[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascends to heaven]] before his disciples, Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Joseph of Arimathea, and others, leaving them with his final commands as a clouds engulfs him. He then states that he will always be with them, \"even unto the end of the world\".\n\n==Cast==\nThe major roles in the movie are these:\n* [[Max von Sydow]] as [[Jesus]]\n* [[Dorothy McGuire]] as [[Mary mother of Jesus|the Virgin Mary]]\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[John the Baptist]]\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Herod the Great]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as [[Herod Antipas]]\n* [[Telly Savalas]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* [[Martin Landau]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n* [[David McCallum]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as \"The Dark Hermit\" (a personification of [[Satan]])\n* [[Michael Anderson Jr.]] as [[James the Just]]\n* [[Roddy McDowall]] as [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]]\n* [[Joanna Dunham]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n* [[Joseph Schildkraut]] as [[Nicodemus]]\n* [[Ed Wynn]] as \"Old Aram\"\n\nSmaller, credited roles (some only a few seconds) were played by [[Michael Ansara]], [[Carroll Baker]], [[Ina Balin]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Victor Buono]], [[John Considine (actor)|John Considine]], [[Richard Conte]], [[John Crawford (actor)|John Crawford]], [[Cyril Delevanti]], [[Jamie Farr]], [[David Hedison]], [[Van Heflin]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[Robert Loggia]], [[John Lupton]], [[Janet Margolin]], [[Sal Mineo]], [[Nehemiah Persoff]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Gary Raymond]], [[Marian Seldes]], [[David Sheiner]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]], [[Michael Tolan]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Shelley Winters]]. [[Richard Bakalyan]] and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]] played the thieves crucified with Jesus in uncredited roles.\n\n==Pre-production==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame.\" Perigree Books, 1984. {{ISBN|0-399-50714-0}}</ref> [[Darryl F.

Stevens created a company, \"The Greatest Story Productions\", to film the novel<ref name=\"GI\"/> and Fox set a budget of $10 million, twice their previous biggest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Three Epics Based on Christ|page=20|date=November 26, 1958|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n247/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greatest-Story-1960.jpg|thumb|Pre-production poster from 1960, with [[John Wayne]] as the Centurion]]\nThe screenplay took two years to write. Stevens collaborated with [[Ivan Moffat]] and then with [[James Lee Barrett]]. It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed.<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Reginald Rose]] were considered but neither participated. The poet [[Carl Sandburg]] was solicited, though it is not certain if any of his contributions were included. Sandburg, however, did receive screen credit for \"creative association\".<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>The movie's opening credits include: ''Screenplay by James Lee Barrett and George Stevens, based on the Books of the Old and New Testaments, Other Ancient Writings, the Writings of Fulton Oursler and Henry Denker, and in Creative Association with Carl Sandburg'' (see ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 136)</ref>\n\nFinancial excesses began to grow during pre-production. Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens traveled to the Vatican to see [[Pope John XXIII]] for advice.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nIn August 1961, 20th Century Fox withdrew from the project, noting that $2.3 million had been spent without any footage being shot. Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with its own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and is nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n==Casting==\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. \"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.\" HarperCollins, 2001. {{ISBN|0-06-093507-3}}</ref> Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.<ref>''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 138</ref>\n\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' features an ensemble of well-known actors, many in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n==Production==\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Cinematographer [[William C. Mellor]] had a fatal heart attack during production; [[Loyal Griggs]], who won an [[Academy Award]] for his cinematography on Stevens's 1953 Western classic ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', was brought in to replace him. Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962\u20131963, when Arizona had heavy snow.

The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|20|1963}} million in {{Inflation-year|USD}}) plus additional editing and promotion charges,<ref name=\"Shame p. 142\">''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 142</ref> making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>\"Such giants as ''Cleopatra'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia'' did boast bigger budgets, but they were shot on foreign soil.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\nThe film was advertised on its first run as being shown in [[Cinerama]]. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary schools, and secondary schools. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes, and photographs that toured museums around the country.  Promotional items made available to groups identified for [[market segmentation]] included school study guides, children's books, and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders, and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maresco |first1=Peter A. |title=Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: Market Segmentation, Mass Marketing and Promotion, and the Internet |journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.8.1.002}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' premiered February 15, 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City. Critical reaction toward the movie was divided once it premiered. In its favor, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film \"a big, powerful moving picture demonstrating vast cinematic resource\". ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated: \"George Stevens has created a novel, reverent and important film with his view of this crucial event in the history of mankind.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote: \"The most distracting nonsense is the pop-up of familiar faces in so-called cameo roles, jarring the illusion.\" [[Shana Alexander]] in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' stated: \"The pace was so stupefying that I felt not uplifted \u2013 but sandbagged!\"<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] \u2013 later notorious as the frequently scathing theater and film critic of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' \u2013 wrote: \"God is unlucky in ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.

It is a retelling of the Biblical account about [[Jesus Christ|Jesus of Nazareth]], from the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] through to the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. Along with the [[ensemble cast]], it marked [[Claude Rains]]'s final film role.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Biblical Magi|Three wise men]] ([[magi]]) follow a brightly shining star from Asia to [[Jerusalem]] in search of a newborn king. They are summoned by King [[Herod the Great]], whose advisers inform him of a [[Messiah]] mentioned in various prophecies. When Herod remembers that the prophecy names nearby [[Bethlehem]] as the child's birthplace, he sends the Magi there to confirm the child's existence--and secretly sends guards to follow them and \"keep [him] informed.\" In Bethlehem, the Magi find a married couple--[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]--laying their [[Nativity of Jesus|newborn son in a manger]]. Mary states that his name is [[Jesus]]. As [[Annunciation to the shepherds|the local shepherds]] watch, the Magi present gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh to the infant. After observing the distant spies' departure, the magi leave as an angel's voice warns Joseph to \"take the child,\" and \"flee.\"\n\nThe spies inform Herod, who decides to kill the child. He orders [[Massacre of the Innocents|the death of every newborn boy in Bethlehem]], and dies shortly after being informed that [apparently] \"not one is alive.\" However, Joseph and Mary have [[Flight into Egypt|escaped into Egypt]] with Jesus; when a messenger informs them and others of Herod's death, they return to their hometown of [[Nazareth]].\n\nA pro-Israel rebellion breaks out in Jerusalem against Herod's son, [[Herod Antipas]], but the conflict is quickly quashed. [[Herodian kingdom|Herod's kingdom]] is divided, [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] is placed under a governor, and Herod becomes of [[Herodian Tetrarchy|tetrarch]] of [[Galilee]] and the [[Jordan River]]. Both he and the Romans are convinced that the Messiah the troubled people cry for is \"someone who will never come.\"\n\nMany years later, a prophet named [[John the Baptist]] appears and preaches at the Jordan, baptizing many who come to repent. When a grown Jesus appears to him, John [[Baptism of Jesus|baptizes him]]. Jesus then ascends into the nearby desert mountains, where he finds a cave in which resides a mysterious [[Hermit|hermit]]--a personification of [[Satan]]. The Dark Hermit [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus three times]], but each temptation is overcome by Jesus, who leaves and continues climbing as John's message echoes in his mind.\n\nHe returns to the valley, where he tells the Baptist that he is returning to Galilee. Four men--[[Judas Iscariot]] and the Galilean fishermen [[Andrew the Apostle|Andrew]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]--ask to go with him; Jesus welcomes them, promising to make them \"[[Fishers of men|fishers of men]]\". When they rest under a bridge, he gives parables and other teachings, which attract the attention of a passing young man named [[James the Less|James]]; he asks to join them the next morning, and Jesus welcomes him. The group comes near Jerusalem, and Jesus says that \"there will come a time to enter.\" They rest at a home in [[Bethany]] occupied by [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] and his sisters [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany|Mary]]. Lazarus asks Jesus if he could join him, but cannot bring himself to leave all he has; before leaving, Jesus promises Lazarus that he will not forget him.\n\nThe group soon arrives at [[Capernaum]], where they meet James' brother [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], a tax collector whom Jesus soon asks to join them. After some thought, Matthew does so. In the local [[Synagogue|synagogue]], Jesus teaches again, and miraculously [[Healing the paralytic at Capernaum|helps a crippled man to walk again]]. Upon seeing this, many begin to follow Jesus on his journey and gather to listen to his teachings.\n\nMeanwhile, the Jerusalem priests and [[Pharisees]] are troubled by the continuing influence and preaching of the Baptist, while the governor [[Pontius Pilate]] wishes only to maintain peace. Since the Jordan is ruled by Herod, he allows the priests to inform him. When he hears that the Baptist is speaking of a Messiah, Herod sends soldiers to arrest him. [[Simon the Zealot|A Zealot named Simon]] informs Jesus and his disciples of the Baptist's arrest; he is welcomed as one.\n\nThe fame of Jesus begins to spread across the land and two more men, named [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] and [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], join him. In Jerusalem, the priests become suspicious of Jesus and the curing of the cripple, and send a group to Capernaum to investigate--among them the Pharisees [[Nicodemus]] and [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. Herod hears rumors about an army due to the multitudes that follow Jesus, and questions John the Baptist about him. Herod begins to consider killing the Baptist, with his wife's encouragement--she herself is the ex-wife of Herod's brother, and has been attacked by John for being adulterous.\n\nJesus is soon asked to return to Capernaum by another man named [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]. Crowds gather and celebrate his return, something that is noticed by the Pharisees who are present and the returned Dark Hermit. Jesus then defends [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|a woman caught in the act of adultery]], who identifies herself as \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary of Magdalene]]\". Among the crowd that gathers as he moves away is [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|a sick woman who is cured when she touches his clothes]]. Both of these instances cause many to have faith in Jesus.\n\nHerod begins to wonder about Jesus, and the Baptist confirms Jesus' escape from the massacre ordered by Herod's father. Herod then decides to finally [[Beheading of John the Baptist|kill the Baptist]]--the moment of beheading occurs while [[Salome]], Herod's stepdaughter by his wife's first marriage, dances for him. When the Baptist is dead, Herod sends soldiers to arrest Jesus.\n\nJesus gives a [[Sermon on the Mount|sermon on a mountain to a great crowd]], while Pilate and the Pharisees hear of many of Jesus' miracles: [[Marriage at Cana|turning water into wine]], [[Feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]], and [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. While resting, Jesus asks his disciples who they and others say that he is: they give many answers, and [[Confession of Peter|Peter believes that Jesus is the Messiah]], a response that has Jesus anoint him as \"the rock on which [he] will build [his] church.\"\n\nAt Nazareth, the people [[Hometown rejection of Jesus|refuse to believe in Jesus and his miracles]] and demand to see for themselves by bringing a blind man named Aram and demanding that Jesus make him see. When he does not, the people are disgusted when he calls himself the Son of God, and briefly stone him. Jesus reunites with his mother, along with a sick Lazarus and his sisters. Andrew and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Nathaniel]] escort Lazarus home to Bethany, while Jesus and the others flee from Herod's approaching soldiers, but not before Jesus heals Aram's sight. When informed that Lazarus is dying, Jesus does not go immediately to Bethany, but to the Jordan where the group [[The Lord's Prayer|gives a prayer]]. Andrew and Nathaniel return, informing them that Lazarus has died, and Jesus then goes to Bethany where he [[Resurrection of Lazarus|brings Lazarus back to life]], a miracle that amazes the witnesses Jerusalem citizens but concerns the Pharisees.\n\nSoon after, when Judas questions why Mary Magdalene is [[Anointing of Jesus|anointing Jesus with expensive oil]], he explains that she is preparing him for his death. Jesus then dons a new garment, and [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|rides on a donkey into Jerusalem]]. In the courtyard of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], Jesus [[Cleansing of the Temple|drives the merchants and money changers away]], and the large crowd prevents the Pharisees from arresting Jesus, an action ordered even though it is [[Passover]]. He teaches in the Temple courtyard, and leaves when Pilate dispatches soldiers to restore peace and close the gates--many of the Temple's crowd are killed as a result.\n\nWhile the disciples gather to prepare and partake in [[Last Supper|an evening meal]], Judas leaves and promises to hand Jesus over to the Pharisees on the condition that no harm comes to him--the Dark Hermit's presence indicates approaching danger. When Judas returns to the meal, Jesus announces to all that [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|one of them will betray him]], that by morning [[Denial of Peter|Peter will deny three times that he even knows Jesus]], and gives a [[Farewell Discourse|farewell discourse]]. Jesus then gives [[Origin of the Eucharist|bread and wine]] to the disciples, and tells Judas before he leaves again to \"do quickly what [he has] to do.\"\n\n[[Agony in the Garden|Jesus then prays at Gethsemane]] while Judas is paid [[Thirty pieces of silver|thirty pieces of silver]] to lead soldiers to [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest Jesus]]. When they arrive, [[Kiss of Judas|Judas kisses Jesus]], and Jesus orders Peter to \"put back [his] sword\". Jesus is [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|put on trial before the Sanhedrin]], and Aram appears as one of the questioned witnesses. Most of the members are present, as Nicodemus--who refuses to take part--notices that many (including Joseph of Arimathea) are absent. Meanwhile, the Hermit is outside and asks the nearby Peter if he knows Jesus--Peter denies it twice and leaves. When [[Caiaphas]] asks Jesus if he is the Christ, Jesus' reply causes the members to condemn him.\n\nThe Pharisees and Caiaphas [[Pilate's court|bring Jesus to a tired Pilate]], who after questioning Jesus--and briefly speaking with [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]]--finds no guilt in Jesus. Since Galilee is under Herod's authority, [[Jesus at Herod's court|Jesus is sent to Herod]], though he and his soldiers merely [[Mocking of Jesus|ridicule him]] and send him back to Pilate. As Jesus is escorted back to Herod, the Hermit continues to observe, and Peter once again denies Jesus, as a remorseful Judas looks on.\n\nIn the morning, [[Ecce homo|Pilate presents Jesus before the assembled crowd]], and the Hermit begins various cries for Jesus to be [[Crucifixion|crucified]]. Pilate offers compromises--that Jesus merely be scourged, and then the release of a prisoner of the crowd's choice (they choose the supposed murderer [[Barabbas]] instead. Pilate then asks Jesus if he has anything to say; Jesus merely states that his kingdom is \"not of this world,\" something that the Hermit and others claim is a challenge of the authority of Rome the Roman emperor. With no other choice, Pilate reluctantly orders Jesus to be crucified.\n\nJesus then carries his cross [[Via Dolorosa|through Jerusalem]] while the crowd looks on. When he collapses, [[Saint Veronica|a woman wipes his face]] and he reassures to the women of Jerusalem. Soon, the soldiers allow a man named [[Simon of Cyrene]] to help Jesus carry the cross when no one else will. At [[Golgotha]], Jesus is stripped and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|nailed to the cross]], which is then raised between those of two other men while Judas throws his silver into the Temple and throws himself into the fire of the nearby altar. He asks God to \"forgive them, for they know not what they do,\" and leaves his mother in the care of John. While one of the thieves asks Jesus to save them, the other accepts his punishment and asks for Jesus to remember him, a promise that Jesus give to him. As the sky darkens, Jesus ask why God has forsaken him, is offered wine in a sponge, and dies before a storm emerges. A centurion states that \"truly this man was the son of God\" as an earthquake begins.\n\nPeter mourns Jesus while he is laid to rest in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea. The Pharisees ask for Pilate to place guards around the tomb and seal it to prevent a possible theft of the corpse that could potentially fulfill a prophecy of [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]; Pilate agrees, but on the morning of the third day the guards discover the tomb is open and empty. Meanwhile, despite Thomas' weakened faith, Mary Magdalene--along with Peter and others--recall the prophecy and run to see the empty tomb.

[[Richard Bakalyan]] and [[Marc Cavell (actor)|Marc Cavell]] played the thieves crucified with Jesus in uncredited roles.\n\n==Pre-production==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' originated as a U.S. radio series in 1947, half-hour episodes inspired by [[gospel|the Gospel]]s. The series was adapted into a 1949 novel by [[Fulton Oursler]], a senior editor at [[Reader's Digest]].<ref name=\"HHS\">Medved, Harry & Michael. \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame.\" Perigree Books, 1984. {{ISBN|0-399-50714-0}}</ref> [[Darryl F.

Stevens created a company, \"The Greatest Story Productions\", to film the novel<ref name=\"GI\"/> and Fox set a budget of $10 million, twice their previous biggest.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Three Epics Based on Christ|page=20|date=November 26, 1958|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/variety212-1958-11#page/n247/mode/1up|via=[[Archive.org]]|accessdate=May 27, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greatest-Story-1960.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-production poster from 1960, with [[John Wayne]] as the Centurion]]\nThe screenplay took two years to write. Stevens collaborated with [[Ivan Moffat]] and then with [[James Lee Barrett]]. It was the only time Stevens received screenplay credit for a film he directed.<ref name=\"GI\"/> [[Ray Bradbury]] and [[Reginald Rose]] were considered but neither participated. The poet [[Carl Sandburg]] was solicited, though it is not certain if any of his contributions were included. Sandburg, however, did receive screen credit for \"creative association.\"<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>The movie's opening credits include: ''Screenplay by James Lee Barrett and George Stevens, based on the Books of the Old and New Testaments, Other Ancient Writings, the Writings of Fulton Oursler and Henry Denker, and in Creative Association with Carl Sandburg'' (see ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 136)</ref>\n\nFinancial excesses began to grow during pre-production. Stevens commissioned French artist [[Andr\u00e9 Girard (1901-1968)|Andr\u00e9 Girard]] to prepare 352 oil paintings of Biblical scenes to use as storyboards. Stevens also traveled to the Vatican to see [[Pope John XXIII]] for advice.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nIn August 1961, 20th Century Fox withdrew from the project, noting that $2.3 million had been spent without any footage being shot. Stevens was given two years to find another studio or 20th Century Fox would reclaim its rights. Stevens moved the film to [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, [[MGM]] proceeded with their own 1961 Technicolor epic about the life of Christ, ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'', starring [[Jeffrey Hunter]] as Jesus, which was filmed in Spain, and when released was nearly an hour shorter than ''The Greatest Story Ever Told''.\n\n==Casting==\nFor ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'', Stevens cast Swedish actor Max von Sydow as Jesus. Von Sydow had never appeared in an English-language film and was best known for his performances in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s dramatic films.<ref>Walker, John. \"Halliwell's Who's Who in the Movies.\" HarperCollins, 2001. {{ISBN|0-06-093507-3}}</ref> Stevens wanted an actor unknown to international audiences, free of secular and unseemly associations in the mind of the public.<ref>''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 138</ref>\n\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' featured an ensemble of well-known actors, many of them in brief, even cameo, appearances. Some critics would later complain that the large cast distracted from the solemnity, notably in the appearance of John Wayne as the Roman [[centurion]] who comments on the Crucifixion, in his well-known voice, by stating: \"Truly this man was the Son of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=12795&mainArticleId=202389|title=The Greatest Story Ever Told|work=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref>\"It is impossible for those watching the film to avoid the merry game of 'Spot the Star', and the road to Calvary in particular comes to resemble the Hollywood Boulevard 'Walk of Fame'.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\n==Production==\nStevens shot ''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' in the U.S. southwest, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah.

Cinematographer [[William C.

Joanna Dunham became pregnant, which required costume redesigns and carefully chosen camera angles.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nMuch of the production was shot during the winter of 1962\u20131963, when Arizona had heavy snow. Actor [[David Sheiner]], who played James the Elder, quipped in an interview about the snowdrifts: \"I thought we were shooting ''[[Nanook of the North]]''.\"<ref>\"Several hundred volunteers . . braved the elements with shovels, wheelbarrows, bulldozers, and fifty butane flame throwers to remove the snow from the expensive replica of the Holy Land.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 140</ref> Stevens was also under pressure to hurry the John the Baptist sequence, which was shot at the Glen Canyon area \u2013 it was scheduled to become [[Lake Powell]] with the completion of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and the production held up the project.<ref name=\"HHS\"/>\n\nStevens brought in two veteran filmmakers. [[Jean Negulesco]] filmed sequences in the Jerusalem streets and the Nativity scenes, while [[David Lean]] shot the prologue featuring Herod the Great.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Lean cast Claude Rains as Herod.<ref>Skal, David J. \"Claude Rains: An Actor\u2019s Voice.\" University Press of Kentucky, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2432-2}}</ref>\n\nBy the time shooting was completed in August 1963, Stevens had amassed six million feet of [[Ultra Panavision 70]] film (about 1829&nbsp;km or 1136 miles, roughly the radius of the Moon). The budget ran to $20 million (equivalent to $142 million in 2010) plus additional editing and promotion charges,<ref name=\"Shame p. 142\">''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 142</ref> making it the most expensive film shot in the U.S.<ref name=\"GI\"/><ref>\"Such giants as ''Cleopatra'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia'' did boast bigger budgets, but they were shot on foreign soil.\" ''Hollywood Hall of Shame'', p. 137</ref>\n\nThe film was advertised on its first run as being shown in [[Cinerama]]. While it was shown on an ultra-curved screen, it was with one projector. True Cinerama required three projectors running simultaneously. A dozen other films were presented this way in the 1960s.\n\n==Marketing==\nThe marketing campaign included exhibits created for churches and Sunday schools, department stores, primary and secondary schools. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] put together a traveling exhibition of props, costumes and photographs that toured museums around the country.  Promotional items made available to groups identified for [[market segmentation]] included school study guides, children's books and a reprint of the original novel by Oursler. Previews of the film were shown to leading industrialists, psychologists, government officials, religious leaders and officials from the Boy and Girl Scout organizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maresco |first1=Peter A. |title=Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ: Market Segmentation, Mass Marketing and Promotion, and the Internet |journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture |date=2004 |volume=8 |issue=1 |doi=10.3138/jrpc.8.1.002}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Greatest Story Ever Told'' premiered 15 February 1965, 18 months after filming wrapped, at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, wishing not to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, wishing not to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London Stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].
