As of the 2010 census, the city population was 29,752,<ref name=2010Census>United States Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011</ref> and in 2018 the estimated population was 31,366.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The city includes the villages of [[East Rochester, New Hampshire|East Rochester]], [[Gonic, New Hampshire|Gonic]], and [[North Rochester, New Hampshire|North Rochester]]. Rochester is home to [[Skyhaven Airport (New Hampshire)|Skyhaven Airport]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Origins===\nRochester was once inhabited by [[Abenaki]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] of the [[Pennacook]] tribe. They fished, hunted and farmed, moving locations when their agriculture exhausted the soil for growing [[pumpkins]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], [[beans]] and [[maize]]. Gonic was called ''Squanamagonic'', meaning \"the water of the clay place hill.\"<ref name=\"history vol 1\">{{cite web|last1=McDuffee|first1=Franklin|title=History of the Town of Rochester New Hampshire from 1722-1890|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftownofr01mcdu|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe town was one of four granted by [[Colony|Colonial]] Governor [[Samuel Shute]] of [[Massachusetts]] and New Hampshire during his brief term. Incorporated in 1722, it was named for his close friend, [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Laurence Hyde]], [[Earl of Rochester]] and brother-in-law to [[James II of England|King James II]].<ref name=\"history vol 1\" /> As was customary, tall [[Eastern white pine|white pine]] trees were reserved for use as [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] by the [[Royal Navy]]. But hostility with the Abenaki delayed settlement until 1728, although attacks would continue until 1748.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" /> Early dwellings clustered together for protection, beginning near Haven Hill. Due to warfare or disease, after 1749 [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] numbers dwindled, although many descendants remain in or around Rochester communities. The community at that time included [[Farmington, New Hampshire|Farmington]], which would be incorporated in 1798, and [[Milton, New Hampshire|Milton]], in 1802.\n\n===Rochester Common===\nIn 1737, the Reverend Amos Main became the first settled pastor of the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] Church, located on Rochester Hill. The building would be moved to Rochester Common, which then encompassed {{convert|250|acre|km2}} and was called Norway Plain Mille Common after its abundant [[Norway pine]]s. At the time, the Common extended into what is now downtown Rochester. By 1738, the farming community contained 60 families. A statue of Parson Main, [[sculpting|sculpted]] by [[Giuseppe Moretti]], today presides over the town square.\n \t\nBy 1780 the area surrounding the Common was the most thickly settled part of town, so a meeting house/church was erected on the east end of the Common with the entrance facing what is now South Main Street. A cemetery was also established near the new meeting house, but the ground was found to be too wet, and the bodies were removed to the Old Rochester Cemetery. In 1842 the Meeting House/church was moved to the present-day location at the corner of Liberty and South Main streets. As the years went by the size of the Common would shrink as more of it was sold off for development. A bandstand was constructed in 1914. Today, the Common is used for community activities such as [[Memorial Day]] events and for concerts throughout the summer months, in addition to having a walking track.\n\t\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the Common was used as the meeting place for soldiers before going off to war. The common is also the location of the city's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] monument which bears the names of the 54 men who died then. The monument was dedicated in the 1870s, and in the 1880s the statue was added to the monument. Four Civil War cannons also decorated the monument, but during [[World War II]] the cannon were melted down for use in the war. They were replaced by World War II guns.\n\nThe bandstand was built in 1914 by Miles Dustin; before then band concerts were held on the square. The flag pole was donated by J. Frank Place in 1917. He was the former publisher of the ''Rochester Courier''.\n\n===Early education===\nIn 1750, Rochester voted at a town meeting to establish a public school to teach writing and reading to the town's children. The vote was quickly overturned, which violated state laws mandating schools in each community. In 1752 the first public schooling began. The school lasted for 16 weeks and the school master was named John Forst. He was paid a salary of 15 pounds and boarded with a different family each month (this family received 30 cents a week from the city).<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\nFor many years the city followed the pattern of the first school by opening one and closing it shortly after. Eventually the citizens realized a school was necessary but funding one was an issue. In 1783 the state demanded that schools were opened permanently or else the state would penalize them. A year later permanent schools were established. Corporal punishment was commonly used by the school masters.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\nIn 1806 the school system was divided into districts in accordance with the state law, which was passed in 1805. This system of districts remained in place until 1884 when laws regarding districts changed. The schools in this system often lacked the necessary educational materials. Eventually the number of students attending school across the state diminished. This led to the abolishment of this system because communities across the state including Rochester had many schools with extremely low numbers of students.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\nIn 1850 the city voted to allow high schools and the funding of them. However money wasn't actually raised for high schools until 1868. The first high school did not open until 1857. The principal and teacher was William A. Kimball. At that time a school year lasted for 22 weeks. High school attendance was relatively low and most dropped out before graduating.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\n===Growth through the 19th century===\nMail service was established in 1768 when a post rider traveled from [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] through [[Berwick, Maine|Berwick]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and Rochester bringing gazettes. In 1792 this improved when Joseph Paine would deliver and pick up mail once a week. When he arrived in town a horn would blow to inform the town of his presence. A regular post office was established on March 26, 1812, in the Barke Tavern. The first postmaster in Rochester was William Barker.\n\n[[Image:Cocheco River and Rochester 6.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Cocheco River]] provided power for the city's early factories and mills.]]\nThe first large business was [[lumber]]ing, although it would be overtaken by other industries as Rochester developed into a [[mill town]] with the [[Cochecho River]] to provide [[water power]]. In 1806, 6 [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were operating, along with a [[sawmill]], [[fulling]] mill, and 2 [[gristmill]]s. By the 1820s-1830s, the town had a [[cabinet making|cabinet maker]] and clockmaker. The Mechanics Company was established in 1834, producing [[woolen]] [[blanket]]s which would win the premium quality award at the 1853 [[New York City|New York]] [[World's Fair]]. The Norway Plains Woolen Company manufactured blankets used by the [[Union Army]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and in 1870 wove {{convert|1600000|yd|m|-5}} of [[textiles]], but by century's end was out of business. Shoe manufacturing had surpassed textiles as Rochester's dominant industry by 1880.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The shoemaking history in Rochester: The industry grows,\u2033 ''Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat'', May 21, 2009; http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090521/GJCOMMUNITY04/705219851/0/SEARCH</ref>\n\nIn 1854, the E.G. & E. Wallace Shoe Company was established, eventually becoming the city's largest employer, with over 700 workers in 1901. Its name changed to the Rochester Shoe Corporation in the 1920s. The Wallace brothers died in the 1890s,<ref name=\"fosters.com\">Martha Fowler, \u2033One foot at a time: The E. G. & E. Wallace Company,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 18, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090518/GJBUSINESS_01/705189994</ref> and other shoe factories opened, including Perkins, Linscott & Company (later the Linscott, Tyler, Wilson Company) off Wakefield Street and N. B. Thayer & Company, Inc., in East Rochester.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The shoemaking history in Rochester: The industry grows,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 21, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090521/GJCOMMUNITY04/705219851/0/SEARCH</ref> In the early twentieth century, more people were employed in shoe manufacturing than in all other local industries combined. Rochester contributed to New Hampshire's position as the nation's third largest shoe-producing state.<ref name=\"fosters.com\"/> The Kessel Fire Brick Company was established in 1889, and at one time [[brickmaking|bricks]] for new buildings at [[Harvard University]] were made in Gonic. Carrying the [[freight]] were four [[railroad]]s which once passed through Rochester, a major [[junction (rail)|junction]] between [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] and [[Portland, Maine]]. Agriculture continued to be important, and in 1875 the Rochester Fair was established. In 1891, Rochester was incorporated as a city.\n\nThe first telephone was installed in 1885 in the K.C. Sanborn Drug Store, the phone was connected to the Dover Telephone Exchange. By the early 1900s there were 1200 local calls and 400 toll calls a day made from Rochester.\n\nIn 1889 and 1900 Jonas Spaulding and his three sons Leon, [[Huntley N. Spaulding|Huntley]], and [[Rolland H. Spaulding|Rolland]], built a leatherboard mill at [[North Rochester, New Hampshire|North Rochester]]. Jonas died before the mill became operational but his three sons ran it well in copartnership and expanded the company nationally and internationally. Leon Cummings Spaulding served as the J Spaulding and Sons Company president after his father's death.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], however, several industries left for cheaper operating conditions in the [[Southern United States|South]] or went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. But the affluent mill era left behind fine [[architecture]], including the Rochester Public Library, a [[List of Carnegie libraries in New Hampshire|Carnegie Library]] designed by the [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architects [[Randlett & Griffin]].\n\n===Library===\n[[File:Rochester NH Public Library.jpg|thumb|The Rochester Public Library in New Hampshire]]\nThe Rochester Public Library was approved in 1893 but was not open to the public until early 1894. Back then, the library was located on the corner of Portland Street and South Main Street. In 1897, the library moved to City Hall, where it remained for over eight years.<ref name=library>{{cite web |last1=Scheffer |first1=Bud |title=The History of the Rochester Public Library |url=http://www.rpl.lib.nh.us/reference/rplhistory.htm |website=Rochester Public Library |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n \nIn the early 1900s, Osman Warren, Rochester's postmaster,  contacted [[Andrew Carnegie]] for help in securing an endowment to build the new library. The Carnegie Institute donated $20,000 to construct the new building. The new library was built on the site of what was the Main Street School. The library was built in the [[Georgian revival]] style, using brick and granite, and the inside was finished with golden oak and cypress.<ref name=library /> The library opened on October 2, 1905, and 150 people registered the first day. Miss Lillian Parshley was the first librarian, serving until her death in 1945. Velma Foss, Miss Parshley's assistant, was the second librarian of the Rochester Library.<ref name=library />\n\n===City Hall and Opera House===\nAnother notable structure is Rochester City Hall, built in 1908, and [[Rochester Opera House|Opera House]] designed by [[George G. Adams (architect)|George G. Adams]]. Adams designed other municipal government/opera house dual-purpose buildings around New England, including in [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]] (1887); [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]] (1887); [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1891); and [[Derry, New Hampshire]] (1901). Only four of his structures survive today (in [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], Derry, and Rochester), with many of his buildings destroyed by fires.\n\nGeorge Adams' opera houses were unique because of their floors, which were movable and could function in both inclined or level position. With the floor in the inclined position, the opera house would show plays, concerts, etc. When the floor was level, the building could be used for dances or public meetings. The Rochester Opera House opened on [[Memorial Day]] 1908. Almost all of Adams' buildings contained movable floors, though the buildings in Waterville and Montpelier did not. Because of the destruction of the other opera houses, the Rochester Opera House is the only known theatre in the United States to use this type of movable floor.\n\nRochester City Hall contained the Rochester Police Department in its basement offices for many years. Some historical portraits of officers remain in an upstairs chamber where a collection of portraits of city officials was traditionally preserved, including officers Nelson S. Hatch and Red Hayes.\n\nToday, visitors may still attend shows at the Rochester Opera House. The City of Rochester has preserved the 90-year-old historical decor of the Opera House.\n\n===20th century===\nRochester's thriving shoe industry in the early twentieth century attracted entrepreneurs from out of state. In 1930 Samuel J. Katz of [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], incorporated the Hubbard Shoe Company and commenced operations in N. B. Thayer & Company's factory on Pleasant Street in East Rochester before the end of the year. By 1931 the firm had also taken over the Linscott, Tyler, Wilson factory off Wakefield Street in Rochester, which it purchased outright in May 1932.<ref>''Rochester Courier'', 21 Nov. 1930 and 20 May 1932</ref> At its peak, the Hubbard Shoe Company employed about four hundred people in East Rochester making men's shoes and five hundred in Rochester making women's shoes, with a total annual payroll of $3 million and total annual output of 2.5 million shoes.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The history of shoemaking in Rochester: The 20th century,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 28, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090528/GJCOMMUNITY04/705289853/0/SEARCH</ref> In 1934 the Maybury Shoe Company began operations on the former E.G. & E. Wallace site on South Main Street. Both firms survived the Great Depression, providing steady jobs for hundreds of Rochester citizens, and converted to a wartime footing during World War Two, but were unable to compete against the flood of cheap foreign imports in the 1970s. Hubbard Shoe Company went out of business in 1973, and Maybury Shoe closed in the mid-1970s.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The history of shoemaking in Rochester: The 20th century,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 28, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090528/GJCOMMUNITY04/705289853/0/SEARCH ; United States Tariff Commission.

The movie was shown at the Scenic Theater. The evening admission price was 35 cents for adults and 15 cents for children.\n\nA ''Rochester Courier'' article from October 1930 described a new indoor golf course:\n\n<blockquote>\n'''INDOOR GOLF COURSE TO BE OPENED ON SATURDAY'''<br>\n''The Leavitt Theatre Property Transformed Inside Into a Bower of Beauty'' - Rochester is to have an indoor golf course, which, it is said, will be second to none, in beauty and attractiveness, this side of New York. Fred Couture, proprietor of the Scenic theatre, who a few months since purchased the Leavitt theatre on South Main Street, has been laying out a small fortune in fitting it up on the ground floor for such use. This building was formerly the residence of the Hon. Summer Wallace and was one of the most beautiful mansions in New Hampshire. Despite the way in which the outside was altered to make the theatre, much of the magnificent paneling inside has been preserved. It was a foundation for an unusual setting for indoor golf. A large force of workers has been engaged in recent weeks, working in relays, and this week six scene painters are decorating the walls and ceilings. There are to be an Egyptian room, a Japanese room, an Indian room and a Dutch room. The walls of each are adorned with appropriate paintings to form a picture of any particular land represented. The Dutch room, for example, not only has the paintings of the canals and dikes but an actual windmill revolving. In the Indian room are pictures of forests and streams, with an Indian paddling a canoe. There is a real waterfall too, with the water flowing down over actual rocks into a series of three basins, with a pool for goldfish at the bottom. One room represents the seashore, the entire wall being one huge painting of the ocean, with a real light house perched up on a promontory, with a light shedding forth its rays. There is also a garden room with a profusion of flowers. There are various rest rooms and seats in plenty everywhere for the onlookers or tired players. All the floors will be covered with artificial grass. In a conspicuous place is a great pile of stones, with a fountain at the top, out of which a tiny stream trickles down over the rocks in various small channels and little pools. Ferns grow on its sides. There are also in various places tree trunks, some birch with their white bark and other varieties. There will be eighteen holes to the golf course, with various traps and some mysteries. The whole place is certainly a wonderful representation of the great out-of-doors and a veritable dream of loveliness. The grand opening is set for Saturday evening at 6:00, when Mayor Louis H. McDuffee will press the button and turn on the lights.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n| last =\n| first =\n| coauthors =\n| title = INDOOR GOLF COURSE TO BE OPENED SATURDAY\n| newspaper = Rochester Courier\n| location = Rochester, New Hampshire\n| pages =\n| language =\n| publisher =\n| date = October 3, 1930\n| url = http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/niagara/news/nh/rochester10031930.html\n| accessdate = 11 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Natural disasters===\nThe summer of 1947 was dry. In late October of that year only 1/8&nbsp;inch of rain had fallen since mid-September, and the temperatures were high. Small ponds and streams were dried up, and local farmers were using water from the [[Salmon Falls River]] and [[Cocheco River]] to provide water for their livestock. Fire risk was high. On October 21, sparks from a passing train car in [[Farmington, New Hampshire|Farmington]] ignited the dry grass on both sides of the track, starting the biggest fire to strike Rochester.\n\nAt first firefighters seemed to have the fire in control, but two days later winds up to {{convert|60|mph}} drove the 'small' fire out of control.

As of the 2010 census, the city population was 29,752,<ref name=2010Census>United States Census Bureau, [https://www.census.gov U.S. Census website], 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011</ref> and in 2018 the estimated population was 31,366.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The city includes the villages of [[East Rochester, New Hampshire|East Rochester]], [[Gonic, New Hampshire|Gonic]], and [[North Rochester, New Hampshire|North Rochester]]. Rochester is home to [[Skyhaven Airport (New Hampshire)|Skyhaven Airport]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Origins===\nRochester was once inhabited by [[Abenaki]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] of the [[Pennacook]] tribe. They fished, hunted and farmed, moving locations when their agriculture exhausted the soil for growing [[pumpkins]], [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], [[beans]] and [[maize]]. Gonic was called ''Squanamagonic'', meaning \"the water of the clay place hill.\"<ref name=\"history vol 1\">{{cite web|last1=McDuffee|first1=Franklin|title=History of the Town of Rochester New Hampshire from 1722-1890|url=https://archive.org/details/historyoftownofr01mcdu|via=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe town was one of four granted by [[Colony|Colonial]] Governor [[Samuel Shute]] of [[Massachusetts]] and New Hampshire during his brief term. Incorporated in 1722, it was named for his close friend, [[Laurence Hyde, 1st Earl of Rochester|Laurence Hyde]], [[Earl of Rochester]] and brother-in-law to [[James II of England|King James II]].<ref name=\"history vol 1\" /> As was customary, tall [[Eastern white pine|white pine]] trees were reserved for use as [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] by the [[Royal Navy]]. But hostility with the Abenaki delayed settlement until 1728, although attacks would continue until 1748.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" /> Early dwellings clustered together for protection, beginning near Haven Hill. Due to warfare or disease, after 1749 [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] numbers dwindled, although many descendants remain in or around Rochester communities. The community at that time included [[Farmington, New Hampshire|Farmington]], which would be incorporated in 1798, and [[Milton, New Hampshire|Milton]], in 1802.\n\n===Rochester Common===\nIn 1737, the Reverend Amos Main became the first settled pastor of the [[Congregational church|Congregational]] Church, located on Rochester Hill. The building would be moved to Rochester Common, which then encompassed {{convert|250|acre|km2}} and was called Norway Plain Mille Common after its abundant [[Norway pine]]s. At the time, the Common extended into what is now downtown Rochester. By 1738, the farming community contained 60 families. A statue of Parson Main, [[sculpting|sculpted]] by [[Giuseppe Moretti]], today presides over the town square.\n \t\nBy 1780 the area surrounding the Common was the most thickly settled part of town, so a meeting house/church was erected on the east end of the Common with the entrance facing what is now South Main Street. A cemetery was also established near the new meeting house, but the ground was found to be too wet, and the bodies were removed to the Old Rochester Cemetery. In 1842 the Meeting House/church was moved to the present-day location at the corner of Liberty and South Main streets. As the years went by the size of the Common would shrink as more of it was sold off for development. A bandstand was constructed in 1914. Today, the Common is used for community activities such as [[Memorial Day]] events and for concerts throughout the summer months, in addition to having a walking track.\n\t\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the Common was used as the meeting place for soldiers before going off to war. The common is also the location of the city's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] monument which bears the names of the 54 men who died then. The monument was dedicated in the 1870s, and in the 1880s the statue was added to the monument. Four Civil War cannons also decorated the monument, but during [[World War II]] the cannon were melted down for use in the war. They were replaced by World War II guns.\n\nThe bandstand was built in 1914 by Miles Dustin; before then band concerts were held on the square. The flag pole was donated by J. Frank Place in 1917. He was the former publisher of the ''Rochester Courier''.\n\n===Early education===\nIn 1750, Rochester voted at a town meeting to establish a public school to teach writing and reading to the town's children. The vote was quickly overturned, which violated state laws mandating schools in each community. In 1752 the first public schooling began. The school lasted for 16 weeks and the school master was named John Forst. He was paid a salary of 15 pounds and boarded with a different family each month (this family received 30 cents a week from the city).<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\nFor many years the city followed the pattern of the first school by opening one and closing it shortly after. Eventually the citizens realized a school was necessary but funding one was an issue. In 1783 the state demanded that schools were opened permanently or else the state would penalize them. A year later permanent schools were established. Corporal punishment was commonly used by the school masters.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\nIn 1806 the school system was divided into districts in accordance with the state law, which was passed in 1805. This system of districts remained in place until 1884 when laws regarding districts changed. The schools in this system often lacked the necessary educational materials. Eventually the number of students attending school across the state diminished. This led to the abolishment of this system because communities across the state including Rochester had many schools with extremely low numbers of students.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\nIn 1850 the city voted to allow high schools and the funding of them. However money wasn't actually raised for high schools until 1868. The first high school did not open until 1857. The principal and teacher was William A. Kimball. At that time a school year lasted for 22 weeks. High school attendance was relatively low and most dropped out before graduating.<ref name=\"history vol 1\" />\n\n===Growth through the 19th century===\nMail service was established in 1768 when a post rider traveled from [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] through [[Berwick, Maine|Berwick]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and Rochester bringing gazettes. In 1792 this improved when Joseph Paine would deliver and pick up mail once a week. When he arrived in town a horn would blow to inform the town of his presence. A regular post office was established on March 26, 1812, in the Barke Tavern. The first postmaster in Rochester was William Barker.\n\n[[Image:Cocheco River and Rochester 6.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Cocheco River]] provided power for the city's early factories and mills.]]\nThe first large business was [[lumber]]ing, although it would be overtaken by other industries as Rochester developed into a [[mill town]] with the [[Cochecho River]] to provide [[water power]]. In 1806, 6 [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were operating, along with a [[sawmill]], [[fulling]] mill, and 2 [[gristmill]]s. By the 1820s-1830s, the town had a [[cabinet making|cabinet maker]] and clockmaker. The Mechanics Company was established in 1834, producing [[woolen]] [[blanket]]s which would win the premium quality award at the 1853 [[New York City|New York]] [[World's Fair]]. The Norway Plains Woolen Company manufactured blankets used by the [[Union Army]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and in 1870 wove {{convert|1600000|yd|m|-5}} of [[textiles]], but by century's end was out of business. Shoe manufacturing had surpassed textiles as Rochester's dominant industry by 1880.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The shoemaking history in Rochester: The industry grows,\u2033 ''Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat'', May 21, 2009; http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090521/GJCOMMUNITY04/705219851/0/SEARCH</ref>\n\nIn 1854, the E.G. & E. Wallace Shoe Company was established, eventually becoming the city's largest employer, with over 700 workers in 1901. Its name changed to the Rochester Shoe Corporation in the 1920s. The Wallace brothers died in the 1890s,<ref name=\"fosters.com\">Martha Fowler, \u2033One foot at a time: The E. G. & E.

B. Thayer & Company, Inc., in East Rochester.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The shoemaking history in Rochester: The industry grows,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 21, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090521/GJCOMMUNITY04/705219851/0/SEARCH</ref> In the early twentieth century, more people were employed in shoe manufacturing than in all other local industries combined. Rochester contributed to New Hampshire's position as the nation's third largest shoe-producing state.<ref name=\"fosters.com\"/> The Kessel Fire Brick Company was established in 1889, and at one time [[brickmaking|bricks]] for new buildings at [[Harvard University]] were made in Gonic. Carrying the [[freight]] were four [[railroad]]s which once passed through Rochester, a major [[junction (rail)|junction]] between [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] and [[Portland, Maine]]. Agriculture continued to be important, and in 1875 the Rochester Fair was established. In 1891, Rochester was incorporated as a city.\n\nThe first telephone was installed in 1885 in the K.C. Sanborn Drug Store, the phone was connected to the Dover Telephone Exchange. By the early 1900s there were 1200 local calls and 400 toll calls a day made from Rochester.\n\nIn 1889 and 1900 Jonas Spaulding and his three sons Leon, [[Huntley N. Spaulding|Huntley]], and [[Rolland H. Spaulding|Rolland]], built a leatherboard mill at [[North Rochester, New Hampshire|North Rochester]]. Jonas died before the mill became operational but his three sons ran it well in copartnership and expanded the company nationally and internationally. Leon Cummings Spaulding served as the J Spaulding and Sons Company president after his father's death.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], however, several industries left for cheaper operating conditions in the [[Southern United States|South]] or went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]]. But the affluent mill era left behind fine [[architecture]], including the Rochester Public Library, a [[List of Carnegie libraries in New Hampshire|Carnegie Library]] designed by the [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] architects [[Randlett & Griffin]].\n\n===Library===\n[[File:Rochester NH Public Library.jpg|thumb|The Rochester Public Library in New Hampshire]]\nThe Rochester Public Library was approved in 1893 but was not open to the public until early 1894. Back then, the library was located on the corner of Portland Street and South Main Street. In 1897, the library moved to City Hall, where it remained for over eight years.<ref name=library>{{cite web |last1=Scheffer |first1=Bud |title=The History of the Rochester Public Library |url=http://www.rpl.lib.nh.us/reference/rplhistory.htm |website=Rochester Public Library |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n \nIn the early 1900s, Osman Warren, Rochester's postmaster,  contacted [[Andrew Carnegie]] for help in securing an endowment to build the new library. The Carnegie Institute donated $20,000 to construct the new building. The new library was built on the site of what was the Main Street School. The library was built in the [[Georgian revival]] style, using brick and granite, and the inside was finished with golden oak and cypress.<ref name=library /> The library opened on October 2, 1905, and 150 people registered the first day. Miss Lillian Parshley was the first librarian, serving until her death in 1945. Velma Foss, Miss Parshley's assistant, was the second librarian of the Rochester Library.<ref name=library />\n\n===City Hall and Opera House===\nAnother notable structure is Rochester City Hall, built in 1908, and [[Rochester Opera House|Opera House]] designed by [[George G. Adams (architect)|George G. Adams]]. Adams designed other municipal government/opera house dual-purpose buildings around New England, including in [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]] (1887); [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]] (1887); [[Dover, New Hampshire]] (1891); and [[Derry, New Hampshire]] (1901). Only four of his structures survive today (in [[Waterville, Maine|Waterville]], [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], Derry, and Rochester), with many of his buildings destroyed by fires.\n\nGeorge Adams' opera houses were unique because of their floors, which were movable and could function in both inclined or level position. With the floor in the inclined position, the opera house would show plays, concerts, etc. When the floor was level, the building could be used for dances or public meetings. The Rochester Opera House opened on [[Memorial Day]] 1908. Almost all of Adams' buildings contained movable floors, though the buildings in Waterville and Montpelier did not. Because of the destruction of the other opera houses, the Rochester Opera House is the only known theatre in the United States to use this type of movable floor.\n\nRochester City Hall contained the Rochester Police Department in its basement offices for many years. Some historical portraits of officers remain in an upstairs chamber where a collection of portraits of city officials was traditionally preserved, including officers Nelson S. Hatch and Red Hayes.\n\nToday, visitors may still attend shows at the Rochester Opera House. The City of Rochester has preserved the 90-year-old historical decor of the Opera House.\n\n===20th century===\nRochester's thriving shoe industry in the early twentieth century attracted entrepreneurs from out of state. In 1930 Samuel J. Katz of [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], incorporated the Hubbard Shoe Company and commenced operations in N. B. Thayer & Company's factory on Pleasant Street in East Rochester before the end of the year. By 1931 the firm had also taken over the Linscott, Tyler, Wilson factory off Wakefield Street in Rochester, which it purchased outright in May 1932.<ref>''Rochester Courier'', 21 Nov. 1930 and 20 May 1932</ref> At its peak, the Hubbard Shoe Company employed about four hundred people in East Rochester making men's shoes and five hundred in Rochester making women's shoes, with a total annual payroll of $3 million and total annual output of 2.5 million shoes.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The history of shoemaking in Rochester: The 20th century,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 28, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090528/GJCOMMUNITY04/705289853/0/SEARCH</ref> In 1934 the Maybury Shoe Company began operations on the former E.G. & E. Wallace site on South Main Street. Both firms survived the Great Depression, providing steady jobs for hundreds of Rochester citizens, and converted to a wartime footing during World War Two, but were unable to compete against the flood of cheap foreign imports in the 1970s. Hubbard Shoe Company went out of business in 1973, and Maybury Shoe closed in the mid-1970s.<ref>Martha Fowler, \u2033The history of shoemaking in Rochester: The 20th century,\u2033 ''Foster\u2032s Daily Democrat'', May 28, 2009 http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090528/GJCOMMUNITY04/705289853/0/SEARCH ; United States Tariff Commission.

The movie was shown at the Scenic Theater. The evening admission price was 35 cents for adults and 15 cents for children.\n\nA ''Rochester Courier'' article from October 1930 described a new indoor golf course:\n\n<blockquote>\n'''INDOOR GOLF COURSE TO BE OPENED ON SATURDAY'''<br>\n''The Leavitt Theatre Property Transformed Inside Into a Bower of Beauty'' - Rochester is to have an indoor golf course, which, it is said, will be second to none, in beauty and attractiveness, this side of New York. Fred Couture, proprietor of the Scenic theatre, who a few months since purchased the Leavitt theatre on South Main Street, has been laying out a small fortune in fitting it up on the ground floor for such use. This building was formerly the residence of the Hon. Summer Wallace and was one of the most beautiful mansions in New Hampshire. Despite the way in which the outside was altered to make the theatre, much of the magnificent paneling inside has been preserved. It was a foundation for an unusual setting for indoor golf. A large force of workers has been engaged in recent weeks, working in relays, and this week six scene painters are decorating the walls and ceilings. There are to be an Egyptian room, a Japanese room, an Indian room and a Dutch room. The walls of each are adorned with appropriate paintings to form a picture of any particular land represented. The Dutch room, for example, not only has the paintings of the canals and dikes but an actual windmill revolving. In the Indian room are pictures of forests and streams, with an Indian paddling a canoe. There is a real waterfall too, with the water flowing down over actual rocks into a series of three basins, with a pool for goldfish at the bottom. One room represents the seashore, the entire wall being one huge painting of the ocean, with a real light house perched up on a promontory, with a light shedding forth its rays. There is also a garden room with a profusion of flowers. There are various rest rooms and seats in plenty everywhere for the onlookers or tired players. All the floors will be covered with artificial grass. In a conspicuous place is a great pile of stones, with a fountain at the top, out of which a tiny stream trickles down over the rocks in various small channels and little pools. Ferns grow on its sides. There are also in various places tree trunks, some birch with their white bark and other varieties. There will be eighteen holes to the golf course, with various traps and some mysteries. The whole place is certainly a wonderful representation of the great out-of-doors and a veritable dream of loveliness. The grand opening is set for Saturday evening at 6:00, when Mayor Louis H. McDuffee will press the button and turn on the lights.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n| last =\n| first =\n| coauthors =\n| title = INDOOR GOLF COURSE TO BE OPENED SATURDAY\n| newspaper = Rochester Courier\n| location = Rochester, New Hampshire\n| pages =\n| language =\n| publisher =\n| date = October 3, 1930\n| url = http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/niagara/news/nh/rochester10031930.html\n| accessdate = 11 June 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Natural disasters===\nThe summer of 1947 was dry. In late October of that year only 1/8&nbsp;inch of rain had fallen since mid-September, and the temperatures were high. Small ponds and streams were dried up, and local farmers were using water from the [[Salmon Falls River]] and [[Cocheco River]] to provide water for their livestock. Fire risk was high. On October 21, sparks from a passing train car in [[Farmington, New Hampshire|Farmington]] ignited the dry grass on both sides of the track, starting the biggest fire to strike Rochester.\n\nAt first firefighters seemed to have the fire in control, but two days later winds up to {{convert|60|mph}} drove the 'small' fire out of control. The wind-driven fire moved to the south and east into Rochester. The fire would engulf an area over {{convert|9|mi}} long and over {{convert|2|mi}} wide with walls of flame {{convert|40|ft}} high. Before the fire was under control over 30 homes in Rochester would be lost.\n\n[[Hurricane Carol]] struck New Hampshire on September 2, 1954. The winds of the hurricane were in excess of {{convert|90|mph}}. The property damage in New Hampshire was estimated to be 3 million dollars and four inches of rain fell during the storm.\n\nA Category 5 hurricane, known locally as the [[New England Hurricane of 1938|Hurricane of '38]], was the most deadly of New Hampshire's history, causing excessive damage to Rochester and outlying communities.  Hurricane Carol was a Category 3 storm, in comparison to the devastation caused by the previous hurricane.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Upper Dam, Rochester, NH.jpg|Upper Dam c. 1905\nImage:Public Library & South Main St., Rochester, NH.jpg|Public Library c. 1908\nImage:City Hall & Opera House, Rochester, NH.jpg|City Hall c. 1910\nImage:Central Square, Rochester, NH.jpg|Central Square in 1909\nCity Hotel, Rochester, NH.jpg|City Hotel c. 1910\nImage:The Wallace Factory, Rochester, NH.jpg|Wallace Factory c. 1910\nImage:Stone Bridge in Rochester, NH.jpg|Stone Bridge c. 1910\nImage:Gateway to Rochester Fairgrounds.jpg|Rochester Fair c. 1910\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cocheco River and Rochester 5.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Cocheco River]] flows through central Rochester.]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|45.8|sqmi|1}}, of which {{convert|45.4|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|1}} is water, comprising 0.79% of the town.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001) - Rochester city, New Hampshire| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref> Rochester is drained by the [[Salmon Falls River|Salmon Falls]], [[Isinglass River|Isinglass]] and Cochecho rivers. The highest point in Rochester is a southern extension of Nute Ridge, at {{convert|581|ft}} above [[sea level]], occupying the northern corner of the city.\n\n[[New Hampshire Route 16]] (the [[Spaulding Turnpike]]) is a six-lane [[controlled-access highway]] that passes through the city, leading north towards [[Conway, New Hampshire|Conway]] and south to [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]].  [[U.S. Route 202]] uses the turnpike to bypass the city center, then heads northeast into Maine and southwest towards [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. [[New Hampshire Route 125]] passes north\u2013south through the center of town, leading south to [[Lee, New Hampshire|Lee]] and [[Epping, New Hampshire|Epping]], and traveling north parallel to NH 16 into [[Milton, New Hampshire|Milton]].

{"title_page": "Resuscitator", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}\nA '''resuscitator''' is a device using positive pressure to inflate the lungs of an [[Syncope (medicine)|unconscious]] person who is [[apnea|not breathing]], in order to keep them [[oxygen]]ated and alive. There are three basic types: a ''manual'' version (also known as a ''[[bag valve mask]]'') consisting of a mask and a large hand-squeezed plastic bulb using ambient air, or with supplemental oxygen from a high-pressure tank. The second type is the ''Expired Air'' or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an ''oxygen powered'' resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.\n\n== History ==\n\nResuscitators began in 1907 <ref name=\"The dawn of mechanical ventilation\">{{cite book|last=Bahns|first=Ernst|title=The Evolution of Ventilation|publisher=Dragerwerk AG|isbn=3-926762-17-9|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>  when Heinrich Dr\u00e4ger, owner of the Dr\u00e4gerwerk AG Company, produced the \"Pulmotor\" Resuscitator. Considered to be the first practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years.\n\n[[File:Lungmotor resuscitation device advertisement (newspaper, 1917).jpg|thumb|Early \"Lungmotor\" resuscitation device]]\nWhen ambulance services began to form in major cities around the world, such as in London, New York and Los Angeles, [[Emergency medical services]] or EMS was developed. In these early days, perhaps the most advanced piece of equipment carried on these ambulances were devices for delivering supplemental oxygen to patients in respiratory distress. The Pulmotor and later models, such as the Emerson Resuscitator, utilized heavy tanks of oxygen to power a device which forced air into the patient's lungs. While better than no oxygen at all, these old units were problematic. Aside from often failing to sense obstructions in the airway, the Emerson, and to a lesser degree the Pulmotor, were large, bulky and heavy. The Emerson Resuscitator required two strong men to carry it from the ambulance to the victim. Perhaps the greatest defect, however, was the fact that these units \"cycled\".\n\nCycling was a feature that was built into most resuscitators built before the 1960s, including the Pulmotor and Emerson models. To ensure that the victim's lungs were not injured from being over-inflated, the resuscitator was pre-set to provide what was considered a safe pressure of oxygen. Once the unit reached this limit, it ceased to pump oxygen. For patients suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), or any form of obstructive lung disease, the delivered pressure was insufficient pressure to fill the lungs with oxygen, meaning that, for patients with any sort of obstructive lung disease, units that pressure cycled did more harm than good. Pressure cycling also meant that [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] was impossible to perform if a patient's respiration was being supported by one of these units. If chest compressions were to be done, the cycle would be retarded and the resuscitator would be unable to provide oxygen as long as the chest was being compressed. For victims of smoke inhalation and drowning, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives, so these units found a home on ambulances around the world. The devices that cycled on the basis of upper and lower pressure limits are known as pressure cycled automatic resuscitators. In the UK the introduction of BS6850:1987 Ventilatory Resuscitators confirmed that \"....automatic pressure-cycled gas-powered resuscitators are not considered suitable for such use (closed chest cardiac compression)...\" and confirmed the standards required for gas powered resuscitators and operator powered resuscitators.<ref>{{cite book|title=BS 6850:1987 British Standard Specification for Ventilatory resuscitators|year=1987|publisher=British Standards Institution|isbn=0 580 15880 2}}</ref> The following year a similar ISO standard was introduced.<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8382:1988 Resuscitators intended for use with humans|year=1988|publisher=International Organisation for Standardisation}}</ref> Around this date most manufacturers supplied or introduced time - volume cycled resuscitators and pressure cycled devices were discontinued.\n\nBoth the Pulmotor and the Emerson depended to a large extent upon the patient's ability to breathe the oxygen in order to be beneficial. Due to the limitations imposed by the cycling feature, this meant that patients in need of rescue breathing benefited little from the application of these devices. The Emerson and Pulmotor were utilized until the mid-1960s, when a breakthrough in the history of oxygen delivery was made: the demand valve.<ref name=\"Demand valve assembly for use with breathing or resuscitation equipment\" <ref>{{cite book|last=CHANEY|first=G.|title=US Patent 3,285,261|date=Nov 15, 1966}}</ref>\n\nThe demand valve was a revolutionary new piece of equipment. At the simple push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be delivered into the lungs of the patient without the worry of the device cycling and, thus, ceasing to pump oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the demand valve was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to \"work with the patient\" than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a demand valve, as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patients airway was a factor in causing vomiting and aspiration. Demand valve resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the demand valve resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.\n\n== Modern day ==\nThe [[bag valve mask|ambu-bag]] was a further advancement in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve as the primary method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60&nbsp;cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a \"pop-off\" valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally more common in the pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is  of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.\n\nEven newer products have been developed and are now available. In 1992 the Genesis(R) II time/volume cycled resuscitator (now upgraded to meet the current, International, resuscitation guidelines and called the CAREvent(R) ALS and CA)provide the SIMV automatic ventilation mode with demand breathing for the spontaneously breathing patient. These devices work like full blown transport ventilators yet are simple enough to operate that they can be used in an emergency situation by pre-hospital healthcare providers and are small enough to be easily transportable. Having a manual override control for use during mask CPR they meet the requirements of the current resuscitation standards. The Oxylator (R) EM-100 introduced in the late 1990s and subsequently replaced by the more flexible Oxylator (R) EMX and HD are pressure cycled devices that utilize pressure, rather than time, cycling to ventilate the patient. \nMore recently the microVENT resuscitator range introduced two new models, the microVENT(R) CPR and the microVENT(R)World. These two new time/volume resuscitators meet the latest requirements for resuscitation and are lighter and smaller<ref name=\"Brochure download\">{{cite web|title=Manufacturer information|url=http://www.meditech.gb.com/Downloads.html|website=Meditech (B.N.O.S.

The second type is the ''Expired Air'' or breath powered resuscitator. The first appearance of the second type was the Brooke Airway introduced in 1957. The third type is an ''oxygen powered'' resuscitator. These are driven by pressurized gas delivered by a regulator, and can either be automatic or manually controlled. The most popular type of gas powered resuscitator are Time Cycled, Volume Constant Ventilators. In the early days of pre-hospital emergency services, pressure cycled devices like the Pulmotor were popular but yielded less than satisfactory results. One of the first modern resuscitation ventilators was the HARV, later called the PneuPac 2R or Yellow Box. Most modern resuscitators are designed to allow the patient to breathe on his own should he recover the ability to do so. All resuscitation devices should be able to deliver >85% oxygen when a gas source is available.\n\n== History ==\n\nResuscitators began in 1907 <ref name=\"The dawn of mechanical ventilation\">{{cite book|last=Bahns|first=Ernst|title=The Evolution of Ventilation|publisher=Dragerwerk AG|isbn=3-926762-17-9|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>  when Heinrich Dr\u00e4ger, owner of the Dr\u00e4gerwerk AG Company, produced the \"Pulmotor\" Resuscitator. Considered to be the first practical device for delivering oxygen to unconscious patients or patients in respiratory distress, the Pulmotor influenced resuscitators for many years.\n\n[[File:Lungmotor resuscitation device advertisement (newspaper, 1917).jpg|thumb|Early \"Lungmotor\" resuscitation device]]\nWhen ambulance services began to form in major cities around the world, such as in London, New York and Los Angeles, [[Emergency medical services]] or EMS was developed. In these early days, perhaps the most advanced piece of equipment carried on these ambulances were devices for delivering supplemental oxygen to patients in respiratory distress. The Pulmotor and later models, such as the Emerson Resuscitator, utilized heavy tanks of oxygen to power a device which forced air into the patient's lungs. While better than no oxygen at all, these old units were problematic. Aside from often failing to sense obstructions in the airway, the Emerson, and to a lesser degree the Pulmotor, were large, bulky and heavy. The Emerson Resuscitator required two strong men to carry it from the ambulance to the victim. Perhaps the greatest defect, however, was the fact that these units \"cycled\".\n\nCycling was a feature that was built into most resuscitators built before the 1960s, including the Pulmotor and Emerson models. To ensure that the victim's lungs were not injured from being over-inflated, the resuscitator was pre-set to provide what was considered a safe pressure of oxygen. Once the unit reached this limit, it ceased to pump oxygen. For patients suffering from [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), or any form of obstructive lung disease, the delivered pressure was insufficient pressure to fill the lungs with oxygen, meaning that, for patients with any sort of obstructive lung disease, units that pressure cycled did more harm than good. Pressure cycling also meant that [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] was impossible to perform if a patient's respiration was being supported by one of these units. If chest compressions were to be done, the cycle would be retarded and the resuscitator would be unable to provide oxygen as long as the chest was being compressed. For victims of smoke inhalation and drowning, however, the benefits outweighed the negatives, so these units found a home on ambulances around the world. The devices that cycled on the basis of upper and lower pressure limits are known as pressure cycled automatic resuscitators. In the UK the introduction of BS6850:1987 Ventilatory Resuscitators confirmed that \"....automatic pressure-cycled gas-powered resuscitators are not considered suitable for such use (closed chest cardiac compression)...\" and confirmed the standards required for gas powered resuscitators and operator powered resuscitators.<ref>{{cite book|title=BS 6850:1987 British Standard Specification for Ventilatory resuscitators|year=1987|publisher=British Standards Institution|isbn=0 580 15880 2}}</ref> The following year a similar ISO standard was introduced.<ref>{{cite book|title=ISO 8382:1988 Resuscitators intended for use with humans|year=1988|publisher=International Organisation for Standardisation}}</ref> Around this date most manufacturers supplied or introduced time - volume cycled resuscitators and pressure cycled devices were discontinued.\n\nBoth the Pulmotor and the Emerson depended to a large extent upon the patient's ability to breathe the oxygen in order to be beneficial. Due to the limitations imposed by the cycling feature, this meant that patients in need of rescue breathing benefited little from the application of these devices. The Emerson and Pulmotor were utilized until the mid-1960s, when a breakthrough in the history of oxygen delivery was made: the demand valve.<ref name=\"Demand valve assembly for use with breathing or resuscitation equipment\" <ref>{{cite book|last=CHANEY|first=G.|title=US Patent 3,285,261|date=Nov 15, 1966}}</ref>\n\nThe demand valve was a revolutionary new piece of equipment. At the simple push of a button, high-flow oxygen could be delivered into the lungs of the patient without the worry of the device cycling and, thus, ceasing to pump oxygen. Any amount of pressure that might be required to inflate the lungs could be achieved, and the demand valve was better able to detect obstructions in the lungs and more able to \"work with the patient\" than the Emerson and Pulmotor could. The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress. Conserving the often limited reserves of oxygen was easier with a demand valve, as oxygen was designed only to flow when either the button was depressed or the casualty inhaled. Later medical opinion decided that getting high flow oxygen into a patients airway was a factor in causing vomiting and aspiration. Demand valve resuscitators were introduced with restrictors to limit flow rates to 40 lpm. Use of the demand valve resuscitator in Europe was limited by the lack of pressure relief valve or audible alarm for high pressure.\n\n== Modern day ==\nThe [[bag valve mask|ambu-bag]] was a further advancement in resuscitation. Introduced in the 1960s by the Danish company Ambu, this device allowed two rescuers to perform CPR and ventilation on a non-breathing patient with an acceptable chance of success. The ambu-bag has now mostly replaced the demand valve as the primary method of ventilation, largely due to concerns of potential over-inflation with the demand valve by untrained rescuers. The ambu-bag, unlike the older version of the demand valve (all new models of demand valve now have pressure relief valves set at 60&nbsp;cm of water to prevent accidental overinflation of the lungs), has a \"pop-off\" valve to prevent inflation at greater than 40 pounds -per-square-inch (275.79 kilo-pascals), with the result being that it is generally more common in the pre-hospital setting than the demand valve. However, the demand valve remains popular with BLS providers, and in situations where conserving supplies of oxygen is  of paramount importance. The demand valve, while less popular today than it was previously, still remains in service, albeit with important safety features added, including the addition of a pressure-relief valve to prevent over-inflation and the restriction of its flow to 40 liters a minute.\n\nEven newer products have been developed and are now available. In 1992 the Genesis(R) II time/volume cycled resuscitator (now upgraded to meet the current, International, resuscitation guidelines and called the CAREvent(R) ALS and CA)provide the SIMV automatic ventilation mode with demand breathing for the spontaneously breathing patient. These devices work like full blown transport ventilators yet are simple enough to operate that they can be used in an emergency situation by pre-hospital healthcare providers and are small enough to be easily transportable. Having a manual override control for use during mask CPR they meet the requirements of the current resuscitation standards. The Oxylator (R) EM-100 introduced in the late 1990s and subsequently replaced by the more flexible Oxylator (R) EMX and HD are pressure cycled devices that utilize pressure, rather than time, cycling to ventilate the patient. \nMore recently the microVENT resuscitator range introduced two new models, the microVENT(R) CPR and the microVENT(R)World. These two new time/volume resuscitators meet the latest requirements for resuscitation and are lighter and smaller<ref name=\"Brochure download\">{{cite web|title=Manufacturer information|url=http://www.meditech.gb.com/Downloads.html|website=Meditech (B.N.O.S.

Mugen's grip on the town ended after the legendary Amamiya Brothers refused to submit to their will. The 5 gangs that comprise SWORD fight for their pride and glory, but the mysterious new gang Mighty Warriors who newly comes to the coastal regions near the SWORD area begins to challenge their reigns. \n\nThis movie picks up where the 2nd season of the HiGH&LOW TV drama left off. \n\nKohaku, former leader of the powerful Mugen, is devastated over the death of his close friend, Tatsuya. He's approached by Lee from Chanson, a mafia from South Korea. Chanson is working with the local yakuza group Kuryu Group to gain control of the area together, and Lee induces Kohaku to join the plan. To achieve this goal, Chanson and Kuryu Group also enlist the help of the vicious gang DOUBT and Mighty Warriors to cause havoc in all five districts of the SWORD area. Most notably, Mighty Warriors sets the Nameless Road ablaze, killing some of the residents there. \n\nThe 5 SWORD gangs have to join together to defeat a ferocious Kohaku, and the five hundred men he leads.  The Amamiya Brothers also join the 5 SWORD gangs in the fatal fight. At last, Kohaku is brought back to his senses, Lee's plan failed, and the SWORD won this fatal fight to protect their town.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Takanori Iwata]]<ref name=\"allcinema\"/> as Cobra, leader of [[High&Low#Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)|Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)]], and a member of the former legendary gang [[High&Low#Mugen|Mugen]].

Mugen's grip on the town ended after the legendary Amamiya Brothers refused to submit to their will. The 5 gangs that comprise SWORD fight for their pride and glory, but the mysterious new gang Mighty Warriors who newly comes to the coastal regions near the SWORD area begins to challenge their reigns. \n\nThis movie picks up where the 2nd season of the HiGH&LOW TV drama left off. \n\nKohaku, former leader of the powerful Mugen, is devastated over the death of his close friend, Tatsuya. He's approached by Lee from Chanson, a mafia from South Korea. Chanson is working with the local yakuza group Kuryu Group to gain control of the area together, and Lee induces Kohaku to join the plan. To achieve this goal, Chanson and Kuryu Group also enlist the help of the vicious gang DOUBT and Mighty Warriors to cause havoc in all five districts of the SWORD area. Most notably, Mighty Warriors sets the Nameless Road ablaze, killing some of the residents there. \n\nThe 5 SWORD gangs have to join together to defeat a ferocious Kohaku, and the five hundred men he leads.  The Amamiya Brothers also join the 5 SWORD gangs in the fatal fight. At last, Kohaku is brought back to his senses, Lee's plan failed, and the SWORD won this fatal fight to protect their town.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Takanori Iwata]]<ref name=\"allcinema\"/> as Cobra, leader of [[High&Low#Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)|Sannoh Rengokai (Hoodlum Squad)]], and a member of the former legendary gang [[High&Low#Mugen|Mugen]].

Krathum District]] of [[Phitsanulok Province]], [[Thailand]].\n\n(Not to be confused with [[Ban Rai, Uthai Thani]], which is a district (''[[amphoe]]'') in [[Uthai Thani Province]], [[Thailand]].)\n\n==Geography==\nBan Rai borders [[Bang Rakam District]] and [[Wang Nam Khu]] of [[Mueang Phitsanulok District]] to the north, Bang Krathum to the east, [[Khok Salut]] to the south and [[Phichit Province]] to the west.\nMost of Ban Rai lies in the [[Nan River#Nan Basin|Nan Basin]], although a narrow strip of land on the west side of the subdistrict lies in the [[Yom River#Yom Basin|Yom Basin]]. Both basins are part of the [[Chao Phraya River#Chao Phraya watershed|Chao Phraya Watershed]]. The [[Nan River]] flows through Ban Rai at Ban Khok Salut, and the [[Yom River]] forms part of the subdistrict's border with Phichit.\n\n==Administration==\nThe subdistrict is divided into 10 smaller divisions called (''[[muban]]'') (villages). There are seven villages, several of which occupy multiple mubans. Ban Rai is administered by a [[Tambon administrative organization]] (TAO). The mubans in Ban Rai are enumerated as follows:\n<ref name=\"Pitlocal.org\">[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:GX9UMhZNdisJ:www.pitloklocal.org/songko47.xls+%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%87&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=7&gl=us Ban Rai at Pitlocal.org]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Thai)</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| No.\n| English\n| Thai\n|-\n| 1\n| Ban Hua Laem\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e21\n|-\n| 2-3\n| Ban Kok Salud\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e42\u0e04\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e38\u0e14\n|-\n| 4\n| Ban Rai\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e44\u0e23\u0e48\n|-\n| 5-7\n| Ban Wat Kwang\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e02\u0e27\u0e32\u0e07\n|-\n| 8\n| Ban Hat Tra Koo\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e14\u0e15\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e39\n|-\n| 9\n| Ban Yan Non Prai\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e42\u0e19\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\n|-\n| 10\n| Ban Khon Apak\n| \u0e1a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01\n|}\n\n==Temples==\nBan Rai is home to the following four temples:<ref name=\"WebWat.com\">[http://www.webwat.net/temple_detail.php?province_id=9&region_id=1&page=6 Ban Rai on WebWat.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904200850/http://www.webwat.net/temple_detail.php?province_id=9&region_id=1&page=6 |date=September 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n*Wat Sirisutthawas (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e23\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e32\u0e27\u0e32\u0e2a in Ban Wat Kwang)\n*Wat Kok Salud (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e42\u0e04\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e38\u0e14 Ban Kok Salud Village Temple) in Ban Kok Salud\n*Wat Prai Soowan (Thai: [[:th:\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e44\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13]], Golden Forest Temple) in Ban Yan Non Prai\n*Wat Mai Ratsongtham (\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e23\u0e32\u0e29\u0e0e\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21 in Ban Rai)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Tambon of Phitsanulok Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Phitsanulok Province]]\n", "name_user": "Seligne", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Rai,_Phitsanulok"}
