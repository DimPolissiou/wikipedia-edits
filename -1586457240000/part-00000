An arts administrator often directs the hiring and training of personnel, devises their schedules and task assignments. Those employed by non-profit (or not-for profit in Canada) organizations are in charge of organizing fund-raising events and enlisting financial supporters. Additionally, arts administrators are expected to conduct grant research, apply for grants and disburse acquired funding so that programming can continue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://study.com/articles/Arts_Administrator_Job_Description_Duties_and_Career_Outlook.html|title=Arts Administrator: Job Description, Duties and Career Outlook|last=|first=|date=|website=study.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn arts administrator employed by a small organization can be responsible for [[marketing|marketing events]], event booking, and managing project budges. An arts administrator employed by a larger arts organization may be responsible for buildings and facilities, creative staff (e.g., performers/artists), administrative staff, [[public relations]], marketing, writing proposals and reports.\n\nA senior-level arts administrator may advise the [[board of directors]] or other senior managers on strategic planning and management decisions. An effective arts administrator must also be knowledgeable in local, state and federal [[public policy]] as it relates to [[human resources]], [[health insurance]], [[labor laws]] and volunteer risk management.<ref name=\"prospects.ac.uk\" />\n\nArts administrators have the ability to create and administer necessary professional development to fine arts teachers. Professional development for the arts is often subpar due to a lack in finances from the government's allotted funding, which can be remedied by the lobbying of arts administrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gates|first=Leslie|date=2010|title=Professional Development: Through Collaborative Inquiry for an Art Education Archipelago|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25746078?seq=1|journal=Studies in Arts Education|volume=V.52 no.1|pages=6-17|access-date=2018-09-16|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\n==Advocacy in Arts Administration==\nLike any business, arts organizations must work within changing external and internal environments.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 84.</ref> External changes may be cultural, social, demographic, economic, political, legal, or technological.  Internal changes may be related to the audience, membership, Board of Directors, personnel, facilities, growth, or financial operations. Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 87.</ref>  Arts organizations, as part of the economic system, experience the effects of expansion and contractions in the local, regional, national, and world economies.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\". Focal Press. p. 93.</ref> Many arts organizations struggle in difficult economic times. Increasingly, the AAAE ([[Association of Arts Administration Educators]]) membership has become more interested and proactive in responding to key issues in the arts and in offering help to arts organizations on management, policy, governance, fund development, and financial issues. As a result of this new commitment, research in the program is growing in both amount and quality.\n\nThe history of Advocacy for the arts in Canada is largely represented by the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des Artistes Canadiens (CARFAC). It is a [[non-profit corporation]] that serves as the national voice of Canada's professional visual artists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfac.ca/about/|title=About CARFAC|last=|first=|date=|website=CARFAC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The organization's active involvement in advocacy, [[lobbying]], research and public education on behalf of artists in Canada has defined CARFAC as an integral representative body for artists across Canada.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1975 CARFAC was successful in lobbying for exhibition fees for artists.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.carfac.ca/about/carfac-history/|title=CARFAC History|last=|first=|date=|website=CARFAC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> As a result the Canada Council made the payment of fees to living Canadian artists a requirement for eligibility for Program Assistance Grants to Public Art Galleries.<ref name=\":2\" /> CARFAC\u2019s advocacy for artists resulted in the creation of the federal Copyright Act amendment in 1988.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Act recognizes artists as the primary producers of culture, and gives artists legal entitlement to exhibition and other fees.<ref name=\":2\" /> Arts Administrators throughout Canada actively refer to CARFAC's artist fee requirements when hiring professional artists.\n\n== Government Funding and Granting Bodies  ==\nEach country has their own models and agencies to fund the arts. In Canada the arts are funded by the Canadian government through the Department of Canadian Heritage. Each province has a ministry that funds arts and culture. Depending on the governmental party in power, the amount of funds available for the arts and culture vary. In Ontario, the Ministry that funds the arts is the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-heritage-sport-tourism-culture-industries|title=Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Cultural Industries|last=|first=|date=|website=Ontario.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> \n\nIn Canada there are federal, provincial and municipal granting bodies that fund the arts.

Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.\n\nArts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University}}</ref>  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.\n\nAt some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|title=Arts Management Degree Programs & Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|title=Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|website=www.depaul.edu|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref>, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, [[University of Southern California]]'s Master of Science in Arts Leadership program).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|title=Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|website=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/|title=Arts Leadership {{!}} USC Thornton School of Music|website=music.usc.edu|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  \n\nUniversities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.\n\nThough curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \"in the field,\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations.

For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.<ref>[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management.

[[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.\n\nSome programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs. Another example is the University of Southern California's [https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/ Master of Science in Arts Leadership] which is housed within the [[USC Thornton School of Music]], and accepts thought leaders in any artistic discipline including music, theatre, dance, film, and fine art.\n\nSeveral universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management.

Another change that must be taken into consideration is the growing need for technology-based marketing programs (i.e.: social media) in order for the organization to change with the times and bring younger visitor and member pools into the organization.\n\nAlthough a good arts administrator constantly monitors and manages change, they must also remain aware of the overall direction and mood of the organization while helping people do their day-to-day jobs.<ref>^ Byrnes, William, J, (2009). \"Management and the Arts\".

From 1990 to 1999, 35 percent of the United States currently active, larger foundations (with assets over $1 million) were established, and 23 percent were established between 2000 and 2009.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition to larger entities, small private or family foundations also give significant amounts to the arts.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some institutions foster more mainstream projects, while others specialize in supporting the avant-garde. Small foundations can be well-suited at identifying and addressing unmet community needs, and they can assist in identifying additional funding sources for undercapitalized projects.<ref name=\":0\" /> Corporate giving, like foundation giving, has been influenced by public policy decisions.

Some academic units offer certificate programs for practitioners seeking continuing education or professional development education. While programs in arts administration draw on many elements of related administration fields, such as [[business administration]], they also include specialized courses on administering [[non-profit]] arts and cultural organizations.\n\nArts administration programs award a range of credentials, including certificates and diplomas, bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. These programs usually blend curriculum elements from existing administration programs such as [[public administration]], business administration, arts law, and [[management]]. At some institutions arts administration may be a concentration within the school's [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) program. The MA in Arts Administration program at [[Columbia University]] is the only program that ties together curriculum elements from public and private management/administration, law, business, and finance at an [[Ivy league]] university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.columbia.edu/artsadmin/|title=Arts Administration@Teachers College, Columbia University}}</ref>  Many arts administration programs include a practicum in which the student volunteers or works in an arts or cultural organization to gain practical experience.\n\nAt some universities, similar programs are called arts management (e.g. American University)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/cas/arts-management/|title=Arts Management Degree Programs & Information {{!}} American University, Washington, DC|website=www.american.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref>, performing arts management (e.g. DePaul University's Undergraduate music program)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.depaul.edu/academics/undergraduate-majors/performing-arts-management-bm/Pages/default.aspx|title=Performing Arts Management {{!}} School of Music {{!}} DePaul University|website=www.depaul.edu|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref>, or arts leadership (e.g. DePaul University's Graduate program, [[University of Southern California]]'s Master of Science in Arts Leadership program).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.depaul.edu/conservatory/graduate/arts-leadership/Pages/default.aspx|title=Graduate Degree in Arts Leadership {{!}} Conservatory {{!}} DePaul Theatre {{!}} DePaul University|website=theatre.depaul.edu|accessdate=2015-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/|title=Arts Leadership {{!}} USC Thornton School of Music|website=music.usc.edu|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>  \n\nUniversities such as American, Wisconsin and Indiana, among many others, offer programs to students in all arts disciplines, while others are more specialized towards a particular discipline (DePaul's undergraduate and graduate theatre programs are theatre oriented, while its undergraduate music program is music oriented).  The master's degree at some schools is an [[MBA]], while other universities offer [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]], MA, and MPA degrees, largely depending on where the program is housed.  For example, at American University, the program is part of the Department of Performing Arts, whereas at Indiana University it is part of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  Another program differentiator of note is that the MFA is considered a terminal degree in the field, allowing graduates to apply to teach at the university level as a full-time professor.\n\nThough curricula may be similar, the atmosphere of programs may differ.  Variances between programs may often revolve around the centrality of arts versus the centrality of business skills in the curriculum.  Other programs, such as Ohio State, Indiana, and (increasingly) American, are strongly rooted in cultural policy.  Another program differentiator is the amount of time spent \"in the field,\" applying academic principles to existing arts organizations through practicum or internship experiences.  [http://www.seattleu.edu/artsci/mfa/ Seattle University's] [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in Arts Leadership degree program requires that students spend time each quarter working with a local arts organization through a practicum.  They believe this emphasis on real-world interaction helps reinforce classwork and helps build a network of arts professionals that serves as a resource upon graduation. At George Mason University, MA in Arts Management at the College of Visual & Performing Arts (Arlington, VA) [http://artsmanagement.gmu.edu], one of the largest enrolled programs in the USA, no less than 252 hours of internship are required in at least two different arts organizations. At this institution, the faculty are required to be both academically and experientially qualified, with many being current senior arts managers at some of the Washington, DC's area most prominent visual & performing arts centers.\n\nMost programs require two years in residence, though [http://www.drexel.com/online-degrees/business-degrees/arts-administration/index.aspx Drexel University], [http://universitycollege.du.edu/mals/degree/masters/arts-development-and-program-management-online/degreeid/423 University of Denver], and [[Goucher College]] offer online options with limited residency.

For example, the [[University of Cincinnati]] offers an MA/MBA program in conjunction with the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].  The UC/CCM Graduate Arts Administration Program, like most others, exists to prepare and train students to become successful [[CEO]]s and senior managers of non-profit arts and cultural institutions by combining business administration and real-world experience.<ref>[http://www.artsadminmba.com www.ArtsAdminMBA.com]</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the [http://www.ied.edu Istituto Europeo di Design], in Venice, offers a [http://www.ied.edu/venice/management-school/master-courses/business-administration-for-arts-and-cultural-events/CMG2095E Master in Business Administration in Arts and Cultural Events] that provides advanced knowledge and entrepreneurial skills necessary to understand and operate in the multifarious world of the arts. A similar course is held in [[Bologna]], at the [[University of Bologna]], called Innovation and Organization of Culture and the Arts [http://corsi.unibo.it/gioca/Pages/default.aspx], offering a double degree opportunity together with Carnegie Mellon's Master of Arts Management. In Turin, the [[St. John International University]] [http://www.sjiu.it/] offers a Master of Arts in International Arts Administration. A new innovative program based on the concept of artwork as 'information', that integrate recording, cataloging, communication, management, fruition. The program is led by faculty and high level practitioners from Heritage, srl.\n\nOther programs may offer a single degree that includes coursework at two colleges. [[Carnegie Mellon]]'s Master of Arts Management (MAM) Program is one example, tying the [[Carnegie Mellon College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]] to [[Heinz College]]'s School of Public Policy and Management. Heinz College provides the core management coursework and the College of Fine Arts supports the MAM Program with coursework specific to arts institutions.  Another example is the two-year MA/MBA program at [[Southern Methodist University]], offering a Master of Arts in Arts Administration from the Meadows School of the Arts and a Master of Business Administration from the Cox School of Business.\n\nSome programs are housed within their university's Music, Theater and Dance department like the one at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. This is the [http://leap.colostate.edu/masters/ LEAP Institute for the Arts Master of Arts Leadership and Administration] residential and online programs. Another example is the University of Southern California's [https://music.usc.edu/departments/arts-leadership/master-of-science-arts-leadership/ Master of Science in Arts Leadership] which is housed within the [[USC Thornton School of Music]], and accepts thought leaders in any artistic discipline including music, theatre, dance, film, and fine art.\n\nSeveral universities offer concentrations in media (film, television, music, new media, etc.) management: Drexel University, Carnegie Mellon, and Columbia College Chicago are examples.  Carnegie Mellon offers a separate degree in film/television management. New York University's MA in Arts Administration program allows students to choose a visual arts or a performing arts focus.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.artsmanagement.net Arts Management Network] International information service for arts administration.\n*[http://www.artsadministration.org Association of Arts Administration Educators] An international association of degree-granting programs in arts and cultural management.\n*[http://www.encatc.org European Network of Cultural Administration Training Centres]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arts Administration}}\n[[Category:Academic disciplines]]\n[[Category:Arts administrators| ]]\n[[Category:Arts occupations]]\n[[Category:Management occupations]]\n[[Category:Occupations in music]]\n", "name_user": "BlurCollective", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed information that is public domain and needs quotes.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_administration"}

Hajaresha Qadri used to give \u201cLinga Deeksha\u201d, or initiation by tying a linga around the neck of a disciple, as per the Hindu Lingayat tradition. His father used to teach him [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], and even the teachings of Allama Prabhu. Legend has it that Shishunala Sharifa was conceived with the blessings of [[Basavanna]].\n\nEven when Shishunala was a boy, He was taught the tenets of both religions. In his birthplace Shishuvinahala, even today, both Hindus and Muslims revere him as a saint at the same temple.\n\n== Meeting Govinda Bhatta ==\n\nGovinda Bhatta, a Brahmin, was famous in the region as an unconventional Master. He cared little for caste or religion, and He used to spend time with anyone who invited him, and used to eat anywhere He felt like. Other Brahmins could not stomach His approach.\n\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta came to Shishuvinahala, and Sharifa\u2019s father found Him seated under a tree. He asked Him to accept His son as disciple. In front of the father, Govinda Bhatta called the young boy and said, \u201cHey Sharifa, who is your father?\u201d The villagers laughed, but were shocked when the boy brashly said, \u201cWhat kind of question are you asking? Your father and mine are the same!\u201d. Govinda Bhatta laughed, patted the boy on the back and said, \u201cExcellent, Sharifa! The land is fertile, the seed will sprout well. O Imam, leave Him to my care! From today, He is my son!\u201d\n\nSharifa followed Govinda Bhatta back to His village. The boy was found to be curious about matters beyond logic and the world, and about the secrets of creation. These qualities were nurtured by Govinda Bhatta. Society was surprised by their closeness. In the eyes of Muslims, the Master was a Khafir (infidel) and for Brahmins, the boy was a Mleccha(outsider).\n\n=== Incidents during their time together ===\n\n==== The thorn bush ====\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta called all His young disciples to follow Him to the Temple. On the way, they were blocked by a thorn bush. Govinda Bhatta stepped on the bush with His slippers and climbed to the other side. The disciples, however, were bare-footed. Govinda Bhatta tossed His slippers across to them, but they hesitated. \u201cA Master\u2019s Padukas must be kept on the head, not worn on the feet\u201d, they said. Bhatta looked at Sharifa, and said, \u201cWill you at least join me?\u201d Sharifa, without hesitation, puts on the slippers and crosses over. The two of them leave the others behind and go to the temple alone.\n\n====Thread Ceremony====\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta was seated with some Brahmins at the village crossroad. Just then, Sharifa comes by. The Master calls Him to sit, and the two sit very closely. The others were offended, and say, \u201cDoes that Muslim look like a Brahmin to you? You have no sense of cleanliness or social status!\u201d Bhatta laughs, saying, \u201cJust because you are born a Brahmin, do you think you\u2019ll become one? None of you is a greater Brahmin than this boy!\u201d. He takes off His sacred thread puts it around Sharifa, embracing Him tightly. Sharifa, overcome with feeling, prostrates himself at the Master\u2019s feet. The Brahmins were highly offended.\n\n====The Mullah====\nOne day, a Mullah asks Sharifa, \u201cSo, I see you\u2019ve stopped coming to the mosque! Do you even remember what Namaz is?\u201d To this, Sharifa calmly replies, pointing at His own body, \u201cI dwell in this mosque, so why go and come? I am in constant worship of \u201cI AM\u201d, so what can be greater Namaz?\u201d The Mullah was dumbstruck.\n\n====Vomit incident====\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta was sick and vomited. Then he turned to Sharifa and asked \"Keep this vomit so no man steps on it\". Sharif thought that the place where no one should step on it, he understands mythology behind the Govind Bhatta words so it is said that Sharifa drank it.\n\n== Later years ==\n\nSharifa\u2019s parents force Him to marry. Sharifa goes to Bhatta and asks, \u201cIf i become a Samsari, won\u2019t i get stuck in desire and illusion?\u201d The Master replies, \u201cWhy are you worried? Even in the worst rain, does wind become wet? Does light become soaked? So go and get married!\u201d\n\nSharifa married, and had a daughter. He joins work as a schoolmaster in Karadagi, to support the family. However, His wife passes away shortly. Sharifa\u2019s neighbours adopt the child, and Sharifa quits His job. He starts participating in folk dramas, teaching simple lessons through daily experiences. Sharifa went through extreme poverty, often going without meals. However, Govinda Bhatta stood by Him through all His troubles.\n\nAfter Govinda Bhatta left His body, Sharifa lived on for another twenty years. When He started falling ill and realised His days were few, He decided to give up His body according to \u201cSharana\u201d tradition, in which ash is smeared on the body, and the feet of a Jangama, or Shaivite monk, are worshipped. The monk\u2019s feet are then placed on the head, and life is given up. Nobody agreed, but on His insistence, a Jangama by name Hirematta Karibasavayya agreed. Shishunala Sharifa left His body on 3rd July1889 AD.\n\nThe people were left confused. Sharifa was born a Muslim but lived with Hindu. The leaders of both communities came together and agreed to perform the last rites as per both religions. The Quran was read simultaneously with the Hindu Mantras.\n\nA Samadhisthan was constructed in Shishuvinahala, in a vast compound. There, statues of both Govinda Bhatta and Sharifa are visited by both Hindus and Muslims, to this day. Shishunala Sharifa is known as the Kabir of Karnataka.\n\n== Teachings ==\n\n* When the mind gets very involved in the world and becomes agitated, hit it with the hatchet and stop it. \n* The Word of knowledge given by the Master annihilates the mind, and makes all difficulties vanish.\n* As one would take good care of a horse, take care of the mind by feeding it with spiritual food. At times, whip it like a horse, so that it behaves in a manner pleasing to the Master.\n* This house (the body) moves around so much, yet through proper discipline, in this very house one can experience Shiva. \n* Jiva, like a bird in a cage, has freedom only within the cage of body and mind. But, by the Grace of the Master, the bird is able to spread its wings to fly through the entire universe.\n* The Holy Feet of his Master may look small and ordinary; however, they swallow up the huge ego when the head is placed at them.\n\nShishunala Sharifa was known to compose poems as per the situation and sing them to spread the message.

Hajaresha Qadri used to give \u201cLinga Deeksha\u201d, or initiation by tying a linga around the neck of a disciple, as per the Hindu Lingayat tradition. His father used to teach him [[Ramayana]], [[Mahabharata]], and even the teachings of Allama Prabhu. Legend has it that Shishunala Sharifa was conceived with the blessings of [[Basavanna]].\n\nEven when Shishunala was a boy, He was taught the tenets of both religions. In his birthplace Shishuvinahala, even today, both Hindus and Muslims revere him as a saint at the same temple.\n\n== Meeting Govinda Bhatta ==\n\nGovinda Bhatta, a Brahmin, was famous in the region as an unconventional Master. He cared little for caste or religion, and He used to spend time with anyone who invited him, and used to eat anywhere He felt like. Other Brahmins could not stomach His approach.\n\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta came to Shishuvinahala, and Sharifa\u2019s father found Him seated under a tree. He asked Him to accept His son as disciple. In front of the father, Govinda Bhatta called the young boy and said, \u201cHey Sharifa, who is your father?\u201d The villagers laughed, but were shocked when the boy brashly said, \u201cWhat kind of question are you asking? Your father and mine are the same!\u201d. Govinda Bhatta laughed, patted the boy on the back and said, \u201cExcellent, Sharifa! The land is fertile, the seed will sprout well. O Imam, leave Him to my care! From today, He is my son!\u201d\n\nSharifa followed Govinda Bhatta back to His village. The boy was found to be curious about matters beyond logic and the world, and about the secrets of creation. These qualities were nurtured by Govinda Bhatta. Society was surprised by their closeness. In the eyes of Muslims, the Master was a Khafir (infidel) and for Brahmins, the boy was a Mleccha(outsider).\n\n=== Incidents during their time together ===\n\n==== The thorn bush ====\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta called all His young disciples to follow Him to the Temple. On the way, they were blocked by a thorn bush. Govinda Bhatta stepped on the bush with His slippers and climbed to the other side. The disciples, however, were bare-footed. Govinda Bhatta tossed His slippers across to them, but they hesitated. \u201cA Master\u2019s Padukas must be kept on the head, not worn on the feet\u201d, they said. Bhatta looked at Sharifa, and said, \u201cWill you at least join me?\u201d Sharifa, without hesitation, puts on the slippers and crosses over. The two of them leave the others behind and go to the temple alone.\n\n====Thread Ceremony====\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta was seated with some Brahmins at the village crossroad. Just then, Sharifa comes by. The Master calls Him to sit, and the two sit very closely. The others were offended, and say, \u201cDoes that Muslim look like a Brahmin to you? You have no sense of cleanliness or social status!\u201d Bhatta laughs, saying, \u201cJust because you are born a Brahmin, do you think you\u2019ll become one? None of you is a greater Brahmin than this boy!\u201d. He takes off His sacred thread puts it around Sharifa, embracing Him tightly. Sharifa, overcome with feeling, prostrates himself at the Master\u2019s feet. The Brahmins were highly offended.\n\n====The Mullah====\nOne day, a Mullah asks Sharifa, \u201cSo, I see you\u2019ve stopped coming to the mosque! Do you even remember what Namaz is?\u201d To this, Sharifa calmly replies, pointing at His own body, \u201cI dwell in this mosque, so why go and come? I am in constant worship of \u201cI AM\u201d, so what can be greater Namaz?\u201d The Mullah was dumbstruck.\n\n====Vomit incident====\nOne day, Govinda Bhatta was sick and vomited. Then he turned to Sharifa and asked \"Keep this vomit so no man steps on it\". Sharif thought that the place where no one should step on it, he understands mythology behind the Govind Bhatta words so it is said that Sharifa drank it.\n\n== Later years ==\n\nSharifa\u2019s parents force Him to marry. Sharifa goes to Bhatta and asks, \u201cIf i become a Samsari, won\u2019t i get stuck in desire and illusion?\u201d The Master replies, \u201cWhy are you worried? Even in the worst rain, does wind become wet? Does light become soaked? So go and get married!\u201d\n\nSharifa married, and had a daughter. He joins work as a schoolmaster in Karadagi, to support the family. However, His wife passes away shortly. Sharifa\u2019s neighbours adopt the child, and Sharifa quits His job. He starts participating in folk dramas, teaching simple lessons through daily experiences. Sharifa went through extreme poverty, often going without meals. However, Govinda Bhatta stood by Him through all His troubles.\n\nAfter Govinda Bhatta left His body, Sharifa lived on for another twenty years. When He started falling ill and realised His days were few, He decided to give up His body according to \u201cSharana\u201d tradition, in which ash is smeared on the body, and the feet of a Jangama, or Shaivite monk, are worshipped. The monk\u2019s feet are then placed on the head, and life is given up. Nobody agreed, but on His insistence, a Jangama by name Hirematta Karibasavayya agreed. Shishunala Sharifa left His body on 3rd July1889 AD.\n\nThe people were left confused. Sharifa was born a Muslim but lived with Hindu. The leaders of both communities came together and agreed to perform the last rites as per both religions. The Quran was read simultaneously with the Hindu Mantras.\n\nA Samadhisthan was constructed in Shishuvinahala, in a vast compound. There, statues of both Govinda Bhatta and Sharifa are visited by both Hindus and Muslims, to this day. Shishunala Sharifa is known as the Kabir of Karnataka.\n\n== Teachings ==\n\n* When the mind gets very involved in the world and becomes agitated, hit it with the hatchet and stop it. \n* The Word of knowledge given by the Master annihilates the mind, and makes all difficulties vanish.\n* As one would take good care of a horse, take care of the mind by feeding it with spiritual food.

Bush]] and First Lady [[Laura Bush]] lead the inaugural parade from the Capitol, down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House]]\n\nThe '''inauguration of the president of the United States''' is a ceremony to mark the commencement of a new four-year term of the [[president of the United States]]. This ceremony takes place for each new presidential term, even if the president is continuing in office for a second term. Since 1937, it has taken place at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on January 20, the first day of the new term, some {{age in days|November 9, 2016|January 20, 2017}} to {{age in days|November 3, 2016|January 20, 2017}} days after the [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], except for three occasions when January 20 fell on a Sunday. In those years, the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] was administered on that day privately and then again in a public ceremony the next day, on Monday, January 21. The most recent presidential inauguration ceremony was held on Friday, January 20, 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] officially assumed presidential duties.\n\n[[Recitation]] of the presidential oath of office is the only component in this ceremony mandated by the [[United States Constitution]] (in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation|Article II, Section One, Clause 8]]). Though it is not a constitutional requirement, the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]] typically administers the presidential oath of office. Since 1789, the oath has been administered at 58 scheduled public inaugurations, by 15 chief justices, one [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice]], and one New York state judge. Others, in addition to the chief justice, have administered the oath of office to several of the nine [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidents]] who have succeeded to the presidency upon their predecessor's death or resignation intra-term.\n\nSince the [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan]], the ceremony has been held at the west front of the [[United States Capitol]] facing the [[National Mall]] with its iconic [[Washington Monument]] and distant [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Other swearing-in ceremonies have taken place on a platform over the steps at the Capitol's east portico on a regular basis for 180 years, and occasionally inside the [[Old Senate Chamber]] on the old north side, the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the south wing, and the central [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]] under the dome.<ref name=\"CNN 2017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/inauguration-day-events-traditions/|title=Presidents change, Inauguration Day stays the same|last=Williams|first=Brenna Williams|publisher=CNN|date=January 16, 2017|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref> The last regularly scheduled inauguration not to take place at the Capitol was [[Fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's fourth inauguration]] in 1945, which was held at the [[White House]].\n\nOver the years, various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event, including parades and multiple social gatherings. The ceremony itself is carried live via the major U.S. [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] and [[United States cable news|cable news]] networks; various ones also stream it live on their websites.\n\nWhen a president has assumed office intra-term the inauguration ceremony has been conducted without pomp or fanfare. To facilitate a quick [[United States presidential transition|presidential transition]] under extraordinary circumstances, the new president takes the oath of office in a simple ceremony and usually addresses the nation afterward.\n\n=={{anchor|Inaugural ceremonies}}Inauguration ceremonies==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

All subsequent (regular) inaugurations from 1793 until 1933, were held on March 4,  the day of the year on which the federal government began operations under the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The exception to this pattern was those years in which March 4 fell on a Sunday. When it did, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5. This happened on four occasions, in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917. Inauguration Day moved to January 20, beginning in 1937, following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution]], where it has remained since. A similar Sunday exception and move to Monday is made around this date as well (which happened in 1957, 1985, and 2013).\n\nThis resulted in a several anomilies: The Presidency was technically vacant for 24 hours in 1821, and in 1849, it is alleged that Senate President pro tempore [[David Rice Atchison]] was president for a day.<ref name=1day441849>{{cite web| title=President for a Day: March 4, 1849| url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/President_For_A_Day.htm| publisher=Office of the Secretary, United States Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession| last1=Feerick| first1=John D.| last2=Freund| first2=Paul A.| date=1965| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=twentyfifth_amendment_books| publisher=Fordham University Press| location=New York City| pages=100\u2013101| lccn=65-14917}}</ref> In 1877, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] was sworn in secretly on March 3 due to the controversy over the [[Compromise of 1877]].\n\nSince 1917, the President took his oath on a Sunday in a private ceremony and repeated it the following day among all that pomp and circumstance. In 1985 and 2013, these were televised. \n\nInauguration Day, while not a [[federal holiday]], is observed as a holiday by federal employees who would be working in the \"Inauguration Day Area.\" The Inauguration Day Area consists of the District of Columbia; [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties in Maryland; [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] Counties in Virginia [The City of Fairfax is considered part of Fairfax county for this purpose.], and the cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] in Virginia, and who are regularly scheduled to perform non-overtime work on Inauguration Day.<ref name=\"hr.commerce.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://hr.commerce.gov/Employees/Leave/DEV01_005944|publisher=US Department of Commerce|title=Federal, state, and local holidays|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> There is no in-lieu-of holiday for employees or students who are not regularly scheduled to work or attend school on Inauguration Day.\n\n===Locations===\nMost presidential inaugurations since 1801 have been held in Washington D.C. at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]].

[[Andrew Jackson]], in 1829, was the first of 35 held on the east front of the Capitol.

U.S. military personnel have participated in Inauguration Day ceremonies since 1789 when members of the [[Continental Army]], local [[Militia (United States)|militia units]] and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veterans escorted George Washington to his first inauguration ceremony. Their participation traditionally includes musical units, [[color guard]]s, [[Presidential Salute Battery|salute batteries]] and [[Honor guard#United States|honor cordons]].

Prior to 1937, the [[Oath of office of the Vice President of the United States|vice presidential oath]] was administered in the [[United States Senate|Senate Chamber]] (in keeping with the vice president's position as president of the Senate). The oath is administered to the vice president first. Immediately afterwards, the [[United States Marine Band]] will perform four ''[[ruffles and flourishes]]'', followed by ''[[Hail, Columbia]].'' Unlike the presidential oath, however, the Constitution does not specify specific words that must be spoken. Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789. The current form, which is also recited by senators, representatives, and other government officers, has been in use since 1884:\n{{cquote|I do solemnly swear (or [[Affirmation in law|affirm]]) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.<ref>{{usc|5|3331}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAt noon, the new presidential and vice presidential terms begin. At about that time, the president recites the constitutionally mandated oath of office:\n{{cquote|I do solemnly swear (or [[Affirmation in law|affirm]]) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n}}\n\nAccording to [[Washington Irving]]'s biography of George Washington, after reciting the oath at his (and the nation's) first inauguration, Washington added the words \"so help me God\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2002-2009-fpc.state.gov/40871.htm |title=Presidential Inaugurations Past and Present: A Look at the History Behind the Pomp and Circumstance |publisher=2002-2009-fpc.state.gov |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> However, the only contemporaneous source that fully reproduced Washington's oath completely lacks the religious codicil.<ref>''Documentary History of the First Federal Congress'', Vol. 15, pages 404\u2013405</ref> The first newspaper report that actually described the exact words used in an oath of office, Chester Arthur's in 1881,<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/09/23/98566684.pdf\n|title=The New Administration: President Arthur Formally Inaugurated\n|date=September 22, 1881\n|accessdate=January 19, 2009\n|format=PDF\n|work=The New York Times\n}}</ref> repeated the \"query-response\" method where the words, \"so help me God\" were a personal prayer, not a part of the constitutional oath. The time of adoption of the current procedure, where both the chief justice and the president speak the oath, is unknown.\n\nThe oath of office was administered to Washington in 1789 by [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], Chancellor of New York State. Four years later, the oath was administered by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court associate justice]] [[William Cushing]]. Since the 1797 inauguration of [[John Adams]], it has become customary for the new president to be sworn into office by the Supreme Court's [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]]. Others have administered the oath on occasions when a new president assumed office intra-term due to the incumbent's death or resignation.  [[William Cranch]], chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court, administered the oath of office to [[John Tyler]] in 1841 when he succeeded to the presidency upon [[William Henry Harrison]]'s death, and to [[Millard Fillmore]] in 1850 when [[Zachary Taylor]] died. In 1923, upon being informed of [[Warren Harding]]'s death, while visiting his [[Coolidge Homestead|family home]] in [[Plymouth Notch, Vermont]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] was sworn in as president by his father, [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]], a [[notary public]].<ref>Glenn D.

With the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|2017 inauguration]] of [[Donald Trump]], the oath has been taken 75 different times by 44 people. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because the day of inauguration has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inaugural ceremonies. In addition, three have repeated the oath as a precaution against potential later constitutional challenges.<ref name=\"inaugUSCap\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/inauguration-us-capitol|title=Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is no requirement that any book, or in particular a book of sacred text, be used to administer the oath, and none is mentioned in the Constitution. By convention, incoming presidents raise their right hand and place the left on a [[Bible]] or other book while taking the oath of office.

As with many inaugural customs, this one was started by George Washington in 1789. After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall, he proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries. Every president since Washington has delivered an Inaugural address. While many of the early presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the chief justice administer the oath first, followed by the president's speech.<ref name=\"JCCOIC\"/> [[William McKinley]] requested the change in 1897, so that he could reiterate the words of the oath at the close of his first inaugural address.\n\n[[William Henry Harrison]] delivered the longest inaugural address, at 8,445 words, in 1841. John Adams' 1797 address, which totaled 2,308 words, contained the longest sentence, at 737 words. In 1793, Washington gave the shortest inaugural address on record, just 135 words.<ref name=\"JCCOIC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/days-events/inaugural-address/ |title=Inaugural Address |publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies |accessdate=January 23, 2017}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nMost presidents use their inaugural address to present their vision of America and to set forth their goals for the nation. Some of the most eloquent and powerful speeches are still quoted today. In 1865, in the waning days of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] stated, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" In 1933, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] avowed, \"we have nothing to fear but fear itself.\" And in 1961, [[John F.

In fact, contemporary inaugural celebrations typically span 10 days, from five days before the inauguration to five days after. On some occasions however, either due to the preferences of the new president or to other constraining circumstances, they have been scaled back. Such was the case in 1945, because of [[Rationing in the United States|rationing]] in effect during [[World War II]]. More recently, in 1973, the celebrations marking Richard Nixon's second inauguration were altered because of the death of former president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] two days after the ceremony. All pending events were cancelled so preparations for Johnson's [[State funerals in the United States|state funeral]] could begin.

The parade, which proceeds along the 1.5 miles of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the stand and the Front Lawn in view of the presidential party, features both military and civilian participants from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; this parade largely evolved from the post-inaugural procession to the White House, and occurred as far back as [[second inauguration of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's second inauguration]] in 1805, when workers from the [[Washington Navy Yard]], accompanied by military music, marched with the president<ref name=\"MBhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marineband.marines.mil/Portals/175/Site%20Images/Inauguration/Marine%20Band%20Inauguration%20History_2017.pdf?ver=2017-01-11-113551-543|title=Marine Band Inauguration History|publisher=Marine Band Public Affairs Office|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}</ref> on foot as he rode on horseback from the Capitol to the White House.

With the District of Columbia attracting thousands of attendees for inauguration, presidential medals were an inexpensive souvenir for the tourists to remember the occasion. However, the once-simple trinket turned into an official presidential election memento. In 1901, the first Inauguration Committee<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president-inauguration-2017.blogspot.com/2017/01/presidential-inaugural-committee-2017.html|title=presidential inaugural committee 2017|last=Vocal|first=Youth|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> on Medals and Badges was established as part of the official Inauguration Committee for the re-election of President McKinley. The Committee saw official medals as a way to raise funding for the festivities. Gold medals were to be produced as gifts for the president, vice president, and committee chair; silver medals were to be created and distributed among Inauguration Committee members, and bronze medals would be for sale for public consumption. McKinley's medal was simple with his portrait on one side and writing on the other side.<ref>MacNeil, Neil. ''The President's medal, 1789\u20131977''. New York: Published in association with the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, by C. N. Potter, 1977.</ref>\n\nUnlike his predecessor, when Theodore Roosevelt took his oath of office in 1905, he found the previous presidential medal unacceptable. As an art lover and admirer of the ancient Greek high-relief coins, Roosevelt wanted more than a simple medal\u2014he wanted a work of art. To achieve this goal, the president hired [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], a famous American sculptor, to design and create his inauguration medal. Saint-Gaudens's obsession with perfection resulted in a forestalled release and the medals were distributed after the actual inauguration. Nonetheless, President Roosevelt was very pleased with the result. Saint Gardens' design, executed by [[Adolph A. Weinman]], was cast by [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany & Company]] and was proclaimed an artistic triumph.<ref name=\"histIM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.loriferber.com/research/inaugural-facts-statistics/history-of-the-inaugural-medal.html|title=History of the Official Inaugural Medal|last=Levine|first=H.

After the president sits for the sculptor, the resulting clay sketch is turned into a life mask and plaster model. Finishing touches are added and the epoxy cast that is created is used to produce the die cuts. The die cuts are then used to strike the president's portrait on each medal.<ref>Levine, H. Joseph.

Bush]] and First Lady [[Laura Bush]] lead the inaugural parade from the Capitol, down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House]]\n\nThe '''inauguration of the president of the United States''' is a ceremony to mark the commencement of a new four-year term of the [[president of the United States]]. This ceremony takes place for each new presidential term, even if the president is continuing in office for a second term. Since 1937, it has taken place at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on January 20, the first day of the new term, some {{age in days|November 9, 2016|January 20, 2017}} to {{age in days|November 3, 2016|January 20, 2017}} days after the [[United States presidential election|presidential election]], except for three occasions when January 20 fell on a Sunday. In those years, the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|presidential oath of office]] was administered on that day privately and then again in a public ceremony the next day, on Monday, January 21. The most recent presidential inauguration ceremony was held on Friday, January 20, 2017, when [[Donald Trump]] officially assumed presidential duties.\n\n[[Recitation]] of the presidential oath of office is the only component in this ceremony mandated by the [[United States Constitution]] (in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation|Article II, Section One, Clause 8]]). Though it is not a constitutional requirement, the [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]] typically administers the presidential oath of office. Since 1789, the oath has been administered at 58 scheduled public inaugurations, by 15 chief justices, one [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|associate justice]], and one New York state judge. Others, in addition to the chief justice, have administered the oath of office to several of the nine [[Vice President of the United States|vice presidents]] who have succeeded to the presidency upon their predecessor's death or resignation intra-term.\n\nSince the [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan]], the ceremony has been held at the west front of the [[United States Capitol]] facing the [[National Mall]] with its iconic [[Washington Monument]] and distant [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Other swearing-in ceremonies have taken place on a platform over the steps at the Capitol's east portico on a regular basis for 180 years, and occasionally inside the [[Old Senate Chamber]] on the old north side, the chamber of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the south wing, and the central [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]] under the dome.<ref name=\"CNN 2017\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/inauguration-day-events-traditions/|title=Presidents change, Inauguration Day stays the same|last=Williams|first=Brenna Williams|publisher=CNN|date=January 16, 2017|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref> The last regularly scheduled inauguration not to take place at the Capitol was [[Fourth inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt's fourth inauguration]] in 1945, which was held at the [[White House]].\n\nOver the years, various traditions have arisen that have expanded the inauguration from a simple oath-taking ceremony to a day-long event, including parades and multiple social gatherings. The ceremony itself is carried live via the major U.S. [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] and [[United States cable news|cable news]] networks; various ones also stream it live on their websites.\n\nWhen a president has assumed office intra-term the inauguration ceremony has been conducted without pomp or fanfare. To facilitate a quick [[United States presidential transition|presidential transition]] under extraordinary circumstances, the new president takes the oath of office in a simple ceremony and usually addresses the nation afterward.\n\n=={{anchor|Inaugural ceremonies}}Inauguration ceremonies==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

All subsequent (regular) inaugurations from 1793 until 1933, were held on March 4,  the day of the year on which the federal government began operations under the U.S. Constitution in 1789. The exception to this pattern was those years in which March 4 fell on a Sunday. When it did, the public inauguration ceremony would take place on Monday, March 5. This happened on four occasions, in 1821, 1849, 1877, and 1917. Inauguration Day moved to January 20, beginning in 1937, following ratification of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution]], where it has remained since. A similar Sunday exception and move to Monday is made around this date as well (which happened in 1957, 1985, and 2013).\n\nThis resulted in a several anomilies: The Presidency was technically vacant for 24 hours in 1821, and in 1849, it is alleged that Senate President pro tempore [[David Rice Atchison]] was president for a day.<ref name=1day441849>{{cite web| title=President for a Day: March 4, 1849| url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/President_For_A_Day.htm| publisher=Office of the Secretary, United States Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=From Failing Hands: the Story of Presidential Succession| last1=Feerick| first1=John D.| last2=Freund| first2=Paul A.| date=1965| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=twentyfifth_amendment_books| publisher=Fordham University Press| location=New York City| pages=100\u2013101| lccn=65-14917}}</ref> In 1877, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] was sworn in secretly on March 3 due to the controversy over the [[Compromise of 1877]].\n\nSince 1917, the President took his oath on a Sunday in a private ceremony and repeated it the following day among all that pomp and circumstance. In 1985 and 2013, these were televised. \n\nInauguration Day, while not a [[federal holiday]], is observed as a holiday by federal employees who would be working in the \"Inauguration Day Area.\" The Inauguration Day Area consists of the District of Columbia; [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]] and [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]] counties in Maryland; [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] Counties in Virginia [The City of Fairfax is considered part of Fairfax county for this purpose.], and the cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] in Virginia, and who are regularly scheduled to perform non-overtime work on Inauguration Day.<ref name=\"hr.commerce.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://hr.commerce.gov/Employees/Leave/DEV01_005944|publisher=US Department of Commerce|title=Federal, state, and local holidays|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> There is no in-lieu-of holiday for employees or students who are not regularly scheduled to work or attend school on Inauguration Day.\n\n===Locations===\nMost presidential inaugurations since 1801 have been held in Washington D.C. at the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]].

U.S. military personnel have participated in Inauguration Day ceremonies since 1789 when members of the [[Continental Army]], local [[Militia (United States)|militia units]] and [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veterans escorted George Washington to his first inauguration ceremony. Their participation traditionally includes musical units, [[color guard]]s, [[Presidential Salute Battery|salute batteries]] and [[Honor guard#United States|honor cordons]].

Prior to 1937, the [[Oath of office of the Vice President of the United States|vice presidential oath]] was administered in the [[United States Senate|Senate Chamber]] (in keeping with the vice president's position as president of the Senate). The oath is administered to the vice president first. Immediately afterwards, the [[United States Marine Band]] will perform four ''[[ruffles and flourishes]]'', followed by ''[[Hail, Columbia]].'' Unlike the presidential oath, however, the Constitution does not specify specific words that must be spoken. Several variants of the oath have been used since 1789. The current form, which is also recited by senators, representatives, and other government officers, has been in use since 1884:\n{{cquote|I do solemnly swear (or [[Affirmation in law|affirm]]) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.<ref>{{usc|5|3331}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAt noon, the new presidential and vice presidential terms begin. At about that time, the president recites the constitutionally mandated oath of office:\n{{cquote|I do solemnly swear (or [[Affirmation in law|affirm]]) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n}}\n\nAccording to [[Washington Irving]]'s biography of George Washington, after reciting the oath at his (and the nation's) first inauguration, Washington added the words \"so help me God\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2002-2009-fpc.state.gov/40871.htm |title=Presidential Inaugurations Past and Present: A Look at the History Behind the Pomp and Circumstance |publisher=2002-2009-fpc.state.gov |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> However, the only contemporaneous source that fully reproduced Washington's oath completely lacks the religious codicil.<ref>''Documentary History of the First Federal Congress'', Vol. 15, pages 404\u2013405</ref> The first newspaper report that actually described the exact words used in an oath of office, Chester Arthur's in 1881,<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1881/09/23/98566684.pdf\n|title=The New Administration: President Arthur Formally Inaugurated\n|date=September 22, 1881\n|accessdate=January 19, 2009\n|format=PDF\n|work=The New York Times\n}}</ref> repeated the \"query-response\" method where the words, \"so help me God\" were a personal prayer, not a part of the constitutional oath. The time of adoption of the current procedure, where both the chief justice and the president speak the oath, is unknown.\n\nThe oath of office was administered to Washington in 1789 by [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], Chancellor of New York State. Four years later, the oath was administered by [[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court associate justice]] [[William Cushing]]. Since the 1797 inauguration of [[John Adams]], it has become customary for the new president to be sworn into office by the Supreme Court's [[Chief Justice of the United States|chief justice]]. Others have administered the oath on occasions when a new president assumed office intra-term due to the incumbent's death or resignation.  [[William Cranch]], chief judge of the U.S. Circuit Court, administered the oath of office to [[John Tyler]] in 1841 when he succeeded to the presidency upon [[William Henry Harrison]]'s death, and to [[Millard Fillmore]] in 1850 when [[Zachary Taylor]] died. In 1923, upon being informed of [[Warren Harding]]'s death, while visiting his [[Coolidge Homestead|family home]] in [[Plymouth Notch, Vermont]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] was sworn in as president by his father, [[John Calvin Coolidge, Sr.]], a [[notary public]].<ref>Glenn D.

With the [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|2017 inauguration]] of [[Donald Trump]], the oath has been taken 75 different times by 44 people. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because the day of inauguration has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inaugural ceremonies. In addition, three have repeated the oath as a precaution against potential later constitutional challenges.<ref name=\"inaugUSCap\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/inauguration-us-capitol|title=Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol|publisher=Architect of the Capitol|access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere is no requirement that any book, or in particular a book of sacred text, be used to administer the oath, and none is mentioned in the Constitution. By convention, incoming presidents raise their right hand and place the left on a [[Bible]] or other book while taking the oath of office.

As with many inaugural customs, this one was started by George Washington in 1789. After taking his oath of office on the balcony of Federal Hall, he proceeded to the Senate chamber where he read a speech before members of Congress and other dignitaries. Every president since Washington has delivered an Inaugural address. While many of the early presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the chief justice administer the oath first, followed by the president's speech.<ref name=\"JCCOIC\"/> [[William McKinley]] requested the change in 1897, so that he could reiterate the words of the oath at the close of his first inaugural address.\n\n[[William Henry Harrison]] delivered the longest inaugural address, at 8,445 words, in 1841. John Adams' 1797 address, which totaled 2,308 words, contained the longest sentence, at 737 words.

Some of the most eloquent and powerful speeches are still quoted today. In 1865, in the waning days of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] stated, \"With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.\" In 1933, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] avowed, \"we have nothing to fear but fear itself.\" And in 1961, [[John F.

On some occasions however, either due to the preferences of the new president or to other constraining circumstances, they have been scaled back. Such was the case in 1945, because of [[Rationing in the United States|rationing]] in effect during [[World War II]]. More recently, in 1973, the celebrations marking Richard Nixon's second inauguration were altered because of the death of former president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] two days after the ceremony. All pending events were cancelled so preparations for Johnson's [[State funerals in the United States|state funeral]] could begin. Because of the construction work on the center steps of the East Front, Johnson's casket was taken up the Senate wing steps of the Capitol when taken into the rotunda to [[lie in state]].<ref name=StateFuneral/> When it was brought out, it came out through the House wing steps of the Capitol.<ref name=StateFuneral>{{cite news|last=Foley|first=Thomas|title = Thousands in Washington Brave Cold to Say Goodbye to Johnson|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date = January 25, 1973 | page = A1 }}</ref>\n\n===Congressional luncheon===\n[[File:2009 Obama inauguration luncheon.jpg|thumb|Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural luncheon]]\nSince 1953, the president and vice president have been guests of honor at a luncheon held by the leadership of the [[United States Congress]] immediately following the inaugural ceremony. The luncheon is held in [[National Statuary Hall|Statuary Hall]] and is organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, and attended by the leadership of both houses of Congress as well as guests of the president and vice president. By tradition, the outgoing president and vice president do not attend.\n\n===Inaugural parade===\n[[File:Inaugural parade 2005.jpg|thumb|The Inaugural Parade on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] passes the presidential reviewing stand in front of the [[White House]] in January 2005.]][[File:Ticket of Inauguration of Herbert Hoover March 4, 1929.jpg|thumb|right|Grandstand ticket to the Inaugural Parade for President Herbert Hoover, March 4, 1929]]\n\nFollowing the arrival of the presidential entourage to the [[White House]], it is customary for the president, vice-president, their respective families and leading members of the government and military to review an inaugural parade from an enclosed stand at the edge of the [[North Lawn (White House)|North Lawn]], a custom begun by [[James Garfield]] in 1881. The parade, which proceeds along the 1.5 miles of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the stand and the Front Lawn in view of the presidential party, features both military and civilian participants from all 50 states and the District of Columbia; this parade largely evolved from the post-inaugural procession to the White House, and occurred as far back as [[second inauguration of Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson's second inauguration]] in 1805, when workers from the [[Washington Navy Yard]], accompanied by military music, marched with the president<ref name=\"MBhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marineband.marines.mil/Portals/175/Site%20Images/Inauguration/Marine%20Band%20Inauguration%20History_2017.pdf?ver=2017-01-11-113551-543|title=Marine Band Inauguration History|publisher=Marine Band Public Affairs Office|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}</ref> on foot as he rode on horseback from the Capitol to the White House. By the time of [[William Henry Harrison]]'s inauguration in 1841, political clubs and marching societies would regularly travel to Washington for the parade. That year was also the first in which floats were part of the parade. It was at Lincoln's second inauguration, in 1865, that Native Americans and African Americans participated in the inaugural parade for the first time.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bendat |first=Jim |title=Democracy's Big Day: The Inauguration of Our President, 1789-2013 |publisher=iUniverse |year=2012 |pages=106\u2013108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bx6keVq2Fs0C&pg=PA194&lpg=PA194&dq=1885+inauguration+parade&source=bl&ots=iYV7WqNRc4&sig=mw9LW9bPvBUnTl0DN6LLWj1gLO4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdmMyZzePRAhVB0oMKHcofBdEQ6AEIUTAM#v=onepage&q=1885%20inauguration%20parade&f=false |isbn=978-1-935278-47-4}}</ref> Women were involved for the first time in 1917.<ref name=\"fromWtoT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/01/19/washington-obama-inauguration-firsts/96728070/|title=From Washington to Trump: Inauguration firsts|last=Rossman|first=Sean|date=January 20, 2017|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1829, following his first inaugural parade, [[Andrew Jackson]] held a public reception at the White House, during which 20,000 people created such a crush that Jackson had to escape through a window.

With the District of Columbia attracting thousands of attendees for inauguration, presidential medals were an inexpensive souvenir for the tourists to remember the occasion. However, the once-simple trinket turned into an official presidential election memento. In 1901, the first Inauguration Committee<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president-inauguration-2017.blogspot.com/2017/01/presidential-inaugural-committee-2017.html|title=presidential inaugural committee 2017|last=Vocal|first=Youth|access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> on Medals and Badges was established as part of the official Inauguration Committee for the re-election of President McKinley. The Committee saw official medals as a way to raise funding for the festivities. Gold medals were to be produced as gifts for the president, vice president, and committee chair; silver medals were to be created and distributed among Inauguration Committee members, and bronze medals would be for sale for public consumption. McKinley's medal was simple with his portrait on one side and writing on the other side.<ref>MacNeil, Neil. ''The President's medal, 1789\u20131977''. New York: Published in association with the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, by C. N. Potter, 1977.</ref>\n\nUnlike his predecessor, when Theodore Roosevelt took his oath of office in 1905, he found the previous presidential medal unacceptable. As an art lover and admirer of the ancient Greek high-relief coins, Roosevelt wanted more than a simple medal\u2014he wanted a work of art. To achieve this goal, the president hired [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], a famous American sculptor, to design and create his inauguration medal. Saint-Gaudens's obsession with perfection resulted in a forestalled release and the medals were distributed after the actual inauguration. Nonetheless, President Roosevelt was very pleased with the result. Saint Gardens' design, executed by [[Adolph A. Weinman]], was cast by [[Tiffany & Co.|Tiffany & Company]] and was proclaimed an artistic triumph.<ref name=\"histIM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.loriferber.com/research/inaugural-facts-statistics/history-of-the-inaugural-medal.html|title=History of the Official Inaugural Medal|last=Levine|first=H.

After the president sits for the sculptor, the resulting clay sketch is turned into a life mask and plaster model. Finishing touches are added and the epoxy cast that is created is used to produce the die cuts. The die cuts are then used to strike the president's portrait on each medal.<ref>Levine, H. Joseph. ''Collectors Guide to Presidential Medals and Memorabilia''. Danbury, Conn.: Johnson & Jensen, 1981.</ref>\n\nFrom 1929 through 1949, the official medal was struck by the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]]. This changed in 1953 when the [[Medallic Art Company]] was chosen to strike [[Walker Hancock]]'s portrait of President Eisenhower. The official medals have been struck by private mints ever since.<ref name=\"histIM\"/> [[The Smithsonian Institution]] and [[The George Washington University]] hold the two most complete collections of presidential medals in the United States.\n\n[[Gerald Ford]]'s unscheduled inauguration also had a medal<ref>https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/gerald-r-ford-presidential-inaugural-medal-87045</ref> .\n\n=={{anchor|List of inaugural ceremonies}}List of inauguration ceremonies==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.
