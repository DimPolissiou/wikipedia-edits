An ornate wooden [[Federal style]] building dating to 1821, it is one of the oldest churches in the county. It remains mostly as it was originally built save for some changes to the interior.\n\nIts 80-foot-tall (24 m) [[bell tower]] visible for some distance, is a local landmark. In 1980 the church, no longer in use, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It is currently a local and regional history museum. A recent referendum defeated a proposal by the town of [[Mamakating, New York|Mamakating]] to sell it to another congregation.\n\n==Building==\n\nThe church building is a two-story, three-by-five-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] rectangle [[siding|sided]] in white [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]]. The heavy [[timber framing]] is supported by a [[fieldstone]] [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]]. The moderately-[[roof pitch|pitched]] [[gable]]d roof is [[roof shingle|shingled]] in [[asphalt]], with a single [[chimney]] near the roofline on the east side.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />  The church is entered at the tower or south end.  Unusually, this originally brought the congregation in at the sides of the altar, which was also at this end.\n\nFrom the projecting central front bay, the multi-staged tower rises, interrupted only by the [[bracket (architecture)|bracketed]] [[cornice]] on the front roofline. It continues to a narrow [[frieze]] with cornice and modillions. All four sides have a window, a small roundel on the front and sides and a small rectangle on the rear, overlooking the roof. Above the oculus there has traditionally been a painted [[clock face]], set at 11:07.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe [[Bell tower|belfry]] above is octagonal and ornate. Tuscan columns frame panels that are alternately [[louver]]ed and plain. These support a similar frieze and cornice as the one below. The final stage uses the same treatment, with all panels louvered, and the tower's cap is an octagonal dome with [[weathervane]].<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nAll the three front bays are filled with entrances. The main entrance is a pair of doors recessed behind [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] [[architrave]]s. A fanlight surmounts the doorway, their [[muntin]]s making intersecting Gothic arches. These are echoed on the side entrances.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nBoth sides are fully [[window|fenestrated]] on both stories with 20-over-20 double-hung [[sash window]]s. The rear elevation features no decorative treatment at the roofline, and one window in each story at the sides, similar to the windows along the sides.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nA [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] separates the main door from the [[sanctuary]], while both side entrances lead directly to it. The [[altar]] is of plain wood, with some elliptical framing in the wall above paralleling a larger frame opposite that leads to the stairway to the choir loft, supported by thin octagonal columns. Simple round columns support the 10-foot\u2013deep (3 m) second-story galleries with [[balustrade]] on either side. All walls except the front have [[wainscoting]] to the sill level; the front has shelving.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nAll the woodwork inside save the altar and gallery handrails is painted white. Much of it is original. The ceilings are pressed metal.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nA set of stone steps from the front leads to a [[flagstone]] walkway that in turn descends a set of steep stone steps to Main Street. In the back is a small [[bungalow]] that once served as a [[parsonage]].<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\n==Aesthetics==\n\nThe Bloomingburg Reformed Protestant Dutch Church is similar to the style of churches that began to appear in [[New England]] after 1800, as well as some of [[Charles Bulfinch]]'s designs. It was common to copy church designs at the time, usually from other nearby examples. The [[steeple]] appears to be some similarity between the Bloomingburg church and a pattern for a rural church in [[Asher Benjamin]]'s influential 1797 ''The Country Builder's Assistant''.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nBut unlike the other designs, there is no small [[pediment]] on the front of the tower, matching the larger pediment on the front face, nor is there any sign there ever was. The three-bay front is a variant found more frequently in New York, as opposed to the five-bay facades found in New England. Also unusual is the placement of the altar at the front of the church, later changed.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Associate Reformed Church was formed in Bloomingburg in 1799. Twenty years later, in 1819, some members who wished for a pastor recognized by the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] broke away to form the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Bloomingburgh (as it was then spelled). They chose the small Gillen's Hill, which overlooked the village, and established a building committee.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nThe [[cornerstone]] was laid in 1821. Church records credit Peter Weller, an [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] of the church and George Miller, a local builder and carpenter who was not a member of the congregation, with the construction. A year later, the [[pew]]s were finished and [[subscription business model|subscribed]]. The church was dedicated in spring 1822 and opened in December.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nAt the time, the church interior was slightly different. The altar was at the entrance end, and a small semicircular window in the gable apex opened into the rear. These were changed in the middle of the century, along with the conversion of the box pews into slips, the extension of the galleries and construction of the choir loft and accompanying stairways. A new bell was installed in 1868.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nIn the late 1880s, the exterior got renovated. The roof eaves were extended and the brackets installed, per the late [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] trends of the era. A memorial [[stained glass|stained-glass]] window was installed in 1901 above the front door. Other stained-glass windows installed shortly afterwards have since been lost. New carpets and pews were installed later in that decade.<ref name=\"NRHP nom\" />\n\nTo celebrate the church's centennial, in 1922 the parsonage was built. In 1950 the roof was converted from tin to asphalt shingling, the last major change to the church's exterior. A decade later, in 1962,<ref name=\"BRF page\">{{cite web|title=The Bloomingburg Restoration Foundation, Inc.|url=http://www.mamakating.org/culture/brf/brf.htm|publisher=[[Mamakating, New York|Town of Mamakating]]|accessdate=March 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626214953/http://www.mamakating.org/culture/brf/brf.htm|archivedate=June 26, 2010}}</ref> the dwindling congregation merged with Bloomingburg's [[Methodist]] Church to form the [[Community Church movement|Community Church]] of Bloomingburg.

The foundation  declined, and later the town notified the foundation that it was planning to sell the church to a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregation from nearby [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]] for $85,000, and thus the foundation should vacate the premises. Town supervisor Bill Herrmann claimed the foundation's maintenance of the property \"has been less than acceptable\", citing numerous defects in the building such as cracks in the interior plaster, a leaning steeple and front steps in such disrepair that they are blocked off from use, requiring visitors to enter through the side. The foundation countered that it had invested $50,000 in the building during its ownership, adding carpeting and a bathroom and a new furnace. It said it would hire a lawyer to fight any [[eviction]] proceedings, and suggested the town's real goal was to sell it to the area's growing [[Hasidim|Hasidic]] community, an allegation Hermann called a sign of the foundation's desperation.<ref name=\"2017 THR sale story\">{{cite news|last=Bayne|first=Richard L.|title=Mamakating, foundation battling over church building|url=http://www.recordonline.com/news/20170725/mamakating-foundation-battling-over-church-building|newspaper=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=July 26, 2017|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNo legal action would be necessary.

It is the [[county town]] of Devon, and home to [[Devon County Council]] and the [[University of Exeter]].\n\nIn [[Roman Britain]], Exeter was established as the base of [[Legio II Augusta]] under the personal command of [[Vespasian]]. Exeter became a religious centre in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Exeter Cathedral]], founded in the mid 11th century, became [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] in the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. In the late 19th century, Exeter became an affluent centre for the [[wool trade]], although by the [[First World War]] the city was in decline. After the [[Second World War]], much of the city centre was rebuilt and is now a centre for business and tourism in Devon and Cornwall.\n\nThe administrative area of Exeter has the status of a [[non-metropolitan district]] under the administration of the County Council; a plan to grant the city [[unitary authority]] status was scrapped by the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|2010 coalition government]].\n\n==Name==\nThe modern name of Exeter is a development of the [[Old English]] ''Escanceaster'',<ref name=tcodoepn>{{cite book |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names |author=Eilert Ekwall |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |page=171 |isbn=0-19-869103-3}}</ref> from the [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] form of the river now known as the [[River Exe|Exe]] and the Old English [[suffix]] {{nowrap|[[Chester (placename element)|-''ceaster'']]}} (as in [[Dorset#Toponymy|Dorset]] and [[Gloucester#Etymology|Glowcester]]), used to mark important fortresses or fortified towns.

To distinguish the two, the Romans also referred to Exeter as {{nowrap|'''Isca Dumnoniorum'''}}, \"Watertown of the [[Dumnonii]]\", and Caerleon as Isca Augusta. A small fort was also maintained at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]]; a supply depot on the route between the two was excavated at {{nowrap|St Loyes}} on Topsham Road in 2010.\n\nThe presence of the fort built up an unplanned civilian community ({{lang|la|[[vicus]]}} or {{lang|la|[[canabae]]}}) of [[Britons (Celtic people)|natives]] and the soldiers' families, mostly to the northeast of the fort.

Many historic buildings in the heart of the city were destroyed and others, including the Cathedral, were damaged.

The defences included three flood relief channels, and were complemented by the construction of two new concrete bridges (built in 1969 and 1972) to replace the old Exe Bridge which had obstructed the flow of the river and made the flooding worse.<ref>{{cite web\n | title        = The Exeter floods of the 1960s\n | url        = http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | work        = Exeter Memories\n | date        = 28 October 2010\n | accessdate        = 15 September 2012\n | archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20121028034133/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | archive-date        = 28 October 2012\n | url-status        = live\n }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[Princesshay]] shopping centre adjoining the [[Cathedral Close, Exeter|Cathedral Close]] and the High Street was redeveloped between 2005 and 2007,<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Doors open at Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |publisher    = BBC Devon\n |date         = 20 September 2007\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217211042/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |archive-date = 17 February 2008\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | title       = Heaven for shoppers as Princesshay gets off to a flying start with huge crowds for opening day\n | url         = http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=142326&command=displayContent&sourceNode=142321&contentPK=18452155&folderPk=79876&pNodeId=142331\n | work   = [[Express & Echo]]\n | date        = 21 September 2007\n | accessdate  = 21 September 2007\n}}</ref> despite some local opposition.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = High Street revamp plans criticised\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 4 March 2003\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20030819112856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |archive-date = 19 August 2003\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref> It incorporates 123 varied residential units.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Key facts about Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |publisher    = Land Securities Group\n |work         = Princesshay.com\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014035943/http://princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |archive-date = 14 October 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nTo enable people with limited mobility to enjoy the city, Exeter Community Transport Association provides manual and powered wheelchairs and scooters (called Shopmobility) for use by anyone suffering from short or long-term mobility impairment to access to the city centre and shopping facilities, events and meetings with friends and company.<ref>{{cite web\n | title       = Shopmobility\n | url       = http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | work       = Exeter Community Transport Association\n | accessdate       = 13 July 2008\n | archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406220728/http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | archive-date       = 6 April 2012\n | url-status       = dead\n }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008 there was an [[22 May 2008 Exeter bombing|attempted terrorist attack]] on the Giraffe cafe in Princesshay, but the bomber was the only one injured.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Nail-bomber given life sentence\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 30 January 2009\n |accessdate   = 15 September 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090217020915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |archive-date = 17 February 2009\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>\n\nA \u00a330 million improvement scheme for the flood defences was approved in March 2015.

Exeter itself is relatively marginal, and since World War II its Member of Parliament has usually been drawn from the governing party, though the Exeter seat is becoming increasingly a Labour stronghold.  The Exeter MP is [[Ben Bradshaw]] and [[Simon Jupp]] represents East Devon. Exeter is part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England European constituency]], which elects 6 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s. In 2014, a majority of Exeter voters voted for Labour in the European elections, but in 2019 Labour fell to fourth - the Brexit Party won 28.1% of votes in the city and the Greens won 27.2%.\n\nExeter's [[city council]] is a [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] authority, and shares responsibility for local government with the [[Devon County Council]]. In May 2012 Labour became the majority party on the council. [[Exeter City Council]]'s bid for the city to become a [[Unitary Authority]] was initially approved by ministers in February 2010. A judicial review was called by Devon County Council and the Court held that the Minister had acted unlawfully in granting Unitary status to Exeter at the same time, however, following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|new coalition government]] announced in May 2010 that the reorganisation would be blocked.<ref name=coalition>{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Coalition: our programme for government |publisher=HM Government, United Kingdom |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=24 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612015906/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7753762/The-Queens-Speech-Bill-by-Bill.html | title= The Queen's Speech: Bill by Bill | date= 22 May 2010 | accessdate= 24 May 2010 | newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | first= Patrick | last= Hennessy | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525102927/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7753762/The-Queens-Speech-Bill-by-Bill.html | archive-date= 25 May 2010 | url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nFrom Saxon times, it was in the [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] of [[Wonford (hundred)|Wonford]].<ref name=\"genuki-devonhundreds\">{{cite web | url=http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Hundreds.html | title=The hundreds of devon | work=GENUKI | accessdate=18 June 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427064112/http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Hundreds.html | archive-date=27 April 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Exeter has had a [[Mayor of Exeter|mayor]] since at least 1207 and until 2002, the city was the oldest 'Right Worshipful' Mayoralty in England.

Councillor Granville Baldwin became the first Lord Mayor of Exeter on 1 May 2002 when [[Letters Patent]] were awarded to the city during a visit by the Queen.\nThe Lord Mayor is elected each year from amongst the 39 Exeter city [[councillor]]s and is non-political for the term of office.\n\n===Public services===\nPolicing in Exeter is provided by the [[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary]] who have their headquarters at Middlemoor in the east of the city.\n\nThe [[fire service]] is provided by the [[Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service]], which is headquartered at Clyst St. George near Exeter.

It is at this point that the Exe, having just been joined by the [[River Creedy]], opens onto a wide [[flood plain]] and estuary which results in quite common flooding. Historically this was the [[lowest bridging point]] of the River Exe which was tidal and navigable up to the city until the construction of weirs later in its history. This combined with the easily defensible higher ground of the ridge made the current location of the city a natural choice for settlement and trade. In [[George Oliver (historian)|George Oliver]]'s ''The History of the City of Exeter'', it is noted that the most likely reasons for the original settling of what would become modern Exeter was the \"fertility of the surrounding countryside\" and the area's \"beautiful and commanding elevation [and] its rapid and navigable river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=George|title=History of the City of Exeter|year=1861|page=1|isbn=0-217-79997-3}}</ref>\nIts woodland would also have been ideal for natural resources and hunting.\n\nExeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|title=Southwest EDRP Geographical Area and Physical Context|last=DEFRA|accessdate=13 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123623/http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|archive-date=13 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a [[volcanic plug]], on which the [[Rougemont Castle]] is situated.

The weir had the effect of preventing water-born trade in the City of Exeter and forced boats to load and unload at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] from where the [[Earl of Devon|Earls of Devon]] were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to and from Exeter.\n\nOriginally 3 feet deep and 16 feet wide (0.9 m by 5 m), the canal ran {{convert|2.0|mi|2|abbr=out}} from the confluence of the Matford Brook, just above Bridge Road in [[Countess Wear|Countess Weir]] to Haven Banks, close to the centre of Exeter. In order to maintain a consistent navigable water level, another weir was constructed by Trew, just below the point the canal joins the river. The canal was later extended south to Topsham Lock {{convert|3.65|mi|2|abbr=out}}, deepened and widened, and later still it was extended to Turf Lock near [[Manor_of_Powderham|Powderham]] {{convert|5.0|mi|2|abbr=out}}.

It previously operated as the sole [[sixth form]] for the entire [[maintained school]] sector in the city. However, in 2014 [[Exeter Mathematics School]] was established, a [[Free school (England)|free school]] sixth form with a specialism in Mathematics.\n\nFor about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a [[maintained school]] system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The changeover back to the more typical structure led to a citywide, [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] funded, rebuilding programme for the high schools and led to the changing of names for some schools.

London: Collins; p. 164</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned collective of Anglican churches include St David's Church, located near to St. David's Station. The church was envisaged by [[W. D. Caroe]], with the windows being manufactured by Kempe & Tower, and was later constructed between 1897 and 1900. A tower stands on the northeast side, with the overall design being described as \u201chighly picturesque by Nikolaus Pevsner.\n\nSt Edmund-on-the-Bridge was built on the Exe Bridge ca. 1230\u201340. Two arches of the bridge remain under the undercroft though the church was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1835, using the old materials.\n\nSt Martin's is in the [[Cathedral Close]]; the plan is odd, and there are numerous items of church furniture, though these are not of high aesthetic value. St Mary Arches is a Norman church with aisles. St Mary Steps was originally by the West Gate of the city; the font is Norman, and there is a remarkable early clock. St Michael, Heavitree was built in 1844\u201346 and extended later in the century. [[St Pancras Church, Exeter|St Pancras]] is of the 13th century and has a nave and chancel only; the font is Norman. The plan of [[St Petrocks Church, Exeter|St Petroc's]] church is highly unusual: a second chancel has been added facing north while the original chancel has another use and faces east. There are two aisles on the south, one of 1413 and another of the 16th century.\n\nSt Sidwell's church is by W. Burgess, 1812, in the Perpendicular style. [[St Stephens Church, Exeter|St Stephen's church]] is partly of the 13th century but most of the structure is as rebuilt in 1826.<ref>Pevsner, N. (1952) ''South Devon''.

[[England]], on the [[River Exe]] {{convert|36|mi|km}} northeast of [[Plymouth]] and {{convert|65|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bristol]]. It is the [[county town]] of Devon, and home to [[Devon County Council]] and the [[University of Exeter]].\n\nIn [[Roman Britain]], Exeter was established as the base of [[Legio II Augusta]] under the personal command of [[Vespasian]]. Exeter became a religious centre in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Exeter Cathedral]], founded in the mid 11th century, became [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] in the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. In the late 19th century, Exeter became an affluent centre for the [[wool trade]], although by the [[First World War]] the city was in decline. After the [[Second World War]], much of the city centre was rebuilt and is now a centre for business and tourism in Devon and Cornwall.\n\nThe administrative area of Exeter has the status of a [[non-metropolitan district]] under the administration of the County Council; a plan to grant the city [[unitary authority]] status was scrapped by the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|2010 coalition government]].\n\n==Name==\nThe modern name of Exeter is a development of the [[Old English]] ''Escanceaster'',<ref name=tcodoepn>{{cite book |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names |author=Eilert Ekwall |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |page=171 |isbn=0-19-869103-3}}</ref> from the [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] form of the river now known as the [[River Exe|Exe]] and the Old English [[suffix]] {{nowrap|[[Chester (placename element)|-''ceaster'']]}} (as in [[Dorset#Toponymy|Dorset]] and [[Gloucester#Etymology|Glowcester]]), used to mark important fortresses or fortified towns. (The Welsh name for the city, {{lang|cy|Caerwysg}}, similarly means \"[[caer|''caer'' or fortress]] on the Exe\".)

To distinguish the two, the Romans also referred to Exeter as {{nowrap|'''Isca Dumnoniorum'''}}, \"Watertown of the [[Dumnonii]]\", and Caerleon as Isca Augusta. A small fort was also maintained at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]]; a supply depot on the route between the two was excavated at {{nowrap|St Loyes}} on Topsham Road in 2010.\n\nThe presence of the fort built up an unplanned civilian community ({{lang|la|[[vicus]]}} or {{lang|la|[[canabae]]}}) of [[Britons (Celtic people)|natives]] and the soldiers' families, mostly to the northeast of the fort.

Many historic buildings in the heart of the city were destroyed and others, including the Cathedral, were damaged.

The defences included three flood relief channels, and were complemented by the construction of two new concrete bridges (built in 1969 and 1972) to replace the old Exe Bridge which had obstructed the flow of the river and made the flooding worse.<ref>{{cite web\n | title        = The Exeter floods of the 1960s\n | url        = http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | work        = Exeter Memories\n | date        = 28 October 2010\n | accessdate        = 15 September 2012\n | archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20121028034133/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | archive-date        = 28 October 2012\n | url-status        = live\n }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[Princesshay]] shopping centre adjoining the [[Cathedral Close, Exeter|Cathedral Close]] and the High Street was redeveloped between 2005 and 2007,<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Doors open at Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |publisher    = BBC Devon\n |date         = 20 September 2007\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217211042/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |archive-date = 17 February 2008\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | title       = Heaven for shoppers as Princesshay gets off to a flying start with huge crowds for opening day\n | url         = http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=142326&command=displayContent&sourceNode=142321&contentPK=18452155&folderPk=79876&pNodeId=142331\n | work   = [[Express & Echo]]\n | date        = 21 September 2007\n | accessdate  = 21 September 2007\n}}</ref> despite some local opposition.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = High Street revamp plans criticised\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 4 March 2003\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20030819112856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |archive-date = 19 August 2003\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref> It incorporates 123 varied residential units.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Key facts about Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |publisher    = Land Securities Group\n |work         = Princesshay.com\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014035943/http://princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |archive-date = 14 October 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nTo enable people with limited mobility to enjoy the city, Exeter Community Transport Association provides manual and powered wheelchairs and scooters (called Shopmobility) for use by anyone suffering from short or long-term mobility impairment to access to the city centre and shopping facilities, events and meetings with friends and company.<ref>{{cite web\n | title       = Shopmobility\n | url       = http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | work       = Exeter Community Transport Association\n | accessdate       = 13 July 2008\n | archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406220728/http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | archive-date       = 6 April 2012\n | url-status       = dead\n }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008 there was an [[22 May 2008 Exeter bombing|attempted terrorist attack]] on the Giraffe cafe in Princesshay, but the bomber was the only one injured.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Nail-bomber given life sentence\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 30 January 2009\n |accessdate   = 15 September 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090217020915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |archive-date = 17 February 2009\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>\n\nA \u00a330 million improvement scheme for the flood defences was approved in March 2015.

Exeter itself is relatively marginal, and since World War II its Member of Parliament has usually been drawn from the governing party, though the Exeter seat is becoming increasingly a Labour stronghold.  The Exeter MP is [[Ben Bradshaw]] and [[Simon Jupp]] represents East Devon. Exeter is part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England European constituency]], which elects 6 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s. In 2014, a majority of Exeter voters voted for Labour in the European elections, but in 2019 Labour fell to fourth - the Brexit Party won 28.1% of votes in the city and the Greens won 27.2%.\n\nExeter's [[city council]] is a [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] authority, and shares responsibility for local government with the [[Devon County Council]]. In May 2012 Labour became the majority party on the council. [[Exeter City Council]]'s bid for the city to become a [[Unitary Authority]] was initially approved by ministers in February 2010. A judicial review was called by Devon County Council and the Court held that the Minister had acted unlawfully in granting Unitary status to Exeter at the same time, however, following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|new coalition government]] announced in May 2010 that the reorganisation would be blocked.<ref name=coalition>{{cite web |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Coalition: our programme for government |publisher=HM Government, United Kingdom |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=24 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612015906/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7753762/The-Queens-Speech-Bill-by-Bill.html | title= The Queen's Speech: Bill by Bill | date= 22 May 2010 | accessdate= 24 May 2010 | newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | first= Patrick | last= Hennessy | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100525102927/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/liberaldemocrats/7753762/The-Queens-Speech-Bill-by-Bill.html | archive-date= 25 May 2010 | url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nFrom Saxon times, it was in the [[Hundred (county subdivision)|hundred]] of [[Wonford (hundred)|Wonford]].<ref name=\"genuki-devonhundreds\">{{cite web | url=http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Hundreds.html | title=The hundreds of devon | work=GENUKI | accessdate=18 June 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427064112/http://genuki.cs.ncl.ac.uk/DEV/Hundreds.html | archive-date=27 April 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref> Exeter has had a [[Mayor of Exeter|mayor]] since at least 1207 and until 2002, the city was the oldest 'Right Worshipful' Mayoralty in England.

Councillor Granville Baldwin became the first Lord Mayor of Exeter on 1 May 2002 when [[Letters Patent]] were awarded to the city during a visit by the Queen.\nThe Lord Mayor is elected each year from amongst the 39 Exeter city [[councillor]]s and is non-political for the term of office.\n\n===Public services===\nPolicing in Exeter is provided by the [[Devon and Cornwall Constabulary]] who have their headquarters at Middlemoor in the east of the city.\n\nThe [[fire service]] is provided by the [[Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service]], which is headquartered at Clyst St. George near Exeter.

It is at this point that the Exe, having just been joined by the [[River Creedy]], opens onto a wide [[flood plain]] and estuary which results in quite common flooding. Historically this was the [[lowest bridging point]] of the River Exe which was tidal and navigable up to the city until the construction of weirs later in its history. This combined with the easily defensible higher ground of the ridge made the current location of the city a natural choice for settlement and trade. In [[George Oliver (historian)|George Oliver]]'s ''The History of the City of Exeter'', it is noted that the most likely reasons for the original settling of what would become modern Exeter was the \"fertility of the surrounding countryside\" and the area's \"beautiful and commanding elevation [and] its rapid and navigable river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=George|title=History of the City of Exeter|year=1861|page=1|isbn=0-217-79997-3}}</ref>\nIts woodland would also have been ideal for natural resources and hunting.\n\nExeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|title=Southwest EDRP Geographical Area and Physical Context|last=DEFRA|accessdate=13 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123623/http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|archive-date=13 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a [[volcanic plug]], on which the [[Rougemont Castle]] is situated.

The weir had the effect of preventing water-born trade in the City of Exeter and forced boats to load and unload at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] from where the [[Earl of Devon|Earls of Devon]] were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to and from Exeter.\n\nOriginally 3 feet deep and 16 feet wide (0.9 m by 5 m), the canal ran {{convert|2.0|mi|2|abbr=out}} from the confluence of the Matford Brook, just above Bridge Road in [[Countess Wear|Countess Weir]] to Haven Banks, close to the centre of Exeter. In order to maintain a consistent navigable water level, another weir was constructed by Trew, just below the point the canal joins the river. The canal was later extended south to Topsham Lock {{convert|3.65|mi|2|abbr=out}}, deepened and widened, and later still it was extended to Turf Lock near [[Manor_of_Powderham|Powderham]] {{convert|5.0|mi|2|abbr=out}}.

It previously operated as the sole [[sixth form]] for the entire [[maintained school]] sector in the city. However, in 2014 [[Exeter Mathematics School]] was established, a [[Free school (England)|free school]] sixth form with a specialism in Mathematics.\n\nFor about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a [[maintained school]] system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The changeover back to the more typical structure led to a citywide, [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] funded, rebuilding programme for the high schools and led to the changing of names for some schools.

London: Collins; p. 164</ref>\n\nThe aforementioned collective of Anglican churches include St David's Church, located near to St. David's Station. The church was envisaged by [[W. D. Caroe]], with the windows being manufactured by Kempe & Tower, and was later constructed between 1897 and 1900. A tower stands on the northeast side, with the overall design being described as \u201chighly picturesque by Nikolaus Pevsner.\n\nSt Edmund-on-the-Bridge was built on the Exe Bridge ca. 1230\u201340. Two arches of the bridge remain under the undercroft though the church was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1835, using the old materials.\n\nSt Martin's is in the [[Cathedral Close]]; the plan is odd, and there are numerous items of church furniture, though these are not of high aesthetic value. St Mary Arches is a Norman church with aisles. St Mary Steps was originally by the West Gate of the city; the font is Norman, and there is a remarkable early clock. St Michael, Heavitree was built in 1844\u201346 and extended later in the century. [[St Pancras Church, Exeter|St Pancras]] is of the 13th century and has a nave and chancel only; the font is Norman. The plan of [[St Petrocks Church, Exeter|St Petroc's]] church is highly unusual: a second chancel has been added facing north while the original chancel has another use and faces east. There are two aisles on the south, one of 1413 and another of the 16th century.\n\nSt Sidwell's church is by W. Burgess, 1812, in the Perpendicular style.

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels.

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.\n[[File:WS1359-10-N-Downtown-HanfordCA-1877-1.png|thumb|Hanford in 1877. Resident J.T.

Hanford's namesake was [[James Madison Hanford]], an executive for the company.

The district is well known for its [[Pangkor Island]], a major attraction in Perak and the home of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] (TLDM) Lumut Naval Base and dockyard. Since the population is increasing, residential and commercial infrastructure is being developed. Dinding was once part of the British [[Straits Settlements]] colony.\n\n[[Seri Manjung]] is the district's principal urban centre while smaller towns include [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] town, [[Sitiawan]] town, [[Ayer Tawar]], [[Pantai Remis]] and [[Beruas]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Pulo Pangkor, Malaya 1874 (7886261828).jpg|thumb|right|View of Dindings taken from a hill in Pulau Pangkor, 1874.]]\n[[File:British Malaya circa 1922.PNG|thumb|Malaya in 1922 with the Straits Settlements, including Dinding, in red]]\n{{see also|Straits Settlements}}\nPrior to 1973 the district was called '''Dindings'''. It used to be part of the Straits Settlements then under the administration of Penang. Dindings district became part of the [[Pangkor]] Engagement (also commonly known as the Pangkor Treaty), signed by Britain and the British appointed Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, in January 1874. This agreement was signed to stop bloodshed resulting from two major events, the struggle for the throne between relatives of Perak royalty upon the death of Sultan Ali and Chinese clan wars between Ghee Hin and Hai San to grab tin mining areas in Late Colonial [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]].\n\nThe agreement required the [[Sultan of Perak]] to surrender Dindings to the British, to accept a British Resident, Sir JWW Birch, and the appointment of Assistant Resident in Taiping, Captain [[Tristram Speedy]]. Sultan Ismail was to step down from the throne of Perak.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, Colonial Dindings comprised three main areas: [[Sitiawan]], [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Pangkor Island]].\n\nIn 1937, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Iskandar Alang successfully appealed to the British for the return of Dindings to Perak. The Perak Government united the former colony with Bruas and coastal areas to the south, forming the Dindings district. In 1973, Dindings district was given the current name Manjung.\n\nOn 24 April 2009, Lumut was declared by the Sultan Perak as the Royal Malaysian Navy's Town \u2013 or simply called as TLDM Town or Navy Town. Manjung also was declared as \"Bandar Pelancongan Dan Maritim\" (Tourism and Maritime Town) by government of Perak.\n\nIn August 2016, Sembilan Island was separated from Manjung District and incorporated into [[Bagan Datuk District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/edisi/perak/pulau-sembilan-kini-bawah-bagan-datoh-1.549401|title=Pulau Sembilan kini bawah Bagan Datoh|first=MOHAMAD HAFIZI MOHD|last=SAID|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Map of Manjung District, Perak.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Manjung District]]\nManjung District is divided into five [[mukim]]s:<ref name=\"perak.gov.my\">{{cite web|url=http://pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my/profil-organisasi/maklumat-daerah/profil-daerah|title=Portal Rasmi Pejabat Daerah Dan Tanah - Profil Daerah|website=pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my}}</ref>\n*[[Beruas]]\n*Lekir\n*[[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]]\n*Pengkalan Baharu\n*[[Sitiawan]]\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.{{my10|2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Manjung , 2015 census\n|-\n!

It is located approximately 90&nbsp;km southwest of Ipoh. The main tourist drawer to Pangkor Island are beaches on the western coastline, such as Pantai Puteri Dewi, Pasir Bogak Beach, Teluk Belanga, Teluk Segadas, Teluk Nipah, and Teluk Cempedak.\n\nThe main island of Pangkor is populated mainly by fisherfolk who occupy the eastern coastline. The island is famous for its [[anchovies]] and squid.\n\nThere are also ruins of a 330-year-old [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fort which was one of the Dutch strongholds against pirates and local Malays. Another historical interest on Pangkor Island is the Pangkor Stone Tablet (''Batu Bersurat Pangkor'' in Malay) which is near the Dutch fort.\n\n[[Pangkor Laut Island]], a small privately owned island to the southwest of the main island, is the second largest of the nine islands that make up the Pangkor archipelago. Pangkor Laut is known for its white beaches and crystal clear waters. It has three main beaches, Emerald Bay, Coral Beach and Royal Bay.\n\n=== Marina Island ===\n\nMarina Island<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinaisland.com|title=Marina Island Pangkor - An Integrated Man-made World|website=Marina Island - Pangkor}}</ref> is one of the man-made island in Malaysia, built on the coast of Teluk Muruh, opposite [[Pangkor Island]] and Pangkor Laut Resort, in the state of [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]]. The island covers an area of 316.9 acres located 400 meters from the mainland's shoreline. Marina Island took five years of methodical planning and exhaustive feasibility studies to ensure that the making of the island would not disrupt the environment.\n\nMarina Island is also a gateway to Pangkor Island with the establishment of a domestic jetty terminal in the island. The journey to Pangkor Island takes only 10 minutes from the Marina Island Jetty.\n\n=== Beaches ===\n[[File:Teluk Senangin.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset view in Teluk Senangin]]\nAside from beaches on Pangkor Island, there are other beaches in Manjung that are popular among locals and tourists.

The district is well known for its [[Pangkor Island]], a major attraction in Perak and the home of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] (TLDM) Lumut Naval Base and dockyard. Since the population is increasing, residential and commercial infrastructure is being developed. Dinding was once part of the British [[Straits Settlements]] colony.\n\n[[Seri Manjung]] is the district's principal urban centre while smaller towns include [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] town, [[Sitiawan]] town, [[Ayer Tawar]], [[Pantai Remis]] and [[Beruas]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Pulo Pangkor, Malaya 1874 (7886261828).jpg|thumb|right|View of Dindings taken from a hill in Pulau Pangkor, 1874.]]\n[[File:British Malaya circa 1922.PNG|thumb|Malaya in 1922 with the Straits Settlements, including Dinding, in red]]\n{{see also|Straits Settlements}}\nPrior to 1973 the district was called '''Dindings'''. It used to be part of the Straits Settlements then under the administration of Penang. Dindings district became part of the [[Pangkor]] Engagement (also commonly known as the Pangkor Treaty), signed by Britain and the British appointed Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, in January 1874. This agreement was signed to stop bloodshed resulting from two major events, the struggle for the throne between relatives of Perak royalty upon the death of Sultan Ali and Chinese clan wars between Ghee Hin and Hai San to grab tin mining areas in Late Colonial [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]].\n\nThe agreement required the [[Sultan of Perak]] to surrender Dindings to the British, to accept a British Resident, Sir JWW Birch, and the appointment of Assistant Resident in Taiping, Captain [[Tristram Speedy]]. Sultan Ismail was to step down from the throne of Perak.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, Colonial Dindings comprised three main areas: [[Sitiawan]], [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Pangkor Island]].\n\nIn 1937, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Iskandar Alang successfully appealed to the British for the return of Dindings to Perak. The Perak Government united the former colony with Bruas and coastal areas to the south, forming the Dindings district. In 1973, Dindings district was given the current name Manjung.\n\nOn 24 April 2009, Lumut was declared by the Sultan Perak as the Royal Malaysian Navy's Town \u2013 or simply called as TLDM Town or Navy Town. Manjung also was declared as \"Bandar Pelancongan Dan Maritim\" (Tourism and Maritime Town) by government of Perak.\n\nIn August 2016, Sembilan Island was separated from Manjung District and incorporated into [[Bagan Datuk District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/edisi/perak/pulau-sembilan-kini-bawah-bagan-datoh-1.549401|title=Pulau Sembilan kini bawah Bagan Datoh|first=MOHAMAD HAFIZI MOHD|last=SAID|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Map of Manjung District, Perak.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Manjung District]]\nManjung District is divided into five [[mukim]]s:<ref name=\"perak.gov.my\">{{cite web|url=http://pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my/profil-organisasi/maklumat-daerah/profil-daerah|title=Portal Rasmi Pejabat Daerah Dan Tanah - Profil Daerah|website=pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my}}</ref>\n*[[Beruas]]\n*Lekir\n*[[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]]\n*Pengkalan Baharu\n*[[Sitiawan]]\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.{{my10|2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Manjung , 2015 census\n|-\n!

The game pieces can be any object, such as [[chocolate gelt]], pennies, raisins, etc.\n*To start the game, every participant puts one game piece into the center \"pot\".

Depending on which side is facing up when it stops spinning, the player whose turn it is gives or takes game pieces from the pot:\n**If {{Hebrew|\u05e0}} (''nun'') is facing up, the player does nothing.\n**If {{Hebrew|\u05d2}} (''gimel'') is facing up, the player gets everything in the pot.\n**If {{Hebrew|\u05d4}} (''hei'') is facing up, the player gets half of the pieces in the pot. If there are an odd number of pieces in the pot, the player takes half the pot rounded up to the nearest whole number.\n**If {{Hebrew|\u05e9}} (''shin'') or {{Hebrew|\u05e4}} (''pe'') is facing up, the player adds one of their game pieces to the pot (sometimes accompanied by the chant \"shin, shin, put one in\"<ref>{{cite book|last=LeBon|first=Marilee|title=The complete idiot's guide to holiday crafts|year=2001|pages=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qPlFK_yGckC&q=%22shin+put+one+in%22+dreidel&dq=%22shin+put+one+in%22+dreidel|isbn=9780028642000}}</ref>).

Similarly, the Hebrew letters on a dreidel may be taken as a mnemonic for the game rules in Yiddish. Occasionally, in the United States, the Hebrew letters on the dreidel form an English-language mnemonic about the rules: Hay or \"H\" for \"half;\" Gimel or \"G\" for \"get all;\" Nun or \"N\" for \"nothing;\" and Shin or \"S\" for \"share\".\n===Analysis===\nThomas Robinson and Sujith Vijay have shown that the expected number of spins in a game of dreidel is '''[[Big O notation|O(n<sup>2</sup>)]]''', where n is the number of game pieces each player begins with.
