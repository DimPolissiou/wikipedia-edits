His father, Heinrich Wenders, was a surgeon. The use of the Dutch name \"Wim\" is a shortened version of the baptismal name \"Wilhelm\". As a boy, he took unaccompanied trips to [[Amsterdam]] to visit the [[Rijksmuseum]]. He graduated from high school in [[Oberhausen]] in the [[Ruhr area]]. He then studied medicine (1963\u201364) and philosophy (1964\u201365) in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[University of Dusseldorf|D\u00fcsseldorf]]. However, he dropped out of university studies and moved to Paris in October 1966 to become a painter. Wenders failed his entry test at France's national film school [[IDHEC]] (now [[La F\u00e9mis]]), and instead became an engraver in the studio of [[Johnny Friedlaender|Johnny Friedlander]], in [[Montparnasse]]. During this time, Wenders became fascinated with cinema, and saw up to five movies a day at the local movie theater.\n\nSet on making his obsession also his life's work, Wenders returned to Germany in 1967 to work in the D\u00fcsseldorf office of [[United Artists]]. That fall, he entered the \"Hochschule f\u00fcr Fernsehen und Film M\u00fcnchen\" ([[University of Television and Film Munich]]). Between 1967 and 1970 while at the \"HFF\", Wenders also worked as a film critic for ''FilmKritik'', then the Munich daily newspaper ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Twen]]'' magazine, and ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.\n\nWenders completed several short films before graduating from the Hochschule with a feature-length 16mm black-and-white film, ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]'' (1970).\n\n==Career==\nWenders began his career during the [[New German Cinema]] era of the late 1960s, making his feature directorial debut with ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]'' (1970). Much of the distinctive [[cinematography]] in his movies is the result of a highly productive long-term collaboration with Dutch cinematographer [[Robby M\u00fcller]]. Some of his more successful and critically acclaimed movies\u2014''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' and ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', for example\u2014have been the result of fruitful collaborations with ''avant-garde'' authors [[Peter Handke]] and [[Sam Shepard]]. Handke's novel, ''[[The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick]]'' was adapted for Wenders' second feature film, ''[[The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty]].'' Handke co-wrote the script for ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' and ''[[Until the end of the World]]'', both featuring [[Solveig Dommartin]].\n\n[[File:Carrie Fisher and Wim Wenders.jpg|thumb|left|Wenders with [[Carrie Fisher]] in 1978]]\nWenders has directed several highly acclaimed documentaries, most notably ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), about Cuban musicians, and ''[[The Soul of a Man]]'' (2003), on American blues. He has also directed a documentary style film on the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]], known in English as ''A Trick of the Light''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0113151|A Trick of the Light}}</ref> The Skladanowsky brothers were inventing 'moving pictures' when several others like the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] and [[William Friese-Greene]] were doing the same. Alongside ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' his documentaries on [[Pina Bausch]], ''[[Pina (film)|Pina]]'', and [[Sebastiao Salgado]], ''[[The Salt of the Earth (2014 film)|The Salt of the Earth]]'' also received nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].\n\nHe has also directed many music videos for groups such as [[U2]] and [[Talking Heads]], including \"[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]\" and \"[[Sax and Violins]]\". His television commercials include a UK advertisement for [[Carling O'Keefe|Carling Premier]] Canadian beer.\n\n[[Image:Wim Wenders(cannesPhotocall)-.jpg|thumb|Wim Wenders at [[Cannes]] in 2002]]\nWenders' book, ''Emotion Pictures'', a collection of diary essays written while a film student, was adapted and broadcast as a series of plays on [[BBC Radio 3]], featuring Peter Capaldi as Wenders, with [[Gina McKee]], [[Saskia Reeves]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Harry Dean Stanton]] and [[Ricky Tomlinson]], dramatised by Neil Cargill.\n\nWenders was collaborating with artist/journalist and longtime friend [[Melinda Camber Porter]] on a documentary feature about his body of work, ''Wim Wenders \u2013 Visions on Film'', when Porter died \u2013 the film remains incomplete.<ref>http://www.wimwendersfilmfestival.com/#!a-b-o-u-t/cfp1 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222153705/http://www.wimwendersfilmfestival.com/ |date=22 December 2015 }}</ref>\n\nWenders is a member of the advisory board of [[World Cinema Foundation]].

When questioned by Amanpour, he indicated that he was born a Catholic but had converted to the Protestant faith, years ago.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Amanpour: Joseph Yun and Wim Wenders|series=Amanpour on PBS|date=23 May 2018|network=PBS|last=Amanpour|first=Christiane (host)}}</ref>\n\n==Photography==\nAlongside filmmaking, Wim Wenders works with the medium of photography and his poignant images of desolate landscapes engage themes including memory, time, loss, nostalgia and movement.<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/><ref name=\"telegraph \"/> Wenders' long-running artistic project, \"Pictures from the Surface of the Earth\", began in the early 1980s and was subsequently pursued by the artist for the next twenty years.

He is a major figure in [[New German Cinema]]. Among many honors, he has received three nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]: for ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), about Cuban music culture; ''[[Pina (film)|Pina]]'' (2011), about the contemporary dance choreographer [[Pina Bausch]]; and ''[[The Salt of the Earth (2014 film)|The Salt of the Earth]]'' (2014), about Brazilian photographer [[Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado]].\n\nOne of Wenders' earliest honors was a win for the [[BAFTA Award for Best Direction]] for his narrative drama ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984), which also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1984 Cannes Film Festival]]. Many of his subsequent films have also been recognized at Cannes, including ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' (1987), for which Wenders won the [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Director Award]] at the [[1987 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nWenders has been the president of the [[European Film Academy]] in Berlin since 1996.

His father, Heinrich Wenders, was a surgeon. The use of the Dutch name \"Wim\" is a shortened version of the baptismal name \"Wilhelm\". As a boy, he took unaccompanied trips to [[Amsterdam]] to visit the [[Rijksmuseum]]. He graduated from high school in [[Oberhausen]] in the [[Ruhr area]]. He then studied medicine (1963\u201364) and philosophy (1964\u201365) in [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] and [[University of Dusseldorf|D\u00fcsseldorf]]. However, he dropped out of university studies and moved to Paris in October 1966 to become a painter. Wenders failed his entry test at France's national film school [[IDHEC]] (now [[La F\u00e9mis]]), and instead became an engraver in the studio of [[Johnny Friedlaender|Johnny Friedlander]], in [[Montparnasse]]. During this time, Wenders became fascinated with cinema, and saw up to five movies a day at the local movie theater.\n\nSet on making his obsession also his life's work, Wenders returned to Germany in 1967 to work in the D\u00fcsseldorf office of [[United Artists]]. That fall, he entered the \"Hochschule f\u00fcr Fernsehen und Film M\u00fcnchen\" ([[University of Television and Film Munich]]). Between 1967 and 1970 while at the \"HFF\", Wenders also worked as a film critic for ''FilmKritik'', then the Munich daily newspaper ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Twen]]'' magazine, and ''[[Der Spiegel]]''.\n\nWenders completed several short films before graduating from the Hochschule with a feature-length 16mm black-and-white film, ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]'' (1970).\n\n==Career==\nWenders began his career during the [[New German Cinema]] era of the late 1960s, making his feature directorial debut with ''[[Summer in the City (film)|Summer in the City]]'' (1970). Much of the distinctive [[cinematography]] in his movies is the result of a highly productive long-term collaboration with Dutch cinematographer [[Robby M\u00fcller]]. Some of his more successful and critically acclaimed movies\u2014''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' and ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', for example\u2014have been the result of fruitful collaborations with ''avant-garde'' authors [[Peter Handke]] and [[Sam Shepard]]. Handke's novel, ''[[The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick]]'' was adapted for Wenders' second feature film, ''[[The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty]].'' Handke co-wrote the script for ''[[Wings of Desire]]'' and ''[[Until the end of the World]]'', both featuring [[Solveig Dommartin]].\n\n[[File:Carrie Fisher and Wim Wenders.jpg|thumb|left|Wenders with [[Carrie Fisher]] in 1978]]\nWenders has directed several highly acclaimed documentaries, most notably ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), about Cuban musicians, and ''[[The Soul of a Man]]'' (2003), on American blues. He has also directed a documentary style film on the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]], known in English as ''A Trick of the Light''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0113151|A Trick of the Light}}</ref> The Skladanowsky brothers were inventing 'moving pictures' when several others like the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] and [[William Friese-Greene]] were doing the same. Alongside ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' his documentaries on [[Pina Bausch]], ''[[Pina (film)|Pina]]'', and [[Sebastiao Salgado]], ''[[The Salt of the Earth (2014 film)|The Salt of the Earth]]'' also received nominations for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]].\n\nHe has also directed many music videos for groups such as [[U2]] and [[Talking Heads]], including \"[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]\" and \"[[Sax and Violins]]\".

His arrival at [[Louisiana]] and later [[Austin, Texas]] coincided with the advance of the [[Sexual Revolution]] throughout the [[Western world]]. It was there that he met fellow students who self-labeled themselves as gay and came across the first wave of gay liberation writings. After graduation, Xiaomingxiong briefly returned to Hong Kong but went to rural [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1976 to pursue graduate study in [[geology]]. His attention was, however, quickly diverted to the vibrant post-[[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] [[New York City]]. In the year that followed, he explored  first hand various aspects of the new urban gay lifestyle, interviewing first generations of gay bookshop owners, gay parents, homosexuals from different races, etc. In June 1979, Xiaomingxiong travelled to the [[White House]] as part of a delegate for gay rights, representing Asian Americans. There, he met with a secretary of [[Jimmy Carter]] and raised concerns regarding the United States immigration procedures.\n\nAt the end of 1979, Xiaomingxiong returned to [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s - 1930s)|British colonial Hong Kong]], where homosexual acts were still illegal and punishable by life imprisonment. He was quick to discover the one and only local underground gay bar at the time, the Dateline, through the then editor of the City Magazine. There, he met a wealthy Chinese merchant, who agreed to finance Xiaomingxiong for his first gay liberation Chinese publication, \"A Chinese Gay's Manifesto\" (1980). This was followed by the underground newsletter \"Pink Triangle\" (1981) and the book \"Twenty-five Questions about Homosexuality\" (1981). The public's reactions also earned Xiaomingxiong a column space in the City Magazine, allowing him to openly disseminate information and advice on homosexuality.

He is the current manager of [[Defensa y Justicia]].\n\nA prolific [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]], Crespo has scored over 300 goals in a career spanning 19 years. At international level, he scored 35 goals and is [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|Argentina's fourth highest goalscorer]] behind only [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]], [[Gabriel Batistuta]] and [[Lionel Messi]].

Crespo was left without the attacking support he had enjoyed in 2001, but still scored a respectable haul of goals.

In the Roman period, it had become a cosmopolitan center of the eastern Mediterranean whilst, according to the Christian tradition, it was also the place of [[Saint Andrew]]'s [[martyr]]dom.\n\nDubbed as Greece's ''Gate to the  West'', Patras is a commercial hub, while its busy port is a nodal point for trade and communication with Italy and the rest of [[Western Europe]]. The city has two public universities and one [[TEI of Patras|technological institute]], hosting a large student population and rendering Patras an important scientific centre {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} with a field of excellence in technological education. The [[Rio-Antirio Bridge]] connects Patras' easternmost suburb of Rio to the town of Antirrio, connecting the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula with mainland Greece.\n\nEvery year, in February, the city hosts one of Europe's largest carnivals. Notable features of the [[Patras Carnival]] include its mammoth satirical floats and balls and parades, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors in a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Patras is also famous for supporting an indigenous cultural scene active mainly in the performing arts and modern urban literature.

This is the result of an interplay between natural geography and human settlement patterns; the lower section of the city (Kato Poli), which includes the 19th-century urban core and the port, is adjacent to the sea and stretches between the estuaries of the rivers of Glafkos and Haradros. It is built on what was originally a bed of river soils and dried-up swamps.

Patras flourished for the first time in the Post-Helladic or [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean period]] (1580&ndash;11). Ancient Patras was formed by the unification of three [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] villages in modern Aroe; namely Antheia (from mythological [[Antheia]]) and [[Messatida|Mesatis]]. Mythology has it that after the [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, a group of [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] from [[Laconia]] led by the [[Wiktionary:eponymous|eponymous]] [[Patreus]] established a colony. In antiquity Patras remained a farming city. It was in Roman times that it became an important port.\n\nAfter 280 BC and prior to the Roman occupation of Greece, Patras played a significant role in the foundation of the second \"[[Achaean League]]\" (Achaiki Sympoliteia), along with the cities of [[Dyme]], [[Tritaea (Achaea)|Tritaea]] and [[Pheraea|Pharai]]. Later on, and following the Roman occupation of Greece in 146 BC, Patras played a key role, and [[Augustus]] refounded the city as a Roman colony in the area. In addition, Patras has been a Christian centre since the early days of Christianity, and it is the city where [[Saint Andrew]] was crucified.\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern===\n{{See also|Byzantine Greece|Frankokratia|Principality of Achaea|Ottoman Greece|Kingdom of the Morea}}\n[[File:Greece in 1278.svg|thumb|The Principality of Achaea in southern Greece, 1278]]\n[[File:\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03be\u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 1821.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The declaration of the revolutionaries of Patras (1821), engraved on a stele, Saint George Square]]\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era Patras continued to be an important port as well as an industrial centre. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} One of the most scholarly philosophers and theologians of the time, [[Arethas of Caesarea]] was born at Patrae, at around 860. By the 9th century, there are strong signs the city was prosperous: the widow [[Danielis]] from Patras had accumulated immense wealth in land ownership, {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} the carpet and textile industry, and offered critical support in the ascent of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] to the Byzantine throne.\n\nIn 1205 the city was captured by [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin|Villehardouin]], and became a part of the [[principality of Achaea]]. It became the seat of the [[Barony of Patras]], and its [[Latin Archbishop of Patras|Latin archbishop]] primate of the principality. In 1408, Patras became [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], until it was recaptured in 1430 by the [[Despotate of Morea]] and its despot [[Constantine XI|Constantine Palaiologos]], who thus succeeded in recovering for the [[Byzantine Empire]] the whole of the [[Morea]], apart from Venetian possessions. The administration of Patras was given to [[George Sphrantzes]], while Constantine was immediately contested by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later, in 1449, became emperor of the Byzantine empire.<ref>Patra. From antiquity until today, Kotinos A.E. Editions, Athens 2005</ref>\n\nPatras remained a part of the [[Despotate of Morea]] until 1458, when it was conquered by the Sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mehmet II]]. Under the Ottomans, it was known as \"Baliabadra\", from the Greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03ac \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 (\"Old Patras\"), as opposed to \u039d\u03ad\u03b1 \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1, the town of [[Ypati]] in [[Central Greece]]. Though Mehmet granted the city special privileges and tax reductions, it never became a major centre of commerce. [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] attacked and captured it several times in the 15th and 16th centuries, but never re-established their rule effectively, except for a period of [[Kingdom of the Morea|Venetian rule]] in 1687\u20131715 after the [[Morean War]].<ref>''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' ''s.v.''

The concept of the event revolved around the main theme of \"Bridges\" and \"Dialogues\", drawing benefit from the city's rich history and its position as a \"Gate to the West\", to underline the essence of the productive interaction of culture and civilisations in Europe. The EU Commission found Patras' plans very ambitious and also commented that a successful hosting of the title by a medium-sized city would make it possible to redefine the meaning of the term Cultural Capital.\n\nThe Selection Panel for 2006 noted in its final report:\n\n{{quote|The current cultural activity of the city includes the Patras International Festival (various artistic activities, mainly in the field of music), the Patras Carnival and the Poetry Symposium (organised each year for the 25 years by an ad hoc committee at the University of Patras).<ref name=\"Poetry Symposium\"/> The Patras 2006 proposal focuses on two central ideas: \"bridges\" and \"dialogues\". Cultural managers from Patras and the general public will be involved in developing these ideas. Further, four poles/programmes of cultural attraction will be developed. The first, \"A city for Europe\", will relate to the architectural heritage, the industrial revolution and similar subjects. \"The counterpart cities\" programme will be developed in the fields of human and social sciences and in diverse artistic fields. \"The three sea battles\" will present a cultural programme focusing on peace and understanding. The last theme, \"The many homelands\", is directly linked to the etymology of the name of the city. This programme will among other things concentrate on art workshops, the transfer of know-how, way of life and entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/pdf_word/patras_final_report.pdf|title=Patras Final Report|publisher=Europa.eu.int|accessdate=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325110128/http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/pdf_word/patras_final_report.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_futur_en.html|title=Patras Future Report|publisher=Europa.eu.int|accessdate=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504210548/http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_futur_en.html|archivedate=2006-05-04}}</ref> }}\n\nIn 2006 various cultural events were held in the context of the European Capital of Culture.

There is also a sizeable living community of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].\n[[File:Old Saint Andrew church, Patra 9281555.jpg|thumb|220px|The old Orthodox church of Saint Andrew, next to the Cathedral]]\nThe most significant church in the city is the [[Cathedral of Saint Andrew, Patras|Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew]], in the south west of the city center.The construction of the church began in 1908 under the supervision of the architect [[Anastasios Metaxas]], followed by Georgios Nomikos. It was inaugurated in 1974. It is the largest church in Greece and the third-largest Byzantine-style church in the [[Balkans]], after the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]] in Belgrade and [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia]]. It holds relics of [[Andrew the Apostle]], which were returned to the city of Patras from [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome in September, 1964, on the orders of [[Pope Paul VI]].\nOther historical churches of the city are: \n*The church of ''Pantokrator'' (1832), the old cathedral, in the upper town district\n*The ''Metropolitan Church of Patras'' (1846) dedicated to [[Panayia]] Evangelistria, on Maisonos Street\n*The church of ''Ayios Nikolaos'' (1885), next to the steps of Ayiou Nikolaou street \n*The church of ''Pantanassa'' (1859), Ipsilanti street\n*The church of ''Ayios Dimitrios'', in the upper town district \n*The Catholic Church of ''Saint Andrew'' (1937), on Maisonos Street\n*The [[Anglican]] church of ''Saint Andrew'' (1878), on Karolou Street \n*The old church of ''Ayios Andreas'' (1836\u20131843), next to the new temple. Situated in the site of [[Andrew the Apostle]]'s martyrdom, it was built in [[basilica]] style by the architect [[Lysandros Kaftanzoglou]].\n\n*''Girokomiou Monastery (Holy Monastery of Panagia Girokomitissa)'': This historic monastery was founded in the 10th century AD in the eastern part of Patras. It was built on the ruins of an ancient temple of the goddess Artemis and for this reason the monastery's cathedral is dedicated to Saint Artemi\u03bfs. It is obvious that the monastery maintained a nursing home during the Byzantine period.\n*''Monastery of Agios Nikolaos Bala (Paleomonastiro):'' \u0399t is built at the foot of Panachaikos, at an altitude of 500 meters, near the village of Bala, 8 km northeast of Patras. This historic and picturesque monastery was founded at the end of the 17th century. A marble slab on the north outer side of the Cathedral tells of the restoration of the monastery in 1693. The monastery has aldo recently been renovated, numbering nineteen nuns and celebrating December 6th and May 10th.\n\n====Jewish community====\nThe first Jewish presence in the city was dated back to the [[Hellenistic era]] (see [[Romaniotes]]).

In the Roman period, it had become a cosmopolitan center of the eastern Mediterranean whilst, according to the Christian tradition, it was also the place of [[Saint Andrew]]'s [[martyr]]dom.\n\nDubbed as Greece's ''Gate to the  West'', Patras is a commercial hub, while its busy port is a nodal point for trade and communication with Italy and the rest of [[Western Europe]]. The city has two public universities and one [[TEI of Patras|technological institute]], hosting a large student population and rendering Patras an important scientific centre {{citation needed|date=September 2017}} with a field of excellence in technological education. The [[Rio-Antirio Bridge]] connects Patras' easternmost suburb of Rio to the town of Antirrio, connecting the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula with mainland Greece.\n\nEvery year, in February, the city hosts one of Europe's largest carnivals. Notable features of the [[Patras Carnival]] include its mammoth satirical floats and balls and parades, enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of visitors in a [[Mediterranean climate]]. Patras is also famous for supporting an indigenous cultural scene active mainly in the performing arts and modern urban literature.

Patras flourished for the first time in the Post-Helladic or [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean period]] (1580&ndash;11). Ancient Patras was formed by the unification of three [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] villages in modern Aroe; namely Antheia (from mythological [[Antheia]]) and [[Messatida|Mesatis]]. Mythology has it that after the [[Dorians|Dorian]] invasion, a group of [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaeans]] from [[Laconia]] led by the [[Wiktionary:eponymous|eponymous]] [[Patreus]] established a colony. In antiquity Patras remained a farming city. It was in Roman times that it became an important port.\n\nAfter 280 BC and prior to the Roman occupation of Greece, Patras played a significant role in the foundation of the second \"[[Achaean League]]\" (Achaiki Sympoliteia), along with the cities of [[Dyme]], [[Tritaea (Achaea)|Tritaea]] and [[Pheraea|Pharai]]. Later on, and following the Roman occupation of Greece in 146 BC, Patras played a key role, and [[Augustus]] refounded the city as a Roman colony in the area. In addition, Patras has been a Christian centre since the early days of Christianity, and it is the city where [[Saint Andrew]] was crucified.\n\n=== Middle Ages and early modern===\n{{See also|Byzantine Greece|Frankokratia|Principality of Achaea|Ottoman Greece|Kingdom of the Morea}}\n[[File:Greece in 1278.svg|thumb|The Principality of Achaea in southern Greece, 1278]]\n[[File:\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c1\u03c5\u03be\u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u03a0\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2 1821.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The declaration of the revolutionaries of Patras (1821), engraved on a stele, Saint George Square]]\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] era Patras continued to be an important port as well as an industrial centre. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} One of the most scholarly philosophers and theologians of the time, [[Arethas of Caesarea]] was born at Patrae, at around 860. By the 9th century, there are strong signs the city was prosperous: the widow [[Danielis]] from Patras had accumulated immense wealth in land ownership, {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} the carpet and textile industry, and offered critical support in the ascent of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] to the Byzantine throne.\n\nIn 1205 the city was captured by [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I of Villehardouin|Villehardouin]], and became a part of the [[principality of Achaea]]. It became the seat of the [[Barony of Patras]], and its [[Latin Archbishop of Patras|Latin archbishop]] primate of the principality. In 1408, Patras became [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], until it was recaptured in 1430 by the [[Despotate of Morea]] and its despot [[Constantine XI|Constantine Palaiologos]], who thus succeeded in recovering for the [[Byzantine Empire]] the whole of the [[Morea]], apart from Venetian possessions. The administration of Patras was given to [[George Sphrantzes]], while Constantine was immediately contested by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later, in 1449, became emperor of the Byzantine empire.<ref>Patra.

The architectural heritage of the city is dominated by neo-classicism, but also includes structures from other periods. Patras is also a pilot city of the [[Council of Europe]] and EU  [[Intercultural cities]]  programme.\n\n===Theatrical tradition and music===\n\nThe [[Patras Municipal and Regional Theatre]] was founded in June 1988, having as its main stage the city's landmark, the [[Apollon Theatre (Patras)|Apollon Theatre]]. Throughout its existence it has mounted critically acclaimed performances ranging from ancient [[dramaturgy]] and modern Greek, to international repertoire. The theatre cooperates with other theatrical groups, such as the ''Viomichaniki'' (Industrial) group and the ''Michani Technis'' (Art Machine).\n\nThe Roman [[Odeon (building)|Odeon]] hosts ancient dramas in the summer, while the Pantheon theater, the Art Factory, the Lithographeion and the Agora theatres provide additional venues.

The concept of the event revolved around the main theme of \"Bridges\" and \"Dialogues\", drawing benefit from the city's rich history and its position as a \"Gate to the West\", to underline the essence of the productive interaction of culture and civilisations in Europe. The EU Commission found Patras' plans very ambitious and also commented that a successful hosting of the title by a medium-sized city would make it possible to redefine the meaning of the term Cultural Capital.\n\nThe Selection Panel for 2006 noted in its final report:\n\n{{quote|The current cultural activity of the city includes the Patras International Festival (various artistic activities, mainly in the field of music), the Patras Carnival and the Poetry Symposium (organised each year for the 25 years by an ad hoc committee at the University of Patras).<ref name=\"Poetry Symposium\"/> The Patras 2006 proposal focuses on two central ideas: \"bridges\" and \"dialogues\". Cultural managers from Patras and the general public will be involved in developing these ideas. Further, four poles/programmes of cultural attraction will be developed. The first, \"A city for Europe\", will relate to the architectural heritage, the industrial revolution and similar subjects. \"The counterpart cities\" programme will be developed in the fields of human and social sciences and in diverse artistic fields. \"The three sea battles\" will present a cultural programme focusing on peace and understanding. The last theme, \"The many homelands\", is directly linked to the etymology of the name of the city. This programme will among other things concentrate on art workshops, the transfer of know-how, way of life and entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/pdf_word/patras_final_report.pdf|title=Patras Final Report|publisher=Europa.eu.int|accessdate=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325110128/http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/pdf_word/patras_final_report.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_futur_en.html|title=Patras Future Report|publisher=Europa.eu.int|accessdate=2012-10-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504210548/http://europa.eu.int/comm/culture/eac/other_actions/cap_europ/cap_futur_en.html|archivedate=2006-05-04}}</ref> }}\n\nIn 2006 various cultural events were held in the context of the European Capital of Culture.

There is also a sizeable living community of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].\n[[File:Old Saint Andrew church, Patra 9281555.jpg|thumb|220px|The old Orthodox church of Saint Andrew, next to the Cathedral]]\nThe most significant church in the city is the [[Cathedral of Saint Andrew, Patras|Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew]], in the south west of the city center.The construction of the church began in 1908 under the supervision of the architect [[Anastasios Metaxas]], followed by Georgios Nomikos. It was inaugurated in 1974. It is the largest church in Greece and the third-largest Byzantine-style church in the [[Balkans]], after the [[Cathedral of Saint Sava]] in Belgrade and [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral in Sofia]]. It holds relics of [[Andrew the Apostle]], which were returned to the city of Patras from [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Rome in September, 1964, on the orders of [[Pope Paul VI]].\nOther historical churches of the city are: \n*The church of ''Pantokrator'' (1832), the old cathedral, in the upper town district\n*The ''Metropolitan Church of Patras'' (1846) dedicated to [[Panayia]] Evangelistria, on Maisonos Street\n*The church of ''Ayios Nikolaos'' (1885), next to the steps of Ayiou Nikolaou street \n*The church of ''Pantanassa'' (1859), Ipsilanti street\n*The church of ''Ayios Dimitrios'', in the upper town district \n*The Catholic Church of ''Saint Andrew'' (1937), on Maisonos Street\n*The [[Anglican]] church of ''Saint Andrew'' (1878), on Karolou Street \n*The old church of ''Ayios Andreas'' (1836\u20131843), next to the new temple.

It was built on the ruins of an ancient temple of the goddess Artemis and for this reason the monastery's cathedral is dedicated to Saint Artemi\u03bfs. It is obvious that the monastery maintained a nursing home during the Byzantine period.\n*''Monastery of Agios Nikolaos Bala (Paleomonastiro):'' \u0399t is built at the foot of Panachaikos, at an altitude of 500 meters, near the village of Bala, 8 km northeast of Patras.
