Her first on-screen appearance was in the episode \"[[Four Months Later...]]\", though the character was featured earlier in the [[List of Heroes graphic novels|graphic novel]] \"Maya y Alejandro\".\n\n==Character overview==\n\n===Generations===\n\nMaya and her twin brother [[Alejandro Herrera (Heroes)|Alejandro]] are fugitives wanted for murder. In \"[[Four Months Ago...]]\", it is revealed she killed all of the people who attended her brother's wedding, except Alejandro, with her power. This happened when Maya discovered the bride was having an affair with a former lover, and the man threatened her, causing enough stress to activate her powers in her native [[Dominican Republic]]. She then became a nun and went to a convent in [[Venezuela]] to pray for God to help her. However, her brother found her and brought the police. Again stressed at the possibility of imprisonment, her power activated, but Alejandro, using his own power, stopped the damage and fled with her.\n\nAfter discovering [[Chandra Suresh]]'s book, they decided to go to [[New York City]] to find him, not knowing of his death. When Alejandro was kicked out of one transport they found, it results in the death of the occupants.\n\nIn \"[[Lizards (Heroes)|Lizards]]\", Maya and Alejandro make it to the Guatemala-Mexico border where they meet with Nidia, a woman who they knew in their childhood and who arranged for them to sneak across the border. While resting at Nidia's, an unnamed [[curandera]] tells Maya that she is cursed with a horrible, incurable darkness, which she says could even kill the [[Devil]]; the healer then runs away in fear. While crossing the border, Alejandro gets separated from Nidia and Maya, who both make it across. Maya accidentally uses her power on Nidia, but Alejandro comes back in time to halt the effect allowing Nidia to recover. Nidia then runs away, saying that the twins are cursed, leaving the pair alone in Mexico.\n\nIn \"[[Kindred (Heroes)|Kindred]]\", the twins are still on the run. Alejandro is arrested during an attempted car theft and imprisoned. Maya comes to his rescue by initiating her power and poisoning everyone in the building. Once freed Alejandro stops the effect and an American prisoner named Derek offers them a ride in exchange for helping him escape.\n\nIn \"[[The Kindness of Strangers (Heroes)|The Kindness of Strangers]]\", Maya and Alejandro continue to travel with Derek to the United States. While traveling along a barren road they meet up with Sylar, who has collapsed from exhaustion. Sylar tells them his real name, Gabriel, and offers to help them find Chandra Suresh. After reaching a town Derek discovers Maya and Alejandro are wanted criminals and tells it to Sylar. Sylar kills him and drives off with Maya and Alejandro in the car, telling them that Derek is calling the police.\n\nIn \"[[The Line (Heroes)|The Line]]\", Sylar tries to convince Maya that her power is a gift. They discover an apparently unguarded crossing on the border and drive through. However, they are immediately surrounded by armed men demanding they exit the vehicle. Against Alejandro's protests, Sylar convinces Maya to use her ability to kill the men and escape. Maya is later excoriated by Alejandro, who says Sylar can't be trusted and that because of what she did back at the border, she really is a murderer now.\n\nIn \"[[Truth and Consequences]]\", Sylar provokes Maya into using her power in order to learn to control it.  For the first time, Maya is able to control her ability and prevent Sylar from dying.  Alejandro again warns Maya, showing her an article off the internet that says Sylar killed his mother. When confronted, Sylar confesses to killing his mother, saying it was an accident. In saying so Maya feels they have an even greater understanding. Sylar succeeds in driving a wedge between the siblings, as Maya identifies with Sylar as a fellow accidental killer. When Alejandro privately confronts Sylar in his hotel room over Sylar's intention to take Maya, Sylar kills him. When Maya knocks on the door, Sylar pretends to have gotten out of the shower and answers the door, blocking Maya's view of the room. As they talk, the two draw closer, and slowly kiss. While Maya is distracted, Sylar closes the door behind him.\n\nIn \"[[Powerless (Heroes)|Powerless]]\", Maya and Sylar successfully reach [[Mohinder Suresh]] in New York.  Sylar shoots Maya after she finds out the truth about him and that he killed Alejandro. She is brought back to life by Mohinder by one of the two blood samples meant for [[Niki Sanders]]. The other vial is then taken by Sylar, who uses it to regain his own powers and cure the virus.\n\n===Villains===\n\nIn \"[[The Second Coming (Heroes)|The Second Coming]]\", Mohinder discovers the source of the powers due to the way Maya's power works.  By taking a sample of fluid from her adrenal glands, he is able to inject himself and gain a power of his own.  This power is different from Maya's because it is influenced by blood chemistry.  In \"[[The Butterfly Effect (Heroes)|The Butterfly Effect]]\" she begins to have a sexual relationship with Mohinder.\n\nSoon after, however, she discovers the people that Mohinder has kidnapped, and, upon being discovered, is wrapped in a cocoon and stuck to the wall herself. In the episode \"[[Dying of the Light (Heroes)|Dying of the Light]]\", Mohinder confesses to Tracy (whom he kidnaps along with Nathan) that Maya was right, that he is a monster. In \"[[Eris Quod Sum]]\", Maya is taken to [[Pinehearst Industries]] by Mohinder. There, she has her ability absorbed by [[Arthur Petrelli]]. Upon learning this, she is relieved to be free of her power, which she considered a curse. When she is released, she is still wary of Mohinder, who has admitted to having genuine feelings for her. She tells him that he had no right to conduct his experiments and crimes in her name and that she no longer trusts him. She adds that she needs to make amends for her sins and hopes he will get well. She is then seen with her belongings\u2014an American passport, credit card, and money\u2014leaving Pinehearst.\n\nIn \"[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse]]\", the temporarily depowered Mohinder escapes from Pinehearst and goes to visit her, but he immediately leaves just as she opens the door when his powers (and mutation) return.\n\n===Fugitives===\n\nIn \"[[List of Heroes graphic novels#Season 3: Fugitives|Libertad]]\", she is sent by \"[[Micah Sanders|Rebel]]\" to \"Angry Skunk\", a bar that also helps fugitive posthumans, to obtain a new ID and resources to escape [[United States Department of Homeland Security|DHS]]'s agents. [[List of characters in Heroes#Misha|Misha]] and his associate are reluctant at first, especially when they notice Maya has no power. They finally agree to meet Maya at the bar at 11:00 pm to give her a new ID. Later that night, Misha is caught by the agents and ends up revealing the meeting point. \"Rebel\" manages to warn [[List of characters in Heroes#Angie|Angie]], [[List of characters in Heroes#Harmon|Harmon]] and Maya. After considering themselves doomed, the trio decides to escape in different ways. Although the negative current situation, \"Rebel\" makes her believe in hope, as he ensures his help to Maya while hidden in the dark avoiding the oncoming agents.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n\n[[Image:Maya's black tears.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Maya's black tears.]]\nMaya's ability creates a fast-acting and potentially fatal poison in any human being nearby. The ability is triggered when she is stressed, but she can willingly activate her power if she wishes. Impediments such as walls or sealed vehicles don't affect the range or speed of infection.\n\nWhen Maya's ability activates, her eyes turn completely black and \"black [[tears]]\" are emitted from her eyes. Anyone within a certain distance of her (the range varies considerably, from an entire street full of people to the area of a small building) quickly exhibits similar symptoms and loses consciousness almost immediately, followed shortly by death.\n\nInitially, Maya needs the help of her brother Alejandro to deactivate her power. His power also acts as a cure to the poison she creates, as well as making him immune to its effects. With Sylar's help, Maya eventually learns to deactivate her own power, eliminating the need for Alejandro's intervention to control it.\n\nIn \"[[Eris Quod Sum]]\", her power is removed completely by [[Arthur Petrelli]].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Heroes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Herrera, Maya}}\n[[Category:Heroes (American TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Fictional Christian nuns]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Fictional Dominican Republic people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{long plot|date=March 2009}}\n{{original research|date=September 2008}}\n{{in-universe|date=March 2009}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name = Maya Herrera\n| series = [[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]\n| image = Maya Herrera.jpg\n| image_size = 200px\n| caption = [[Dania Ramirez]] as Maya Herrera \n| portrayer = [[Dania Ramirez]]\n| first = \"[[Four Months Later...]]\"\n| last = \"[[The Eclipse (Heroes)|The Eclipse, Part 2]]\"\n| lbl21 = Ability\n|data21 = Poison emission<ref>http://www.primatechpaper.com/AT_2.0/at_map_file.php#{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><br>''(removed by Arthur Petrelli in Volume Three)''\n}}\n\n'''Maya Herrera''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[NBC]] [[drama]] ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', portrayed by [[Dania Ramirez]].

In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000 CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|the first Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio, and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|the second Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with [[Entercom]]. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada\u2013United States border|border areas]] over-the-air.

The fledgling network soon needed additional investors, and the Columbia Phonograph Company, manufacturers of [[Columbia Records]], rescued it in April 1927. Now the \"Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System\", the network went to air under its new name on September 18, 1927, with a presentation by the Howard L.

None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>\n\n====Turnaround: Paley's first year====\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H. Grebe]]'s [[Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) for a small Brooklyn station, [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (no relation to the current [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56. The station changed frequencies again, to 880 kHz, in the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)'s 1941 reassignment of stations ([[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]]); in 1946, WABC was renamed [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].</ref> The physical plant was relocated also&nbsp;\u2013 to [[Steinway Hall]] on West 57th Street in [[Manhattan]], where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates.<ref name=berg/>\n\nPaley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5&nbsp;million, provided CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who \"had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years.... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born.\"<ref name=berg61/> The near-bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932.<ref name=bartow251>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 261</ref> In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4&nbsp;million to $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=halfirst>[[David Halberstam|Halberstam, David]] (1979).

There were two types of program at the time: ''sponsored'' and ''sustaining'', i.e., unsponsored. Rival [[NBC]] paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran.<ref name=bargoldfirst>{{cite book |title=The Golden Web: A History of Broadcasting in the United States, 1933\u20131953|url=https://archive.org/details/goldenwebhistory00barn|url-access=registration|author=[[Erik Barnouw]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|year=1968|page=[https://archive.org/details/goldenwebhistory00barn/page/57 57] |isbn= 978-0-19-500475-5}}</ref> It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:<ref name=halfirst/> he would ''give'' the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.<ref name=bargoldfirst/> CBS soon had more affiliates than either [[NBC Red Network|NBC Red]] or [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]].<ref>In 1943, the FCC would force NBC to sell off its Blue network, which thereupon became ABC. Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 190</ref>\n\nPaley was a man who valued style and taste,<ref name=hal26>Halberstam, pp. 26\u201327</ref> and in 1929, once he had his affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated his concern to sleek, new 485 [[Madison Avenue]], the \"heart of the advertising community, right where Paley wanted his company to be\"<ref name=berg60>Bergreen, p. 60</ref> and where it would stay until its move to its own [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed headquarters, the CBS Building, in 1965. When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg60/>\n\n====CBS takes on the Red and the Blue (1930s)====\n[[File:Kate Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wholesome [[Kate Smith]], Paley's choice for ''La Palina Hour'', was unthreatening to home and hearth]]\nSince NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief [[David Sarnoff]] approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on \"[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]\" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his&nbsp;\u2013 and his affiliates'&nbsp;\u2013 success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.<ref name=halfirst/>\n\nPaley had an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, \"a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure\",<ref name=hal26a>Halberstam, p. 26</ref> wrote [[David Halberstam]]. \"[He] knew what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another.\"<ref name=hal24>Halberstam, p. 24</ref> As the 1930s loomed, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them [[Jack Benny]], (\"Your [[Canada Dry]] Humorist\"), [[Al Jolson]], [[George Burns]] & [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Kate Smith]], whom Paley personally selected for his family's ''[[La Palina]] Hour'' because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.<ref name=berg69>Bergreen, p. 69</ref> When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and \"cabled\" New York to sign [[Bing Crosby]] immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.<ref>Halberstam, p. 26, and Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 273</ref>\n\nWhile the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes&nbsp;\u2013 and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products.<ref name=berg63>Bergreen, p. 63</ref> Starting in 1930, astrologer [[Evangeline Adams]] would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems&nbsp;\u2013 and a box-top from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste.<ref name=bartow240>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 240</ref> The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, \"made him a soul mate to millions of women\"<ref name=bartow2401>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 240\u2013241</ref> on behalf of the [[R.

Although the form, usually in quarter-hour episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had the same basic premise: that characters \"fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble. The helping-hand figures were usually older.\"<ref name=bargol96>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 96</ref> At CBS, ''[[Just Plain Bill]]'' brought human insight and [[Anacin]] pain reliever into households; ''[[Your Family and Mine]]'' came courtesy of [[Sealtest Dairy]] products; ''[[Bachelor's Children]]'' first hawked Old Dutch Cleanser, then [[Wonder Bread]]; ''[[Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories]]'' was sponsored by [[Spry Vegetable Shortening]]. ''[[Our Gal Sunday]]'' (Anacin again), ''[[The Romance of Helen Trent]]'' (Ang\u00e9lus cosmetics), ''[[Big Sister (radio)|Big Sister]]'' ([[Rinso]] laundry soap) and many others filled the daytime ether.<ref>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 94n9</ref>\n\n[[File:CBS radio hollywood.JPG|thumb|CBS west coast headquarters reflected its industry stature while hosting its top Hollywood talent.]]\nThanks to its daytime and primetime schedules, CBS prospered in the 1930s.

Murrow]] in 1935; his first corporate title was Director of Talks. He was mentored in microphone technique by [[Robert Trout]], the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss White.<ref name=berg107>Bergreen, p. 107</ref> Murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind\"<ref name=berg109>Bergreen, p. 109</ref> when he was dispatched to [[London]] as CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\".<ref name=hal38>Halberstam, p. 38</ref> Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists&nbsp;\u2013 including [[William L. Shirer]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Bill Downs]], and [[Eric Sevareid]]&nbsp;\u2013 who would become known as the \"[[Murrow Boys]]\". They were \"in [Murrow's] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all\".<ref name=berg110>Bergreen, p. 110</ref> They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves: on March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly [[Anschluss|annexed nearby Austria]] and Murrow and Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] in Paris, [[Pierre Huss]] in [[Berlin]], [[Frank Gervasi]] in [[Rome]] and Trout in New York.<ref name=bargol78>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 78</ref> This bore the ''[[CBS World News Roundup|News Round-Up]]'' format, which is still ubiquitous today in broadcast news.\n\nMurrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] galvanized American listeners: even before [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], the conflict became \"the story of the survival of Western civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories. He was indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples.\"<ref name=hal39>Halberstam, p. 39</ref> With his \"manly, tormented voice\",<ref name=berg112>Bergreen, p. 112</ref> Murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience.<ref name=berg112/> Using his trademark self-reference \"This reporter\",<ref name=bargol140>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 140</ref> he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance.<ref name=berg112/> Murrow himself said he tried \"to describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor\".<ref name=berg112/> When he returned home for a visit late in 1941, Paley threw an \"extraordinarily elaborate reception\"<ref name=berg114>Bergreen, p. 114</ref> for Murrow at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. Of course, its goal was more than just honoring CBS's latest \"star\"&nbsp;\u2013 it was an announcement to the world that Mr. Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other people's programming: it had now become a cultural force in its own right.<ref name=berg1145>Bergreen, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nOnce the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as \"a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company\".<ref name=hal40>Halberstam, p. 40</ref> He possessed enormous capital within that company, and as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it freely, first in radio news, then in television, taking on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] first, then eventually William S. Paley himself,<ref name=bargol276>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 276</ref> and with a foe that formidable, even the vast Murrow account would soon run dry.\n\n====Panic: ''The War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast====\n[[File:Orson Welles 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Enfant terrible]]'' Orson Welles's \"Hallowe'en joke\" frightened the country and snared a sponsor.]]\nOn October 30, 1938, CBS gained a taste of infamy when ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' broadcast a [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation]] of [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', performed by [[Orson Welles]]. Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of ''faux'' news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from [[Mars]] were actually invading and devastating [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]], despite ''three'' disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on ''faux'' news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air''&nbsp;\u2013 the former sustaining program became ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' to sell soup.<ref name=bargol88>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 88</ref> Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"<ref name=berg96>Bergreen, p. 96</ref>\n\n====CBS recruits Edmund A.

In this capacity, Chester coordinated the development of the Network of the Americas (La Cadena de las Americas) with the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs|Office for Inter-American Affairs]] (as chaired by [[Nelson Rockefeller]]) and [[Voice of America]] as part of President Roosevelt's support for [[Pan-Americanism]] during World War II.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&pg=PA166&dq=Eva+Garza&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Edmund%20Chester&f=false ''Dissonant Divas In Chicana Music: The Limits of La Onda''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200109230902/https://books.google.com/books?id=Qx00pQIkclMC&pg=PA166&dq=Eva+Garza&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXg_qkiPnZAhVFPN8KHbynAMAQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=Edmund%20Chester&f=false |date=January 9, 2020 }} Deborah R.

Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines.<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers&nbsp;\u2013 and effectively advertisements&nbsp;\u2013 and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit<ref name=bargol165/> and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;\u2013 scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped&nbsp;\u2013 two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946\u20131971.]]\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;\u2013 made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's ''chain broadcasting investigation''&nbsp;\u2013 the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called.<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168\u2013169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;\u2013 the ''network option''&nbsp;\u2013 came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]] and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, [[game show]]s and amateur hours to wither for the duration.<ref name=bargol156/>\n\nSurprising was \"the granite permanence\" of the shows at the top of the ratings.<ref name=bargol284>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 284</ref> The vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s: Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Edgar Bergen]] all had been on the radio almost as long as there had ''been'' network radio.<ref name=bargol285>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 285</ref> A notable exception to this was relative newcomer [[Arthur Godfrey]] who, as late as 1942, was still doing a local morning show in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=berg179>Bergreen, p. 179</ref> Godfrey, who had been a cemetery-lot salesman and a cab driver, pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an ''individual'', with a singular \"you\" rather than phrases like \"Now, folks...\" or \"Yes, friends...\".<ref name=berg180>Bergreen, p. 180</ref> His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of ''all'' CBS revenues; by 1948, he was pulling down $500,000 a year.<ref name=berg179/>\n\nIn 1947, Paley, still the undisputed \"head talent scout\" of CBS,<ref name=berg169/> led a much-publicized \"talent raid\" on NBC. One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\"<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]] and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;\u2013 television.\n\n====Prime time radio gives way to television (1950s)====\n\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Shortly after ruling in favor of NBC, FCC chairman Charles Denny resigned from the FCC to become vice president and general counsel of NBC: Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 243</ref> In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number had increased to 3&nbsp;million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg1589>Bergreen, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> 64 American cities had television stations, though most of them only had one.<ref name=bargol295>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 295</ref>\n\nRadio continued to be the backbone of the company, at least in the ''early'' 1950s, but it was \"a strange, twilight period\" where some cities had often multiple television stations which siphoned the audience from radio, while other cities (such as Denver and Portland, Oregon) had no television stations at all.  In those areas, as well as rural areas and some entire states, network radio remained the sole, nationally broadcast service.<ref name=bargol285/> NBC's venerable [[Fred Allen]] saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's game show ''Stop The Music!''; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor [[Ford Motor Company]] and was shortly gone from the scene.<ref name=bargol2878>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 287\u2013288</ref> Radio powerhouse [[Bob Hope]]'s ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953.<ref name=bargol288>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 288</ref> By 1952, \"death seemed imminent for network radio\" in its familiar form;<ref name=bargol290>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 290</ref> most telling of all, the big sponsors were eager for the switch.\n\nGradually, as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. The radio soap opera ''[[Guiding Light|The Guiding Light]]'' moved to television in 1952 and would run for another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back \"home\" from NBC, made the move in 1950; [[Lucille Ball]] a year later; ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' in 1952 (though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated ''[[The Jack Benny Program|Jack Benny Program]]'' ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday night show went off the air in 1957. When CBS announced in 1956 that its radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made money,<ref name=berg230>Bergreen, p. 230</ref> it was clear where the future lay. When the soap opera ''[[Ma Perkins]]'' went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight, relatively minor series remained. Prime time radio ended on September 30, 1962, when ''[[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]]'' and ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' aired for the final time.<ref name=dun742>{{cite book|title=On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio|author=[[John Dunning (radio historian)|John Dunning]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|year=1998|page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/742 742]|isbn=0-19-507678-8|url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/742}}</ref>\n\n====CBS's radio programming after 1972====\nThe retirement of Arthur Godfrey in April 1972 marked the end of long-form programming on CBS radio; programming thereafter consisted of hourly news summaries and news features, known in the 1970s as ''Dimension'', and commentaries, including the ''Spectrum'' series that evolved into the \"Point/Counterpoint\" feature on the television network's ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and ''First Line Report'', a news and analysis feature delivered by CBS correspondents. The network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming, from 1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the ''[[General Mills Radio Adventure Theater]]'' and the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'' in the 1970s; otherwise, most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations.<ref name=dun143>Dunning, p. 143</ref> The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly newscasts, including its centerpiece ''CBS World News Roundup'' in the morning and evening, weekend sister program ''[[CBS News Weekend Roundup]]'', the news-related feature segment ''[[Charles Osgood|The Osgood File]]'', ''What's In the News'', a one-minute summary of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle radio personality [[Dave Ross]], tip segments from various other sources, and technology coverage from [[CBS Interactive]] property [[CNET]].\n\n{{anchor|Big Four}}\nOn November 17, 2017 CBS Radio was sold to Entercom becoming the last of the original Big Four radio network to be owned by its founding company.<ref name=\"entercom-8k-20171116\">{{cite web | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | title = Form 8-K | author = Entercom Communications Corp. | publisher = Securities and Exchange Commission | date = 2017-11-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072029/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | archive-date = January 22, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> Although the CBS parent itself ceased to exist when it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995, CBS Radio continued to be run by CBS until its sale to Entercom.

Its initial broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018041706/http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish [[Television network|networks]] and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#\"Freeze\" of 1948|\"freeze\"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which CBS&nbsp;\u2013 as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;\u2013 quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the ''Post'' in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in [[Milwaukee]] (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947.  In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier.  In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.  The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to [[WISN-TV]] on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation, and the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup.  CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in  December 1994 to join Fox]]; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (25 years, as of the end of 2019).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in [[Pittsburgh]] after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby [[Steubenville, Ohio]] and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] (a co-founder of NBC with RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled [[KDKA-TV]] with CBS instead of NBC (like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA radio]]) due to NBC [[Extortion|extorting]] and [[coercion|coercing]] Westinghouse to trade [[KYW (AM)|KYW radio]] and WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) for [[Cleveland]] stations [[WTAM]], WTAM-FM (now [[WMJI]]), and WNBK (now [[WKYC]]); the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice]] after an eight-year investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Circle is Complete/Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1964/1964-08-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |date=August 3, 1964|pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\nHad CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now [[WPXI]]) once it signed on in 1957 instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Ch. 11 Grantee to be CBS-TV Primary Outlet|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-06-20-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=June 20, 1955|pages=89\u201390}}</ref> This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS decades later.\n\n====Programming (1945\u20131970)====\nThe \"talent raid\" on NBC of the mid-1940s had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well.

Aubrey]] (1958\u20131965), CBS was able to balance prestigious television projects (befitting the ''Tiffany Network'' image), with more [[low culture]], broad appeal programs. So the network had challenging fare like ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Defenders (1961 TV series)|The Defenders]]'', and ''[[East Side/West Side]]'', as well as ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', and ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.classictvhistory.com/EpisodeGuides/east_side_west_side.html|title=East Side/West Side|work=classictvhistory.com|last=Bowie|first=Stephen|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015806/http://www.classictvhistory.com/EpisodeGuides/east_side_west_side.html|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThis success would continue for many years, with CBS being bumped from first place only due to the rise of ABC in the mid-1970s. Perhaps because of its status as the top-rated network, during the late 1960s and early 1970s CBS felt freer to gamble with controversial properties like the ''[[Smothers Brothers|Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]'' (and its many spinoffs) during this period.\n\n====Programming: \"Rural purge\" and success in the 1970s and early-mid 1980s (1971\u20131986)====\n{{Main|Rural purge}}\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was very successful in [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]], but many of its shows (including ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[Green Acres]]'') were appealing more to older and more rural audiences and less to the young, urban and more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target. [[Fred Silverman]] (who would later head [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and then later [[NBC]]) made the decision to cancel most of those otherwise hit shows by mid-1971 in what became colloquially referred to as the \"[[Rural Purge]]\", with ''Green Acres'' cast member [[Pat Buttram]] remarking that the network cancelled \"anything with a tree in it\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ken Berry interview|url=http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|work=KenBerry.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20000903070554/http://www.kenberry.com/ken_berry_interview.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2000|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hillbilly: A Cultural History of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtehLu1cissC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203|author=Anthony Harkins|page=203|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2005|accessdate=March 23, 2009|isbn=0-19-518950-7}}</ref>\n\nWhile the \"rural\" shows got the axe, new hits, like ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'', <!--''[[The Waltons]]'', - - - this is not a rural show? -->''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]'' took their place on the network's schedule and kept CBS at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s.

The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' spun from ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the [[1976\u201377 United States network television schedule|1976\u201377 season]], but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-[[series finale]] single U.S. television episode&nbsp;\u2013 the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent \"[[Who Shot J.R.?]]\" [[cliffhanger]].\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the [[College Basketball on CBS|broadcast rights]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982 (taking over for [[College Basketball on NBC|NBC]]), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a  new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years&nbsp;\u2013 namely ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''&nbsp;\u2013 however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as [[chief operating officer]], and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Law]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''). ABC had in turn also rebounded with hits such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Growing Pains]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Roseanne]]''.\n\nSome of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits ''Simon & Simon'', ''Falcon Crest'', ''Murder, She Wrote'', ''Kate & Allie'', and ''Newhart'' still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and future{{needs update|date=April 2020}} hits ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', and the newsmagazine ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', all having debuted during the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'' and ''Knots Landing''; however, the ratings for ''Dallas'' were a far cry{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} from what they were in the early 1980s.

One of the shows that was affected was the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''; as a result, NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which the ''Late Show'' often dominated over during the first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman in London, Seeking Boost at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822063316/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|archive-date=August 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, such as ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' (which moved to the network from NBC), ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', ''[[Cybill (TV series)|Cybill]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.\n\nCBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block, the \"[[CBS Block Party]]\", in the [[1997\u201398 United States network television schedule|1997\u201398 season]] (consisting of ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'', and ''[[The Gregory Hines Show]]'', all but the latter coming from [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], which had maintained a relationship with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete against ABC's \"[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]\" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): ''Meego'' and ''Hines'' were cancelled by November, while ''Family Matters'' and ''Step by Step'' were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Games]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]]; NBC, which had already held the rights to the Summer Olympics since [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], took over coverage of the Winter Olympics beginning with the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Games]].\n\nThe building blocks for the network's return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the [[American Football Conference]] (stripping that package from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] after 32 years), effective with the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|last=Kent|first=Milton|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502212451/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|archive-date=May 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the [[New England Patriots]] in the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the [[1998\u20131999 United States network television schedule|1998\u20131999 season]]; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''.\n\n====Programming: Return to first place and rivalry with Fox (2002\u2013present)====\nAnother turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (US)|Big Brother]]'', which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) including ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the [[2002\u201303 United States network television schedule|2002\u201303 season]]. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u201306 season]], an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]]). This lasted until the [[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308 season]], when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008\u201309 United States network television schedule|2008\u201309 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18\u201334, 18\u201349 and 25\u201354 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010\u201311 United States network television schedule|2010\u201311 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, ''Two and a Half Men'', saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18\u201349, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 fall season]], the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, the [[NCIS (TV series)|tenth season of ''NCIS'']] took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after ''American Idol'' ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' taking over the top spot from ''Idol'' the year before and from ''NCIS'' the year after), for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season (when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314]] slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's [[2014\u201315 United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. Also, midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' reboot and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with [[NFL Network]] to carry ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite

Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives|access-date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906063204/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|archive-date=September 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule&nbsp;\u2013 first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\n====Color technology (1953\u20131967)====\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;\u2013 then-parent company of NBC&nbsp;\u2013 made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first telecast ever of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)'s 1939 film classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''; [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]''; and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', featuring choreography by [[George Balanchine]]. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to [[PBS]]).\n\nBeginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'', now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of ''Ford Star Jubilee''), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]], the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis#White House restoration|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964\u201365 United States network television schedule|1964\u201365 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965\u201366 United States network television schedule|1965\u201366]] season and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966\u201367 United States network television schedule|1966\u201367 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from [[Philips]] which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|title=Norelco Cameras \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002233035/http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before [[Thanksgiving]]. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\n==Conglomerate==\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] Inc. from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club), book and magazine publishers ([[Fawcett Publications]] including ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]), map-makers and toy manufacturers ([[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), [[X-Acto]] knives,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first=Colin |last=Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327203550/http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Laboratories|CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.\n\n===Columbia Records===\n{{main|Columbia Records}}\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of [[North America]], where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122152333/http://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|archive-date=November 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]]) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from [[EMI]] its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]], co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.\n\n===Publishing===\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190901192756/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-date = September 1, 2019| url-status = live}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985.

([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965\u20131980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966\u20131983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972\u20131985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\n===Film production===\n{{Main|CBS Films}}\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of [[Cinema Center Films]]. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]] called [[TriStar Pictures]]. Despite releasing such box office successes as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165839/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|archive-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\n===Home video===\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\n===Gabriel Toys===\nCBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the [[Atari 2600]], and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first [[karaoke]] recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].\n\n===New owners===\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States ([[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\n[[File:Ed sullivan theater.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|CBS's [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in Manhattan, former home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Now houses ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.]]\n\n====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994]]. The New World deal resulted in CBS affiliating with UHF stations in [[Detroit]] and [[Cleveland]]&nbsp;\u2013 former Fox affiliate [[WOIO]] and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now [[WWJ-TV]]), the latter of which was purchased by the network&nbsp;\u2013 after a failed attempt to woo the respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets, [[WXYZ-TV]] and [[WEWS-TV]] (the latter of which had previously been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955) to respectively replace departing affiliates [[WJBK]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]], a situation that the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] actually used as leverage to sign a group-wide affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.<ref>{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; TV Stations Shift to ABC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=October 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111215200/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|archive-date=November 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC pre-empts CBS in Cleveland, Detroit|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-06-20.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=June 20, 1994|page=7}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the Scripps deal was [[Baltimore]] NBC affiliate [[WMAR-TV]] (which had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981), displacing longtime ABC affiliate [[WJZ-TV]], despite the fact that Westinghouse-owned WJZ-TV had long been the Baltimore market's dominant station while WMAR-TV had long been in a distant third and even nearly lost its [[broadcast license|license]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|title=Smith family seeks to take Channel 2; WBFF owners' move could shift WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=September 13, 1991|accessdate=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213185614/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> This did not sit well with Westinghouse, who even before the New World deal was already seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but accelerated the process after the Scripps-ABC agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business; Group W's Negotiations|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=8|date=July 11, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations with CBS.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS to Add Three Affiliates in Deal With Westinghouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1994|accessdate=July 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023121452/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|archive-date=October 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, Group W Form Historic Alliance|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-07-18.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=July 18, 1994|page=14}}</ref> Of the other four stations, two of the stations ([[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco]] and [[KDKA-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]) were already longtime affiliates of the network, while two others ([[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WBZ-TV]] in [[Boston]]) were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, [[WCAU (TV)|WCAU]], which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia \u2013 Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423000255/http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|archive-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995.

CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in [[Miami]], with NBC-owned [[WTVJ]] moving to channel 6 and CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as [[WFOR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, NBC changing channels.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|author=Tom Jicha|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=November 22, 1994|accessdate=March 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703093638/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|archive-date=July 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 1, 1995, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] acquired CBS outright for $5.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Westinghouse-CBS\">{{cite news|title=CBS Agrees to Buyout Bid by Westinghouse : Entertainment: $5.4-billion merger would create biggest TV, radio empire.

Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007, and is now owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]] and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]] ([[The Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]]) and starting a new one ([[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for [[brand licensing]] purposes) were gone.\n\n====Viacom====\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]&nbsp;\u2013 a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\n====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815051557/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|archive-date=August 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned the [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"[[Star Trek]]\" and \"[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]\" franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165956/https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}\n{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00\u201311:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific (7:00\u201310:00&nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) and Sunday from 7:00\u201311:00&nbsp;p.m. (6:00\u201310:00&nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain).\n\nDaytime programming is also provided between 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays (including a half-hour break for local news) featuring the game shows ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', [[soap opera]]s ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', and talk show ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]''.\n\n[[CBS News]] programming includes ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. weekdays and Saturdays; nightly editions of ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', the [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday political talk show]] ''[[Face the Nation]]'', early morning news program ''[[CBS Morning News]]''. and the newsmagazines ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'', and ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]''. Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.\n\n[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] season. In addition to rights to sports events from the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to&nbsp;\u2013 or in some cases, in lieu of&nbsp;\u2013 a major sporting event.\n\n===Daytime===\n{{main|CBS Daytime}}\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''The Price Is Right'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer/comedian [[Wayne Brady]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include ''Match Game'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10/25,000 Pyramid]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'', ''Family Feud'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and ''Password''. Two long-running prime time-only games were the panel shows ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nThe network is also home to ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'', a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's ''[[The View (American TV series)|The View]]'', which debuted in October 2010 ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}, the program is hosted by moderator [[Julie Chen]], series creator/executive producer [[Sara Gilbert]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Sheryl Underwood]]).\n\n{{As of|2019|09}}, CBS Daytime airs two daytime [[soap operas]] each weekday: the hour-long series ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (debuted in 1973) and half-hour series ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (debuted in 1987). CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying 3{{frac|1|2}} hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than ''Guiding Light'', notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' and ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]''.\n\n===Children's programming===\n{{Main|Children's programming on CBS}}\nCBS broadcast the live-action series ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays through 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']]. In 1997, CBS premiered ''[[Wheel 2000]]'' (a children's version of the syndicated game show ''Wheel of Fortune''), which aired simultaneously on the [[Game Show Network]].\n\nIn September 1998, CBS began contracting the time period out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule.

Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials are now held by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|title=Boomerang &#124; Full Episodes of Your Family's Favorite Cartoons|website=Boomerang|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608084708/https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''Hawaii Five-O'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner\u2014 Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Classical music specials====\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'' conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ''The Nutcracker''&nbsp;\u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;\u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by legendary pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n====''Cinderella''====\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] and a book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}.

The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;\u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;\u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\n====Other notable specials====\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special.

Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\n\n==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==\n\n===Logos===\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\n[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]\n[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface.]]\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126183721/http://pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|archive-date=November 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] as well as a [[Shakers|Shaker]] drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018003809/http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the ''Eyemark'', which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom, [[Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru, [[Fuji Television]] in Japan, [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil, and [[Saeta TV Channel 10]] in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703103325/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|archive-date=July 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is ''[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]'', a close relative to ''[[Bodoni]]''.  Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include ''Avant Garde'', ''Lubalin Graph'', and ''Serif Gothic''.\n\n===Image campaigns===\n\n====1980s====\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the [[1981\u201382 United States network television schedule|1981\u201382 season]] feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985\u201386).\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 United States network television schedule|1986\u201387 season]] ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[Digital video effect|DVE]] effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the [[1988\u201389 United States network television schedule|1988\u201389 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the [[1989\u201390 United States network television schedule|1989\u201390 season]]. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\n====1990s====\nFor the [[1990\u201391 United States network television schedule|1990\u201391 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[The Temptations]], which offered an altered version of their hit \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997\u20131999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\n====2000s====\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010\u20132011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018081239/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Promos===\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules.

Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]]s, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.\n\n===Bermuda===\nIn Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]-based [[ZBM-TV]], locally owned by [[Bermuda Broadcasting|Bermuda Broadcasting Company]].\n\n===Mexico===\nCBS programming is available in [[Mexico]] through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] (such as [[KYMA-DT]]/[[Yuma, Arizona]];

To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.\n|-\n| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970\u20131975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to Vice President, Programs&nbsp;\u2013 heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book|title=My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163\u2013173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the \"[[rural purge]]\" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.\n|-\n| [[Arthur R.

In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000 CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|the first Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio, and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|the second Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with [[Entercom]]. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada\u2013United States border|border areas]] over-the-air.

With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>\n\n====Turnaround: Paley's first year====\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H.

WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56.

In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5&nbsp;million, provided CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling.

When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg60/>\n\n====CBS takes on the Red and the Blue (1930s)====\n[[File:Kate Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wholesome [[Kate Smith]], Paley's choice for ''La Palina Hour'', was unthreatening to home and hearth]]\nSince NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief [[David Sarnoff]] approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on \"[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]\" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his&nbsp;\u2013 and his affiliates'&nbsp;\u2013 success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.<ref name=halfirst/>\n\nPaley had an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, \"a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure\",<ref name=hal26a>Halberstam, p. 26</ref> wrote [[David Halberstam]]. \"[He] knew what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another.\"<ref name=hal24>Halberstam, p. 24</ref> As the 1930s loomed, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them [[Jack Benny]], (\"Your [[Canada Dry]] Humorist\"), [[Al Jolson]], [[George Burns]] & [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Kate Smith]], whom Paley personally selected for his family's ''[[La Palina]] Hour'' because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.<ref name=berg69>Bergreen, p. 69</ref> When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and \"cabled\" New York to sign [[Bing Crosby]] immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.<ref>Halberstam, p. 26, and Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 273</ref>\n\nWhile the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes&nbsp;\u2013 and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products.<ref name=berg63>Bergreen, p. 63</ref> Starting in 1930, astrologer [[Evangeline Adams]] would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems&nbsp;\u2013 and a box-top from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste.<ref name=bartow240>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 240</ref> The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, \"made him a soul mate to millions of women\"<ref name=bartow2401>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 240\u2013241</ref> on behalf of the [[R.

Although the form, usually in quarter-hour episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had the same basic premise: that characters \"fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble.

By 1933 they fought back, many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers' convenience, or allowing \"their\" news to be read on the air for radio's profit.<ref name=bargol18>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 18</ref> Radio, in turn, pushed back when urban department stores, newspapers' largest advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations, threatened to withhold their ads from print.<ref name=bargol22>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 22</ref> A short-lived attempted truce in 1933 even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news before 9:30&nbsp;a.m., and then only after 9:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 and that no news story could air until it was 12 hours old.<ref name=bargol21>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:CBSNewsRemote1937.jpg|thumb|left|[[CBS News]] engineers prepare a remote: Justice [[Hugo Black]]'s 1937 denial of [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] ties.]]\nIt was in this climate that Paley set out to \"enhance the prestige of CBS, to make it seem in the public mind the more advanced, dignified and socially aware network\".<ref name=berg90>Bergreen, p. 90</ref> He did it through sustaining programming like the [[New York Philharmonic]], the thoughtful drama of [[Norman Corwin]]&nbsp;\u2013 and an in-house news division to gather and present news, free of fickle suppliers like newspapers and [[wire service]]s.<ref name=berg90/> In the fall of 1934, CBS launched an independent news division, shaped in its first years by Paley's vice-president, former ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist Ed Klauber, and [[news director]] [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]]. Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years<ref name=bartow2456>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 245\u2013246</ref> to bring live feeds of [[Europe]]an events to its American air.\n\nA key early hire was [[Edward R. Murrow]] in 1935; his first corporate title was Director of Talks. He was mentored in microphone technique by [[Robert Trout]], the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss White.<ref name=berg107>Bergreen, p. 107</ref> Murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind\"<ref name=berg109>Bergreen, p. 109</ref> when he was dispatched to [[London]] as CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\".<ref name=hal38>Halberstam, p. 38</ref> Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists&nbsp;\u2013 including [[William L. Shirer]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Bill Downs]], and [[Eric Sevareid]]&nbsp;\u2013 who would become known as the \"[[Murrow Boys]]\". They were \"in [Murrow's] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all\".<ref name=berg110>Bergreen, p. 110</ref> They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves: on March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly [[Anschluss|annexed nearby Austria]] and Murrow and Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] in Paris, [[Pierre Huss]] in [[Berlin]], [[Frank Gervasi]] in [[Rome]] and Trout in New York.<ref name=bargol78>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 78</ref> This bore the ''[[CBS World News Roundup|News Round-Up]]'' format, which is still ubiquitous today in broadcast news.\n\nMurrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] galvanized American listeners: even before [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], the conflict became \"the story of the survival of Western civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories. He was indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples.\"<ref name=hal39>Halberstam, p. 39</ref> With his \"manly, tormented voice\",<ref name=berg112>Bergreen, p. 112</ref> Murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience.<ref name=berg112/> Using his trademark self-reference \"This reporter\",<ref name=bargol140>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 140</ref> he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance.<ref name=berg112/> Murrow himself said he tried \"to describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor\".<ref name=berg112/> When he returned home for a visit late in 1941, Paley threw an \"extraordinarily elaborate reception\"<ref name=berg114>Bergreen, p. 114</ref> for Murrow at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. Of course, its goal was more than just honoring CBS's latest \"star\"&nbsp;\u2013 it was an announcement to the world that Mr. Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other people's programming: it had now become a cultural force in its own right.<ref name=berg1145>Bergreen, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nOnce the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as \"a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company\".<ref name=hal40>Halberstam, p. 40</ref> He possessed enormous capital within that company, and as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it freely, first in radio news, then in television, taking on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] first, then eventually William S. Paley himself,<ref name=bargol276>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 276</ref> and with a foe that formidable, even the vast Murrow account would soon run dry.\n\n====Panic: ''The War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast====\n[[File:Orson Welles 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Enfant terrible]]'' Orson Welles's \"Hallowe'en joke\" frightened the country and snared a sponsor.]]\nOn October 30, 1938, CBS gained a taste of infamy when ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' broadcast a [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation]] of [[H.

Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of ''faux'' news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from [[Mars]] were actually invading and devastating [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]], despite ''three'' disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on ''faux'' news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air''&nbsp;\u2013 the former sustaining program became ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' to sell soup.<ref name=bargol88>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 88</ref> Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"<ref name=berg96>Bergreen, p. 96</ref>\n\n====CBS recruits Edmund A.

Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines.<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers&nbsp;\u2013 and effectively advertisements&nbsp;\u2013 and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit<ref name=bargol165/> and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;\u2013 scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped&nbsp;\u2013 two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946\u20131971.]]\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;\u2013 made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's ''chain broadcasting investigation''&nbsp;\u2013 the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called.<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168\u2013169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;\u2013 the ''network option''&nbsp;\u2013 came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]] and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews.

One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\"<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]] and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;\u2013 television.\n\n====Prime time radio gives way to television (1950s)====\n\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Its initial broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018041706/http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish [[Television network|networks]] and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#\"Freeze\" of 1948|\"freeze\"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which CBS&nbsp;\u2013 as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;\u2013 quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the ''Post'' in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in [[Milwaukee]] (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947.  In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier.  In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.  The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to [[WISN-TV]] on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation, and the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup.  CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in  December 1994 to join Fox]]; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (25 years, as of the end of 2019).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in [[Pittsburgh]] after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby [[Steubenville, Ohio]] and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] (a co-founder of NBC with RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled [[KDKA-TV]] with CBS instead of NBC (like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA radio]]) due to NBC [[Extortion|extorting]] and [[coercion|coercing]] Westinghouse to trade [[KYW (AM)|KYW radio]] and WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) for [[Cleveland]] stations [[WTAM]], WTAM-FM (now [[WMJI]]), and WNBK (now [[WKYC]]); the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice]] after an eight-year investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Circle is Complete/Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1964/1964-08-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |date=August 3, 1964|pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\nHad CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now [[WPXI]]) once it signed on in 1957 instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Ch. 11 Grantee to be CBS-TV Primary Outlet|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-06-20-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=June 20, 1955|pages=89\u201390}}</ref> This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS decades later.\n\n====Programming (1945\u20131970)====\nThe \"talent raid\" on NBC of the mid-1940s had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well.

The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' spun from ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the [[1976\u201377 United States network television schedule|1976\u201377 season]], but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-[[series finale]] single U.S. television episode&nbsp;\u2013 the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent \"[[Who Shot J.R.?]]\" [[cliffhanger]].\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the [[College Basketball on CBS|broadcast rights]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982 (taking over for [[College Basketball on NBC|NBC]]), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a  new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years&nbsp;\u2013 namely ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''&nbsp;\u2013 however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as [[chief operating officer]], and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Law]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''). ABC had in turn also rebounded with hits such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Growing Pains]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Roseanne]]''.\n\nSome of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits ''Simon & Simon'', ''Falcon Crest'', ''Murder, She Wrote'', ''Kate & Allie'', and ''Newhart'' still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and future{{needs update|date=April 2020}} hits ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', and the newsmagazine ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', all having debuted during the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'' and ''Knots Landing''; however, the ratings for ''Dallas'' were a far cry{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|Major League Baseball]] from [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] and the [[Olympics on CBS|Winter Olympics]] from [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] despite losing the [[National Basketball Association]] to [[NBC]] after the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]].\n\nUnder network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''; ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''; ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''; ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]; [[Picket Fences]]''; and a resurgent ''Jake and the Fatman'' during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly, in the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]; however, a drawback for the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC, or even the fledgling Fox network, with its relatively limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was \"the network for the living dead\" during this period.<ref name=\"tvtropes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|title=CBS (Creator) - TV Tropes|publisher=|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209025436/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|archive-date=February 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|late-night talk show]] franchise to compete with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it signed [[David Letterman]] away from NBC after the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' host was passed over as [[Johnny Carson]]'s successor on ''Tonight'' in favor of [[Jay Leno]].\n\nDespite having success with ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever.{{dubious|date=April 2020}}{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with [[Major League Baseball]] (after losing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million over a four-year span), with the league reaching a new contract with [[The Baseball Network|NBC and ABC]].

One of the shows that was affected was the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''; as a result, NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which the ''Late Show'' often dominated over during the first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman in London, Seeking Boost at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822063316/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|archive-date=August 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, such as ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' (which moved to the network from NBC), ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', ''[[Cybill (TV series)|Cybill]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.\n\nCBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block, the \"[[CBS Block Party]]\", in the [[1997\u201398 United States network television schedule|1997\u201398 season]] (consisting of ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'', and ''[[The Gregory Hines Show]]'', all but the latter coming from [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], which had maintained a relationship with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete against ABC's \"[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]\" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): ''Meego'' and ''Hines'' were cancelled by November, while ''Family Matters'' and ''Step by Step'' were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Games]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]]; NBC, which had already held the rights to the Summer Olympics since [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], took over coverage of the Winter Olympics beginning with the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Games]].\n\nThe building blocks for the network's return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the [[American Football Conference]] (stripping that package from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] after 32 years), effective with the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|last=Kent|first=Milton|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502212451/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|archive-date=May 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the [[New England Patriots]] in the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the [[1998\u20131999 United States network television schedule|1998\u20131999 season]]; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''.\n\n====Programming: Return to first place and rivalry with Fox (2002\u2013present)====\nAnother turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (US)|Big Brother]]'', which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) including ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the [[2002\u201303 United States network television schedule|2002\u201303 season]]. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u201306 season]], an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]]). This lasted until the [[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308 season]], when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008\u201309 United States network television schedule|2008\u201309 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18\u201334, 18\u201349 and 25\u201354 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010\u201311 United States network television schedule|2010\u201311 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, ''Two and a Half Men'', saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18\u201349, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 fall season]], the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, the [[NCIS (TV series)|tenth season of ''NCIS'']] took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after ''American Idol'' ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' taking over the top spot from ''Idol'' the year before and from ''NCIS'' the year after), for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season (when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314]] slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's [[2014\u201315 United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. Also, midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' reboot and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with [[NFL Network]] to carry ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite

Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives|access-date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906063204/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|archive-date=September 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule&nbsp;\u2013 first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\n====Color technology (1953\u20131967)====\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;\u2013 then-parent company of NBC&nbsp;\u2013 made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first telecast ever of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)'s 1939 film classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''; [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]''; and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', featuring choreography by [[George Balanchine]]. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to [[PBS]]).\n\nBeginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'', now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of ''Ford Star Jubilee''), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]], the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis#White House restoration|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964\u201365 United States network television schedule|1964\u201365 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965\u201366 United States network television schedule|1965\u201366]] season and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966\u201367 United States network television schedule|1966\u201367 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from [[Philips]] which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|title=Norelco Cameras \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002233035/http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before [[Thanksgiving]]. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\n==Conglomerate==\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] Inc. from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club), book and magazine publishers ([[Fawcett Publications]] including ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]), map-makers and toy manufacturers ([[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), [[X-Acto]] knives,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first=Colin |last=Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327203550/http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Laboratories|CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.\n\n===Columbia Records===\n{{main|Columbia Records}}\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of [[North America]], where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122152333/http://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|archive-date=November 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]]) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from [[EMI]] its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]], co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.\n\n===Publishing===\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190901192756/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-date = September 1, 2019| url-status = live}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]; the US trade book division, renamed [[Henry Holt and Company]], was sold to the West German publisher [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]].

([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965\u20131980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966\u20131983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972\u20131985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\n===Film production===\n{{Main|CBS Films}}\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of [[Cinema Center Films]]. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]] called [[TriStar Pictures]]. Despite releasing such box office successes as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165839/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|archive-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\n===Home video===\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\n===Gabriel Toys===\nCBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the [[Atari 2600]], and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first [[karaoke]] recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].\n\n===New owners===\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States ([[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\n[[File:Ed sullivan theater.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|CBS's [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in Manhattan, former home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Now houses ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.]]\n\n====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994]].

The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, [[WCAU (TV)|WCAU]], which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia \u2013 Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423000255/http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|archive-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995.

Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007, and is now owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]] and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]] ([[The Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]]) and starting a new one ([[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for [[brand licensing]] purposes) were gone.\n\n====Viacom====\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]&nbsp;\u2013 a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\n====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815051557/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|archive-date=August 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned the [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"[[Star Trek]]\" and \"[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]\" franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165956/https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}\n{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week.

Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.\n\n[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] season. In addition to rights to sports events from the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to&nbsp;\u2013 or in some cases, in lieu of&nbsp;\u2013 a major sporting event.\n\n===Daytime===\n{{main|CBS Daytime}}\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''The Price Is Right'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer/comedian [[Wayne Brady]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows.

From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']].

The Litton-produced \"CBS Dream Team\" block, which is aimed at teenagers 13 to 16 years old, debuted on September 28, 2013, replacing ''Cookie Jar TV''.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS partners with Litton Entertainment for Saturday teen block|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-cbs-litton-entertainment-saturday-teen-block-20130724,0,7010894.story|last=James|first=Meg|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725124635/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-cbs-litton-entertainment-saturday-teen-block-20130724,0,7010894.story|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Specials===\n\n====Animated primetime holiday specials====\nCBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime holiday specials based on the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip, beginning with ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials are now held by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|title=Boomerang &#124; Full Episodes of Your Family's Favorite Cartoons|website=Boomerang|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608084708/https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''Hawaii Five-O'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner\u2014 Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Classical music specials====\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'' conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ''The Nutcracker''&nbsp;\u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;\u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by legendary pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n====''Cinderella''====\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] and a book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}.

The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;\u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;\u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\n====Other notable specials====\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Bob Barker]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[Willard Scott]] (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and [[Alex Trebek]].\n\nThe Miss USA [[beauty pageant]] aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an [[animal rights activist]] who eventually convinced producers of ''The Price Is Right'' to cease offering [[fur coat]]s as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996. The pageant's highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. pulchritude tops TV charts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=P15|date=May 21, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pageant tops Nielsen ratings|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|page=P15|date=May 19, 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Beauty pageant most-watched show|publisher=The Globe and Mail Associated Press|page=P15|date=May 18, 1983}}</ref> Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20&nbsp;million to an average of 7&nbsp;million from 2000 to 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=There She Goes: Pageants Move to NBC|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> In 2002, [[Donald Trump]] (owner of the Miss USA pageant's governing body, the [[Miss Universe Organization]]) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract,<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump moves pageants from CBS to NBC|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|page=2B|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump's controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC: Done With Donald Trump, Miss USA, Miss Universe \u2013 Update|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/nbc-donald-trump-cancels-miss-usa-miss-universe-1201461913/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=July 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630174133/http://deadline.com/2015/06/nbc-donald-trump-cancels-miss-usa-miss-universe-1201461913/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 1977, it was announced that [[Elvis Presley]] had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a new television special.

In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is [[KHNL|KOGG]] in [[Wailuku, Hawaii]], which serves as a repeater of [[Honolulu]] affiliate [[KGMB]] (the sister station of KOGG parent KHNL).\n\n[[Nexstar Media Group]] is the largest operator of CBS stations by numerical total, owning 49 CBS affiliates (counting satellites);

That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]\u2013[[1998 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] to high definition beginning with the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]], with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts.

This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018 when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\n\n==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==\n\n===Logos===\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\n[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]\n[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface.]]\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126183721/http://pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|archive-date=November 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] as well as a [[Shakers|Shaker]] drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018003809/http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the ''Eyemark'', which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom, [[Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru, [[Fuji Television]] in Japan, [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil, and [[Saeta TV Channel 10]] in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703103325/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|archive-date=July 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is ''[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]'', a close relative to ''[[Bodoni]]''.  Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include ''Avant Garde'', ''Lubalin Graph'', and ''Serif Gothic''.\n\n===Image campaigns===\n\n====1980s====\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the [[1981\u201382 United States network television schedule|1981\u201382 season]] feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985\u201386).\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 United States network television schedule|1986\u201387 season]] ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[Digital video effect|DVE]] effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the [[1988\u201389 United States network television schedule|1988\u201389 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the [[1989\u201390 United States network television schedule|1989\u201390 season]]. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\n====1990s====\nFor the [[1990\u201391 United States network television schedule|1990\u201391 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[The Temptations]], which offered an altered version of their hit \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997\u20131999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\n====2000s====\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010\u20132011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018081239/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Promos===\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules.

Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]]s, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.\n\n===Bermuda===\nIn Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]-based [[ZBM-TV]], locally owned by [[Bermuda Broadcasting|Bermuda Broadcasting Company]].\n\n===Mexico===\nCBS programming is available in [[Mexico]] through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] (such as [[KYMA-DT]]/[[Yuma, Arizona]];

To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.\n|-\n| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970\u20131975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to Vice President, Programs&nbsp;\u2013 heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book|title=My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163\u2013173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the \"[[rural purge]]\" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.\n|-\n| [[Arthur R.

The [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] period saw the dawn of drama and history. Three philosophers are especially notable: [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].

A number of [[alphabet]]s and [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] had been used to render Greek, but surviving Greek literature was written in a [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]-derived alphabet that arose primarily in Greek [[Ionia]] and was fully adopted by [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by the fifth century BC.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/grkol|title=Introduction to Classical Greek|last=|first=|date=|website=lrc.la.utexas.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Homer British Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|Idealized portrayal of [[Homer]]]]\n\n===Preclassical (800 BC-500 BC)===\nAll ancient Greek literature was to some degree oral in nature, and the earliest literature was completely so.<ref>Reece, Steve. \"Orality and Literacy: Ancient Greek Literature as Oral Literature,\" in David Schenker and Martin Hose (eds.), ''Companion to Greek Literature'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2015) 43-57.

A third historian, [[Xenophon]], wrote \"Hellenica,\" which is considered an extension of Thucydides's work.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=Chad Matthew|date=2016-12-09|year=|title=Review of: A Guide to Hellenistic Literature.

Philip II's son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] extended his father's conquests greatly.\n\nThe Hellenistic age is defined as the time between the death of Alexander the Great and the rise of Roman domination.  After the 3rd century BC, the Greek colony of [[Alexandria]] in northern [[Egypt]] became the center of Greek culture.\n\nGreek poetry flourished with significant contributions from [[Theocritus]], [[Callimachus]], and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]. Theocritus, who lived from about 310 to 250 BC, was the creator of pastoral poetry, a type that the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Virgil]] mastered in his [[Eclogues]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://classes.maxwell.syr.edu/his301-001/when_cultures_collide.htm|title=Historiography of the Hellenistic Age|last=|first=|date=2016-12-09|website=|publisher=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003205129/http://classes.maxwell.syr.edu/his301-001/when_cultures_collide.htm|archive-date=2017-10-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDrama was represented by the [[New Comedy]], of which [[Menander]] was the principal exponent.\n\nOne of the most valuable contributions of the Hellenistic period was the translation of the [[Old Testament]] into Greek. This work was done at Alexandria and completed by the end of the 2nd century BC.\n\n[[File:Strabon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Strabo]]]]\n\n===Roman Age (31 BC-284 AD)===\n{{Main article|Latin Literature}}\n\nRoman literature was written in Latin and contributed significant works to the subjects of poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy. A large proportion of literature from this time period were histories.\n\nSignificant historians of the period were [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], [[Polybius]], [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], [[Appian of Alexandria]], [[Arrian]], and [[Plutarch]]. The period of time the cover extended from late in the 4th century BC to the 2nd century AD.\n\n[[Eratosthenes]] of Alexandria wrote on [[astronomy]] and [[geography]], but his work is known mainly from later summaries. The physician [[Galen]] pioneered developments in various scientific disciplines including anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, and neurology. This is also the period in which most of the [[Ancient Greek novel]]s were written.\n\nThe [[New Testament]], written by various authors in varying qualities of [[Koine Greek]], hails from this period. The [[Gospels]] and the [[Pauline epistles|Epistles of Saint Paul]] were written in this time period as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/suic/ReferenceDetailsPage/DocumentToolsPortletWindow?displayGroupName=Reference&jsid=b519e6dc07c52b83c12bc6f1bf327190&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CCX3448400018&u=tecu60273&zid=ca58d102d83e5cc266963e932dc1954b|title=Student Resources in Context - Document|last=|first=|date=|website=ic.galegroup.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-09}}</ref>\n\n==Byzantine literature (290 AD\u20131453 AD)==\n{{Main article|Byzantine literature}}\n[[File:Suda.jpg|thumb|160px|A page from a 16th-century edition of the 10th century Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]] of the ancient Mediterranean world, the [[Suda]]]]\n\nByzantine literature refers to literature of the [[Byzantine Empire]] written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval Greek|Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]].\n\nByzantine literature combined Greek and [[Christian civilization]] on the common foundation of the Roman political system. This type of literature was set in the intellectual and ethnographic atmosphere of the [[Near East]]. Byzantine literature possesses four primary cultural elements: Greek, Christian, Roman, and [[Oriental]].\n\nAside from personal correspondence, literature of this period was primarily written in the [[Atticism|Atticizing]] style. Some early literature of this period was written in [[Latin]]; some of the works from the [[Latin Empire]] were written in [[French Language|French]].\n\n[[Chronicle]]s, distinct from historic, arose in this period.

It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553\u20131613).\n\nModern Greek literature is significantly influenced by the [[Diafotismos]], a movement that translated the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] into the Greek world. [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] are two prominent figures of this movement.\n\nToday, Modern Greek Literature participates in the global literary community.

The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition.

He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final.

They also design power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems.\n\nLike other engineers, mechanical engineers use computers to help create and analyze designs, run simulations and test how a machine is likely to work.\n\n===License and regulation===\nEngineers may seek [[licensing|license]] by a state, provincial, or national government. The purpose of this process is to ensure that engineers possess the necessary technical knowledge, real-world experience, and knowledge of the local legal system to practice engineering at a professional level. Once certified, the engineer is given the title of [[Professional Engineer]] (in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Bangladesh and South Africa), [[Chartered Engineer]] (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Zimbabwe), ''Chartered Professional Engineer'' (in Australia and New Zealand) or ''European Engineer'' (much of the European Union).\n\nIn the U.S., to become a licensed Professional Engineer (PE), an engineer must pass the comprehensive FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam, work a minimum of 4 years as an ''Engineering Intern (EI)'' or ''Engineer-in-Training (EIT)'', and pass the \"Principles and Practice\" or PE (Practicing Engineer or Professional Engineer) exams.  The requirements and steps of this process are set forth by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying]] (NCEES), a composed of engineering and land surveying licensing boards representing all U.S. states and territories.\n\nIn the UK, current graduates require a [[BEng]] plus an appropriate master's degree or an integrated [[MEng]] degree, a minimum of 4 years post graduate on the job competency development and a peer reviewed project report to become a Chartered Mechanical Engineer (CEng, MIMechE) through the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]]. CEng MIMechE can also be obtained via an examination route administered by the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn most developed countries, certain engineering tasks, such as the design of bridges, electric power plants, and chemical plants, must be approved by a [[professional engineer]] or a [[chartered engineer]]. \"Only a licensed engineer, for instance, may prepare, sign, seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or to seal engineering work for public and private clients.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= Why Get Licensed? |work= National Society of Professional Engineers |url= http://www.nspe.org/Licensure/WhyGetLicensed/index.html |accessdate= 6 May 2008 }}</ref> This requirement can be written into state and provincial legislation, such as in the Canadian provinces, for example the Ontario or Quebec's Engineer Act.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engineers Act |work=Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) |url=http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html |accessdate=24 July 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html |archivedate=5 October 2006 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn other countries, such as Australia, and the UK, no such legislation exists; however, practically all certifying bodies maintain a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] independent of legislation, that they expect all members to abide by or risk expulsion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Codes of Ethics and Conduct |work=Online Ethics Center |url=http://onlineethics.org/codes/ |accessdate=24 July 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081942/http://onlineethics.org/codes/ |archivedate=19 June 2005 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n{{Further|FE Exam|Professional Engineer|Incorporated Engineer|Washington Accord|Regulation and licensure in engineering}}\n\n===Salaries and workforce statistics===\nThe total number of engineers employed in the U.S. in 2015 was roughly 1.6 million.

Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.\n\n===Mechanics===\n[[File:Mohrs circle.svg|thumb|[[Mohr's circle]], a common tool to study [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] in a [[mechanical element]]]]\n{{main|Mechanics}}\n\nMechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of [[force]]s and their effect upon [[matter]]. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both [[Elastic Deformation|elastic]] and [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]]) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or [[Stress (physics)|stresses]]. Subdisciplines of mechanics include\n* [[Statics]], the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies\n* [[dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]] the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).\n* [[Mechanics of materials]], the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress\n* [[Fluid mechanics]], the study of how fluids react to forces<ref>Note: fluid mechanics can be further split into fluid statics and fluid dynamics, and is itself a subdiscipline of continuum mechanics. The application of fluid mechanics in engineering is called [[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]].</ref>\n* [[Kinematics]], the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion.  Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]].\n* [[Continuum mechanics]], a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than [[wikt:discrete|discrete]])\n\nMechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the [[piston]]s and [[cam]]s as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see [[HVAC]]), or to design the [[intake]] system for the engine.\n\n===Mechatronics and robotics===\n[[File:FMS1 small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC Mill and CNC Lathe]]\n{{main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}\n\nMechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics.  It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, [[electrical engineering]] and [[software engineering]] that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems.  In this way, machines can be automated through the use of [[electric motor]]s, [[servomechanism|servo-mechanisms]], and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to [[bit]]s. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.\n\nRobotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).\n\nRobots are used extensively in [[industrial engineering]]. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ [[assembly lines]] of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run [[Lights out (manufacturing)|by themselves]]. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, [[space exploration]], and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.\n\n===Structural analysis===\n{{main|Structural analysis|Failure analysis}}\n\nStructural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. ''Static structural failure'' occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed [[plastic deformation|plastically]], depending on the criterion for failure. ''Fatigue failure'' occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack on the surface of the object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause [[ultimate failure]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/bohr/mse209/chapter8.htm|title=Chapter 8. Failure|website=www.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\nFailure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.\n\nStructural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred, or when designing to prevent failure. Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM<ref>[http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ ASM International's site many documents, such as the ''ASM Handbook'' series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901014247/http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ |date=2007-09-01 }}. [[ASM International (society)|ASM International]].</ref> to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes.\n\nOnce theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often performed to verify calculated results. Structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed parts, or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.\n\n===Thermodynamics and thermo-science===\n{{main|Thermodynamics}}\n\n[[Thermodynamics]] is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a [[physical system|system]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/thermo.html|title=Thermodynamics|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy ([[enthalpy]]) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.\n\nThermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of [[heat transfer]], [[thermofluids]], and [[energy conversion]]. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design [[engine]]s and [[power plant]]s, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, [[heat exchanger]]s, [[heat sink]]s, [[radiator]]s, [[refrigeration]], [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/thermodynamics/38344-thermodynamics-integral-part-of-our-life/|title=Applications of Thermodynamics Laws. Carnot, Stirling, Ericsson, Diesel cycles|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2009-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Design and drafting===\n[[File:Mech 2 3D.png|thumb|right|A CAD model of a [[mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]] ]]\n{{main|Technical drawing|CNC}}\n\n[[Technical drawing|Drafting]] or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for [[manufacture|manufacturing]] parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-3d-cad|title=SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD|website=SOLIDWORKS|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2017-11-27}}</ref> A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.\n\nInstructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of [[Numerical control#CNC arrives|computer numerically controlled]] (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of [[thermal spray|spray coatings]], surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.\n\nDrafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).\n\n==Modern tools==\n[[File:cad crank.jpg|thumb|An oblique view of a four-cylinder inline crankshaft with pistons]]\n\nMany mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D [[solid modeling]] [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.\n\nOther CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM).\n\nUsing CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian flows]].\n\nAs mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in [[mechatronics]], [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.  MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.\n\n==Areas of research==\nMechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below (see also [[exploratory engineering]]).\n\n===Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)===\nMicron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like [[SU8]]. Examples of [[MEMS]] components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.\n\n===Friction stir welding (FSW)===\n{{main|Friction stir welding}}\n\nFriction stir welding, a new type of [[welding]], was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI).  The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several [[aluminum]] [[alloy]]s.  It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets.  Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew Vehicle, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niar.wichita.edu/media/pdf/nationalpublication/Nov2-06.pdf|title=Advances in Friction Stir Welding for Aerospace Applications|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/08/sbir/phase1/SBIR-08-1-A1.02-9322.html?solicitationId=SBIR_08_P1 Proposal Number: 08-1 A1.02-9322] \u2013 NASA 2008 SBIR</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntefsw.com/military_applications.htm|title=Military Applications|access-date=15 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190131095213/http://www.ntefsw.com/military_applications.htm|archive-date=31 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Composites===\n[[File:Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg|thumb|Composite cloth consisting of woven carbon fiber]]\n{{main|Composite material}}\n\nComposites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce [[weight]], susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.\n\n===Mechatronics===\n[[Mechatronics]] is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, [[electronic engineering]], and software engineering. The discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-mechanical systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/what-is-mechatronics-technology|title=What is Mechatronics Technology?|website=www.ecpi.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.\n\n===Nanotechnology===\n{{main|Nanotechnology}}\n\nAt the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology\u2014one speculative goal of which is to create a [[molecular assembler]] to build molecules and materials via [[mechanosynthesis]]. For now that goal remains within [[exploratory engineering]].  Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters,<ref>Nilsen, Kyle.

But the evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial codes such as [[NASTRAN]], [[ANSYS]], and [[ABAQUS]] are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules.  In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like [[SimScale]] are becoming more common.\n\nOther techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.\n\n===Biomechanics===\n{{main|Biomechanics}}\n\nBiomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems, such as [[human]]s, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and [[Cell (biology)|cells]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.016 |title=Mechanics of animal movement}}</ref>  Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is closely related to [[engineering]], because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] and/or [[materials science]]s can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.\n\nIn the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight. <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tensile strength of bone along and across the grain|journal = Journal of Applied Physiology|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 355\u2013360|last=Dempster|first=Coleman|date=August 15, 1960|doi=10.1152/jappl.1961.16.2.355|pmid = 13721810}}</ref> The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for structural design.\n\nOver the past decade the [[Finite element method]] (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to [[in vivo]] surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.<ref>Tsouknidas, A., Savvakis, S., Asaniotis, Y., Anagnostidis, K., Lontos, A., Michailidis, N.

Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.\n\n===Acoustical engineering===\n{{main|Acoustical engineering}}\n\nAcoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the study of [[Sound]] and [[Vibration]].

Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized subdisciplines are discussed in this section.\n\n===Mechanics===\n[[File:Mohrs circle.svg|thumb|[[Mohr's circle]], a common tool to study [[Stress (physics)|stresses]] in a [[mechanical element]]]]\n{{main|Mechanics}}\n\nMechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of [[force]]s and their effect upon [[matter]]. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both [[Elastic Deformation|elastic]] and [[Plastic Deformation|plastic]]) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or [[Stress (physics)|stresses]]. Subdisciplines of mechanics include\n* [[Statics]], the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies\n* [[dynamics (mechanics)|Dynamics]] the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).\n* [[Mechanics of materials]], the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress\n* [[Fluid mechanics]], the study of how fluids react to forces<ref>Note: fluid mechanics can be further split into fluid statics and fluid dynamics, and is itself a subdiscipline of continuum mechanics. The application of fluid mechanics in engineering is called [[hydraulics]] and [[pneumatics]].</ref>\n* [[Kinematics]], the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion.  Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]].\n* [[Continuum mechanics]], a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than [[wikt:discrete|discrete]])\n\nMechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the [[piston]]s and [[cam]]s as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see [[HVAC]]), or to design the [[intake]] system for the engine.\n\n===Mechatronics and robotics===\n[[File:FMS1 small.JPG|thumb|Training FMS with learning robot [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]], workbench CNC Mill and CNC Lathe]]\n{{main|Mechatronics|Robotics}}\n\nMechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics.  It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, [[electrical engineering]] and [[software engineering]] that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems.  In this way, machines can be automated through the use of [[electric motor]]s, [[servomechanism|servo-mechanisms]], and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to [[bit]]s. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.\n\nRobotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).\n\nRobots are used extensively in [[industrial engineering]]. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ [[assembly lines]] of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run [[Lights out (manufacturing)|by themselves]]. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, [[space exploration]], and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.\n\n===Structural analysis===\n{{main|Structural analysis|Failure analysis}}\n\nStructural analysis is the branch of mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and fatigue failure. ''Static structural failure'' occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed [[plastic deformation|plastically]], depending on the criterion for failure. ''Fatigue failure'' occurs when an object fails after a number of repeated loading and unloading cycles. Fatigue failure occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack on the surface of the object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause [[ultimate failure]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/bohr/mse209/chapter8.htm|title=Chapter 8. Failure|website=www.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref>\n\nFailure is not simply defined as when a part breaks, however; it is defined as when a part does not operate as intended. Some systems, such as the perforated top sections of some plastic bags, are designed to break. If these systems do not break, failure analysis might be employed to determine the cause.\n\nStructural analysis is often used by mechanical engineers after a failure has occurred, or when designing to prevent failure. Engineers often use online documents and books such as those published by ASM<ref>[http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ ASM International's site many documents, such as the ''ASM Handbook'' series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901014247/http://asmcommunity.asminternational.org/portal/site/asm/ |date=2007-09-01 }}. [[ASM International (society)|ASM International]].</ref> to aid them in determining the type of failure and possible causes.\n\nOnce theory is applied to a mechanical design, physical testing is often performed to verify calculated results. Structural analysis may be used in an office when designing parts, in the field to analyze failed parts, or in laboratories where parts might undergo controlled failure tests.\n\n===Thermodynamics and thermo-science===\n{{main|Thermodynamics}}\n\n[[Thermodynamics]] is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a [[physical system|system]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/thermo.html|title=Thermodynamics|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy ([[enthalpy]]) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.\n\nThermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of [[heat transfer]], [[thermofluids]], and [[energy conversion]]. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design [[engine]]s and [[power plant]]s, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, [[heat exchanger]]s, [[heat sink]]s, [[radiator]]s, [[refrigeration]], [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], and others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brighthubengineering.com/thermodynamics/38344-thermodynamics-integral-part-of-our-life/|title=Applications of Thermodynamics Laws. Carnot, Stirling, Ericsson, Diesel cycles|website=Brighthub Engineering|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2009-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Design and drafting===\n[[File:Mech 2 3D.png|thumb|right|A CAD model of a [[mechanical seal|mechanical double seal]] ]]\n{{main|Technical drawing|CNC}}\n\n[[Technical drawing|Drafting]] or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for [[manufacture|manufacturing]] parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solidworks.com/product/solidworks-3d-cad|title=SOLIDWORKS 3D CAD|website=SOLIDWORKS|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09|date=2017-11-27}}</ref> A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.\n\nInstructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of [[Numerical control#CNC arrives|computer numerically controlled]] (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of [[thermal spray|spray coatings]], surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.\n\nDrafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) and [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD).\n\n==Modern tools==\n[[File:cad crank.jpg|thumb|An oblique view of a four-cylinder inline crankshaft with pistons]]\n\nMany mechanical engineering companies, especially those in industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D [[solid modeling]] [[computer-aided design]] (CAD). This method has many benefits, including easier and more exhaustive visualization of products, the ability to create virtual assemblies of parts, and the ease of use in designing mating interfaces and tolerances.\n\nOther CAE programs commonly used by mechanical engineers include [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM) tools and analysis tools used to perform complex simulations. Analysis tools may be used to predict product response to expected loads, including fatigue life and manufacturability. These tools include [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD), and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM).\n\nUsing CAE programs, a mechanical design team can quickly and cheaply iterate the design process to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing hundreds or thousands of designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as viscoelasticity, complex contact between mating parts, or [[Non-Newtonian fluid|non-Newtonian flows]].\n\nAs mechanical engineering begins to merge with other disciplines, as seen in [[mechatronics]], [[multidisciplinary design optimization]] (MDO) is being used with other CAE programs to automate and improve the iterative design process.  MDO tools wrap around existing CAE processes, allowing product evaluation to continue even after the analyst goes home for the day. They also utilize sophisticated optimization algorithms to more intelligently explore possible designs, often finding better, innovative solutions to difficult multidisciplinary design problems.\n\n==Areas of research==\nMechanical engineers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in order to produce safer, cheaper, and more efficient machines and mechanical systems. Some technologies at the cutting edge of mechanical engineering are listed below (see also [[exploratory engineering]]).\n\n===Micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)===\nMicron-scale mechanical components such as springs, gears, fluidic and heat transfer devices are fabricated from a variety of substrate materials such as silicon, glass and polymers like [[SU8]]. Examples of [[MEMS]] components are the accelerometers that are used as car airbag sensors, modern cell phones, gyroscopes for precise positioning and microfluidic devices used in biomedical applications.\n\n===Friction stir welding (FSW)===\n{{main|Friction stir welding}}\n\nFriction stir welding, a new type of [[welding]], was discovered in 1991 by [[The Welding Institute]] (TWI).  The innovative steady state (non-fusion) welding technique joins materials previously un-weldable, including several [[aluminum]] [[alloy]]s.  It plays an important role in the future construction of airplanes, potentially replacing rivets.  Current uses of this technology to date include welding the seams of the aluminum main Space Shuttle external tank, Orion Crew Vehicle, Boeing Delta II and Delta IV Expendable Launch Vehicles and the SpaceX Falcon 1 rocket, armor plating for amphibious assault ships, and welding the wings and fuselage panels of the new Eclipse 500 aircraft from Eclipse Aviation among an increasingly growing pool of uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niar.wichita.edu/media/pdf/nationalpublication/Nov2-06.pdf|title=Advances in Friction Stir Welding for Aerospace Applications|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/08/sbir/phase1/SBIR-08-1-A1.02-9322.html?solicitationId=SBIR_08_P1 Proposal Number: 08-1 A1.02-9322] \u2013 NASA 2008 SBIR</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntefsw.com/military_applications.htm|title=Military Applications|access-date=15 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190131095213/http://www.ntefsw.com/military_applications.htm|archive-date=31 January 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Composites===\n[[File:Kohlenstofffasermatte.jpg|thumb|Composite cloth consisting of woven carbon fiber]]\n{{main|Composite material}}\n\nComposites or composite materials are a combination of materials which provide different physical characteristics than either material separately. Composite material research within mechanical engineering typically focuses on designing (and, subsequently, finding applications for) stronger or more rigid materials while attempting to reduce [[weight]], susceptibility to corrosion, and other undesirable factors. Carbon fiber reinforced composites, for instance, have been used in such diverse applications as spacecraft and fishing rods.\n\n===Mechatronics===\n[[Mechatronics]] is the synergistic combination of mechanical engineering, [[electronic engineering]], and software engineering. The discipline of mechatronics began as a way to combine mechanical principles with electrical engineering. Mechatronic concepts are used in the majority of electro-mechanical systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecpi.edu/blog/what-is-mechatronics-technology|title=What is Mechatronics Technology?|website=www.ecpi.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> Typical electro-mechanical sensors used in mechatronics are strain gauges, thermocouples, and pressure transducers.\n\n===Nanotechnology===\n{{main|Nanotechnology}}\n\nAt the smallest scales, mechanical engineering becomes nanotechnology\u2014one speculative goal of which is to create a [[molecular assembler]] to build molecules and materials via [[mechanosynthesis]]. For now that goal remains within [[exploratory engineering]].  Areas of current mechanical engineering research in nanotechnology include nanofilters,<ref>Nilsen, Kyle.

It uses a mesh setup with user-defined sizes to measure physical quantities at a node. The more nodes there are, the higher the precision.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://user.engineering.uiowa.edu/~bme083/lecture/lecture04_020303.pdf|title=Introduction to Finite Element Analysis (FEA)|last=Xia|first=Ting|date=Feb 3, 2003|website=UIOWA Engineering|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830001308/http://user.engineering.uiowa.edu/~bme083/Lecture/Lecture04_020303.pdf|archive-date=30 August 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=Sep 4, 2018}}</ref> This field is not new, as the basis of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) or Finite Element Method (FEM) dates back to 1941.  But the evolution of computers has made FEA/FEM a viable option for analysis of structural problems. Many commercial codes such as [[NASTRAN]], [[ANSYS]], and [[ABAQUS]] are widely used in industry for research and the design of components. Some 3D modeling and CAD software packages have added FEA modules.  In the recent times, cloud simulation platforms like [[SimScale]] are becoming more common.\n\nOther techniques such as finite difference method (FDM) and finite-volume method (FVM) are employed to solve problems relating heat and mass transfer, fluid flows, fluid surface interaction, etc.\n\n===Biomechanics===\n{{main|Biomechanics}}\n\nBiomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to biological systems, such as [[human]]s, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and [[Cell (biology)|cells]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.08.016 |title=Mechanics of animal movement}}</ref>  Biomechanics also aids in creating prosthetic limbs and artificial organs for humans. Biomechanics is closely related to [[engineering]], because it often uses traditional engineering sciences to analyze biological systems. Some simple applications of [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] and/or [[materials science]]s can supply correct approximations to the mechanics of many biological systems.\n\nIn the past decade, reverse engineering of materials found in nature such as bone matter has gained funding in academia. The structure of bone matter is optimized for its purpose of bearing a large amount of compressive stress per unit weight. <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Tensile strength of bone along and across the grain|journal = Journal of Applied Physiology|volume = 16|issue = 2|pages = 355\u2013360|last=Dempster|first=Coleman|date=August 15, 1960|doi=10.1152/jappl.1961.16.2.355|pmid = 13721810}}</ref> The goal is to replace crude steel with bio-material for structural design.\n\nOver the past decade the [[Finite element method]] (FEM) has also entered the Biomedical sector highlighting further engineering aspects of Biomechanics. FEM has since then established itself as an alternative to [[in vivo]] surgical assessment and gained the wide acceptance of academia. The main advantage of Computational Biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.<ref>Tsouknidas, A., Savvakis, S., Asaniotis, Y., Anagnostidis, K., Lontos, A., Michailidis, N.

Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.simscale.com/docs/content/simwiki/cfd/whatiscfd.html|title=What is CFD {{!}} Computational Fluid Dynamics? \u2014 SimScale Documentation|website=www.simscale.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.\n\n===Acoustical engineering===\n{{main|Acoustical engineering}}\n\nAcoustical engineering is one of many other sub-disciplines of mechanical engineering and is the application of acoustics. Acoustical engineering is the study of [[Sound]] and [[Vibration]]. These engineers work effectively to reduce [[noise pollution]] in mechanical devices and in buildings by soundproofing or removing sources of unwanted noise. The study of acoustics can range from designing a more efficient hearing aid, microphone, headphone, or recording studio to enhancing the sound quality of an orchestra hall. Acoustical engineering also deals with the vibration of different mechanical systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learn.org/articles/What_is_the_Job_Description_of_an_Acoustic_Engineer.html|title=What is the Job Description of an Acoustic Engineer?|work=learn.org}}</ref>\n\n==Related fields==\n[[Manufacturing engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]] and [[automotive engineering]] are grouped with mechanical engineering at times.

It was his first feature film, and was also based on an original story he had written. Shot mostly in the rural town of [[Sofala, New South Wales]], the film is set in the fictional town of Paris in which most of the inhabitants appear to be directly, or indirectly, involved in profiting from the results of car accidents.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with an urban couple driving through the countryside in what looks like a cinema advertisement. The scene comes to a halt with a fatal accident. The rural Australian town of Paris arranges fatal accidents to visitors driving through. Townspeople collect items from the luggage of the deceased passengers whilst survivors are taken to the local hospital where they are given [[Lobotomy|lobotomies]] with [[power tool]]s and kept as \"veggies\" for medical experiments by the earnest town surgeon. The young men of the town salvage and modify the wrecked vehicles into a variety of strange-looking cars designed for destruction.\n\nArthur Waldo ([[Terry Camilleri]]) and his older brother, George Waldo (Rick Scully), drive through Paris with their [[Travel trailer|caravan]] where they meet with an accident that kills George. Arthur is spared and looked after by the Mayor of Paris, Len Kelly ([[John Meillon]]), who invites Arthur to stay in his home as one of his family; his two young daughters have been \"adopted\" after being orphaned in motor accidents in the town.\n\nArthur unsuccessfully attempts to leave Paris but due to a previous incident where he was exonerated of [[manslaughter]] for running over an elderly pedestrian, he has lost his confidence in driving and there does not seem to be any [[public transport]]. Mayor Len gives Arthur a job at the local hospital as a [[medical orderly]]. Beneath the idyllic rural paradise of Paris is a festering feud between the young men of the town who live for their modified vehicles that they terrorise the town with and the older generation. When one of the [[hoon]]s damages the Mayor's property and breaks a statue of an [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigine]] the older men of the town burn the guilty driver's car as he is held down.\n\nThe Mayor appoints Arthur the town Parking Inspector complete with [[brassard]] and Army [[bush jacket]] that further irritates the young men. The situation reaches its boiling point the night of the town's annual Pioneers Ball which is a fancy dress and costume party.  What was planned to be a \"car [[Gymkhana (motorsport)|gymkhana]]\" by the young men turns into an assault on the town where both sides attack each other killing several of the residents.  Arthur regains his driving confidence when he repeatedly drives the Mayor's car into his former hospital orderly supervisor who is one of the hoons. The film closes with Arthur, and the town's other residents, leaving Paris in the night.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Meillon]] as Mayor Len Kelly\n* [[Terry Camilleri]] as Arthur Waldo\n* [[Chris Haywood]] as Darryl\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Charlie\n* Kevin Miles as Dr. Midland\n* Rick Scully as George Waldo\n* [[Max Gillies]] as Metcalfe\n* Peter Armstrong as Gorman\n* Joe Burrow as Ganger\n* Deryck Barnes as Al Smedley\n* [[Edward Howell (actor)|Edward Howell]] as Tringham\n* Jack Ellerton as Staring Drinker\n* [[Max Phipps]] as Reverend Mulray\n* [[Melissa Jaffer]] as Beth\n\n==Production==\nPeter Weir got the idea to make the film while driving through Europe where road signs on the main French roads diverted him into what he perceived as strange little villages.<ref>p. 41 Rayner, Jonathan R.

It was his first feature film, and was also based on an original story he had written. Shot mostly in the rural town of [[Sofala, New South Wales]], the film is set in the fictional town of Paris in which most of the inhabitants appear to be directly, or indirectly, involved in profiting from the results of car accidents.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with an urban couple driving through the countryside in what looks like a cinema advertisement. The scene comes to a halt with a fatal accident. The rural Australian town of Paris arranges fatal accidents to visitors driving through. Townspeople collect items from the luggage of the deceased passengers whilst survivors are taken to the local hospital where they are given [[Lobotomy|lobotomies]] with [[power tool]]s and kept as \"veggies\" for medical experiments by the earnest town surgeon. The young men of the town salvage and modify the wrecked vehicles into a variety of strange-looking cars designed for destruction.\n\nArthur Waldo ([[Terry Camilleri]]) and his older brother, George Waldo (Rick Scully), drive though Paris with their [[Travel trailer|caravan]] where they meet with an accident that kills George. Arthur is spared and looked after by the Mayor of Paris, Len Kelly ([[John Meillon]]), who invites Arthur to stay in his home as one of his family; his two young daughters have been \"adopted\" after being orphaned in motor accidents in the town.\n\nArthur unsuccessfully attempts to leave Paris but due to a previous incident where he was exonerated of [[manslaughter]] for running over an elderly pedestrian, he has lost his confidence in driving and there does not seem to be any [[public transport]]. Mayor Len gives Arthur a job at the local hospital as a [[medical orderly]]. Beneath the idyllic rural paradise of Paris is a festering feud between the young men of the town who live for their modified vehicles that they terrorise the town with and the older generation. When one of the [[hoon]]s damages the Mayor's property and breaks a statue of an [[Australian Aborigine|Aborigine]] the older men of the town burn the guilty driver's car as he is held down.\n\nThe Mayor appoints Arthur the town Parking Inspector complete with [[brassard]] and Army [[bush jacket]] that further irritates the young men. The situation reaches its boiling point the night of the town's annual Pioneers Ball which is a fancy dress and costume party.  What was planned to be a \"car [[Gymkhana (motorsport)|gymkhana]]\" by the young men turns into an assault on the town where both sides attack each other killing several of the residents.  Arthur regains his driving confidence when he repeatedly drives the Mayor's car into his former hospital orderly supervisor who is one of the hoons. The film closes with Arthur, and the town's other residents, leaving Paris in the night.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Meillon]] as Mayor Len Kelly\n* [[Terry Camilleri]] as Arthur Waldo\n* [[Chris Haywood]] as Darryl\n* [[Bruce Spence]] as Charlie\n* Kevin Miles as Dr. Midland\n* Rick Scully as George Waldo\n* [[Max Gillies]] as Metcalfe\n* Peter Armstrong as Gorman\n* Joe Burrow as Ganger\n* Deryck Barnes as Al Smedley\n* [[Edward Howell (actor)|Edward Howell]] as Tringham\n* Jack Ellerton as Staring Drinker\n* [[Max Phipps]] as Reverend Mulray\n* [[Melissa Jaffer]] as Beth\n\n==Production==\nPeter Weir got the idea to make the film while driving through Europe where road signs on the main French roads diverted him into what he perceived as strange little villages.<ref>p. 41 Rayner, Jonathan R.

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can

It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can
