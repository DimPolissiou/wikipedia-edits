In modern times, various economists within the [[Georgism]] movement propose measures like the [[land value tax]] to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[developed country|developed countries]]. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.\n\nPoverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little, while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce.<ref>\"Under traditional (i.e., non-industrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entire population a [[right to an adequate standard of living]] by prevailing standards. With the economic productivity that resulted from industrialization, however, this ceased to be the case\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], \"Poverty\"</ref> Geoffrey Parker wrote that {{quote|In Antwerp and Lyon, two of the largest cities in western Europe, by 1600 three-quarters of the total population were too poor to pay taxes, and therefore likely to need relief in times of crisis.<ref>[[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] (2001). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qy8y8rHgucoC&pg=PA11&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Europe in crisis, 1598\u20131648]''\".

According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"[[working poor]]\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].<ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth.

The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty.

With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.<ref>Mukherji, A.

One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity''].

Poverty activist [[Paul Polak]] has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \"radically\" affordable goods. In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=Out of Poverty|url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781605092768&PG=1&Type=BL&PCS=BKP}}</ref> Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency.

During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n==Aid==\n{{main|Aid}}\n\n===Welfare===\n{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}\nAid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money.

Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S. Warren|title=Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries.|journal=Social Science & Medicine.

The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Sol\u00f3rzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=49|issue=9|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4|pmid=10501641}}</ref>\n\nSome [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.<ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance.

Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \"to get out of the hole\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/|title=World Bank Group - International Development, Poverty, & Sustainability|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm|title=Q&A: African debt relief|date=2005-06-11|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm|title= Zambia overwhelmed by free health care|publisher=BBC NEWS \u2013 Africa}}</ref>\n\n== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==\n\n[[File:Working Together To End Poverty One Nail At A Time - 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|\"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time,\" T-shirt, 50th anniversary of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]\nUniversal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size\u2014an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\n===Microloans===\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.<ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Empowering women==\n{{See also|Women's education and development}}\nThe [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 \"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender\". Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs.</ref> In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the [[feminization of poverty]], policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the [[World Bank]], suggesting that promoting [[gender equality]] through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.<ref>World Bank. 2001a \"Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice\".

Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.<ref>Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. \"Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook\", pp. 1\u2013272.

These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\"<ref name=\"undp2000\">United Nations Development Report. 2000.

Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.<ref name=\"kerbo\"/>\n\n==Other approaches==\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[W\u00f6rgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.<ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty.

There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented.

The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\n===Millennium Development Goals ===\nEradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project \u2013 Publications}}</ref> proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].\n* Action against [[domestic violence]].\n* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.\n* Deworming school children in affected areas.\n* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].\n* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].\n* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].\n* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.\n* Legislation for [[women's rights]], including rights to property.\n* [[Planting trees]].\n* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.\n* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].\n* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].\n* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.\n* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].\n\n=== Sustainable Development Goals ===\nThe first of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref> As the decade that began in 2002, the percentage of the world's population living under the poverty line by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\n===Poverty targeting===\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Costs and benefits of poverty targeting|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/more-accurate-poverty-targeting-strategy-more-expensive-it|author=James G.

For instance, one common method of poverty targeting is 'means testing' that uses a certain income or expenditure threshold for an individual or the a household to be considered as poor and eligible for support.<ref>{{cite news |title=Six main methodologies|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/how-identify-poor-people-provision-support|author=James G.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security |publisher=United Nations Sustainable Development}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces 'global scandal' of hunger|date=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact2025.org/about-compact2025/governance/leadership-council/|title=Leadership Council}}</ref> develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition|title=Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition |publisher=IFPRI}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAnother initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/about|title=SUN communication materials}}</ref>\n\n=== Poverty reduction in Taiwan ===\nIn spite of the intensive reduction [[Strategy|strategies]] deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Dennis|title=The University of Chicago Press Journals|journal=Rural Poverty and the Structure of Farm Household Income in Developing Countries: Evidence from Taiwan|volume=27|issue=2|pages=283\u2013301|jstor=1153441|year=1979|doi=10.1086/451093}}</ref> Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajamann|title=Poverty inequality and economic growth: Rural Punjab|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=11}}</ref> While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results  suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise.

In modern times, various economists within the [[Georgism]] movement propose measures like the [[land value tax]] to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[developed country|developed countries]]. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.\n\nPoverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little, while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce.<ref>\"Under traditional (i.e., non-industrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable.

According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"[[working poor]]\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].<ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth.

The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty. The authors concluded that further investments in the [[chickpea]] and other legume research in [[Ethiopia]] were therefore justified as a means of poverty alleviation.<ref>Macharia I, Orr A, Simtowe F and Asfaw, S., ''Potential economic and poverty impact of improved chickpea technologies in Ethiopia'' http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/chickpea/685/107.

With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.<ref>Mukherji, A.

One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity''].

Poverty activist [[Paul Polak]] has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \"radically\" affordable goods. In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=Out of Poverty|url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781605092768&PG=1&Type=BL&PCS=BKP}}</ref> Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency.

During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n==Aid==\n{{main|Aid}}\n\n===Welfare===\n{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}\nAid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money.

Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S.

The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Sol\u00f3rzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=49|issue=9|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4|pmid=10501641}}</ref>\n\nSome [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.<ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance.

Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size\u2014an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\n===Microloans===\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.<ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Empowering women==\n{{See also|Women's education and development}}\nThe [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]].

Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.<ref>Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. \"Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook\", pp. 1\u2013272.

These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\"<ref name=\"undp2000\">United Nations Development Report. 2000. ''Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000.'' New York: United Nations Publications.</ref> Despite the promise of such research several questions remain, such as where good governance comes from and how it can be achieved. The comparative analysis of one sociologist<ref name=\"kerbo\">{{cite book|last1=Kerbo|first1=Harold|title=World Poverty: The Roots of Global Inequality and the Modern World System|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780073042954}}</ref> suggests that broad historical forces have shaped the likelihood of good governance. Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.<ref name=\"kerbo\"/>\n\n==Other approaches==\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[W\u00f6rgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.<ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars are sold and redeemed in such a way that raise funds which are then given as grants to local charities, primarily ones oriented towards reducing poverty.<ref name=\"milestone\">[https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/347455 Barbara Turnbull, \"Milestone for the `Toronto Dollar'\", ''Toronto Star'', 22 Mar. 2008.]</ref> Toronto Dollars also provide a means to create an [[incentive]] for welfare recipients to work: Toronto dollars can be given as gifts to welfare recipients who perform volunteer work for charitable and non-profit organizations, and these gifts do not affect welfare benefits.<ref>[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 Mark Herpel, \"The Toronto Dollar: Community Alternative Dollar\", ''California Chronicle'', 18 Apr. 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716073246/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/58941 |date=16 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSome have argued for radical economic change in the system. There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented. Such proposals have been put forward by both left-wing and right-wing groups: socialism, communism, [[anarchism]], [[libertarianism]], [[binary economics]] and [[participatory economics]], among others.\n\nInequality can be reduced by [[progressive tax]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diversity.berkeley.edu/6-policies-to-reduce-economic-inequality|title=Six policies to reduce economic inequality|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn law, there has been a move to establish the absence of poverty as a [[human right]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/poverty/expert/docs/Thomas_Pogge_Summary.pdf|title=Poverty and Human Rights |author= Thomas Pogge|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/poverty|title=Poverty and Human Rights  |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=14 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe IMF and member countries have produced [[Poverty Reduction Strategy]] papers or PRSPs.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/external/np/prsp/prsp.asp Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP)]</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The End of Poverty'',<ref>[http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/endofpoverty/ ''The End of Poverty'']</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,1034738,00.html The End of Poverty] by JEFFREY D.

Following his recommendations, international organizations such as the Global Solidarity Network<ref>[http://www.globalsolidaritynetwork.org Global Solidarity Network]</ref> are working to help eradicate poverty worldwide with intervention in the areas of housing, food, education, basic health, agricultural inputs, safe drinking water, transportation and communications.\n\nThe [[Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign]] is an organization in the United States working to secure freedom from poverty for all by organizing the poor themselves. The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. \n\n===Climate change adaptation===\n{{main|Climate change and poverty}}\nThe increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue.  Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.<ref name=ODI2013>Andrew Shepherd, Tom Mitchell, Kirsty Lewis, Amanda Lenhardt, Lindsey Jones, Lucy Scott and Robert Muir-Wood (2013) [http://www.odi.org/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030 \"The geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030\"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref>\n\nIt is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries.  Most of these are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name=ODI2013/>\n\nA researcher at a leading global think-tank, the [[Overseas Development Institute]], suggests that far more effort should be done to better coordinate and integrate [[Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper|poverty reduction strategies]] with climate change adaptation.<ref name=ODI2009>Martin Prowse, Natasha Grist and Cheikh Sourang (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3290&title=climate-change-poverty-strategies \"Closing the gap between climate adaptation and poverty reduction frameworks\"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> The two issues are argued to be currently only dealt with in parallel as most poverty reduction strategy papers ignore [[climate change adaptation]] altogether, while National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) likewise do not deal directly with poverty reduction.

For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3\u201310 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\n===Millennium Development Goals ===\nEradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project \u2013 Publications}}</ref> proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].\n* Action against [[domestic violence]].\n* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.\n* Deworming school children in affected areas.\n* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].\n* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].\n* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].\n* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.\n* Legislation for [[women's rights]], including rights to property.\n* [[Planting trees]].\n* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.\n* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].\n* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].\n* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.\n* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].\n\n=== Sustainable Development Goals ===\nThe first of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:.

If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\n===Poverty targeting===\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Costs and benefits of poverty targeting|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/more-accurate-poverty-targeting-strategy-more-expensive-it|author=James G.

For instance, one common method of poverty targeting is 'means testing' that uses a certain income or expenditure threshold for an individual or the a household to be considered as poor and eligible for support.<ref>{{cite news |title=Six main methodologies|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/how-identify-poor-people-provision-support|author=James G.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAnother initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/about|title=SUN communication materials}}</ref>\n\n=== Poverty reduction in Taiwan ===\nIn spite of the intensive reduction [[Strategy|strategies]] deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Dennis|title=The University of Chicago Press Journals|journal=Rural Poverty and the Structure of Farm Household Income in Developing Countries: Evidence from Taiwan|volume=27|issue=2|pages=283\u2013301|jstor=1153441|year=1979|doi=10.1086/451093}}</ref> Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajamann|title=Poverty inequality and economic growth: Rural Punjab|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=11}}</ref> While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results  suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise.

{"title_page": "Dusk of Dawn", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:DuskOfDawn.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Harcourt Brace]])]]\n\n'''''Dusk of Dawn: An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept''''' is a 1940 [[autobiographical]] text by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] that examines his life and family history in the context of contemporaneous developments in [[race relations]].\n\nPreceded decades prior by the better-known ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' (1903), ''Dusk of Dawn'' focuses on Du&nbsp;Bois's relationship with [[Booker T. Washington]], his reasons for leaving the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], and a new concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. \n\nIn contrast to Washington's ''[[Up From Slavery]]'', a blend of [[slave narrative]] and [[autobiography]], ''Dusk of Dawn'' traces the genealogy of the race concept as it affected Du&nbsp;Bois's life. Du&nbsp;Bois elucidates his theoretical writing with personal experiences, and connects those experiences to the larger historical and social phenomena he identifies as central to the function and development of race in the United States. Reviewing the book in 1940, [[Metz P. Lochard]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', said \"[i]t is no mere autobiography in the conventional sense... [Du&nbsp;Bois] very adroitly utilizes his life experience as an axis from which he surveys the whole panorama of American civilization with its vice and virtue, its prejudice and philanthropy, its consistency and grace; and above all with its contradictory and conflicting interpretations of race, [[Christianity]] and [[Democracy|[d]emocracy]].\"<ref>Dubois new book points way out of segregation. (1940, Sep 21). ''The Chicago Defender'' (National Edition) (1921-1967), pp. 4-4. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/492620306</ref> \n\nDu&nbsp;Bois described the concept saying:\n<blockquote>\nThis was the race concept which has dominated my life, and the history of which I have attempted to make the leading theme of this book. It had as I have tried to show all sorts of illogical trends and irreconcilable tendencies. Perhaps it is wrong to speak of it at all as \"a concept\" rather than as a group of contradictory forces, facts and tendencies. At any rate I hope I have made its meaning to me clear.<ref>''W.E.B. Du Bois: Writings''. New York: Library of America, 1987; 651.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Chapters and major themes ==\n\nThe chapters of ''Dusk of Dawn'' can be divided thematically into three sections. The first four chapters focus on autobiographical information, contextualizing each anecdote in the relevant current events of its time. The next three chapters shift to a more ideological subject\u2014the concept of race. Du Bois uses these chapters to theorize on race as a psychological complex of irrational logics and habits which are perpetuated to support an economically exploitative society. The final two chapters return to autobiography, chronicling Du Bois's life and ideology from 1910 to 1940.\n\n=== Apology ===\n\n=== The Plot ===\n\n===  A New England boy and Reconstruction ===\n\n:Du Bois begins with his childhood in Great Barrington and recounts his experiences through his graduation from high school.\n\n=== Education in the Last Decades of the Nineteenth Century ===\n\n:Du Bois recounts his experiences at [[Fisk University]] and his studies in Germany. He notes that while he was thinking critically about race, his analysis was confined to \"the relation of my people to the world movement. I was not questioning the world movement in itself.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 27.</ref>\n\n=== Science and Empire ===\n\n:This chapter covers the years 1894\u20131910. During this period, Du Bois began teaching, attended the [[Niagara Movement]], and published ''[[The Crisis]]''. His thinking also shifted during this time. He became increasingly disillusioned with the ability of scientific evidence to transform racial bias. Instead, he began to think about racism as \"forces or ideologies [that] embraced more than our reasoned acts. They included physical, biological and psychological forces; habits, conventions and enactments.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 96.</ref>\n:\n\n=== The Concept of Race ===\n\n:Du Bois argues for the arbitrariness of race, pointing to the \"continuous change in the proofs and arguments advanced\" in discussions on race in which \"the basis of race distinction was changed without explanation, without apology.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 99.</ref> He also offers a detailed description of his family tree as he discusses themes of miscegenation, racial \"chauvinism\", and the role of Africa in black identity.\n\n=== The White World ===\n\n:In this chapter, he challenges the dominance of the white world, stating plainly that \"the democracy which the white world seeks to defend does not exist. It has been splendidly conceived and discussed, but not realized.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 169.</ref> Instead, the white world insists on \"group and racial exclusiveness,\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 137.</ref> creating a campaign of propaganda in which racist ideals are not mutually exclusive with democracy and Christian morality. In a conversation with a white character, Roger Van Dieman, Du Bois exposes the psychological and social paradox of racial inequality.\n\n=== The Colored World Within ===\n\n:\"The present question is: What is the colored world going to do about the current situations?\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 175.</ref>\n:Du Bois reflects on the status of African Americans, their exclusion from institutions, and the various social and political inequalities that are misread as natural inferiorities. With this in mind, he outlines an economic plan called \"the Negro co-operative movement\".<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 212.</ref>  This plan recognizes the power African Americans hold as consumers, and proposes that by utilizing the production capacities African Americans already have the African-American community can achieve a level of social and political autonomy unthinkable for the time.\n\n=== Propaganda and the World War ===\n\n:Du Bois discusses the major events that shaped his politics as outlined in chapter 7: his involvement with the NAACP, the impact of the World War on Black consciousness in the United States, the significance of the Great Migration, the development of his Pan-African awareness, and the seizure of Haiti by the United States.\n\n=== Revolution ===\n\n:In the concluding chapter, Du Bois reflects the influence of [[Marx]] on his thinking,<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 287.</ref> his many trips abroad, and his \"Basic American Negro Creed\"\u2014a manuscript of \"that economic program of the Negro which I believed should succeed.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 319-322.</ref> Du Bois also discusses his artistic endeavors, the ways he encouraged creative expression in the black community, and his emphasis on graphic arts. \"I sought to encourage the graphic arts not only by magazine covers with Negro themes and faces, but as often as I could afford, I portrayed the faces and features of colored folk.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 271.</ref> Having grown up in the nearly all-white [[Barrington, Massachusetts]], Du Bois experienced a cultural awakening in 1885 when he entered the historically black Fisk University as a sophomore.

[[Harcourt Brace]])]]\n\n'''''Dusk of Dawn: An Essay Toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept''''' is a 1940 [[autobiographical]] text by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] that examines his life and family history in the context of contemporaneous developments in [[race relations]].\n\nPreceded decades prior by the better-known ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' (1903), ''Dusk of Dawn'' focuses on Du&nbsp;Bois's relationship with [[Booker T. Washington]], his reasons for leaving the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], and a new concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. \n\nIn contrast to Washington's ''[[Up From Slavery]]'', a blend of [[slave narrative]] and [[autobiography]], ''Dusk of Dawn'' traces the genealogy of the race concept as it affected Du&nbsp;Bois's life. Du&nbsp;Bois elucidates his theoretical writing with personal experiences, and connects those experiences to the larger historical and social phenomena he identifies as central to the function and development of race in the United States. Reviewing the book in 1940, [[Metz P. Lochard]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', said \"[i]t is no mere autobiography in the conventional sense... [Du&nbsp;Bois] very adroitly utilizes his life experience as an axis from which he surveys the whole panorama of American civilization with its vice and virtue, its prejudice and philanthropy, its consistency and grace; and above all with its contradictory and conflicting interpretations of race, [[Christianity]] and [[Democracy|[d]emocracy]].\"<ref>Dubois new book points way out of segregation. (1940, Sep 21). ''The Chicago Defender'' (National Edition) (1921-1967), pp. 4-4. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/492620306</ref> \n\nDu&nbsp;Bois described the concept saying:\n<blockquote>\nThis was the race concept which has dominated my life, and the history of which I have attempted to make the leading theme of this book. It had as I have tried to show all sorts of illogical trends and irreconcilable tendencies. Perhaps it is wrong to speak of it at all as \"a concept\" rather than as a group of contradictory forces, facts and tendencies. At any rate I hope I have made its meaning to me clear.<ref>''W.E.B. Du Bois: Writings''. New York: Library of America, 1987; 651.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Chapters and major themes ==\n\nThe chapters of ''Dusk of Dawn'' can be divided thematically into three sections. The first four chapters focus on autobiographical information, contextualizing each anecdote in the relevant current events of its time. The next three chapters shift to a more ideological subject\u2014the concept of race. Du Bois uses these chapters to theorize on race as a psychological complex of irrational logics and habits which are perpetuated to support an economically exploitative society. The final two chapters return to autobiography, chronicling Du Bois's life and ideology from 1910 to 1940.\n\n=== Apology ===\n\n=== The Plot ===\n\n===  A New England boy and Reconstruction ===\n\n:Du Bois begins with his childhood in Great Barrington and recounts his experiences through his graduation from high school.\n\n=== Education in the Last Decades of the Nineteenth Century ===\n\n:Du Bois recounts his experiences at [[Fisk University]] and his studies in Germany. He notes that while he was thinking critically about race, his analysis was confined to \"the relation of my people to the world movement. I was not questioning the world movement in itself.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn; an Essay toward an Autobiography of a Race Concept'', 27.</ref>\n\n=== Science and Empire ===\n\n:This chapter covers the years 1894\u20131910. During this period, Du Bois began teaching, attended the [[Niagara Movement]], and published ''[[The Crisis]]''. His thinking also shifted during this time. He became increasingly disillusioned with the ability of scientific evidence to transform racial bias. Instead, he began to think about racism as \"forces or ideologies [that] embraced more than our reasoned acts. They included physical, biological and psychological forces; habits, conventions and enactments.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 96.</ref>\n:\n\n=== The Concept of Race ===\n\n:Du Bois argues for the arbitrariness of race, pointing to the \"continuous change in the proofs and arguments advanced\" in discussions on race in which \"the basis of race distinction was changed without explanation, without apology.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 99.</ref> He also offers a detailed description of his family tree as he discusses themes of miscegenation, racial \"chauvinism\", and the role of Africa in black identity.\n\n=== The White World ===\n\n:In this chapter, he challenges the dominance of the white world, stating plainly that \"the democracy which the white world seeks to defend does not exist. It has been splendidly conceived and discussed, but not realized.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 169.</ref> Instead, the white world insists on \"group and racial exclusiveness,\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 137.</ref> creating a campaign of propaganda in which racist ideals are not mutually exclusive with democracy and Christian morality. In a conversation with a white character, Roger Van Dieman, Du Bois exposes the psychological and social paradox of racial inequality.\n\n=== The Colored World Within ===\n\n:\"The present question is: What is the colored world going to do about the current situations?\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 175.</ref>\n:Du Bois reflects on the status of African Americans, their exclusion from institutions, and the various social and political inequalities that are misread as natural inferiorities. With this in mind, he outlines an economic plan called \"the Negro co-operative movement\".<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 212.</ref>  This plan recognizes the power African Americans hold as consumers, and proposes that by utilizing the production capacities African Americans already have the African-American community can achieve a level of social and political autonomy unthinkable for the time.\n\n=== Propaganda and the World War ===\n\n:Du Bois discusses the major events that shaped his politics as outlined in chapter 7: his involvement with the NAACP, the impact of the World War on Black consciousness in the United States, the significance of the Great Migration, the development of his Pan-African awareness, and the seizure of Haiti by the United States.\n\n=== Revolution ===\n\n:In the concluding chapter, Du Bois reflects the influence of [[Marx]] on his thinking,<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 287.</ref> his many trips abroad, and his \"Basic American Negro Creed\"\u2014a manuscript of \"that economic program of the Negro which I believed should succeed.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 319-322.</ref> Du Bois also discusses his artistic endeavors, the ways he encouraged creative expression in the black community, and his emphasis on graphic arts. \"I sought to encourage the graphic arts not only by magazine covers with Negro themes and faces, but as often as I could afford, I portrayed the faces and features of colored folk.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 271.</ref> Having grown up in the nearly all-white [[Barrington, Massachusetts]], Du Bois experienced a cultural awakening in 1885 when he entered the historically black Fisk University as a sophomore.  He writes that at Fisk he realized he had not been taught anything positive about black people.  He becomes enamored with their various shades of skin tone. \"From my childhood I have been impressed with the beauty of Negro skin-color and astonished at the blindness of whites who cannot see it.\"<ref>Du Bois, ''Dusk of Dawn'', 272.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{W.
