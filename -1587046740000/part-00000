SISG is controlled by the provincial government of [[Shandong]]. SISG was formed in March 2008 when the provincial government of [[Shandong]] merged two state-owned steel producers.\n\n==History==\n\nThe State-owned Shandong Iron and Steel Group Co Ltd was created out of the restructuring of '''Jinan Iron and Steel Group Co''' and '''Laiwu Steel Group Corp''' \u2013 the sixth- and seventh-largest steel makers in the country \u2013 and '''Shandong Metallurgical Industry Corp.'''

In 2007, Jinan produced 12.12&nbsp;million tons of crude steel and Laiwu turned out 11.7&nbsp;million tons.\n\nLuo Bingsheng, vice chairman of the [[China Iron and Steel Association]], said that link-ups and restructuring of the steel industry had become a global trend and the new Shandong-based steel group would play an active role in the international competitiveness of the country's steel industry.\n\n===Jinan===\n\nJinan Iron & Steel Company Ltd. was a company principally engaged in smelting, processing and sale of steel products. Jinan Iron & Steel provided steel products, including hot rolled ribbed steel bars, hull structure steel plates, thick steel plates, wide and heavy steel plates, deformed steel bars, steel profiles, steel billets, cold and hot rolled steel products, as well as coking products, among others. Jinan Iron & Steel was also involved in sale of dangerous chemical goods, distribution of coal gas, steel smelting technology consulting services, as well as marketing of iron ores and other ores.\n\n===Laiwu===\n\nLaiwu Steel Corporation was principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of pig iron, steel billets, steel ingots, steel products, coke and granulating slag and the supply of electricity and heat. During the year of 2008, Laiwu Steel Corp produced approximately 4.69&nbsp;million metric tons of pig iron, 5.13&nbsp;million metric tons of steel and 6.29&nbsp;million metric tons of steel products. Laiwu Steel Corp distributed its products domestically and to overseas markets with eastern China as its major market. As of December 31, 2008, Laiwu Steel Corp had eight major subsidiaries and three associates.\n\n===Rizhao merger===\nAccording to [[China Securities Journal]], SISG signed an agreement to take a 67% stake in Rizhao Iron and Steel. On September 6, 2009, Shandong Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd. and Rizhao Steel Holding Group Co., Ltd. signed agreement on asset restructuring and cooperation, which marked the former's success in the reorganization. According to the agreement, both sides jointly reorganized the assets to the JV by means of a capital injection. SISG owns 67% stakes by cash, and Rizhao Steel holds 33% stock with net assets. Additionally, the agreement made clear the restructuring principles, means, the scope of assets, the evaluation of restructuring assets, the work processes, as well as staff placement. After signing the agreement, both sides will immediately start all evaluation works.

Because of its existence as a percussion-heavy, primarily live music, it was closer to jazz than any other dance style, but its focus on maintaining a groove allied it with funk, hip-hop, and dance music.<ref name=AllmusicAcidJazz>[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/acid-jazz-ma0000002414 \"Acid Jazz\"], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 6 January 2014.</ref> The style is characterized by danceable grooves and long, repetitive compositions.

Some cite ''\"Six Pack\"'' and ''\"Soul Fiesta\"'' by The Apostles (1969) as acid jazz records during the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/The-Apostles-Six-Pack-Soul-Fiesta/release/2172103]</ref>\n\n===Origins in the United Kingdom===\nAcid jazz became popular in the London club scene of the mid-1980s, with DJs of the [[rare groove]] movement, who played obscure jazz records. Their main interests were in the fringe of [[jazz fusion]], [[jazz funk]], and with lesser input from [[soul jazz]] of the 1950s and 1960s. Particularly significant were records from the [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] catalogue.<ref name=Bush2001/>\n\n[[File:The Brand New Heavies By Daniel \u00c5hs Karlsson.jpg|thumb|[[Brand New Heavies]] shown in 2013]]\nThese DJs included Gilles Peterson, who had residencies at several London clubs in the 1980s, began in his own small [[pirate radio]] station and then moved to the much larger [[Kiss (UK radio station)|Kiss-FM]]. In 1988 with producer [[Eddie Piller]] he formed the label [[Acid Jazz Records]].

football|football]] club based in [[Almelo]], founded in 1903. The club has won the Dutch national title twice, in 1927 and 1941.\n\nIn the 2004\u201305 season, Heracles won the title in the [[Eerste Divisie]], so that during the 2005\u201306 season, Heracles played in the [[Eredivisie]], where they finished 13th. The average attendance in 2004\u201305 was 5,700 people. In the recent top flight seasons, this has risen to just over 13,500. Their main rival is [[FC Twente]].\n\nIn 2012 Heracles competed in its first Dutch cup final, which it lost to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in the Rotterdam Stadium [[De Kuip]].\n\n==Stadium==\nHeracles Almelo currently play at the [[Erve Asito]] in [[Almelo]]. The [[Erve Asito]] was built in 1999 with a capacity 6,900, this was expanded in 2005 to hold 8,500. The pitch at the [[Erve Asito]] is [[artificial turf]].\nAfter renovation of the stadium at the beginning of season 2015\u201316 it holds 13.500 supporters.\n\n== History ==\nThe club was founded on 3 May 1903 as [[Heracles]], after the demigod son of [[Zeus]]. They changed their name on 1 July 1974 to SC Heracles '74 and finally settled on the current name in 1998.\n\nIn the 2015/16 season, Heracles finished sixth in the Eredivisie, so the club could participate in the playoffs for European football. The club first defeated [[FC Groningen]] and then [[FC Utrecht]]. Heracles thus qualified for the first time in club history for European football, in the third qualifying round of the [[2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League]].<ref>{{cite

Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.\n\nThe effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}</ref>\n\n'''Moral mandate'''\n\n===Social health===\n{{expand section|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Spiritual health===\n'''Spiritual Health''' is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe preamble to Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO)  adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 1946 and signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States<ref>Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (12)</ref> defined health as a state of \"physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\"<ref>Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19\u201322 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.</ref> and it has not been amended.\n\nHowever, in 1983 twenty-two WHO member countries from the Eastern Mediterranean Region proposed a draft resolution to this preamble to include reference to spiritual health, such that it would redefine health as a state of \"physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".<ref>Review of the Constitution of the World Health Organization: Report of the Executive Board Special Group. 101st Session.

A religious community can provide support especially through a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people.\n\nThe existence of \u2018religious struggle\u2019 in elderly patients was predictive of greater risk of mortality in a study by Pargament et al.

Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.\n\nThe effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}</ref>\n\n'''Moral mandate'''\n\n===Social health===\n{{expand section|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Spiritual health===\n'''Spiritual Health''' is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe preamble to Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO)  adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 1946 and signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States<ref>Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (12)</ref> defined health as a state of \"physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\"<ref>Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19\u201322 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.</ref> and it has not been amended.\n\nHowever, in 1983 twenty-two WHO member countries from the Eastern Mediterranean Region proposed a draft resolution to this preamble to include reference to spiritual health, such that it would redefine health as a state of \"physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\".<ref>Review of the Constitution of the World Health Organization: Report of the Executive Board Special Group. 101st Session.

Ennobling ideas have given rise to health ideals, which have led to a practical strategy for Health for All that aims at attaining a goal that has both a material and non-material component. If the material component of the strategy can be provided to people, the non-material or spiritual one is something that has to arise within people and communities in keeping with their social and cultural patterns.

In addition to their distinctive position on civil rights, derived from said theory of revolutionary integrationism, the tendency also took a position that was more sympathetic to China than was the norm in the SWP, in part this being due to the alliance between the Kirk-Kaye tendency and the loser tendency of Arne Swabeck and Frank Glass.\n\nPolitical differences, as articulated by the soon-to-become FSP, included what was characterized as the SWP's uncritical support of the black nationalist views of [[Malcolm X]], SWP's orientation toward the [[labor aristocracy]], its opportunism in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], and its dismissive attitude toward the emerging [[feminist movement]]. The nascent FSP advocated the [[social class|class]] [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] of [[African-American|black]] and [[White people|white]] workers, called for a greatly expanded understanding of and attention to [[socialist feminism|women's emancipation]], and urged the [[anti-war]] movement to support the socialist, [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] aims of the [[August Revolution|Vietnamese Revolution]].\n\nThe FSP became a pole of attraction for Seattle leftists opposed to the SWP's internal politics and established a home at Freeway Hall.<ref name=Crowley>{{cite book |last=Crowley|first=Walt|title=Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Winslow|first=Barbara|title=The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices from Women's Liberation|year=2007|pages=227, 230\u2013231, 235\u2013236|chapter=Primary and Secondary Contradictions in Seattle: 1967-1969|editor=Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Ann Barr Snitow}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Ian|title=Rebels, Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History|year=2005|publisher=Between the Lines|page=242}}</ref>  The party formed [[Radical Women]] with the dual goal of building a revolutionary socialist feminist organization and teaching women the organizational and leadership skills they were often denied in male-dominated organizations.<ref name=NotableWomen>{{cite book |last=James|first=Edward T., Janet Wilson James, Paul S.

In addition to their distinctive position on civil rights, derived from the theory of revolutionary integrationism, the tendency also took a position that was more sympathetic to China than was the norm in the SWP, in part this being due to the alliance between the Kirk-Kaye tendency and the loser tendency of Arne Swabeck and Frank Glass.\n\nPolitical differences, as articulated by the soon-to-become FSP, included what was characterized as the SWP's uncritical support of the black nationalist views of [[Malcolm X]], SWP's orientation toward the [[labor aristocracy]], its opportunism in the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], and its dismissive attitude toward the emerging [[feminist movement]]. The nascent FSP advocated the [[social class|class]] [[Solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] of [[African-American|black]] and [[White people|white]] workers, called for a greatly expanded understanding of and attention to [[socialist feminism|women's emancipation]], and urged the [[anti-war]] movement to support the socialist, [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] aims of the [[August Revolution|Vietnamese Revolution]].\n\nThe FSP became a pole of attraction for Seattle leftists opposed to the SWP's internal politics and established a home at Freeway Hall.<ref name=Crowley>{{cite book |last=Crowley|first=Walt|title=Rites of Passage: A Memoir of the Sixties in Seattle|year=2010|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Winslow|first=Barbara|title=The Feminist Memoir Project: Voices from Women's Liberation|year=2007|pages=227, 230\u2013231, 235\u2013236|chapter=Primary and Secondary Contradictions in Seattle: 1967-1969|editor=Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Ann Barr Snitow}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=McKay|first=Ian|title=Rebels, Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History|year=2005|publisher=Between the Lines|page=242}}</ref>  The party formed [[Radical Women]] with the dual goal of building a revolutionary socialist feminist organization and teaching women the organizational and leadership skills they were often denied in male-dominated organizations.<ref name=NotableWomen>{{cite book |last=James|first=Edward T., Janet Wilson James, Paul S.
