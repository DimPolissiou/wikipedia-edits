Hurst also chose the site of the university, which at the time was the rural periphery of the District. After more than three decades devoted principally to securing financial support, the university was officially dedicated on May 15, 1914, with its first instructions beginning October of that year, when 28 students were enrolled, 19 of whom were graduates and the remainder special students not candidates for a degree. The First Commencement, at which no degrees were awarded, was held on June 2, 1915. The Second Annual Commencement was held the following year and saw the awarding of the first degrees: one master's degree and two doctor's degrees. AU admitted both women and African Americans, which was uncommon in higher education at the time. Among its first 28 students were five women, while an African American doctoral student was admitted in 1915.\n\n[[File:AU McKineyHall ACC.jpeg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Army Chemical Corps]]\nShortly after these early commencement ceremonies, classes were interrupted by war. During [[World War I]], the university allowed the U.S. military to use some of its grounds for testing. In 1917, the U.S. military divided American University into two segments, [[Camp American University]] and [[Camp Leach]]. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program and the site of chemical weapons testing;<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Chemical Warfare: From the European Battlefield to the American Laboratory|journal=Distillations|date=Spring 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16\u201323|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemical-warfare-from-the-european-battlefield-to-the-american-laboratory|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref> this required a major cleanup effort in the 1990s. Camp Leach was home to advanced research, development, and testing of modern camouflage techniques. {{As of|2014}}, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] was still removing ordnance including [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]].\n\nInstruction was first offered only at the graduate level, in accordance with the plan of the founders. This changed in 1925 with the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts (subsequently named the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]), which offered the first undergraduate degrees and programs. What is now the [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]] was founded in 1934,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spa.american.edu/pages.php?ID=12 |title=The School of Public Affairs at American University |publisher=Spa.american.edu |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> partly to educate future federal employees in new approaches to [[public administration]] introduced by the [[New Deal]]; during the event commemorating its launch, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] stressed cooperation between the school and his administration.\n\nAU's relationship to the U.S. government continued during [[World War II]], when the campus hosted the U.S. Navy Bomb Disposal School and a [[United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve)|WAVE]] barracks. For AU's role in these wartime efforts, the [[Victory ship]] [[SS American Victory|SS ''American Victory'']] was named in its honor.\n\n===1949\u20131990===\n[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|President [[John F.

In 1947, the Washington Semester Program was established, pioneering the concept of \nsemester-long internships in the nation's capital. In 1949, the university merged with the [[Washington College of Law]], which had begun in 1896 as the first law school founded by women and the first coeducational institution for the professional study of law in the District. Shortly thereafter, three departments were reorganized as schools: the School of Business Administration in 1955 (subsequently named the Robert P. and Arlene R. Kogod College of Business Administration and in 1999 renamed the [[Kogod School of Business]]); the School of Government and Public Administration in 1957; and the [[School of International Service]] in 1958.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operated the [[Federally funded research and development centers|FFRDC]] [[Project Camelot|Special Operations Research Office]] as a think tank at American University. The government abandoned the think tank after its research was criticized as imperialistic by the general public.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} AU's political involvement was furthered by President [[John F.

The Lucy Webb Hayes School of Nursing provided undergraduate study in Nursing from 1965 until 1988. In 1972, the School of Government and Public Administration, the School of International Service, the Center for Technology and Administration, and the Center for the Administration of Justice (subsequently named the School of Justice) were incorporated into the College of Public and International Affairs.\n\nThe university bought the Immaculata Campus in 1986 to alleviate space problems. This would later become Tenley Campus.\n\nIn 1986, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation Center began. Financed with $5 million from and named for Saudi Arabian Trustee [[Adnan Khashoggi]], the building was intended to update athletics facilities and provide a new arena, as well as a parking garage and office space for administrative services. Costing an estimated $19 million, the building represented the largest construction project to date, but met protest by both faculty and students to the university's use of Khashoggi's name on the building due to his involvement in international arms trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/01/11/american-u-donation-stirs-debate/a8487a86-1788-4a79-ab8f-16e02c03df43/ |title=AMERICAN U.

That same year, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center completed while the [[Iran\u2013Contra affair|Iran\u2013Contra Affair]] controversy was at its height although his name remained on the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation in the mid to late 1990s.\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n[[File:Tenleytown aerial 2019.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the American University campus, with [[Tenleytown]] in the background, in 2019]]\n\nThe [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]] became independent from the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] in 1993.\n\nIn 1997, [[American University of Sharjah]], the only coeducational, liberal arts university in the [[United Arab Emirates]], signed a two-year contract with AU to provide academic management, a contract which has since been extended multiple times through August 2009.

In October 2012, the library acquired a large poster printer which researchers may use for presentations and other academic purposes.\n\nThe Library's Archives and Special Collections houses unique and rare materials and information on the history of the institution. The University Archives is the repository for papers and other documents, including sound recordings and photographs, spanning more than a century of the university's history. Special Collections houses rare materials. Among the more important holdings are the [[Artemas Martin]] collection of mathematical texts, the Charles Nelson Spinks collection of artistic and historical works of Japan, the Irwin M. Heine collection of literary works, and Christopher Johnson collection of William Faulkner books. Playbills form a significant set of the collections with the James Carroll and Iris Lipkowitz collections most notable among them.

The mission is described as \u201cbuilding a community for women of the African Diaspora at American University.\u201d Black Girls Vote is \"dedicated to the engagement, education, and empowerment of collegiate women through the electoral process.\"\n\nAmerican University's institutional feminist organizations include the Women and Politics Institute in the School of Public Affairs. The institute announces its mission on their website as \"to close the gender gap in political leadership and provide young women with academic and practical training that encourages them to become involved in the political process and facilitates research by faculty and students that enhances their understanding of the challenges and opportunities women face in the political arena.\" The department of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) within the College of Arts and Sciences is \"an interdisciplinary program encompassing feminist studies, masculinity studies, and sexuality studies. The program is committed to a multicultural curriculum that sustains and integrates diverse perspectives.\" Students who major or minor in WGSS gain experience off-campus in the nation's capital through an internship placement in an organization or agency whose mission embraces some aspect of women's/gender/sexuality studies. WGSS has both undergraduate programs and graduate programs which empower feminist philosophy at the university.\n\nAmerican University's discrimination and sexual harassment policy regarding Title IX rights is \"to prohibit sex- or gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual violence, relationship violence, and stalking. American University is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive environment for all students and employees. American University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), age, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, personal appearance, gender identity and expression, family responsibilities, political affiliation, source of income, veteran status, an individual's genetic information or any other bases under federal or local laws (collectively \"Protected Bases\") in its programs and activities.\"  Although the policy of American University and the federal civil rights law is strict, The Office of Advocacy Services for Interpersonal and Sexual Violence (OASIS) \"provides free and confidential victim advocacy services for American University students who are impacted by all forms of sexual violence either directly or indirectly.\"  The Center for Diversity and Inclusion (CDI) is dedicated to enhancing LGBTQ, multicultural, first generation, and women's experiences on campus.\n\nIn addition to these feminist activities and facilities on AU's campus, AU is home to several women suffragist alumni such as [[Alice Paul]], one of the main leaders and strategists of the suffrage campaign. In 1896, The Washington College of Law was founded for women. In 1915, 5 of AU's first 28 students were women.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Religious life===\nWhile American University is affiliated with the United Methodist Church, it also has many organizations that serve students of other religions.

In 1981, WAVE-TV was formally recognized by the AU Student Confederation, and began full operation as a campus wide closed circuit television station, which broadcast three nights a week. WAVE-TV was funded by the Student Confederation and by local advertisers.\n\nIn 1989, WAVE-TV was renamed to American Television (A-TV2, later shortened to ATV). Over the course of the 1990s, ATV became available to televisions in student residence hall rooms, and significantly expanded its programming. In 1996, ATV was recognized by the Society of Professional Journalists, receiving the Mark of Excellence award in sports reporting and overall newscast.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, ATV filmed most of its shows in the SOC Media Production Center. Following AU's renovation of the Mary Graydon Center in 2002, ATV moved into a new dedicated studio and office space on MGC's second floor, outfitted with cameras and equipment donated to the station by AU alumni Norman and Mary Klotz ('76, '79). Shortly after the move, ATV began broadcasting its programs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the first time.\n\nATV launched its first dedicated website in 2007, and launched an online live-stream simulcast of its on-campus broadcast in 2009, expanding the reach of the station's programming beyond an on-campus student audience for the first time. Most of ATV's viewers are now online.\n\nIn 2011, ATV launched an innovative new rebranding campaign, along with a new logo and station imaging, bringing greater campus visibility to ATV's programming and participation opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auatv.com/page/about|title=ATV|website=Auatv.com|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Programming===\n\n''ATV News'' provides the latest news both around campus and around the Washington, D.

Hurst also chose the site of the university, which at the time was the rural periphery of the District. After more than three decades devoted principally to securing financial support, the university was officially dedicated on May 15, 1914, with its first instructions beginning October of that year, when 28 students were enrolled, 19 of whom were graduates and the remainder special students not candidates for a degree. The First Commencement, at which no degrees were awarded, was held on June 2, 1915. The Second Annual Commencement was held the following year and saw the awarding of the first degrees: one master's degree and two doctor's degrees. AU admitted both women and African Americans, which was uncommon in higher education at the time. Among its first 28 students were five women, while an African American doctoral student was admitted in 1915.\n\n[[File:AU McKineyHall ACC.jpeg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Army Chemical Corps]]\nShortly after these early commencement ceremonies, classes were interrupted by war. During [[World War I]], the university allowed the U.S. military to use some of its grounds for testing. In 1917, the U.S. military divided American University into two segments, [[Camp American University]] and [[Camp Leach]]. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program and the site of chemical weapons testing;<ref name=\"Gross\">{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Chemical Warfare: From the European Battlefield to the American Laboratory|journal=Distillations|date=Spring 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16\u201323|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemical-warfare-from-the-european-battlefield-to-the-american-laboratory|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref> this required a major cleanup effort in the 1990s. Camp Leach was home to advanced research, development, and testing of modern camouflage techniques. {{As of|2014}}, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] was still removing ordnance including [[Sulfur mustard|mustard gas]] and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar shells]].\n\nInstruction was first offered only at the graduate level, in accordance with the plan of the founders. This changed in 1925 with the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts (subsequently named the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]), which offered the first undergraduate degrees and programs. What is now the [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]] was founded in 1934,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spa.american.edu/pages.php?ID=12 |title=The School of Public Affairs at American University |publisher=Spa.american.edu |date= |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref> partly to educate future federal employees in new approaches to [[public administration]] introduced by the [[New Deal]]; during the event commemorating its launch, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] stressed cooperation between the school and his administration.\n\nAU's relationship to the U.S. government continued during [[World War II]], when the campus hosted the U.S. Navy Bomb Disposal School and a [[United States Naval Reserve (Women's Reserve)|WAVE]] barracks. For AU's role in these wartime efforts, the [[Victory ship]] [[SS American Victory|SS ''American Victory'']] was named in its honor.\n\n===1949\u20131990===\n[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|President [[John F.

In 1947, the Washington Semester Program was established, pioneering the concept of \nsemester-long internships in the nation's capital. In 1949, the university merged with the [[Washington College of Law]], which had begun in 1896 as the first law school founded by women and the first coeducational institution for the professional study of law in the District. Shortly thereafter, three departments were reorganized as schools: the School of Business Administration in 1955 (subsequently named the Robert P. and Arlene R. Kogod College of Business Administration and in 1999 renamed the [[Kogod School of Business]]); the School of Government and Public Administration in 1957; and the [[School of International Service]] in 1958.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operated the [[Federally funded research and development centers|FFRDC]] [[Project Camelot|Special Operations Research Office]] as a think tank at American University.

The Lucy Webb Hayes School of Nursing provided undergraduate study in Nursing from 1965 until 1988. In 1972, the School of Government and Public Administration, the School of International Service, the Center for Technology and Administration, and the Center for the Administration of Justice (subsequently named the School of Justice) were incorporated into the College of Public and International Affairs.\n\nThe university bought the Immaculata Campus in 1986 to alleviate space problems. This would later become Tenley Campus.\n\nIn 1986, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation Center began. Financed with $5 million from and named for Saudi Arabian Trustee [[Adnan Khashoggi]], the building was intended to update athletics facilities and provide a new arena, as well as a parking garage and office space for administrative services. Costing an estimated $19 million, the building represented the largest construction project to date, but met protest by both faculty and students to the university's use of Khashoggi's name on the building due to his involvement in international arms trade.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/01/11/american-u-donation-stirs-debate/a8487a86-1788-4a79-ab8f-16e02c03df43/ |title=AMERICAN U.

Tenley Campus used to be home to the Washington Semester and Washington Mentorship Program students, which featured housing primarily for international and transfer students. Before construction of the new Washington College of Law, Tenley Campus was home to the main offices of: the [[School of Professional & Extended Studies]], including the Washington Semester Program, University Marketing and Publications, and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. During the summer, the residence halls were used to house students in the Washington Semester - Summer Internship Program.\n\nSince 2016, Tenley Campus has been home to American University's law school, the [[Washington College of Law]]. Over the course of several years, former dormitory halls and academic buildings were torn down and replaced with a number of newer, more contemporary academic buildings that now house the Washington College of Law. Ironically, the law school's reputation has fallen sharply since construction began on the new campus. Graduates are reportedly saddled with enormous amounts of debt, and in 2014 only 42% of graduates held jobs that required they pass the Bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/city-desk/blog/13068976/why-did-american-universitys-law-school-plunge-in-the-rankings|title=Why Did American University's Law School Plunge in the Rankings?|website=Washingtoncitypaper.com|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Recent building expansions===\n'''Spring 2014:'''\n* Renovation of McKinley Hall into a new home for the [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Mckinley Renovation update|url=http://www.american.edu/buildingAU/mckinleyupdate.cfm|publisher=American University|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n'''2013-Winter 2016:'''\n* Demolition of outdated buildings and dormitories on Tenley Campus and construction of new buildings to house the [[Washington College of Law]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tenley Campus, Building Opportunity|url=http://www.american.edu/buildingAU/upload/WCL-Fact-Sheet-12-22-15.pdf|publisher=American University|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}</ref>\n'''Summer 2014-Summer 2017:'''\n* Construction of new East Campus development across Nebraska Avenue, composed of three residence halls and two connected academic buildings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.american.edu/buildingAU/eastoverview.cfm|title=East Campus Overview|publisher=American University|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Winter 2018-Spring 2020:'''\n\n* Renovation of water pipes across campus.

About 160 public computer workstations are available throughout the Bender building and researchers also may borrow laptops, chargers, tablets, and other electronic devices. In October 2012, the library acquired a large poster printer which researchers may use for presentations and other academic purposes.\n\nThe Library's Archives and Special Collections houses unique and rare materials and information on the history of the institution. The University Archives is the repository for papers and other documents, including sound recordings and photographs, spanning more than a century of the university's history. Special Collections houses rare materials. Among the more important holdings are the [[Artemas Martin]] collection of mathematical texts, the Charles Nelson Spinks collection of artistic and historical works of Japan, the Irwin M.

The institute announces its mission on their website as \"to close the gender gap in political leadership and provide young women with academic and practical training that encourages them to become involved in the political process and facilitates research by faculty and students that enhances their understanding of the challenges and opportunities women face in the political arena.\" The department of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) within the College of Arts and Sciences is \"an interdisciplinary program encompassing feminist studies, masculinity studies, and sexuality studies. The program is committed to a multicultural curriculum that sustains and integrates diverse perspectives.\" Students who major or minor in WGSS gain experience off-campus in the nation's capital through an internship placement in an organization or agency whose mission embraces some aspect of women's/gender/sexuality studies. WGSS has both undergraduate programs and graduate programs which empower feminist philosophy at the university.\n\nAmerican University's discrimination and sexual harassment policy regarding Title IX rights is \"to prohibit sex- or gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual violence, relationship violence, and stalking.

In 1981, WAVE-TV was formally recognized by the AU Student Confederation, and began full operation as a campus wide closed circuit television station, which broadcast three nights a week. WAVE-TV was funded by the Student Confederation and by local advertisers.\n\nIn 1989, WAVE-TV was renamed to American Television (A-TV2, later shortened to ATV). Over the course of the 1990s, ATV became available to televisions in student residence hall rooms, and significantly expanded its programming. In 1996, ATV was recognized by the Society of Professional Journalists, receiving the Mark of Excellence award in sports reporting and overall newscast.\n\nUntil the early 2000s, ATV filmed most of its shows in the SOC Media Production Center. Following AU's renovation of the Mary Graydon Center in 2002, ATV moved into a new dedicated studio and office space on MGC's second floor, outfitted with cameras and equipment donated to the station by AU alumni Norman and Mary Klotz ('76, '79). Shortly after the move, ATV began broadcasting its programs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the first time.\n\nATV launched its first dedicated website in 2007, and launched an online live-stream simulcast of its on-campus broadcast in 2009, expanding the reach of the station's programming beyond an on-campus student audience for the first time. Most of ATV's viewers are now online.\n\nIn 2011, ATV launched an innovative new rebranding campaign, along with a new logo and station imaging, bringing greater campus visibility to ATV's programming and participation opportunities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auatv.com/page/about|title=ATV|website=Auatv.com|accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Programming===\n\n''ATV News'' provides the latest news both around campus and around the Washington, D.

The meme is a type of [[bait and switch]] using a disguised [[hyperlink]] that leads to the music video. The victims, believing that they are accessing some unrelated material, are said to have been \"rickrolled\". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places.\n\nThe meme grew out from a similar bait-and-switch trick called \"duckrolling\" that was popular on the [[4chan]] website in 2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by the 2007 April Fools' Day, and spread to other Internet sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when [[YouTube]] used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event.\n\nInitially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a ten-year hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career, but accepted the fame when he himself rickrolled the 2008 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Astley has seen his performance career revitalized by the meme's popularity.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n\"Never Gonna Give You Up\" appeared on Astley's 1987 debut album ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r941|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Whenever You Need Somebody'' review |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Henderson |first=Alex |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The song, his solo debut single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]], and the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Sometime in 2006, the site moderator, [[Christopher Poole|Christopher \"m00t\" Poole]] implemented a word filter replacing the word \"egg\" with \"duck\" as a gag. On one thread, where \"eggroll\" had become \"duckroll\", an anonymous user posted an [[photo manipulation|edited]] image of a duck with wheels, calling it a \"duckroll\". The image caught on across 4chan; the image would be the target of a [[hyperlink]] with an otherwise interesting title, with a user clicking through having been said to be \"duckrolled\".<ref name=\"hoaxonwheels\">{{cite news |work=Fox News Channel |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=22 April 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream |accessdate=22 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501165153/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |archivedate=2008-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, the first trailer for the highly-anticipated ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' was released onto [[Rockstar Games]] website. Viewership was so high that it crashed Rockstar's site. Several users helped to post mirrors of the video on different sites, but one user on 4chan had linked to the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" video claiming to be the trailer, tricking numerous readers into the bait-and-switch. This practice quickly replaced duckrolling for other alluring links, all generally pointing to Astley's video, and thus creating the practice of \"rickrolling\".<ref name=\"hoaxonwheels\"/> The bait-and-switch to the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" greatly expanded on 4chan on [[April Fools' Day]] in 2007, and led to the trick expanding to other sites like [[Fark]] and [[Digg]] later that year, quickly gaining the name \"rickrolling\" based on the prior \"duckrolling\".<ref name=\"hoaxonwheels\"/>\n\nAn initial use of \"rickrolling\" was confirmed by the editors of ''[[Know Your Meme]]'', where rural Michigan resident Erik Helwig had called into a local radio sports-talk show in 2006 and instead of conversing with the DJs, simply played \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", leaving the DJs speechless. While this occurred before the 4chan use, ''Know Your Meme'' editor-in-chief Don Caldwell said there was no direct confirmation if it had inspired the 4chan use of the video.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-rickrolling |title = An Oral History of Rickrolling | date = January 10, 2020 | accessdate = February 18, 2020 | work = [[Mel Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n===Growth in 2008===\n[[File:Rick Astley impersonator rickrolling a basketball game.png|thumb|right|A Rick Astley impersonator during one of the March 2008 rickrolls at a collegiate basketball game]] \nRickrolling started to appear in more mainstream sources during 2008, with an [[SurveyUSA]] April 2008 poll estimating that at least 18 million American adults had been rickrolled.<ref name=\"SurveyUSA\">{{cite web |work= SurveyUSA |date=9 April 2008 |title=You Wouldn't Get This From Any Other Pollster |url=http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/04/09/you-wouldnt-get-this-from-any-other-pollster/ |accessdate=10 April 2008}}</ref> \n\nOne of the first public events involved the [[Church of Scientology]] which had been aggressively trying to censor videos critical of the church.

video of the song \"[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]\" by [[Rick Astley]] on [[YouTube]], taken in 2008.]]\n\n'''Rickrolling''', alternatively '''rick-rolling''', is a [[prank]] and an [[Internet meme]] involving an unexpected appearance of the [[music video]] for the 1987 [[Rick Astley]] song \"[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]\". The meme is a type of [[bait and switch]] using a disguised [[hyperlink]] that leads to the music video. The victims, believing that they are accessing some unrelated material, are said to have been \"rickrolled\". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places.\n\nThe meme grew out from a similar bait-and-switch trick called \"duckrolling\" that was popular on the [[4chan]] website in 2006. The video bait-and-switch trick grew popular on 4chan by the 2007 April Fools' Day, and spread to other Internet sites later that year. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when [[YouTube]] used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event.\n\nInitially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a ten-year hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career, but accepted the fame when he himself rickrolled the 2008 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, Astley has seen his performance career revitalized by the meme's popularity.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n\"Never Gonna Give You Up\" appeared on Astley's 1987 debut album ''[[Whenever You Need Somebody]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r941|pure_url=yes}} |title=''Whenever You Need Somebody'' review |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Henderson |first=Alex |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> The song, his solo debut single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]], and the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The accompanying music video, Astley's first, features him performing the song while dancing.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUKN0421297720080405 |title='80s singer Rick Astley latest Web phenomenon |accessdate=19 November 2008 |last=Hasty |first=Katie |date=5 April 2008 |work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> It since had become a popular song on the Internet, particularly after it was featured in the 2005 \"[[Charlie Has Cancer]]\" episode of ''[[It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia]]''.\n\nThe use of the song for rickrolling date to 2006 originating from the [[4chan]] [[imageboard]] from an early meme known as \"duckrolling\". Sometime in 2006, the site moderator, [[Christopher Poole|Christopher \"m00t\" Poole]] implemented a word filter replacing the word \"egg\" with \"duck\" as a gag. On one thread, where \"eggroll\" had become \"duckroll\", an anonymous user posted an [[photo manipulation|edited]] image of a duck with wheels, calling it a \"duckroll\". The image caught on across 4chan; the image would be the target of a [[hyperlink]] with an otherwise interesting title, with a user clicking through having been said to be \"duckrolled\".<ref name=\"hoaxonwheels\">{{cite news |work=Fox News Channel |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=22 April 2008 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream |accessdate=22 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501165153/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html |archivedate=2008-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, the first trailer for the highly-anticipated ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' was released onto [[Rockstar Games]] website. Viewership was so high that it crashed Rockstar's site. Several users helped to post mirrors of the video on different sites, but one user on 4chan had linked to the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" video claiming to be the trailer, tricking numerous readers into the bait-and-switch. This practice quickly replaced duckrolling for other alluring links, all generally pointing to Astley's video, and thus creating the practice of \"rickrolling\".<ref name=\"hoaxonwheels\"/> The bait-and-switch to the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" greatly expanded on 4chan on [[April Fools' Day]] in 2007, and led to the trick expanding to other sites like [[Fark]] and [[Digg]] later that year, quickly gaining the name \"rickrolling\" based on the prior \"duckrolling\".<ref name=\"hoaxonwheels\"/>\n\nAn initial use of \"rickrolling\" was confirmed by the editors of ''[[Know Your Meme]]'', where rural Michigan resident Erik Helwig had called into a local radio sports-talk show in 2006 and instead of conversing with the DJs, simply played \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", with the DJs having no apparent words to react to that. While this occurred before the 4chan use, ''Know Your Meme'' editor-in-chief Don Caldwell said there was no direct confirmation if it had inspired the 4chan use of the video.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-rickrolling |title = An Oral History of Rickrolling | date = January 10, 2020 | accessdate = February 18, 2020 | work = [[Mel Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n===Growth in 2008===\n[[File:Rick Astley impersonator rickrolling a basketball game.png|thumb|right|A Rick Astley impersonator during one of the March 2008 rickrolls at a collegiate basketball game]] \nRickrolling started to appear in more mainstream sources during 2008, with an [[SurveyUSA]] April 2008 poll estimating that at least 18 million American adults had been rickrolled.<ref name=\"SurveyUSA\">{{cite web |work= SurveyUSA |date=9 April 2008 |title=You Wouldn't Get This From Any Other Pollster |url=http://www.surveyusa.com/index.php/2008/04/09/you-wouldnt-get-this-from-any-other-pollster/ |accessdate=10 April 2008}}</ref> \n\nOne of the first public events involved the [[Church of Scientology]] which had been aggressively trying to censor videos critical of the church.
