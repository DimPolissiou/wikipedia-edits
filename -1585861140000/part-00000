From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=ridotto+1638+casino#v=onepage&q=ridotto%201638%20casino&f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781409460800}}</ref>\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in casinos==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

Most games have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.\n\n''Payout'' is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.<ref>\n[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ \"Slot Machines: The Big Gamble\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713080253/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ |date=July 13, 2011 }}, (Jan. 10, 2011).

From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=ridotto+1638+casino#v=onepage&q=ridotto%201638%20casino&f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781409460800}}</ref>\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in casinos==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

Most games have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.\n\n''Payout'' is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.<ref>\n[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ \"Slot Machines: The Big Gamble\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713080253/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ |date=July 13, 2011 }}, (Jan. 10, 2011).

Relatively small places such as [[Las Vegas]] are best known for gambling; larger cities such as [[Chicago]] are not defined by their casinos in spite of the large turnover.\n\nThe [[Las Vegas Valley]] has the largest concentration of casinos in the United States.

[[Security camera]]s located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.\n\nModern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system, known in the industry as the [[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/6_Casino_Management.htm|title=Casino Management and Operations|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref> Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.\n\nWhen it opened in 1989, [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |date=February 2007 |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.\n\n==Business practices==\nOver the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.<ref>[http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes \"Tribes to pay Conn. $25m in slot accord\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043241/http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes |date=2012-05-12 }}, (August 27, 2009).

Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and [[puritan]]ical constraints, and centers on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is shaped by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his 1936 voyage to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Gide 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gide in 1893]]\nGide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class [[Protestant]] family. His father was a [[University of Paris|Paris University]] professor of law who died in 1880, Jean Paul Guillaume Gide, and his mother was Juliette Maria Rondeaux. His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]]. His paternal family traced its roots back to [[Italy]], with his ancestors, the Guidos, moving to France and other western and northern European countries after converting to Protestantism during the 16th century, due to persecution.<ref>[[Wallace Fowlie]], ''Andr\u00e9 Gide: His Life and Art'', Macmillan (1965), p. 11</ref><ref>Pierre de Boisdeffre, ''Vie d'Andr\u00e9 Gide, 1869-1951: Andr\u00e9 Gide avant la fondation de la Nouvelle revue fran\u00e7aise (1869-1909)'', Hachette (1970), p. 29</ref><ref>[[Jean Delay]], ''La jeunesse d'Andr\u00e9 Gide'', Gallimard (1956), p. 55</ref>\n\nGide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andr\u00e9 Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'Andr\u00e9 Walter''), in 1891, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn 1893 and 1894, Gide traveled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.<ref>''If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir'' by Andr\u00e9 Gide (first edition 1920, Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: \"but when Ali \u2013 that was my little guide's name \u2013 led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country...As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back...I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation\"...\"I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground.\" [p. 251]</ref>\n\nHe befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in [[Algiers]].

This period, 1901\u201307, is commonly seen as a time of apathy and turmoil for him.\n\nIn 1908, Gide helped found the literary magazine ''[[Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (''The New French Review'').<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html Andr\u00e9 Gide Biography]. nobelprize.org</ref> In 1916, [[Marc All\u00e9gret]], only 15 years old, became his lover.

Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence \u2013 \"the best part of myself,\" he later commented. In 1918, he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.\n\nIn the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.\n\nIn 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]]. This caused the only crisis in the long-standing relationship between All\u00e9gret and Gide and damaged the relation with van Rysselberghe. This was possibly Gide's only sexual liaison with a woman,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n24/edmund-white/on-the-chance-that-a-shepherd-boy-|title=On the chance that a shepherd boy \u2026|first=Edmund|last=White|date=10 December 1998|publisher=|pages=3\u20136|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=London Review of Books}}</ref> and it was brief in the extreme. Catherine became his only descendant by blood. He liked to call Elisabeth \"La Dame Blanche\" (\"The White Lady\"). Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of Gide's life (they had adjoining apartments built for each on the rue Vavin). She worshiped him, but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship.{{Citation needed|reason=Elisabeth's mother Maria was called La Petite Dame.

Later he explored their unconsummated marriage in his memoir of Madeleine, ''Et nunc manet in te''.\n\nIn 1924, he published an [[autobiography]], ''If it Die...'' (French: ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'').\n\nIn the same year, he produced the first French language editions of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Lord Jim]]''.\n\nAfter 1925, he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals.\n\n==Africa==\nFrom July 1926 to May 1927, he traveled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] colony with his lover [[Marc All\u00e9gret]]. Gide went successively to [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), [[Ubangi-Shari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly to [[Chad]] and then to [[Cameroon]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo (book)|Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''[[Return from Chad]]'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html|title=Andr\u00e9 Gide - Biographical|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''R\u00e9gime des Grandes Concessions''), ''i.e.,'' a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[slavery]].

It was the life of a man engaging not only in the business of artistic creation, but reflecting on that process in his journal, reading that work to his friends and discussing it with them; a man who knew and corresponded with all the major literary figures of his own country and with many in Germany and England; who found daily nourishment in the Latin, French, English and German classics, and, for much of his life, in the Bible; [who enjoyed playing Chopin and other classic works on the piano;] and who engaged in commenting on the moral, political and sexual questions of the day.<ref>''Andr\u00e9 Gide: A Life in the Present'' by Alan Sheridan.

Gide's work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and [[puritan]]ical constraints, and centers on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty. His self-exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself, including owning one's sexual nature, without at the same time betraying one's values. His political activity is shaped by the same ethos, as indicated by his repudiation of [[communism]] after his 1936 voyage to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Gide 1893.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gide in 1893]]\nGide was born in Paris on 22 November 1869, into a middle-class [[Protestant]] family.

His uncle was the political economist [[Charles Gide]]. His paternal family traced its roots back to [[Italy]], with his ancestors, the Guidos, moving to France and other western and northern European countries after converting to Protestantism during the 16th century, due to persecution.<ref>[[Wallace Fowlie]], ''Andr\u00e9 Gide: His Life and Art'', Macmillan (1965), p. 11</ref><ref>Pierre de Boisdeffre, ''Vie d'Andr\u00e9 Gide, 1869-1951: Andr\u00e9 Gide avant la fondation de la Nouvelle revue fran\u00e7aise (1869-1909)'', Hachette (1970), p. 29</ref><ref>[[Jean Delay]], ''La jeunesse d'Andr\u00e9 Gide'', Gallimard (1956), p. 55</ref>\n\nGide was brought up in isolated conditions in [[Normandy]] and became a prolific writer at an early age, publishing his first novel, ''The Notebooks of Andr\u00e9 Walter'' (French: ''Les Cahiers d'Andr\u00e9 Walter''), in 1891, at the age of twenty-one.\n\nIn 1893 and 1894, Gide traveled in Northern Africa, and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys.<ref>''If It Die: Autobiographical Memoir'' by Andr\u00e9 Gide (first edition 1920, Vintage Books, 1935, translated by Dorothy Bussy: \"but when Ali \u2013 that was my little guide's name \u2013 led me up among the sandhills, in spite of the fatigue of walking in the sand, I followed him; we soon reached a kind of funnel or crater, the rim of which was just high enough to command the surrounding country...As soon as we got there, Ali flung the coat and rug down on the sloping sand; he flung himself down too, and stretched on his back...I was not such a simpleton as to misunderstand his invitation\"...\"I seized the hand he held out to me and tumbled him on to the ground.\" [p. 251]</ref>\n\nHe befriended [[Oscar Wilde]] in Paris, and in 1895 Gide and Wilde met in [[Algiers]].

Gide and Marc fled to London, in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence \u2013 \"the best part of myself,\" he later commented. In 1918, he met [[Dorothy Bussy]], who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English.\n\nIn the 1920s, Gide became an inspiration for writers such as [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. In 1923, he published a book on [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]; however, when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of ''[[Corydon (book)|Corydon]]'' (1924) he received widespread condemnation. He later considered this his most important work.\n\nIn 1923, he sired a daughter, Catherine, by Elisabeth van Rysselberghe, a woman who was much younger than he. He had known her for a long time, as she was the daughter of his closest female friend, Maria Monnom, the wife of his friend the Belgian neo-impressionist painter [[Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe]].

(French: ''[[Si le grain ne meurt]]'').\n\nIn the same year, he produced the first French language editions of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Lord Jim]]''.\n\nAfter 1925, he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals.\n\n==Africa==\nFrom July 1926 to May 1927, he traveled through the [[French Equatorial Africa]] colony with his lover [[Marc All\u00e9gret]]. Gide went successively to [[Middle Congo]] (now the [[Republic of the Congo]]), [[Ubangi-Shari]] (now the [[Central African Republic]]), briefly to [[Chad]] and then to [[Cameroon]] before returning to France. He related his peregrinations in a journal called ''[[Travels in the Congo (book)|Travels in the Congo]]'' (French: ''Voyage au Congo'') and ''[[Return from Chad]]'' (French: ''Retour du Tchad''). In this published journal, he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1947/gide-bio.html|title=Andr\u00e9 Gide - Biographical|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> In particular, he strongly criticized the ''Large Concessions'' regime (French: ''R\u00e9gime des Grandes Concessions''), ''i.e.,'' a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area's [[natural resource]]s, in particular rubber. He related, for instance, how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest, and went as far as comparing their [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] to [[slavery]].

Moreover, no writer of such stature had led such an interesting life, a life accessibly interesting to us as readers of his autobiographical writings, his journal, his voluminous correspondence and the testimony of others. It was the life of a man engaging not only in the business of artistic creation, but reflecting on that process in his journal, reading that work to his friends and discussing it with them; a man who knew and corresponded with all the major literary figures of his own country and with many in Germany and England; who found daily nourishment in the Latin, French, English and German classics, and, for much of his life, in the Bible; [who enjoyed playing Chopin and other classic works on the piano;] and who engaged in commenting on the moral, political and sexual questions of the day.<ref>''Andr\u00e9 Gide: A Life in the Present'' by Alan Sheridan.

[[Urban park]]s are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. [[National park]]s and [[country park]]s are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. [[State park]]s and [[provincial park]]s are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as [[monument]]s, [[fountain]]s or [[playground]] structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as [[baseball]] and [[football]], and paved areas for games such as [[basketball]]. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain [[picnic table]]s and [[barbecue]] grills.\n\nThe largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. In many large parks, [[camping]] in [[tent]]s is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a [[park ranger]]. Large parks may have areas for [[canoeing]] and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, [[cross-country skiing]] and [[snowshoeing]] in colder months. There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Medieval Hunting Park.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Depiction of a medieval hunting park from a 15th-century manuscript]]\n[[Deer park (England)|English deer parks]] were used by the [[aristocracy]] in [[medieval]] times for game hunting. They had walls or thick hedges around them to keep game animals (e.g., stags) in and people out. It was strictly forbidden for commoners to hunt animals in these deer parks.\n\nThese game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around [[mansion]]s and [[country house]]s from the sixteenth century onwards. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also proclaimed the owner's wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these [[stately home]] parks where the [[natural landscape]] was enhanced by [[landscape architect]]s such as [[Capability Brown]]. The [[French formal garden]] is an elaborate example. As cities became crowded, the private hunting grounds became places for the public.\n\nEarly opportunities for the creation of urban parks in both Europe and the United States grew out of medieval practice to secure pasturelands within the safe confines of villages and towns. The most famous US example of a city park evolved from this practice is the Boston Commons in Boston, Massachusetts (1634).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=505\u2013506}}</ref>  \n\nWith the [[Industrial revolution]] parks took on a new meaning as areas set aside to preserve a sense of nature in the cities and towns. Sporting activity came to be a major use for these urban parks. Areas of outstanding natural beauty were also set aside as [[national park]]s to prevent their being spoiled by uncontrolled development.\n\n==Design==\nPark design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience, as well as by the available land features. A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a [[playground]]. A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping. Specific features, such as riding trails, may be included to support specific activities.\n\nThe design of a park may determine who is willing to use it.

Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including [[playground]]s, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and [[skateparks]]. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called \"low intensity recreation\" is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails.\n\nMany smaller ''neighborhood parks'' are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining together to support local parks that have suffered from [[urban decay]] and government neglect.\n\nPassive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure.\n\n==Parks owned or operated by government==\n\n===National parks===\n[[File:Zackenberg.4.jpg|thumb|Northeast Greenland National Park, the world's largest national park]]\n{{Main|National park}}\nA national park is a reserve of land, usually, but not always declared and owned by a national [[government]], protected from most human development and pollution. Although this may be so, it is not likely that the government of a specific area owns it, rather the community itself. National parks are a [[protected area]] of [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] [[IUCN protected area categories|Category II]]. This implies that they are wilderness areas, but unlike pure nature reserves, they are established with the expectation of a certain degree of human visitation and supporting infrastructure.\n\nWhile this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first \"public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\", [[Yellowstone National Park]], in 1872,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=amrvl&fileName=vl002//amrvlvl002.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrvl+vl002))&linkText=0|title=Evolution of the Conservation Movement, 1850\u20131920|work=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> although Yellowstone was not gazetted as a national park.

In [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], and some states in [[Mexico]], as well as in [[Victoria (Australia)|the Australian state of Victoria]], these are known as state parks, whereas in [[Argentina]], [[Canada]] and [[South Korea]], they are known as provincial or territorial parks. In the United States, it is also common for individual [[County (United States)|counties]] to run parks, these are known as '''county parks'''.\n\n===Urban parks===\n[[File:Yoyogi Park from Hyatt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Yoyogi Park]] is a large urban park in [[Tokyo]].]]\n{{Main|Urban park}}\nA park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Parks commonly resemble [[savanna]]s or open [[woodland]]s, the types of [[landscape]] that human beings find most relaxing. [[Grass]] is typically kept short to discourage [[insect]] pests and to allow for the enjoyment of [[picnic]]s and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]].\n\nSome early parks include the [[La Alameda, Seville|la Alameda de H\u00e9rcules]], in [[Seville]], a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville; the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]], in Budapest, Hungary, which was property of the Batthy\u00e1ny family and was later made public.\n\nAn early purpose built public park was [[Derby Arboretum]] which was opened in 1840 by Joseph Strutt for the mill workers and people of the city. This was closely followed by [[Princes Park, Liverpool|Princes Park]] in the [[Liverpool]] suburb of [[Toxteth]], laid out to the designs of [[Joseph Paxton]] from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the Princes park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for \u00a350,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile, an idea pioneered by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] at [[Regent's Park]], and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash's remodeling of St James's Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent's Park completely transformed the appearance of London's West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile contingent. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence on the scene of global maritime trade before 1800 and during the Victorian era its wealth rivalled that of London itself.\n\nThe form and layout of Paxton's ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much imitated design for [[Birkenhead Park]]. The latter was commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas he pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert's design for New York's Central Park of 1857.\n\n[[File:NYC - Manhattan - Central-Park.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]] in [[New York City]] is the most-visited urban park in the U.S.<ref name=\"CPC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/about-cpc |title=About the Central Park Conservancy|website= Central Park Conservancy|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>]]\n\nAnother early public park is the [[Peel Park, Salford]], England opened on August 22, 1846.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/leisure/parks/publicparks/parks-bb.htm |title=Parks in Broughton and Blackfriars |date=August 6, 2007 |work=[[Salford City Council]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221180427/http://www.salford.gov.uk/leisure/parks/publicparks/parks-bb.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchester2002-uk.com/day-trips/parks-gardens/ |title=Public Parks & Gardens in Manchester |website=Manchester UK |access-date=September 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922182525/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/daytrips/parks-gardens.html |archive-date=September 22, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.buhu.salford.ac.uk/virtualtours/index.php University of Salford: Peel Park] Retrieved on September 7, 2008</ref> Another possible claimant for status as the world's first public park is Boston Common (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), set aside in 1634, whose first recreational promenade, Tremont Mall, dates from 1728. True park status for the entire common seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed (renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Street in 1808 already acknowledged the reality).\n\n===Linear parks===\nA [[linear park]] is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a [[rail trail]] or [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]] (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a [[greenbelt]].\n\n===Country parks===\n{{Main|Country park}}\nIn some countries, especially the United Kingdom, ''country parks'' are areas designated for recreation, and managed by [[local authority|local authorities]]. They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.\n\n==Private parks==\nPrivate parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner. There are a few types of private parks, and some which once were privately maintained and used have now been made open to the public.\n\n''Hunting parks'' were originally areas maintained as open space where residences, industry and farming were not allowed, often originally so that nobility might have a place to hunt&nbsp;\u2013 see [[medieval deer park]]. These were known for instance, as ''deer parks'' (deer being originally a term meaning any wild animal). Many [[country house]]s in Great Britain and Ireland still have parks of this sort, which since the 18th century have often been landscaped for aesthetic effect. They are usually a mixture of open grassland with scattered trees and sections of woodland, and are often enclosed by a high wall. The area immediately around the house is the garden. In some cases this will also feature sweeping lawns and scattered trees; the basic difference between a ''country house's park'' and its garden is that the park is grazed by animals, but they are excluded from the garden.\n\n==Other park types==\n[[Dog parks]] permit dogs to run off-leash. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into a park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash).  [[Amusement park]]s have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance/skill.\n\n{{anchor|Forest park}}Forest park : usually large areas of attractive country with marked paths and special areas for camping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/forest-park|title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[National park]]\n* [[Parklet]]\n* [[Pocket park]]\n* [[Protected area]]\n* [[Public open space]]\n* [[Royal forest]]\n* [[State park]]\n* [[Urban open space]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Parks}}\n* {{Cite AmCyc |last=Olmsted |first=Frederick Law |authorlink=Frederick Law Olmsted |wstitle=Park |short=x}}\n\n{{Developments}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Landscape]]\n[[Category:Parks| ]]\n[[Category:Protected areas]]\n[[Category:Recreation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Redirect|Recreation ground}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Veale Gardens.JPG|thumb|[[Veale Gardens]] in [[Adelaide]], Australia]]\n[[File:Slovakia Bratislava 947.jpg|thumb|[[Sad Janka Kr\u00e1\u013ea]] park in [[Bratislava]], Slovakia]]\n[[File:Sprankelplek Jos Spanbroek Park de Gagel Utrecht.JPG|thumb|Park de Gagel in [[Utrecht]], Netherlands]]\n\nA '''park''' is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and [[recreation]] or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. [[Urban park]]s are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. [[National park]]s and [[country park]]s are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. [[State park]]s and [[provincial park]]s are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as [[monument]]s, [[fountain]]s or [[playground]] structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as [[baseball]] and [[football]], and paved areas for games such as [[basketball]]. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain [[picnic table]]s and [[barbecue]] grills.\n\nThe largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. In many large parks, [[camping]] in [[tent]]s is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g. rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles). Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a [[park ranger]]. Large parks may have areas for [[canoeing]] and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, [[cross-country skiing]] and [[snowshoeing]] in colder months. There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Medieval Hunting Park.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Depiction of a medieval hunting park from a 15th-century manuscript]]\n[[Deer park (England)|English deer parks]] were used by the [[aristocracy]] in [[medieval]] times for game hunting. They had walls or thick hedges around them to keep game animals (e.g., stags) in and people out. It was strictly forbidden for commoners to hunt animals in these deer parks.\n\nThese game preserves evolved into landscaped parks set around [[mansion]]s and [[country house]]s from the sixteenth century onwards. These may have served as hunting grounds but they also proclaimed the owner's wealth and status. An aesthetic of landscape design began in these [[stately home]] parks where the [[natural landscape]] was enhanced by [[landscape architect]]s such as [[Capability Brown]]. The [[French formal garden]] is an elaborate example. As cities became crowded, the private hunting grounds became places for the public.\n\nEarly opportunities for the creation of urban parks in both Europe and the United States grew out of medieval practice to secure pasturelands within the safe confines of villages and towns. The most famous US example of a city park evolved from this practice is the Boston Commons in Boston, Massachusetts (1634).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|location=|pages=505\u2013506}}</ref>  \n\nWith the [[Industrial revolution]] parks took on a new meaning as areas set aside to preserve a sense of nature in the cities and towns. Sporting activity came to be a major use for these urban parks. Areas of outstanding natural beauty were also set aside as [[national park]]s to prevent their being spoiled by uncontrolled development.\n\n==Design==\nPark design is influenced by the intended purpose and audience, as well as by the available land features. A park intended to provide recreation for children may include a [[playground]]. A park primarily intended for adults may feature walking paths and decorative landscaping. Specific features, such as riding trails, may be included to support specific activities.\n\nThe design of a park may determine who is willing to use it. Walkers might feel unsafe on a [[mixed-use path]] that is dominated by fast-moving cyclists or horses. Different landscaping and infrastructure may even affect children's rates of park usage according to gender. Redesigns of two parks in Vienna suggested that the creation of multiple semi-enclosed play areas in a park could encourage equal use by boys and girls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2013/09/how-design-city-women/6739/ |title=How to Design a City for Women |website=[[CityLab]] |first=Clare |last=Foran |date=September 16, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nParks are part of the urban infrastructure: for physical activity, for families and communities to gather and socialize, or for a simple respite.

Elements in the physical design of a park, such as an open and welcoming entry, good visibility (sight lines), and appropriate lighting and signage can all make a difference. Regular park maintenance, as well as programming and community involvement can also contribute to a feeling of safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/torontosafety2/|title=Key Factors in Planning, Designing and Maintaining Safer Parks |work=[[Project for Public Spaces]] |date=December 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\nWhile [[Crime prevention through environmental design|Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design]] (CPTED) has been widely used in facility design, use of CPTED in parks has not been.

Active recreation is that which has an urban character and requires intensive development. It often involves cooperative or team activity, including [[playground]]s, ball fields, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and [[skateparks]]. Active recreation such as team sports, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and high costs. Passive recreation, also called \"low intensity recreation\" is that which emphasizes the open-space aspect of a park and allows for the preservation of natural habitat. It usually involves a low level of development, such as rustic picnic areas, benches and trails.\n\nMany smaller ''neighborhood parks'' are receiving increased attention and valuation as significant community assets and places of refuge in heavily populated urban areas. Neighborhood groups around the world are joining together to support local parks that have suffered from [[urban decay]] and government neglect.\n\nPassive recreation typically requires little management and can be provided at very low costs. Some open space managers provide nothing other than trails for physical activity in the form of walking, running, horse riding, mountain biking, snow shoeing, or cross-country skiing; or sedentary activity such as observing nature, bird watching, painting, photography, or picnicking. Limiting park or open space use to passive recreation over all or a portion of the park's area eliminates or reduces the burden of managing active recreation facilities and developed infrastructure.\n\n==Parks owned or operated by government==\n\n===National parks===\n[[File:Zackenberg.4.jpg|thumb|Northeast Greenland National Park, the world's largest national park]]\n{{Main|National park}}\nA national park is a reserve of land, usually, but not always declared and owned by a national [[government]], protected from most human development and pollution. Although this may be so, it is not likely that the government of a specific area owns it, rather the community itself. National parks are a [[protected area]] of [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] [[IUCN protected area categories|Category II]]. This implies that they are wilderness areas, but unlike pure nature reserves, they are established with the expectation of a certain degree of human visitation and supporting infrastructure.\n\nWhile this type of national park had been proposed previously, the United States established the first \"public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people\", [[Yellowstone National Park]], in 1872,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=amrvl&fileName=vl002//amrvlvl002.db&recNum=1&itemLink=r?ammem/consrvbib:@field(NUMBER+@band(amrvl+vl002))&linkText=0|title=Evolution of the Conservation Movement, 1850\u20131920|work=[[Library of Congress]]}}</ref> although Yellowstone was not gazetted as a national park.

In [[Brazil]], the [[United States]], and some states in [[Mexico]], as well as in [[Victoria (Australia)|the Australian state of Victoria]], these are known as state parks, whereas in [[Argentina]], [[Canada]] and [[South Korea]], they are known as provincial or territorial parks. In the United States, it is also common for individual [[County (United States)|counties]] to run parks, these are known as '''county parks'''.\n\n===Urban parks===\n[[File:Yoyogi Park from Hyatt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Yoyogi Park]] is a large urban park in [[Tokyo]].]]\n{{Main|Urban park}}\nA park is an area of open space provided for recreational use, usually owned and maintained by a local government. Parks commonly resemble [[savanna]]s or open [[woodland]]s, the types of [[landscape]] that human beings find most relaxing. [[Grass]] is typically kept short to discourage [[insect]] pests and to allow for the enjoyment of [[picnic]]s and sporting activities. Trees are chosen for their beauty and to provide [[shade (shadow)|shade]].\n\nSome early parks include the [[La Alameda, Seville|la Alameda de H\u00e9rcules]], in [[Seville]], a promenaded public mall, urban garden and park built in 1574, within the historic center of Seville; the [[City Park (Budapest)|City Park]], in Budapest, Hungary, which was property of the Batthy\u00e1ny family and was later made public.\n\nAn early purpose built public park was [[Derby Arboretum]] which was opened in 1840 by Joseph Strutt for the mill workers and people of the city. This was closely followed by [[Princes Park, Liverpool|Princes Park]] in the [[Liverpool]] suburb of [[Toxteth]], laid out to the designs of [[Joseph Paxton]] from 1842 and opened in 1843. The land on which the Princes park was built was purchased by Richard Vaughan Yates, an iron merchant and philanthropist, in 1841 for \u00a350,000. The creation of Princes Park showed great foresight and introduced a number of highly influential ideas. First and foremost was the provision of open space for the benefit of townspeople and local residents within an area that was being rapidly built up. Secondly it took the concept of the designed landscape as a setting for the suburban domicile, an idea pioneered by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] at [[Regent's Park]], and re-fashioned it for the provincial town in a most original way. Nash's remodeling of St James's Park from 1827 and the sequence of processional routes he created to link The Mall with Regent's Park completely transformed the appearance of London's West End. With the establishment of Princes Park in 1842, Joseph Paxton did something similar for the benefit of a provincial town, albeit one of international stature by virtue of its flourishing mercantile contingent. Liverpool had a burgeoning presence on the scene of global maritime trade before 1800 and during the Victorian era its wealth rivalled that of London itself.\n\nThe form and layout of Paxton's ornamental grounds, structured about an informal lake within the confines of a serpentine carriageway, put in place the essential elements of his much imitated design for [[Birkenhead Park]]. The latter was commenced in 1843 with the help of public finance and deployed the ideas he pioneered at Princes Park on a more expansive scale. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] visited Birkenhead Park in 1850 and praised its qualities. Indeed, Paxton is widely credited as having been one of the principal influences on Olmsted and Calvert's design for New York's Central Park of 1857.\n\n[[File:NYC - Manhattan - Central-Park.jpg|thumb|[[Central Park]] in [[New York City]] is the most-visited urban park in the U.S.<ref name=\"CPC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/about/about-cpc |title=About the Central Park Conservancy|website= Central Park Conservancy|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>]]\n\nAnother early public park is the [[Peel Park, Salford]], England opened on August 22, 1846.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salford.gov.uk/leisure/parks/publicparks/parks-bb.htm |title=Parks in Broughton and Blackfriars |date=August 6, 2007 |work=[[Salford City Council]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221180427/http://www.salford.gov.uk/leisure/parks/publicparks/parks-bb.htm |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchester2002-uk.com/day-trips/parks-gardens/ |title=Public Parks & Gardens in Manchester |website=Manchester UK |access-date=September 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922182525/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/daytrips/parks-gardens.html |archive-date=September 22, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>[http://www.buhu.salford.ac.uk/virtualtours/index.php University of Salford: Peel Park] Retrieved on September 7, 2008</ref> Another possible claimant for status as the world's first public park is Boston Common (Boston, Massachusetts, USA), set aside in 1634, whose first recreational promenade, Tremont Mall, dates from 1728. True park status for the entire common seems to have emerged no later than 1830, when the grazing of cows was ended and renaming the Common as Washington Park was proposed (renaming the bordering Sentry Street to Park Street in 1808 already acknowledged the reality).\n\n===Linear parks===\nA [[linear park]] is a park that has a much greater length than width. A typical example of a linear park is a section of a former railway that has been converted into a park called a [[rail trail]] or [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]] (i.e. the tracks removed, vegetation allowed to grow back). Parks are sometimes made out of oddly shaped areas of land, much like the vacant lots that often become city neighborhood parks. Linked parks may form a [[greenbelt]].\n\n===Country parks===\n{{Main|Country park}}\nIn some countries, especially the United Kingdom, ''country parks'' are areas designated for recreation, and managed by [[local authority|local authorities]]. They are often located near urban populations, but they provide recreational facilities typical of the countryside rather than the town.\n\n==Private parks==\nPrivate parks are owned by individuals or businesses and are used at the discretion of the owner. There are a few types of private parks, and some which once were privately maintained and used have now been made open to the public.\n\n''Hunting parks'' were originally areas maintained as open space where residences, industry and farming were not allowed, often originally so that nobility might have a place to hunt&nbsp;\u2013 see [[medieval deer park]]. These were known for instance, as ''deer parks'' (deer being originally a term meaning any wild animal). Many [[country house]]s in Great Britain and Ireland still have parks of this sort, which since the 18th century have often been landscaped for aesthetic effect. They are usually a mixture of open grassland with scattered trees and sections of woodland, and are often enclosed by a high wall. The area immediately around the house is the garden. In some cases this will also feature sweeping lawns and scattered trees; the basic difference between a ''country house's park'' and its garden is that the park is grazed by animals, but they are excluded from the garden.\n\n==Other park types==\n[[Dog parks]] permit dogs to run off-leash. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into a park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash).  [[Amusement park]]s have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance/skill.\n\n{{anchor|Forest park}}Forest park : usually large areas of attractive country with marked paths and special areas for camping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/forest-park|title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Landscape architecture]]\n* [[National park]]\n* [[Parklet]]\n* [[Pocket park]]\n* [[Protected area]]\n* [[Public open space]]\n* [[Royal forest]]\n* [[State park]]\n* [[Urban open space]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Parks}}\n* {{Cite AmCyc |last=Olmsted |first=Frederick Law |authorlink=Frederick Law Olmsted |wstitle=Park |short=x}}\n\n{{Developments}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Landscape]]\n[[Category:Parks| ]]\n[[Category:Protected areas]]\n[[Category:Recreation]]\n", "name_user": "2601:282:8181:d70:ccef:855d:9b4e:7a8e", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park"}

He lectured on the [[Classics]] at the [[University of Alberta]] from 1922 to 1964, and served as president of the [[Canadian Authors Association]]. He was an administrator of Canadian and international ice hockey, and served as president of the [[Hockey Alberta|Alberta Amateur Hockey Association]], the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA), the [[International Ice Hockey Association]], and the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]].\n\nHardy was self-taught in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. He paid his way through university by earning scholarships, and won the [[Governor General's Academic Medal]] in Classics and English. He earned a [[Master of Arts]] at the [[University of Toronto]], and then a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. He educated about the Classics and world events by radio, and gave 250 talks on [[CBC Radio]]. He was critical of [[progressive education]] in Alberta, arguing it did not prepare students for university and lacked emphasis on [[the three Rs]]. He authored eight novels, six books, and over 200 short stories published in ''[[Maclean's]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. His books told the history of Canada and the [[Greco-Roman world]], and his novels included the fictionalized life and times of [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. He wrote four plays produced by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], was a judge in literary contests, and taught at creative writing workshops.\n\nHardy coached the [[Alberta Golden Bears and Pandas|Alberta Golden Bears]] men's ice hockey team, then became president of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association and established a new playoffs system for [[senior ice hockey]] in Western Canada. He was elected to the CAHA executive in 1934, then became its president in 1938. Hardy and [[George Dudley]] recommended updates to the definition of an amateur ice hockey player in 1936, to reflect the financial challenges during the [[Great Depression]] to have national playoffs and send the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team]] to the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] or [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]]. Hardy campaigned to the Canadian public who accepted the changes, despite opposition by the [[Amateur Athletic Union of Canada]]. As president of the CAHA, he revised playoffs formats for the [[Allan Cup]] and [[Memorial Cup]] to become more profitable, and reinvested the money into [[minor ice hockey]] in Canada. He negotiated an affiliation agreement with the [[USA Hockey|Amateur Hockey Association of the United States]] in 1938, which led to the formation of the International Ice Hockey Association in 1940, to oversee hockey in North America and [[Great Britain]]. He improved professional\u2013amateur relations with the [[National Hockey League]], and negotiated to reimburse the amateur associations for developing professional players. Hardy founded the [[Western Canada Senior Hockey League]] in 1945, which later merged with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey League]]. He agreed to a merger of the International Ice Hockey Association with the [[Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace]] in 1947, which was renamed to the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] in 1948. He was the first North American to be elected its president, and sought for the [[International Olympic Committee]] to recognize the Canadian definition of amateur, and for inclusion of the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team]] at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].\n\nHardy was invested as a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1974 for contributions to education, literature and amateur sports in Canada. He was posthumously inducted into the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and is the namesake of the [[Canada West University Hockey Awards|Dr. W. G. Hardy Trophy]] for university hockey, and the [[Hardy Cup]] for senior hockey.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHardy was born on February 3, 1895, on the family farm in Peniel, Ontario, to parents George William Hardy and Anne Hardy (n\u00e9e White).<ref name=\"rutgers\">{{cite web|url=https://dbcs.rutgers.edu/all-scholars/8769-hardy-william-george|title=HARDY, William George|last1=Fishwick|first1=Duncan|last2=Fowler|first2=Robert L.|website=Database of Classical Scholars|publisher=Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"W-H-New\">''William H.

He lectured on the [[Classics]] at the [[University of Alberta]] from 1922 to 1964, and served as president of the [[Canadian Authors Association]]. He was an administrator of Canadian and international ice hockey, and served as president of the [[Hockey Alberta|Alberta Amateur Hockey Association]], the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]] (CAHA), the [[International Ice Hockey Association]], and the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]].\n\nHardy was self-taught in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]]. He paid his way through university by earning scholarships, and won the [[Governor General's Academic Medal]] in Classics and English. He earned a [[Master of Arts]] at the [[University of Toronto]], and then a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. He educated about the Classics and world events by radio, and gave 250 talks on [[CBC Radio]]. He was critical of [[progressive education]] in Alberta, arguing it did not prepare students for university and lacked emphasis on [[the three Rs]]. He authored eight novels, six books, and over 200 short stories published in ''[[Maclean's]]'' and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. His books told the history of Canada and the [[Greco-Roman world]], and his novels included the fictionalized life and times of [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. He wrote four plays produced by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], was a judge in literary contests, and taught at creative writing workshops.\n\nHardy coached the [[Alberta Golden Bears and Pandas|Alberta Golden Bears]] men's ice hockey team, then became president of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association and established a new playoffs system for [[senior ice hockey]] in Western Canada. He was elected to the CAHA executive in 1934, then became its president in 1938. Hardy and [[George Dudley]] recommended updates to the definition of an amateur ice hockey player in 1936, to reflect the financial challenges during the [[Great Depression]] to have national playoffs and send the [[Canada men's national ice hockey team]] to the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]] or [[ice hockey at the Olympic Games]]. Hardy campaigned to the Canadian public who accepted the changes, despite opposition by the [[Amateur Athletic Union of Canada]]. As president of the CAHA, he revised playoffs formats for the [[Allan Cup]] and [[Memorial Cup]] to become more profitable, and reinvested the money into [[minor ice hockey]] in Canada. He negotiated an affiliation agreement with the [[USA Hockey|Amateur Hockey Association of the United States]] in 1938, which led to the formation of the International Ice Hockey Association in 1940, to oversee hockey in North America and [[Great Britain]]. He improved professional\u2013amateur relations with the [[National Hockey League]], and negotiated to reimburse the amateur associations for developing professional players. Hardy founded the [[Western Canada Senior Hockey League]] in 1945, which later merged with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey League]]. He agreed to a merger of the International Ice Hockey Association with the [[Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace]] in 1947, which was renamed to the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] in 1948. He was the first North American to be elected its president, and sought for the [[International Olympic Committee]] to recognize the Canadian definition of amateur, and for inclusion of the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team]] at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].\n\nHardy was invested as a Member of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1974 for contributions to education, literature and amateur sports in Canada. He was posthumously inducted into the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and is the namesake of the [[Canada West University Hockey Awards|Dr. W. G. Hardy Trophy]] for university hockey, and the [[Hardy Cup]] for senior hockey.\n\n==Early life and family==\nHardy was born on February 3, 1895, on the family farm in Peniel, Ontario, to parents George William Hardy and Anne Hardy (n\u00e9e White).<ref name=\"rutgers\">{{cite web|url=https://dbcs.rutgers.edu/all-scholars/8769-hardy-william-george|title=HARDY, William George|last1=Fishwick|first1=Duncan|last2=Fowler|first2=Robert L.|website=Database of Classical Scholars|publisher=Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences|access-date=November 6, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"W-H-New\">''William H.

He sought for these inconsistencies with respect to professionals and amateurs should be \"ironed out and a common-sense view be taken of the situation\". He further stated that the old definition of amateur came \"from the days when only gentlemen with independent means were supposed to engage in sport\"; and that in the era of the [[Great Depression]], it was justified that a hockey player be allowed legitimate employment in sport and be compensated for work lost while away at playoffs or representing his country at international events.<ref name=\"macleans-1936\" />\n\nThe amateur issue achieved significant press coverage by November 1936.

Born to Cuban parents in [[France]], Nin was the daughter of composer [[Joaqu\u00edn Nin]] and Rosa Culmell, a classically trained singer. Nin spent her early years in  Spain and Cuba, about sixteen years in [[Paris]] (1924\u20131940), and the remaining half of her life in the United States, where she became an established author.\n\nBeginning at age eleven, Nin wrote [[diary|journal]]s prolifically for six decades and even up until her death. Her journals, many of which were published during her lifetime, detail her private thoughts and personal relationships. Her journals also describe her marriage to [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] and marriage to [[Rupert Pole]], in addition to her numerous affairs, including those with psychoanalyst [[Otto Rank]] and writer [[Henry Miller]], both of whom profoundly influenced Nin and her writing.\n\nIn addition to her journals, Nin wrote several novels, critical studies, essays, short stories, and volumes of [[erotic literature|erotica]]. Much of her work, including the collections of erotica ''[[Delta of Venus]]'' and ''[[Little Birds]]'', was published posthumously amid renewed critical interest in her life and work. Nin spent her later life in [[Los Angeles]], California, where she died of cervical cancer in 1977.\n\n==Early life==\nAna\u00efs Nin was born in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]], France, to [[Joaqu\u00edn Nin]], a Cuban pianist and composer of [[Catalans|Catalan]] Spanish descent, and Rosa Culmell,<ref name=\"kir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/anaisnin.htm |title=Ana\u00efs Nin profile|website=kirjasto.sci.fi|first=Petri|last=Liukkonen|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20120123084641/http%3A//www%2Ekirjasto%2Esci%2Efi/anaisnin%2Ehtm|archivedate= 23 January 2012|url-status=dead|language=fi}}</ref> a classically trained Cuban singer of French descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morbidoutlook.com/nonfiction/articles/2001_03_anaisnin.html|title= The Unique Ana\u00efs Nin|author=Fenner, Andrew|accessdate=December 26, 2016}}</ref> Her father's grandfather had fled France during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], going first to [[Saint-Domingue]], then [[New Orleans]], and finally to [[Cuba]] where he helped build that country's first railway.{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=125}}\n\nNin was raised a [[Roman Catholic]]<ref>{{cite book|title=A Spy In The House Of Love (Foreword)|author=Stuhlmann, Gunther|page=3|publisher=Swallow Press}}</ref> but left the church when she was 16 years old.{{sfn|Nin|DuBow|1994|p=126}} She spent her childhood and early life in Europe. Her  parents separated when she was two; her mother then moved Ana\u00efs and her two brothers, Thorvald Nin and [[Joaqu\u00edn Nin-Culmell]], to [[Barcelona]], and then to New York City, where she attended high school. Nin would drop out of high school in 1919 at age sixteen,{{sfn|Nin|DuBow|1994|p=xxi}} and according to her diaries, ''Volume One, 1931\u20131934'', later began working as an artist's model. After being in the United States for several years, Nin had forgotten how to speak Spanish, but retained her French and became fluent in English.{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=183}}\n\nOn March 3, 1923, in [[Havana]], Cuba, Nin married her first husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]] (1898\u20131985), a banker and artist, later known as \"Ian Hugo\" when he became a maker of [[experimental film]]s in the late 1940s. The couple moved to Paris the following year, where Guiler pursued his banking career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s with [[Francisco Miralles Arnau]]. Her first published work was a critical evaluation of [[D. H. Lawrence]] called ''[[D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study]]'', which she wrote in sixteen days.<ref name=\"kir\"/>\n\nNin became profoundly interested in [[psychoanalysis]] and would study it extensively, first with [[Ren\u00e9 Allendy]] in 1932 and then with [[Otto Rank]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Writers|author=Oakes, Elizabeth H.|page=255|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-1-438-10809-4}}</ref> Both men eventually became her lovers, as she recounts in her ''Journal''.<ref>Anais Nin, ''Journal (1931-1934)'', Paris: Le Livre de Poche, 1966, pp. 138, 171\u2013172, 237, 404, 505, passim.</ref> On her second visit to Rank, Nin reflects on her desire to be \"re-born\" as a woman and artist. Rank, she observes, helped her move back and forth between what she could verbalize in her journals and what remained unarticulated. She discovered the quality and depth of her feelings in the wordless transitions between what she could say and what she could not say.  \"As he talked, I thought of my difficulties with writing, my struggles to articulate feelings not easily expressed. Of my struggles to find a language for intuition, feeling, instincts which are, in themselves, elusive, subtle, and wordless.\"{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=276}}\n\nIn the late summer of 1939, when residents from overseas were urged to leave France due to the approaching [[Second World War|war]], Nin left Paris and returned to New York City with her husband. (Guiler was, according to his own wishes, edited out of the diaries published during Nin's lifetime; his role in her life is therefore difficult to gauge.)<ref>\"Several persons, when faced with the question of whether they wanted to remain in the diary 'as is' ... chose to be deleted altogether from the manuscript (including her husband and some members of her family).\" ''The Diary of Ana\u00efs Nin'', ed. by Gunther Stuhlmann.

Collins}}</ref>\n\nIn New York, Ana\u00efs rejoined Otto Rank, who had previously moved there, and moved into his apartment. She actually began to act as a psychoanalyst herself, seeing patients in the room next to Rank's, and having sex with her patients on the psychoanalytic couch.{{sfn|Nin|1967|pages=17\u201325}} She quit after several months, however, stating: \"I found that I wasn't good because I wasn't objective. I was haunted by my patients. I wanted to intercede.\"<ref name=fraser/>  It was in New York that she met the Japanese-American modernist photographer [[Soichi Sunami]], who went on to photograph her for many of her books.\n\n==Literary career==\n===Journals===\nNin's most studied works are her diaries or journals, which she began writing in her adolescence. The published journals, which span several decades from 1933 onward, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially Otto Rank. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.\n\nIn the third volume of her unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote about her father candidly and graphically (207\u201315), detailing his sexual abuse of her at age nine.\n\nPreviously unpublished works are coming to light in ''A Caf\u00e9 in Space, the Ana\u00efs Nin Literary Journal'', which includes \"Ana\u00efs Nin and Joaqu\u00edn Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony\u2014Letters between a father and daughter\".\n\nSo far sixteen volumes of her journals have been published.  All but the last five of her adult journals are in expurgated form.\n\n===Erotic writings===\nNin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of [[Women's erotica|female erotica]]. She was one of the first women known to explore fully the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West known to write erotica. Before her, erotica acknowledged to be written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]]. Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations, and she states in ''Volume One'' of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=15}} [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=45}} [[Jean Cocteau]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|pages=60, 109}} [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=60}} and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=29, 40}}\n\nAccording to ''Volume One'' of her diaries, ''1931\u20131934'', published in 1966, Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her husband, mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: \"One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America... They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits... I had my degree in erotic lore.\"{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=96}}\n\nFaced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Henry Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous \"collector\" for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gertzman, Jay A.|page=344|title=Bookleggers and Smuthounds: The Trade in Erotica, 1920-1940|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2011|edition=Reprint|isbn=978-0-812-20585-5}}</ref> (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.<ref>[[No\u00ebl Riley Fitch]], ''Ana\u00efs: The Erotic Life of Ana\u00efs Nin'' (Boston: [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1993) {{ISBN|0-316-28428-9}}</ref>)  Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=Kowaleski-Wallace|first=Elizabeth|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Literary Theory|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0053unse/page/190 190]|isbn=978-0-8153-0824-9|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0053unse/page/190}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Gibson|title=Postmodernity, Ethics and the Novel: From Leavis to Levinas|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-19895-0|p=[https://archive.org/details/postmodernityeth00gibs_0/page/177 177]|url=https://archive.org/details/postmodernityeth00gibs_0/page/177}}</ref> and ''[[Little Birds]]''.

Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both sexually and as an author. Claims that Nin was [[bisexual]] were given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry & June]]'' about Henry Miller and his second wife [[June Miller]]. The first unexpurgated portion of Nin's journal to be published, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear that Nin was stirred by June to the point of saying (paraphrasing), \"I have become June,\" though it is unclear whether she consummated her feelings for her sexually. To both Ana\u00efs and Henry, June was a femme fatale\u2014irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, often leaving herself broke.\n\n===Novels and other publications===\nIn addition to her journals and collections of erotica, Nin wrote several novels, which were frequently associated by critics with [[Surrealism#Surrealist literature|surrealism]].<ref name=eb>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anais-Nin|title=Ana\u00efs Nin|author= The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}</ref> Her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'' (1936), contains heavily veiled allusions to a brief sexual relationship Nin had with her father in 1933: While visiting her estranged father in France, the then-thirty-year-old Nin had a brief incestuous sexual relationship with him.<ref name=father>{{cite journal|author=Charnock, Ruth|date=September 30, 2013|title= Incest in the 1990s: Reading Ana\u00efs Nin's 'Father Story'|journal=Life Writing|volume = 11|pages=55\u201368|doi=10.1080/14484528.2013.838732|url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/11712/1/Life%20Writing%20article.pdf}}</ref> In 1944, she published a collection of short stories titled ''[[Under a Glass Bell]]'', which were reviewed by [[Edmund Wilson]].<ref name=fraser/>\n\nNin was also the author of several works of non-fiction: Her first publication, written during her years studying psychoanalysis, was ''[[D.

Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol. 1\u20132) although the opening of Vol. 1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was a pregnancy by him that she aborted in 1934.\n\nIn 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor [[Rupert Pole]] in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31pole.t.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=The Lover Who Always Stays|date=2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Corbett, Sara}}</ref><ref name=\"pole\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=Anais Nin Husband, Rupert Pole, Dies in L.A.|date=July 29, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The two ended up dating and traveled to California together; Pole was sixteen years her junior.

The couple moved to Paris the following year, where Guiler pursued his banking career and Nin began to pursue her interest in writing; in her diaries she also mentions having trained as a [[flamenco]] dancer in Paris in the mid-to-late 1920s with [[Francisco Miralles Arnau]].

The published journals, which span several decades from 1933 onward, provide a deeply explorative insight into her personal life and relationships. Nin was acquainted, often quite intimately, with a number of prominent authors, artists, [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]], and other figures, and wrote of them often, especially Otto Rank. Moreover, as a female author describing a primarily masculine constellation of celebrities, Nin's journals have acquired importance as a counterbalancing perspective.\n\nIn the third volume of her unexpurgated journal, ''Incest'', she wrote about her father candidly and graphically (207\u201315), detailing his sexual abuse of her at age nine.\n\nPreviously unpublished works are coming to light in ''A Caf\u00e9 in Space, the Ana\u00efs Nin Literary Journal'', which includes \"Ana\u00efs Nin and Joaqu\u00edn Nin y Castellanos: Prelude to a Symphony\u2014Letters between a father and daughter\".\n\nSo far sixteen volumes of her journals have been published.  All but the last five of her adult journals are in expurgated form.\n\n===Erotic writings===\nNin is hailed by many critics as one of the finest writers of [[Women's erotica|female erotica]]. She was one of the first women known to explore fully the realm of erotic writing, and certainly the first prominent woman in the modern West known to write erotica. Before her, erotica acknowledged to be written by women was rare, with a few notable exceptions, such as the work of [[Kate Chopin]]. Nin often cited authors [[Djuna Barnes]] and D. H. Lawrence as inspirations, and she states in ''Volume One'' of her diaries that she drew inspiration from [[Marcel Proust]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=15}} [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=45}} [[Jean Cocteau]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|pages=60, 109}} [[Paul Val\u00e9ry]],{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=60}} and [[Arthur Rimbaud]].{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=29, 40}}\n\nAccording to ''Volume One'' of her diaries, ''1931\u20131934'', published in 1966, Nin first came across erotica when she returned to Paris with her husband, mother and two brothers in her late teens. They rented the apartment of an American man who was away for the summer, and Nin came across a number of French paperbacks: \"One by one, I read these books, which were completely new to me.  I had never read erotic literature in America... They overwhelmed me.  I was innocent before I read them, but by the time I had read them all, there was nothing I did not know about sexual exploits... I had my degree in erotic lore.\"{{sfn|Nin|1966|p=96}}\n\nFaced with a desperate need for money, Nin, Henry Miller and some of their friends began in the 1940s to write erotic and pornographic narratives for an anonymous \"collector\" for a dollar a page, somewhat as a joke.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gertzman, Jay A.|page=344|title=Bookleggers and Smuthounds: The Trade in Erotica, 1920-1940|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2011|edition=Reprint|isbn=978-0-812-20585-5}}</ref> (It is not clear whether Miller actually wrote these stories or merely allowed his name to be used.<ref>[[No\u00ebl Riley Fitch]], ''Ana\u00efs: The Erotic Life of Ana\u00efs Nin'' (Boston: [[Little, Brown and Company]], 1993) {{ISBN|0-316-28428-9}}</ref>)  Nin considered the characters in her erotica to be extreme caricatures and never intended the work to be published, but changed her mind in the early 1970s and allowed them to be published as ''[[Delta of Venus]]''<ref>{{cite book|last=Kowaleski-Wallace|first=Elizabeth|title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Literary Theory|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0053unse/page/190 190]|isbn=978-0-8153-0824-9|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaoffe0053unse/page/190}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Gibson|title=Postmodernity, Ethics and the Novel: From Leavis to Levinas|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-19895-0|p=[https://archive.org/details/postmodernityeth00gibs_0/page/177 177]|url=https://archive.org/details/postmodernityeth00gibs_0/page/177}}</ref> and ''[[Little Birds]]''.

Her passionate love affair and friendship with Miller strongly influenced her both sexually and as an author. Claims that Nin was [[bisexual]] were given added circulation by the [[Philip Kaufman]] film ''[[Henry & June]]'' about Henry Miller and his second wife [[June Miller]]. The first unexpurgated portion of Nin's journal to be published, ''[[Henry and June]]'', makes it clear that Nin was stirred by June to the point of saying (paraphrasing), \"I have become June,\" though it is unclear whether she consummated her feelings for her sexually. To both Ana\u00efs and Henry, June was a femme fatale\u2014irresistible, cunning, erotic. Nin gave June money, jewelry, clothes, often leaving herself broke.\n\n===Novels and other publications===\nIn addition to her journals and collections of erotica, Nin wrote several novels, which were frequently associated by critics with [[Surrealism#Surrealist literature|surrealism]].<ref name=eb>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anais-Nin|title=Ana\u00efs Nin|author= The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=October 6, 2017}}</ref> Her first book of fiction, ''[[House of Incest]]'' (1936), contains heavily veiled allusions to a brief sexual relationship Nin had with her father in 1933: While visiting her estranged father in France, the then-thirty-year-old Nin had a brief incestuous sexual relationship with him.<ref name=father>{{cite journal|author=Charnock, Ruth|date=September 30, 2013|title= Incest in the 1990s: Reading Ana\u00efs Nin's 'Father Story'|journal=Life Writing|volume = 11|pages=55\u201368|doi=10.1080/14484528.2013.838732|url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/11712/1/Life%20Writing%20article.pdf}}</ref> In 1944, she published a collection of short stories titled ''[[Under a Glass Bell]]'', which were reviewed by [[Edmund Wilson]].<ref name=fraser/>\n\nNin was also the author of several works of non-fiction: Her first publication, written during her years studying psychoanalysis, was ''[[D.

Her husband Guiler is not mentioned anywhere in the published edition of the 1930s parts of her diary (Vol. 1\u20132) although the opening of Vol. 1 makes it clear that she is married, and the introduction suggests her husband refused to be included in the published diaries. The diaries edited by her second husband, after her death, tell that her union with Henry Miller was very passionate and physical, and that she believed that it was a pregnancy by him that she aborted in 1934.\n\nIn 1947, at the age of 44, she met former actor [[Rupert Pole]] in a Manhattan elevator on her way to a party.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/31/magazine/31pole.t.html?_r=1|work=New York Times|title=The Lover Who Always Stays|date=2006-12-31|accessdate=2011-02-16|author=Corbett, Sara}}</ref><ref name=\"pole\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5591676|work=National Public Radio (NPR)|title=Anais Nin Husband, Rupert Pole, Dies in L.A.|date=July 29, 2006|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}</ref> The two ended up dating and traveled to California together; Pole was sixteen years her junior.
