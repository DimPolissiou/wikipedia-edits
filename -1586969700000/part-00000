In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=ia&tran_input=Sunda&direct=au|title=Sunda, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url         = http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=sunda&lang=sans&action=Search\n| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary\n| accessdate  = 20 November 2014\n| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary\n}}\n</ref> The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |title       = Watak Budaya Sunda\n |access-date  = 24 October 2011\n |last        = Kurnia\n |first       = Iwan\n |date        = 14 August 2007\n |publisher   = Kasundaan.org\n |language    = Indonesian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831145939/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |archive-date = 31 August 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe name ''Sunda'' is also known in Hindu mythology of [[Sunda and Upasunda]], as one of the powerful [[Asura]] brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from [[Brahma]]. The powerful Asura brothers then set out to conquering the world, and menacing the Gods. In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

However, currently the Wangsakerta manuscripts are generally discounted as a valid historical source among historians, since this controversial manuscript is suspected as a fraud containing [[pseudohistory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lubis|first=Nina H.|date=2012-08-03|title=Kontroversi Tentang Naskah Wangsakerta|url=https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal-humaniora/article/view/741|journal=Humaniora|language=id|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.22146/jh.v14i1.741|issn=2302-9269|doi-broken-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radarcirebon.com/mengungkap-kontroversi-naskah-wangsakerta-2.html|title=Mengungkap Kontroversi Naskah Wangsakerta - Radar Cirebon|date=2013-12-14|work=Radar Cirebon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=id-ID}}</ref>\n\n===Local account===\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]] dated 854 Saka (932 AD). The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being.

Whoever breaks the law will be punished by these supranatural beings, die in horrible way like their brain being sucked, blood being drunk, intestines being destroyed, and chest is split in two. O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]]. After his return he practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java, where his bodily existence came to an end.<ref name=\"Noorduyn 2006 437\">{{cite book | last =Noorduyn | first =J. | publisher= KITLV Press | title = Three Old Sundanese poems | year =2006| page =437\n}}</ref>  The manuscript dated from pre-Islamic Sunda.

Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling.

Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton, and in cutting their hair they only leave it half an inch long. The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island.

[[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\nSeries of last Sunda kings were notoriously known as incompetent rulers. The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. ''Dayeuh'' Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of Sunda Kingdom approximately for almost a hundred years (1482 \u2013 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the [[Sultanate of Banten]] in 1579.\n\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called ''Pajajaran'' (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name \u2013 Pajajaran \u2013 is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] region (current [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]).\n\n==Government and economy==\n===Administration===\n[[File:Makuta Binokasih.jpg|thumb|upright|''Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Pak\u00e9'', the royal crown of Sunda kingdom. After the fall of Pajajaran to Banten, the crown was evacuated to [[Kingdom of Sumedang Larang|Sumedang Larang]] and become their regalia.]]\nIn many historical sources, including manuscripts, inscriptions, as well as foreign historical accounts from  \nChina and Portuguese reports, all refer to \"Sunda\" as a [[Realm|kingdom]]. On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

As mentioned in some fragments of this manuscript:<br/> \n''\"..., ti Kandangwesi pamwat siya ka Pakwan...\"'' (\"... from Kandangwesi the tribute was sent to Pakuan\"), <br/> \n''\"..., anaking sang Prebu Rama, Resi samadaya sarerea siya marek ka Pakwan unggal tahun...\"'' (\"... my son the chief of the village, the ''[[rishi]]s'' together all paid a visit to Pakuan every years\").<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|405}}\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Leuit os 080815-2283 srna.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sundanese woman retrieving rice from a [[leuit]], Sundanese economy mainly rely on rice agriculture]]\nThe economy of Sunda kingdom relied on [[agriculture]], especially [[rice]] cultivation; this is reflected in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] culture and the annual ceremonies of crop seeding and ''Seren Taun'' rice harvest festival. The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}}; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}} broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered, but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\n\n==Culture and society==\n===Religion===\n[[File:KITLV 87602 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu ritual objects; bells and a small statue made of bronze, from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java. These objects was belongs to Brahmin Hindu priest, Hinduism was a dominant faith in Sunda Kingdom.]]\n[[Hinduism]] was one of the earliest religious influences established in West Java since the era of [[Tarumanagara]], circa early 5th century CE. In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. ''\" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati.

Sunda kingdom period, circa 14th century.]]\nThe culture of Sunda kingdom centred on agricultural activity, especially [[rice]] cultivation. [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich. The land of Sunda has as much as four thousands horses which come there from Priaman (Sumatera) and other islands to be sold. It has up to forty elephants; these are for the king\u2019s array.

The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons. Sunda has up to six junks and many lancharas of the sunda kind, with masts like a crane, and steps between each so that they are easy to navigate.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE).

The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].

The example is ''suvarna'' (lit:\"good color\") used to describe gold. ''Sunda'' is also another name for Hindu God [[Vishnu]]. In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=ia&tran_input=Sunda&direct=au|title=Sunda, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url         = http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=sunda&lang=sans&action=Search\n| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary\n| accessdate  = 20 November 2014\n| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary\n}}\n</ref> The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |title       = Watak Budaya Sunda\n |access-date  = 24 October 2011\n |last        = Kurnia\n |first       = Iwan\n |date        = 14 August 2007\n |publisher   = Kasundaan.org\n |language    = Indonesian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831145939/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |archive-date = 31 August 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe name ''Sunda'' is also known in Hindu mythology of [[Sunda and Upasunda]], as one of the powerful [[Asura]] brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from [[Brahma]]. The powerful Asura brothers then set out to conquering the world, and menacing the Gods. In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

However, currently the Wangsakerta manuscripts are generally discounted as a valid historical source among historians, since this controversial manuscript is suspected as a fraud containing [[pseudohistory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lubis|first=Nina H.|date=2012-08-03|title=Kontroversi Tentang Naskah Wangsakerta|url=https://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal-humaniora/article/view/741|journal=Humaniora|language=id|volume=14|issue=1|pages=20\u201326|doi=10.22146/jh.v14i1.741|issn=2302-9269|doi-broken-date=2020-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radarcirebon.com/mengungkap-kontroversi-naskah-wangsakerta-2.html|title=Mengungkap Kontroversi Naskah Wangsakerta - Radar Cirebon|date=2013-12-14|work=Radar Cirebon|access-date=2018-06-03|language=id-ID}}</ref>\n\n===Local account===\nThe earliest reference to the name \"Sunda\" being used to identify a kingdom is the [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]] dated 854 Saka (932 AD). The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being.

Whoever breaks the law will be punished by these supranatural beings, die in horrible way like their brain being sucked, blood being drunk, intestines being destroyed, and chest is split in two. O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]]. After his return he practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java, where his bodily existence came to an end.<ref name=\"Noorduyn 2006 437\">{{cite book | last =Noorduyn | first =J. | publisher= KITLV Press | title = Three Old Sundanese poems | year =2006| page =437\n}}</ref>  The manuscript dated from pre-Islamic Sunda.

Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling.

Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton, and in cutting their hair they only leave it half an inch long. The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island. Here the capital of Sunda is called ''Daio'' which refer to Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]]\nEuropean explorers, mainly Portuguese based in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], also reported the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\nSeries of last Sunda kings were notoriously known as incompetent rulers. The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations.

Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom.

The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

As mentioned in some fragments of this manuscript:<br/> \n''\"..., ti Kandangwesi pamwat siya ka Pakwan...\"'' (\"... from Kandangwesi the tribute was sent to Pakuan\"), <br/> \n''\"..., anaking sang Prebu Rama, Resi samadaya sarerea siya marek ka Pakwan unggal tahun...\"'' (\"... my son the chief of the village, the ''[[rishi]]s'' together all paid a visit to Pakuan every years\").<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|405}}\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Leuit os 080815-2283 srna.jpg|thumb|upright|A Sundanese woman retrieving rice from a [[leuit]], Sundanese economy mainly rely on rice agriculture]]\nThe economy of Sunda kingdom relied on [[agriculture]], especially [[rice]] cultivation; this is reflected in [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] culture and the annual ceremonies of crop seeding and ''Seren Taun'' rice harvest festival. The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}}; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}} broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered, but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\n\n==Culture and society==\n===Religion===\n[[File:KITLV 87602 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu ritual objects; bells and a small statue made of bronze, from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java. These objects was belongs to Brahmin Hindu priest, Hinduism was a dominant faith in Sunda Kingdom.]]\n[[Hinduism]] was one of the earliest religious influences established in West Java since the era of [[Tarumanagara]], circa early 5th century CE. In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. ''\" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati.

Sunda kingdom period, circa 14th century.]]\nThe culture of Sunda kingdom centred on agricultural activity, especially [[rice]] cultivation. [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich. The land of Sunda has as much as four thousands horses which come there from Priaman (Sumatera) and other islands to be sold. It has up to forty elephants; these are for the king\u2019s array. An inferior gold, of six carats, is found. There is abundance tamarinds which serve the native for vinegar.\n\nThe city where the king is most of the year is the great city of Dayo. The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons. Sunda has up to six junks and many lancharas of the sunda kind, with masts like a crane, and steps between each so that they are easy to navigate.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',<ref>[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W.

The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].

Seven of 51 cases the county had as of April 2 were city residents, and the county feared it did not have sufficient healthcare infrastructure to handle a large outbreak; McLaughlin issued an order requiring any recent arrivals from the city to quarantine themselves for 14 days, during which law enforcement will check on them regularly.<ref name=\"Guardian refugees article\">{{cite news|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|title=New Yorkers fleeing city face fear and hostility from upstate neighbors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/new-yorkers-fleeing-city-conronavirus-fear-hostility-upstate-neighbors|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 2, 2020|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]], in the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] just south of Albany, posted on its website a letter asking people to refrain from traveling there, especially from New York City or [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. \"There is no hospital in Greene County\", wrote the chairman of the county legislature. \"This limits our ability to serve a large number of people requiring higher levels of care for COVID-19 patients and other illnesses.\" The legislatures of neighboring [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware]] and [[Sullivan County, New York|Sullivan]] counties made similar requests.<ref>{{cite press release|last=Linger|first=Patrick S.|date=March 20, 2020|title=A Message to Our Visitors, Weekenders and Second Homeowners|url=https://www.greenegovernment.com/scoop/greene-county-press-release-covid-19-march-20th-2020|location=[[Catskill, New York]]|publisher=[[Greene County, New York|Greene County]]|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn [[the Hamptons]], on the eastern end of Long Island's [[South Fork, Suffolk County, New York|South Fork]], a longtime summer destination for city residents, rental rates have quadrupled as the population has nearly doubled.

In addition there was the threat of French action in North America. It was therefore decided in April 1745 to raise two new Highland Regiments, then reduced to just one new Highland Regiment, to relieve a battalion in Flanders for service in America. Field Marshall the Earl of Stair, commander of the Army in Britain proposed as colonel of this new Highland Regiment, his nephew John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun.\n\tThe Earl of Stair wrote[1] from London to Lord Loudoun that \"Ever since you went from hence, I have been very much employed about the Expedition to America: considering the importance of the Service, I was of Opinion, that it was better to send two Battalions thither then one, his Majesty seemed to be pretty much of that opinion himself.\n\u201cBut at a definitive meeting of the King\u2019s Servants upon that Subject, the Ministers gave it as their opinion, that it was sufficient to send one Battn to America, and to replace that Battn by one Highland Regiment, which Resolution was carryed to the King yesterday morning just before his Majesty went to the House of Peers to put an end to the Session; his Majesty approved of raising one Highland Regiment and that your Lordship should be colonel of it, I gave orders for issuing of beating orders for raising the said Regiment immediately.\"\n\tOn 1st May 1745 King George II signed[2] a Colonel\u2019s commission for the Earl of Loudoun to raise a new Highland Regiment for service in Flanders.\n\tThe King signed[3] a beating order, addressed to \"Our Right trusty and Right well beloved Cousin John Earl of Loudoun colonel of one of our regiments of foot,\"\nLord Loudoun\n\tLord Loudoun was born in 1706 and in 1734 succeeded his father as 4th Earl of Loudoun. Doubly connected to the family of the Earl of Stair, John Campbell, entered upon a military career in 1727. In 1732 he was appointed Cornet in the Royal North British Dragoons. In 1734 he was promoted Captain[4] in the troop in the Queen\u2019s Own Regiment of Dragoons, commanded by Lord Mark Kerr. When the troop was reduced, in 1741, he was appointed Captain in the 3rd Foot Guards, commanded by John Murray, Earl of Dunmore.\n\tIn 1734 Lord Loudoun was elected one of the 16 Representative Peers for Scotland and in 1741 he was appointed[5] Governor of Stirling Castle.\n\tIn 1742, with the return to political favour of his uncle, the Earl of Stair, Lord Loudoun was brought to the attention of the King. In 1743 Lord Loudoun crossed to Flanders and joined the Allied Army on the Rhine. On 27th June, on the day of the Battle of Dettingen, Lord Loudoun was appointed[6] Aid de Camp to King George II, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, though he still commanded his company of Foot Guards.\n\tThe Earl of Stair was the most important influence in his nephew's life \u2013 both politically and militarily. \n        Lord Loudoun was extremely well connected politically and was a follower of Archibald Campbell, Duke of Argyll.\n'''Selection of Officer'''\n\tThe Regiment was known as Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment and Lord Loudoun\u2019s Highland Regiment and the New Highland Regiment. Though numbered 64th Regiment of Foot, it was never referred to as such.\n\tThe Regiment was to have ten Battalion Companies and three Additional Companies, on the same footing as the Old Highland Regiment, The Black Watch. There were to be a Captain, Lieutenant and Ensign, three sergeants, three corporals, two drummers, one a piper, and 70 centinels, in each company, as well as an Adjutant, Chaplain, Quartermaster, Surgeon and Surgeon\u2019s Mate. The officers were to be Gaelic speaking.\n\tWith the help of the Duke of Argyll, Lord Loudoun set about finding officers. Officers were selected more for the political allegiance of their fathers than for their military experience.\n        Despite reservations from the King, in Hanover, the Lieutenant Colonel selected was John Campbell, son of General John Campbell of Mamore, heir to the Duke of Argyll. There was some difficulty in finding a Major, but eventually Captain William Mackenzie was preferred. He had seen service in Russia. He was the grandson of the 2nd Earl of Seaforth and cousin of Kenneth MacKenzie, Lord Fortrose.\n\tThe following officers were appointed, with commissions dated 8th June 1745. The experienced officers who were serving in the Army were: Lieutenant Alexander Mackay, the third son of Lord Reay;  Lieutenant Harry Munro, son of Sir Robert Munro, who commanded the Old Highland Regiment, The Black Watch, had displayed such courage at the Battle of Fontenoy; Lieutenant John Stuart, brother of the Earl of Moray; Lord Charles Gordon, brother of Cosmo, 3rd Duke of Gordon. \n\tThe officers without previous service were allocated seniority by throw of dice in the presence of General Sir John Cope.[7]\n\tThe officers for each company were allocated as follows:\nCaptains\t\t\tLieutenants\t\t\tEnsigns\nColonel\u2019s company\t\tCapt-Lt Macnab\t\tRobert Mackay\nLieutenant Colonel\t\tColin Campbell\t\tArchibald Campbell \n\t\t  \t\tof Kilberrie\t        son of Achallader\nMajor\t\t\t\tDonald MacDonald\tJames Stuart\n\t\t \t\tof Lochgarry\t        younger of Urrard\nCapt John Murray\t\tDuncan Robertson\tDavid Spalding\n  son of Lord George Murray\tof Drumachine\t \tyounger of Ashintully\nCapt Alexander Campbell\t        John Campbell\t\tDaniel MacNeill \n  of Ardkinglas\t  \t        of Strachur\nCapt Colin Campbell\t\tJohn Campbell\t\tRobert Bisset\n  younger of Ballemore\t        younger of Ardslignish\nCapt John MacLeod\t\tDonald MacDonald\tJohn Martin\n  younger of MacLeod\t\nCapt Harry Munro\t\tColin Campbell\t\tMalcolm Ross\n  younger of Fowlis\t \tof Glenure\t        younger of Pitcalnie\nLord Charles Gordon\t\tPatrick Grant\t\tGeorge Munro\n\t\t  \t\tyounger of Rothiemurchus of Novar\nCapt John Stuart\t\tJohn Reid\t\tAlexander Campbell\n  Grenadier Company\t \tyounger of Straloch     Barcaldine, 2nd Lt\nCapt Alexander Mackay\t        Hugh Maclean\t\tAlexander Maclagan\n  son of Lord Reay\t  \tyounger of Kingairloch\t\nCapt MacPherson\t\t       James MacPherson\t\tJames Fraser\n  younger of Cluny\t       of Killiehuntly\nCapt Sutherland\t\t       Patrick Campbell \tJohn Grant\n  of Forse\t  \t \t\t\t\tyounger of Dalrachnie\n\n'''The Jacobite Rising'''\n\tIn June 1745 Lord Loudoun\u2019s officer were already recruiting in the Highlands. Lord Loudoun travelled north to Inverness in early July where he learned that Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, had landed on the west coast of Scotland. Lord Loudoun, having sustained a riding accident in the north, hurried back to Edinburgh, where was appointed Adjutant General to General Sir John Cope\u2019s hastily formed army. Sir John Cope determined to march north to Fort Augustus, in the Great Glen, to stifle the Rising. \n\tSir John Cope commanded some 1,500 men with five companies of Colonel Lee\u2019s Regiment; eight companies of Colonel Lascelles\u2019 Regiment; ten companies of Colonel Thomas Murray\u2019s Regiment; two Additional Companies of Lord John Murray\u2019s Old Highland Regiment and some men of Lord Loudoun\u2019s New Highland Regiment. Almost at once Lieutenant Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry joined the Jacobites with men from the Major\u2019s and Captain John Murray\u2019s Companies. Captain John Murray was the 16 year old son of Lord George Murray and nephew of the Duke of Atholl. He was a scholar at Eton College and never came north. Ewan MacPherson of Cluny, having been snubbed by Sir John Cope raised his clan for the Young Pretender.\n\tAt Dalwhinnie Sir John Cope, supported by all the senior officers, including Lord Loudoun, thinking that the steep Corrieyarrick Pass nearby was already in the hands of the rebels, decided to march to Inverness. Prince Charles and the Highland Clans poured south to take Perth, bypass Stirling and seize Edinburgh.\n\tAt Inverness Sir John Cope decided to march to Aberdeen and sail to Leith, the port of Edinburgh. His army was joined by four of Lord Loudoun\u2019s companies; the Colonel\u2019s company, 10 centinels; Captain Stuart\u2019s, 39 centinels; Captain Harry Munro\u2019s, 67 centinels, and the officer less Captain Murray\u2019s with 16 centinels. Sir Patrick Murray\u2019s Additional Company of the Old Highland Regiment numbered 40 centinels. Just before sailing from Aberdeen, Lord Loudoun was joined by Captain Alexander Mackay, with 67 centinels. The Highland Regiments numbered 12 officers, 14 sergeants, 11 corporals, 7 drummers and 243 centinels.[8]\nThe Battle of Prestonpans\n\tSir John Cope\u2019s Army disembarked at Dunbar on 17th September having heard that Edinburgh had capitulated to the Rebels the night before.\n\tSir John Cope marched west towards Musselburgh and Edinburgh and took up a position on the plain at Prestonpans, below Tranent. Changing position three times during the day, Sir John Copes army was facing east when in the early dawn the Rebels, having passed through a marsh, at night, made a furious dawn charge from the east. Sir John Cope\u2019s two dragoon regiments, on the flanks, broke and the infantry followed. \n\tLord Loudoun was later to send a detailed account of the Battle to Sir John Cope.[9] Lord Loudoun, with Sir John Cope, succeeded in gathering most of the Dragoons together west of Preston village but the Dragoons would not stand. Sir John Cope decided that he could not ride towards Edinburgh. Instead he rode south to Lauder and Coldstream and next day arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\tLord Loudoun\u2019s Highlanders had been withdrawn to Cockenzie House to guard Sir John Cope\u2019s baggage. Lieutenant Colonel Peter Halkett, of Lee\u2019s, having been made prisoner by Lord George Murray, was sent to Cockenzie House and persuaded the Highlanders to surrender.\n\tLord Loudoun wrote[10] that \u201cThere was lost at the Battle Mackays, Stuarts and Monros Companys Complete, part of my Company and part of Capt Murrays & an Officer and 7 Men of Capt Sutherlands whom we meet by Accident a recruiting.\u201d \n        \u201cNever was there a Regiment raised at so unlucky a time, nor yet was there such a Number of men rais\u2019d in so short a time. I have lost all my best Officers for the present Mackay, Stuart, Mcnab all Prisoners and all good Men.\u201d[10]  Despite Lord Loudoun\u2019s comment, as many as 100 Highlanders may have escaped from the battle. More importantly \u201cGovernor\u201d Campbell escaped with Lord Loudoun\u2019s papers and his money. Sir John Cope lost \u00a33,000 at the battle. The captured Highlanders were eventually released and were sent home. Many of the men re-joined the Regiment in December 1745. The officers were paroled and sent to Perth and then Angus and Fife and were to play no further part in the Rising until February 1746. Ensign Malcolm Ross of Pitcalnie joined the Rebels. \t  \t  \t\n\n'''The Argyll Companies'''\n\tIn early July, from Edinburgh, Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell had made his way west to Glasgow, which city he represented in Parliament, and to Rosneath, the Duke of Argyll\u2019s house on Loch Long. It was there that he first had news that the Young Pretender had landed on the west coast. He hurried to Inveraray where the Duke was rebuilding a palace to replace his castle. \n\tLieutenant Colonel John Campbell had three companies in Argyll. \nLieutenant Colonel\t\tLieutenant Colin Campbell\t\tEnsign Archibald Campbell \n\t\t  \t\t    of Kilberrie\t  \t   \t   \tson of Achallader\nCapt Alexander Campbell\t        Lieutenant John Campbell\t\tEnsign Daniel MacNeill \n  of Ardkinglas\t  \t            of Strachur\nCapt Colin Campbell\t\tLieutenant John Campbell\t\tEnsign Robert Bisset\n  younger of Ballemore\t            younger of Ardslignish.\n        In addition there were four officers from other companies: Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure, Captain Munro\u2019s; Lieutenant Alexander Campbell, Barcaldine, 2nd Lt Grenadiers; Lieutenant Hugh Maclean, younger of Kingairloch, Captain Mackay\u2019s; Lieutenant Patrick Campbell, Captain Sutherland\u2019s.\n\tBy mid-November the three Argyll Companies were complete and a further 40 men had been collected for the Regiment. By the middle of December 500 militia had been gathered at Inveraray and 2,000 more were ready to march in. There were 10 canons at Inveraray and a parapet had been built.\n\tOn 21st December Major General John Campbell of Mamore arrived at Inveraray to command the Militia in the west. On 23rd the General\u2019s son, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, led 600 men out of Inveraray towards Stirling. 600 more men followed the next day. But on 25th December Captain Alexander Campbell died at Inveraray. He was not to be replaced until April 1746.\n\tOn 27th December 600 Argyll men arrived at Dumbarton. On 28th December Captain John Noble wrote[11] that \u201cI Cloath'd Lord Loudoun\u2019s Comy's yesterday are some spare Shoulder belts which I intend to give to the millicy as far as they'll go.\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell had ordered brogues from Glasgow.\n\tEach soldier received a shirt and neckcloth; a scarlet vest and coat, faced in white; 12 yards of tartan cut in two and sewn together into a plaid; four pairs of red and white checked hose; a blue bonnet with a black cockade and a pair of brogues.\n\n'''The Inverness Companies'''\n\tLord Loudoun had escaped from the Battle of Prestonpans and rode with Sir John Cope to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Lord Loudoun was then given command of all the King\u2019s forces in the north of Scotland. By 10th October he was back at Inverness. With Duncan Forbes, Lord President, he set about raising 19 Independent Companies from the Munros, Mackays, Sutherlands, MacLeods, MacDonalds, MacKenzies, Grants and from Inverness itself.\n\tMajor William MacKenzie was at Inverness. Lieutenant Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry had joined the Rebels and was Lieutenant Colonel of the Glengarry Regiment at Prestonpans. Ensign James Stuart younger of Urrard was at Inverness. Capt John MacLeod, younger of MacLeod, was with Lieutenant Donald MacDonald and Ensign John Martin. Lord Charles Gordon\twas with Ensign George Munro of Novar. Patrick Grant had been given command of the Grant Independent Company. Capt MacPherson, younger of Cluny had raised his clan for the Young Pretender but his subalterns were at Inverness; Lieutenant James MacPherson of Killiehuntly and Ensign James Fraser. Capt Sutherland of Forse was the only officer in his company since Lieutenant Patrick Campbell was in Argyll and Ensign John Grant younger of Dalrachnie had been made prisoner at Prestonpans.\n\tLord Loudoun was later to write[12] that \u201cwhen I left you I begun with 150 Men in a town ready to cut my throat and my Neighbours the Frassers threatening to attack me every night I augmented by very slow degrees and with numbers difficultys to have 2000 want of Arms want of Money were often my Case and Mutines my Dayly Bread and this with a sett of People that excepin my Major [MacKenzie] whom you know not one Man under my Command that I was aquainted with in May last [in Flanders] However with Coxing and Guiding of Officers and marching a foot in Kilt in Frost and Snow I have got over all that and I have great reason to believe I am extramly well with them.\u201d \n\tAlso at Inverness was the rump of Captain Aeneas Mackintosh\u2019s Additional Company of Lord John Murray\u2019s Old Highland Regiment, The Black Watch. Captain Mackintosh\u2019s wife, Anne Farquharson, had raised 200 men of her husband\u2019s clan for the Prince.\n\tLord Loudoun saw Duncan Forbes, the Lord President, at Culloden House almost every day. With Captain Mackintosh he often rode down to Moy to dine with Lady Mackintosh.\n\tTowards the end of December the Inverness Companies were at last cloathed. The coats, vests and shirts had come from John Mann[13] in London and the tartan for the plaids from James Seton[14] in Edinburgh. The tents, equipment, and 939 muskets, designed to Lord Loudoun\u2019s pattern, with powder and shot were despatched from London.[15] In being transferred from a tender to the ship the packets were dropped in the sea and had to be recovered, dried and re-oiled. It was to be an age before they reached Inverness.\n\tIn late December Norman MacLeod of MacLeod, commanding seven Independent Companies marched south east towards Aberdeen but was surprised at Inverurie. Malcolm MacCrimmon, MacLeod\u2019s piper, was made prisoner.\n\n'''The Rebels return to the north'''\n\tThe Young Pretender marched his army south from Edinburgh to Carlisle, and Manchester as far as Derby. Few English Jacobites joined the Prince and finally, on 5th December, the Rebels turned and started marching back to Scotland. Despite hot pursuit from two British Armies, one commanded by the Duke of Cumberland who had been recalled from Flanders, the Jacobites crossed back into Scotland, entered Glasgow and then began a siege of Stirling Castle.\n\tGeneral Henry Hawley had replaced Sir John Cope as commander in Scotland. Though he had good intelligence of the movement of the Rebels, on 17th January 1746, he had to rush his forces up a steep hill from Falkirk to meet them.[16] Though the Dragoons made a better display than at Prestonpans, they eventually broke and swept most of the Royal Army off the field.  Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell, with three companies of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment and the Argyll Militia were on the lower ground, but were trampled on by the fleeing dragoons and infantry. Three men of the Argyll companies were killed at the battle.\n\tBy the end of January the Duke of Cumberland had been sent from London to command in the north. He instilled some much needed backbone into his father\u2019s troops. The King considered that the Jacobites were rebels and therefore that their parole was invalid. All the paroled officers, taken at Prestonpans, much to their unease, were ordered back to duty.\nIn London the Ministry resigned and was replaced. Two days later the new Ministry resigned and the formed Ministry took charge. Sir John Cope wrote[17] that \u201cThe unaccountable changes which have happened this last Week in London has been as extraordinary an Event, as even a beginning, carrying on, and I hope now, the ending of the Rebellion, to which I wish most sincerely your Lordp may be in condition to put ye finishing stroke to.\u201d\n       In Scotland the Young Pretender withdrew from Stirling and marched north to Crieff and Blair Atholl. Lord George Murray, with the other half of the Rebels, marched towards Aberdeen with the Duke of Cumberland in pursuit.\n       By mid-February the Young Pretender was in Strathspey and captured Ruthven Barracks. He marched closer to Inverness and spent the night at Moy Hall, the home of Anne Farquharson, Lady MacKintosh, who had raised her husband\u2019s clan for the Prince. Lord Loudoun received news that the Prince was at Moy guarded by only a few men. He marched 1,500 of his Regiment and the Independent Companies out of Inverness towards Moy but was surprised by Donald Fraser, the Moy blacksmith, with a handful of men. The Independent Companies fled and in the fire a dropping shot killed a piper at Lord Loudoun\u2019s foot. The piper was Donald MacCrimmon, piper to Captain Macleod\u2019s company. Lord Loudoun was forced to retire to Inverness in what the Jacobites called the Rout of Moy.[18]\n\n'''Retreat to Sutherland'''\n\tLeaving two Independent Companies at Inverness Castle, called Fort George, Lord Loudoun ferried his Regiment and the remaining 16 Independent Companies across the Kessock Ferry to the Black Isle. The MacKenzie Companies deserted to their homes.\n\tLord Loudoun marched his men across the Black Isle and crossed by ferry to Nigg. and moved to Balnagowan. A weekly return was made[19] of Lord Loudoun's Regiment at Balnagowan on Saturday 22nd February. 28 men had deserted from Captain Mackay's company and 7 from Sir Harry Munro's. This was particularly galling for the two Captains, newly released from parole. They, with the other paroled officers, had been trying to re-join Lord Loudoun at the moment that he had abandoned Inverness. \n\tThe Independent Companies at Fort George surrendered after two days. The Earl of Cromartie marched out of Inverness and Lord Loudoun crossed his men over the Kyles of Sutherland, defending a line from Dornoch to the Falls of Shin. Lord Loudoun's Regiment at Dornoch numbered, for the first time, 7 Captains, with the Major absent, 3 Lieutenants and 5 Ensigns, with one Ensign absent. There were also the Adjutant, Quartermaster and Surgeon; 21 sergeants, 6 drummers and 18 corporals. There were 187 men fit for duty and 18 men sick. Since the last return 5 men had deserted.\n\tAlso listed on the return was Captain Aeneas Mackintosh\u2019s Additional Company of Lord John Murray's Regiment, The Black Watch. His subalterns, Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenlyon and Ensign James Grant of Glenmoriston were present with 3 sergeants, a drummer, and 2 corporals. There were only 5 men with one man sick.\n\n'''Lord Loudoun\u2019s wife'''\n        Lord Loudoun was said not to be married but the Earl of Sutherland wrote[20] to Lord Loudoun on 27th February. Lord Loudoun answered that \u201cI beg your lordship will be so good as make my complements acceptable to my Lady Sutherland and my love to my wife, and my complements to the Major [Mackay].\u201d\n\tLord Loudoun\u2019s wife, K MacDougall, Countess of Loudoun, had travelled north from London by boat and was at Dunrobin Castle with the Earl and Countess of Sutherland.\n\tIn March 1745 Captain George MacDougall of the North British Dragoons, or Greys, wrote[21] from Edinburgh that \u201cI have the honour of your Lordships letter, and would fain make fine Speeches in name of the Grays, but can not find words kind enough to express my self, I must therefore recommend it to your Spouse to make up her fathers want of Eloquence in love, and in the meantime desire the favour of K----- to kiss you for me, which shall be repayed with interest at Meeting.\u201d\n\n'''Guarding the Sutherland shore'''\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland had marched from Perth to Aberdeen inspiring some much needed discipline in his men. On 7th March the Duke ordered[22] Lord Loudoun and his command to cross the Moray Firth. Lord Loudoun replied that he needed boats from the southern shore of the Firth to get across. \n\tThe Duke of Cumberland wrote[23] to the Duke of Newcastle that Lord Loudoun and the Lord President \u201cplainly show an aversion to the imbarking & coming Southward, which I shall readily dispense with, as my only view in bringing them south was that they should not have to say, we refused making use of their assistance. But I think it much more for the Honour of his Majesty\u2019s Forces & of the nation, to finish this affair, without any further use of the Highlanders, than plundering and sending out parties. I propose therefore letting them know that I shall not expect their coming to join me till I get to Inverness.\u201d\n\tThick fog prevented the British ships from guarding the Sutherland Shore. Moir of Stoneywood collected boats from Moray and the Duke of Perth marched out of Inverness to Dingwall and Tain. On the morning of 20th March, in thick fog, the Rebels cross the Kyles of Sutherland.\n\tLord Loudoun was to write[24] that \u201cI sett out that morning at seven to vissit the postes, and by the time I had got about three milles I got the alarm \u2026 and gave me an account of the numbers as above, being landed out of 70 boats. I then gallopt forward, tho quite by myself, to trie if I could discover what there numbers realy were, but the fog was so very thick that I could see nothing.\u201d\n\tA volunteer in Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment was later to write[25] that \u201cUpon the alarm being given the Major [MacKenzie] beat to arms & immediately gott together about 120 of the Regiment.\n\t\u201cWith these he proceeded towards the place of landing expecting to be joined by the Mckay\u2019s to see if possible to beat them off. Upon our march we were informed that all at ones they landed about 800 men, \n\t\u201cWe marched on and quickly found ourselves within half muskett-shott of at least 600 men, besides the 300 who were gone up above us whom we could not see. Then we could observe 18 Murray boats 8 or 10 of which were landing more men & the rest under sail returning for others.\n\u201cWe retired to Dornock which they perceived marched about 500 men after us. Here we had time to throw some small quantity of Ammunition into a Ditch & proceeded to gett if possible over the ferry at ferry-oons.\u201d [Loch Fleet]\n        \u201cBut about a mile to the northwards of Dornoch I don't know what panick saized them but that they were for capitulating.\u201d\n        Captains Alexander Mackay, Sir Harry Munro, Lieutenant John Reid and Ensign Alexander Maclaggan had been made prisoners at Prestonpans and made the best of their escape. They were joined by Lord Charles Gordon, Captain John MacLeod and Ensign and Adjutant Robert Grant, with some of the men.\nMajor Mackenzie was made prisoner by Lieutenant-Colonel Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry, commissioned into Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment. \n\tCaptain Aeneas Mackintosh, with a handful of men from Lord John Murray\u2019s additional company, was made prisoner by Donald Fraser, the blacksmith from Moy. \n\tIntelligence from Sutherland reported[26] that at Ferry-oons, [Loch Fleet] the money was put \u201caboard of an open boat and lodged it first in the Vulture Sloop and afterwards in the Shark Sloop when the Vulture sailed South.\u201d Lord Loudoun\u2019s military chest and his papers, with \u201cGovenor\u201d Campbell, had again escaped the Rebels.\nLord Loudoun, with Duncan Forbes, headed west to the Isle of Skye, with several Independent Companies. Captain MacKay headed north into Sutherland with some of the men of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment.\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland concluded[27] that \u201cHis Majesty must have observed how negligently these Highlanders who are with us do their duty \u2026 Lord Loudoun\u2019s people have suffered themselves to be surprised at Dornoch from the Murray side by a few boats \u2026 I am much sorrier for the appearance of the affair than for the thing itself, as I have never expected much assistance from them.\u201d\n\n'''The Hazard Sloop'''\n        Captain Alexander Mackay, with some of the men of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment headed north to Tongue. The Sheerness sloop drove the Hazard sloop, renamed Prince Charles, into the Kyles of Sutherland. After a long bombardment the French officers on board Hazard went ashore, taking a large quantity of gold with them. They were pursued through the night and next morning were surrounded and taken.\n\tEnsign Aeneas Mackay wrote[28] that \u201cthe Prise mony was taken and carried to Tongue by order of the Commanding Officer as they say to the Ammount of Eight Thousand pounds Sterling tho Some call it more.\u201d\n\tLieutenant Daniel Forbes wrote[29] that though Ensign Mackay and \u201cYour Petitioner, without Ostentation were the Main Instruments of bringing all to this desirable issue, and of Saving from Embazlement in the field a Bag of Gold and three Boxes Containing Upwards of \u00a38,000 Sterl, The whole of it was carryed to Tongue the Place of Lord Reays Residence, there it was divided as his Lops three Sons & the above ment officers of your Regiment Thought proper, without Consulting Ensign Mackay or your Petitioner in the Scheme of Division, & tho Each drew \u00a3700 They gave him & me betwixt us no more than \u00a3300.\u201d\n\tLord Cathcart later wrote[30] to Lord Loudoun from Aberdeen that \u201cI give your Lordship the trouble of this to acquaint you that yesterday we were joined by your Captains McKay, Sir Harry, [Munro] Ld Charles, [Gordon] and Laird of Mcleod, with 20 [French] Officers and 150 private prisoners. They had taken in Strathnavrin after they had been driven on shore from the Hazard Sloop by the Sheerness. They had likewise taken about 12,000\u00a3 in money. Your Lordship\u2019s Governour Mr Camel with your papers and all your money was of the party. His R.H. has taken the specie for which Capt Mckay has a receipt, and I have sent Campbell with the Portmantel and Papers to Edgh.\u201d [Edinburgh]\n\n'''The Argyllshire Companies in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire'''\n\tOn 20th January 1746 Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, at [South] Queensferry, made a return[31] of his Company. Present in Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell's company were himself; Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Kilberrie and Ensign Archibald Campbell. There were 5 sergeants; 3 corporals, 2 drummers and 59 Centinels. The Centinels sick present were 2; sick left behind 4; on command 4; lost at Falkirk 3. Total 72 Centinels. \n\tAs the Young Pretender withdrew north, the Duke of Cumberland pursued him. On 5th February the Duke was at Crieff, with the Young Pretender only 25 miles away at Weem, north of Taybridge. The Duke of Cumberland travelled to Perth. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell commanded more than 1,000 Argyll men in the Duke's army. \n\tOn 20th February Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell was ordered[32] to leave 420 of his men to be posted in North Perthshire. On 21st February he marched east towards Dundee and Aberdeen, keeping between the foothills of the Grampian Mountains and the Royal Army.\n\tLieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell reached Aberdeen[33] on 26th February. Two days later Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, with some of Cobham's Dragoons under his command, marched out to Old Meldrum.\n\tOn 12th March Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell was joined at Old Meldrum, 15 miles north of Aberdeen, by General Bland with Kingston's Light Horse and four infantry Battalions.\n\tMeanwhile 420 of the Argyll Militia had been ordered north to guard a line from Blair Atholl, Tummel and Kynachan to Kinloch Rannoch. Amongst the Militia officers were three from Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment. Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure, of Sir Harry Munro\u2019s Company; Lieutenant Patrick Campbell of Captain Sutherland\u2019s Company and Lieutenant Hugh Maclean of Kingarlosk of Captain Alexander Mackay\u2019s Company.\n\tOn the night of 16th March Lord George Murray, with Ewan MacPherson[34] of Cluny, surprised the Militia posts in North Perthshire, taking 16 officers and 400 prisoners. Captain Campbell of Knockbuy, commanding at Kynachan, and Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure, commanding at Kinlochrannoch, had been absent from their posts.\n\tAmongst the officers taken prisoner were Lieutenant Patrick Campbell and Lieutenant Hugh Maclean of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment.\nSurprise at Keith\n\tAs the attack was taking place in Blair Atholl and Rannoch, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell marched towards Strathbogie. General Bland came up at noon, and together they surprised the Rebels commanded by John Roy Stuart and Gordon of Avochie in the town of Huntly, 22 miles away. Captain Colin Campbell of Ballemore took a detachment to Keith, 10 miles further north-west, but returned to Huntly. \n\tOn 20th March Lieutenant Alexander Campbell, Barcaldine's brother, with a handpicked command of 60 men and 30 Light Horse marched as far as Fochabers, 7 miles beyond Keith, and then retired to Keith as night fell. Just after 1am the Rebels attacked and Lieutenant Alexander Campbell hurried back to the guard house, cutting his way through the Rebels. Lieutenant Alexander Campbell later wrote[35] that \u201cWhen I came to the Guard house I found everything in disorder, four of the men killed, the Captain wounded and what remained of the men in the house quite inactive in their duty. I told Ardslignish that the only chance left is now for our Lives and reputation was to make a brisk attempt to gett thro' the enemy back again which he agreed to, we both Rushed out of the house but could not make our post good. He was immediately taken prisoner upon his getting out of the Door\u2026 a fellow came behind me with a clubbed firelock and knocked me down, and then they slashed at me with till they left me in the miserable pickle I am now in: for I gott no cut while I was standing except one across the Face and Nose. After I was flatt upon the ground I gott a wound in the head, one in the right shoulder, and a very bad one in the left wrist which is the one now confines me to my bed.\u201d Lieutenant Alexander Campbell was left for dead, but after twenty minutes staggered out to a farm where eventually he was bound up and the next day found a military surgeon.\n\tDavid Campbell wrote[36] that \u201cSandy Campbell a Brother of Barcaldine's belonging to your Lordships Regiment, with an advance party of 60 Argyleshire folk & 30 of the Duke of Kingston\u2019s Light Horse have been totally Surprised at Keith by a Superior Number of the rebels, some killed & the rest taken prisoner after a smart resistance, Sandy's Arm Cutt off and otherwayes Sorely wounded.\u201d\n\tThe skirmish at Keith had a bad effect on Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell's men.[37] \u201cThere has been great numbers deserted & a General discontent nay even a mutiny thro the whole.\u201d Eventually Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell agreed to send representatives back to Argyll to distribute meal to the families of the soldiers, but urged his father, General John Campbell, to punish deserters severely.\n\nThe Jacobite Rising\n\tIn June 1745 Lord Loudoun\u2019s officer were already recruiting in the Highlands. Lord Loudoun travelled north to Inverness in early July where he learned that Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, had landed on the west coast of Scotland. Lord Loudoun, having sustained a riding accident in the north, hurried back to Edinburgh, where was appointed Adjutant General to General Sir John Cope\u2019s hastily formed army. Sir John Cope determined to march north to Fort Augustus, in the Great Glen, to stifle the Rising. \n\tSir John Cope commanded some 1,500 men with five companies of Colonel Lee\u2019s Regiment; eight companies of Colonel Lascelles\u2019 Regiment; ten companies of Colonel Thomas Murray\u2019s Regiment; two Additional Companies of Lord John Murray\u2019s Old Highland Regiment and some men of Lord Loudoun\u2019s New Highland Regiment. Almost at once Lieutenant Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry joined the Jacobites with men from the Major\u2019s and Captain John Murray\u2019s Companies. Captain John Murray was the 16 year old son of Lord George Murray and nephew of the Duke of Atholl. He was a scholar at Eton College and never came north. Ewan MacPherson of Cluny, having been snubbed by Sir John Cope raised his clan for the Young Pretender.\n\tAt Dalwhinnie Sir John Cope, supported by all the senior officers, including Lord Loudoun, thinking that the steep Corrieyarrick Pass nearby was already in the hands of the rebels, decided to march to Inverness. Prince Charles and the Highland Clans poured south to take Perth, bypass Stirling and seize Edinburgh.\n\tAt Inverness Sir John Cope decided to march to Aberdeen and sail to Leith, the port of Edinburgh. His army was joined by four of Lord Loudoun\u2019s companies; the Colonel\u2019s company, 10 centinels; Captain Stuart\u2019s, 39 centinels; Captain Harry Munro\u2019s, 67 centinels, and the officer less Captain Murray\u2019s with 16 centinels. Sir Patrick Murray\u2019s Additional Company of the Old Highland Regiment numbered 40 centinels. Just before sailing from Aberdeen, Lord Loudoun was joined by Captain Alexander Mackay, with 67 centinels. The Highland Regiments numbered 12 officers, 14 sergeants, 11 corporals, 7 drummers and 243 centinels.8\n\n'''The Battle of Prestonpans'''\n\tSir John Cope\u2019s Army disembarked at Dunbar on 17th September having heard that Edinburgh had capitulated to the Rebels the night before.\n\tSir John Cope marched west towards Musselburgh and Edinburgh and took up a position on the plain at Prestonpans, below Trannent. Changing position three times during the day, Sir John Copes army was facing east when in the early dawn the Rebels, having passed through a marsh, at night, made a furious dawn charge from the east. Sir John Cope\u2019s two dragoon regiments, on the flanks, broke and the infantry followed. \n\tLord Loudoun was later to send a detailed account of the Battle to Sir John Cope.[9] Lord Loudoun, with Sir John Cope, succeeded in gathering most of the Dragoons together west of Preston village but the Dragoons would not stand. Sir John Cope decided that he could not ride towards Edinburgh. Instead he rode south to Lauder and Coldstream and next day arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\tLord Loudoun\u2019s Highlanders had been withdrawn to Cockenzie House to guard Sir John Cope\u2019s baggage. Lieutenant Colonel Peter Halkett, of Lee\u2019s, having been made prisoner by Lord George Murray, was sent to Cockenzie House and persuaded the Highlanders to surrender.\n\tLord Loudoun wrote[10] that \u201cThere was lost at the Battle Mackays, Stuarts and Monros Companys Complete, part of my Company and part of Capt Murrays & an Officer and 7 Men of Capt Sutherlands whom we meet by Accident a recruiting.\u201d \n       \u201cNever was there a Regiment raised at so unlucky a time, nor yet was there such a Number of men rais\u2019d in so short a time. I have lost all my best Officers for the present Mackay, Stuart, Mcnab all Prisoners and all good Men.\u201d10  Despite Lord Loudoun\u2019s comment, as many as 100 Highlanders may have escaped from the battle. More importantly \u201cGovernor\u201d Campbell escaped with Lord Loudoun\u2019s papers and his money. Sir John Cope lost \u00a33,000 at the battle. The captured Highlanders were eventually released and were sent home. Many of the men re-joined the Regiment in December 1745. The officers were paroled and sent to Perth and then Angus and Fife and were to play no further part in the Rising until February 1746. Ensign Malcolm Ross of Pitcalnie joined the Rebels. \t  \t  \t\n\n'''The Argyll Companies'''\n\tIn early July, from Edinburgh, Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell had made his way west to Glasgow, which city he represented in Parliament, and to Rosneath, the Duke of Argyll\u2019s house on Loch Long. It was there that he first had news that the Young Pretender had landed on the west coast. He hurried to Inveraray where the Duke was rebuilding a palace to replace his castle. \n\tLieutenant Colonel John Campbell had three companies in Argyll. \nLieutenant Colonel\t\tLieutenant Colin Campbell\tEnsign Archibald Campbell \n\t\t  \t\t    of Kilberrie\t  \t   son of Achallader\nCapt Alexander Campbell\tLieutenant John Campbell\t\tEnsign Daniel MacNeill \n  of Ardkinglas\t  \t            of Strachur\nCapt Colin Campbell\t\tLieutenant John Campbell\tEnsign Robert Bisset\n  younger of Ballemore\t            younger of Ardslignish.\n        In addition there were four officers from other companies: Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure, Captain Munro\u2019s; Lieutenant Alexander Campbell, Barcaldine, 2nd Lt Grenadiers; Lieutenant Hugh Maclean, younger of Kingairloch, Captain Mackay\u2019s; Lieutenant Patrick Campbell, Captain Sutherland\u2019s.\n\tBy mid-November the three Argyll Companies were complete and a further 40 men had been collected for the Regiment. By the middle of December 500 militia had been gathered at Inveraray and 2,000 more were ready to march in. There were 10 canons at Inveraray and a parapet had been built.\n\tOn 21st December Major General John Campbell of Mamore arrived at Inveraray to command the Militia in the west. On 23rd the General\u2019s son, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, led 600 men out of Inveraray towards Stirling. 600 more men followed the next day. But on 25th December Captain Alexander Campbell died at Inveraray. He was not to be replaced until April 1746.\n\tOn 27th December 600 Argyll men arrived at Dumbarton. On 28th December Captain John Noble wrote[11] that \u201cI Cloath'd Lord Loudoun\u2019s Comy's yesterday are some spare Shoulder belts which I intend to give to the millicy as far as they'll go.\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell had ordered brogues from Glasgow.\n\tEach soldier received a shirt and neckcloth; a scarlet vest and coat, faced in white; 12 yards of tartan cut in two and sewn together into a plaid; four pairs of red and white checked hose; a blue bonnet with a black cockade and a pair of brogues.\n\n'''The Inverness Companies'''\n\tLord Loudoun had escaped from the Battle of Prestonpans and rode with Sir John Cope to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Lord Loudoun was then given command of all the King\u2019s forces in the north of Scotland. By 10th October he was back at Inverness. With Duncan Forbes, Lord President, he set about raising 19 Independent Companies from the Munros, Mackays, Sutherlands, MacLeods, MacDonalds, MacKenzies, Grants and from Inverness itself.\n\tMajor William MacKenzie was at Inverness. Lieutenant Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry had joined the Rebels and was Lieutenant Colonel of the Glengarry Regiment at Prestonpans. Ensign James Stuart younger of Urrard was at Inverness. Capt John MacLeod, younger of MacLeod, was with Lieutenant Donald MacDonald and Ensign John Martin. Lord Charles Gordon\twas with Ensign George Munro of Novar. Patrick Grant had been given command of the Grant Independent Company. Capt MacPherson, younger of Cluny had raised his clan for the Young Pretender but his subalterns were at Inverness; Lieutenant James MacPherson of Killiehuntly and Ensign James Fraser. Capt Sutherland of Forse was the only officer in his company since Lieutenant Patrick Campbell was in Argyll and Ensign John Grant younger of Dalrachnie had been made prisoner at Prestonpans.\n\tLord Loudoun was later to write[12] that \u201cwhen I left you I begun with 150 Men in a town ready to cut my throat and my Neighbours the Frassers threatening to attack me every night I augmented by very slow degrees and with numbers difficultys to have 2000 want of Arms want of Money were often my Case and Mutines my Dayly Bread and this with a sett of People that excepin my Major [MacKenzie] whom you know not one Man under my Command that I was aquainted with in May last [in Flanders] However with Coxing and Guiding of Officers and marching a foot in Kilt in Frost and Snow I have got over all that and I have great reason to believe I am extramly well with them.\u201d \n\tAlso at Inverness was the rump of Captain Aeneas Mackintosh\u2019s Additional Company of Lord John Murray\u2019s Old Highland Regiment, The Black Watch. Captain Mackintosh\u2019s wife, Anne Farquharson, had raised 200 men of her husband\u2019s clan for the Prince.\n\tLord Loudoun saw Duncan Forbes, the Lord President, at Culloden House almost every day. With Captain Mackintosh he often rode down to Moy to dine with Lady Mackintosh.\n\tTowards the end of December the Inverness Companies were at last cloathed. The coats, vests and shirts had come from John Mann[13] in London and the tartan for the plaids from James Seton[14] in Edinburgh. The tents, equipment, and 939 muskets, designed to Lord Loudoun\u2019s pattern, with powder and shot were despatched from London.15 In being transferred from a tender to the ship the packets were dropped in the sea and had to be recovered, dried and re-oiled. It was to be an age before they reached Inverness.\n\tIn late December Norman MacLeod of MacLeod, commanding seven Independent Companies marched south east towards Aberdeen but was surprised at Inverurie. Malcolm MacCrimmon, MacLeod\u2019s piper, was made prisoner.\n\n'''The Rebels return to the north'''\n\tThe Young Pretender marched his army south from Edinburgh to Carlisle, and Manchester as far as Derby. Few English Jacobites joined the Prince and finally, on 5th December, the Rebels turned and started marching back to Scotland. Despite hot pursuit from two British Armies, one commanded by the Duke of Cumberland who had been recalled from Flanders, the Jacobites crossed back into Scotland, entered Glasgow and then began a siege of Stirling Castle.\n\tGeneral Henry Hawley had replaced Sir John Cope as commander in Scotland. Though he had good intelligence of the movement of the Rebels, on 17th January 1746, he had to rush his forces up a steep hill from Falkirk to meet them.[16] Though the Dragoons made a better display than at Prestonpans, they eventually broke and swept most of the Royal Army off the field.  Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell, with three companies of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment and the Argyll Militia were on the lower ground, but were trampled on by the fleeing dragoons and infantry. Three men of the Argyll companies were killed at the battle.\n\tBy the end of January the Duke of Cumberland had been sent from London to command in the north. He instilled some much needed backbone into his father\u2019s troops. The King considered that the Jacobites were rebels and therefore that their parole was invalid. All the paroled officers, taken at Prestonpans, much to their unease, were ordered back to duty.\nIn London the Ministry resigned and was replaced. Two days later the new Ministry resigned and the formed Ministry took charge. Sir John Cope wrote[17] that \u201cThe unaccountable changes which have happened this last Week in London has been as extraordinary an Event, as even a beginning, carrying on, and I hope now, the ending of the Rebellion, to which I wish most sincerely your Lordp may be in condition to put ye finishing stroke to.\u201d\n       In Scotland the Young Pretender withdrew from Stirling and marched north to Crieff and Blair Atholl. Lord George Murray, with the other half of the Rebels, marched towards Aberdeen with the Duke of Cumberland in pursuit.\n       By mid-February the Young Pretender was in Strathspey and captured Ruthven Barracks. He marched closer to Inverness and spent the night at Moy Hall, the home of Anne Farquharson, Lady MacKintosh, who had raised her husband\u2019s clan for the Prince. Lord Loudoun received news that the Prince was at Moy guarded by only a few men. He marched 1,500 of his Regiment and the Independent Companies out of Inverness towards Moy but was surprised by Donald Fraser, the Moy blacksmith, with a handful of men. The Independent Companies fled and in the fire a dropping shot killed a piper at Lord Loudoun\u2019s foot. The piper was Donald MacCrimmon, piper to Captain Macleod\u2019s company. Lord Loudoun was forced to retire to Inverness in what the Jacobites called the Rout of Moy.[18]\n\n'''Retreat to Sutherland'''\n\tLeaving two Independent Companies at Inverness Castle, called Fort George, Lord Loudoun ferried his Regiment and the remaining 16 Independent Companies across the Kessock Ferry to the Black Isle. The MacKenzie Companies deserted to their homes.\n\tLord Loudoun marched his men across the Black Isle and crossed by ferry to Nigg. and moved to Balnagowan. A weekly return was made[19] of Lord Loudoun's Regiment at Balnagowan on Saturday 22nd February. 28 men had deserted from Captain Mackay's company and 7 from Sir Harry Munro's. This was particularly galling for the two Captains, newly released from parole. They, with the other paroled officers, had been trying to re-join Lord Loudoun at the moment that he had abandoned Inverness. \n\tThe Independent Companies at Fort George surrendered after two days. The Earl of Cromartie marched out of Inverness and Lord Loudoun crossed his men over the Kyles of Sutherland, defending a line from Dornoch to the Falls of Shin. Lord Loudoun's Regiment at Dornoch numbered, for the first time, 7 Captains, with the Major absent, 3 Lieutenants and 5 Ensigns, with one Ensign absent. There were also the Adjutant, Quartermaster and Surgeon; 21 sergeants, 6 drummers and 18 corporals. There were 187 men fit for duty and 18 men sick. Since the last return 5 men had deserted.\n\tAlso listed on the return was Captain Aeneas Mackintosh\u2019s Additional Company of Lord John Murray's Regiment, The Black Watch. His subalterns, Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenlyon and Ensign James Grant of Glenmoriston were present with 3 sergeants, a drummer, and 2 corporals. There were only 5 men with one man sick.\n\n'''Lord Loudoun\u2019s wife'''\n         Lord Loudoun was said not to be married but the Earl of Sutherland wrote[20] to Lord Loudoun on 27th February. Lord Loudoun answered that \u201cI beg your lordship will be so good as make my complements acceptable to my Lady Sutherland and my love to my wife, and my complements to the Major [Mackay].\u201d\n\tLord Loudoun\u2019s wife, K MacDougall, Countess of Loudoun, had travelled north from London by boat and was at Dunrobin Castle with the Earl and Countess of Sutherland.\n\tIn March 1745 Captain George MacDougall of the North British Dragoons, or Greys, wrote[21] from Edinburgh that \u201cI have the honour of your Lordships letter, and would fain make fine Speeches in name of the Grays, but can not find words kind enough to express my self, I must therefore recommend it to your Spouse to make up her fathers want of Eloquence in love, and in the meantime desire the favour of K----- to kiss you for me, which shall be repayed with interest at Meeting.\u201d\nGuarding the Sutherland shore\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland had marched from Perth to Aberdeen inspiring some much needed discipline in his men. On 7th March the Duke ordered[22] Lord Loudoun and his command to cross the Moray Firth. Lord Loudoun replied that he needed boats from the southern shore of the Firth to get across. \n\tThe Duke of Cumberland wrote[23] to the Duke of Newcastle that Lord Loudoun and the Lord President \u201cplainly show an aversion to the imbarking & coming Southward, which I shall readily dispense with, as my only view in bringing them south was that they should not have to say, we refused making use of their assistance. But I think it much more for the Honour of his Majesty\u2019s Forces & of the nation, to finish this affair, without any further use of the Highlanders, than plundering and sending out parties. I propose therefore letting them know that I shall not expect their coming to join me till I get to Inverness.\u201d\n\tThick fog prevented the British ships from guarding the Sutherland Shore. Moir of Stoneywood collected boats from Moray and the Duke of Perth marched out of Inverness to Dingwall and Tain. On the morning of 20th March, in thick fog, the Rebels cross the Kyles of Sutherland.\n\tLord Loudoun was to write[24] that \u201cI sett out that morning at seven to vissit the postes, and by the time I had got about three milles I got the alarm \u2026 and gave me an account of the numbers as above, being landed out of 70 boats. I then gallopt forward, tho quite by myself, to trie if I could discover what there numbers realy were, but the fog was so very thick that I could see nothing.\u201d\n\tA volunteer in Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment was later to write[25] that \u201cUpon the alarm being given the Major [MacKenzie] beat to arms & immediately gott together about 120 of the Regiment.\n\t\u201cWith these he proceeded towards the place of landing expecting to be joined by the Mckay\u2019s to see if possible to beat them off. Upon our march we were informed that all at ones they landed about 800 men, \n\t\u201cWe marched on and quickly found ourselves within half muskett-shott of at least 600 men, besides the 300 who were gone up above us whom we could not see. Then we could observe 18 Murray boats 8 or 10 of which were landing more men & the rest under sail returning for others.\n\u201cWe retired to Dornock which they perceived marched about 500 men after us. Here we had time to throw some small quantity of Ammunition into a Ditch & proceeded to gett if possible over the ferry at ferry-oons.\u201d [Loch Fleet]\n        \u201cBut about a mile to the northwards of Dornoch I don't know what panick saized them but that they were for capitulating.\u201d\n        Captains Alexander Mackay, Sir Harry Munro, Lieutenant John Reid and Ensign Alexander Maclaggan had been made prisoners at Prestonpans and made the best of their escape. They were joined by Lord Charles Gordon, Captain John MacLeod and Ensign and Adjutant Robert Grant, with some of the men.\nMajor Mackenzie was made prisoner by Lieutenant-Colonel Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry, commissioned into Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment. \n\tCaptain Aeneas Mackintosh, with a handful of men from Lord John Murray\u2019s additional company, was made prisoner by Donald Fraser, the blacksmith from Moy. \n\tIntelligence from Sutherland reported[26] that at Ferry-oons, [Loch Fleet] the money was put \u201caboard of an open boat and lodged it first in the Vulture Sloop and afterwards in the Shark Sloop when the Vulture sailed South.\u201d Lord Loudoun\u2019s military chest and his papers, with \u201cGovenor\u201d Campbell, had again escaped the Rebels.\nLord Loudoun, with Duncan Forbes, headed west to the Isle of Skye, with several Independent Companies. Captain MacKay headed north into Sutherland with some of the men of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment.\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland concluded[27] that \u201cHis Majesty must have observed how negligently these Highlanders who are with us do their duty \u2026 Lord Loudoun\u2019s people have suffered themselves to be surprised at Dornoch from the Murray side by a few boats \u2026 I am much sorrier for the appearance of the affair than for the thing itself, as I have never expected much assistance from them.\u201d\n\n'''The Hazard Sloop'''\n        Captain Alexander Mackay, with some of the men of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment headed north to Tongue. The Sheerness sloop drove the Hazard sloop, renamed Prince Charles, into the Kyles of Sutherland. After a long bombardment the French officers on board Hazard went ashore, taking a large quantity of gold with them. They were pursued through the night and next morning were surrounded and taken.\n\tEnsign Aeneas Mackay wrote[28] that \u201cthe Prise mony was taken and carried to Tongue by order of the Commanding Officer as they say to the Ammount of Eight Thousand pounds Sterling tho Some call it more.\u201d\n\tLieutenant Daniel Forbes wrote[29] that though Ensign Mackay and \u201cYour Petitioner, without Ostentation were the Main Instruments of bringing all to this desirable issue, and of Saving from Embazlement in the field a Bag of Gold and three Boxes Containing Upwards of \u00a38,000 Sterl, The whole of it was carryed to Tongue the Place of Lord Reays Residence, there it was divided as his Lops three Sons & the above ment officers of your Regiment Thought proper, without Consulting Ensign Mackay or your Petitioner in the Scheme of Division, & tho Each drew \u00a3700 They gave him & me betwixt us no more than \u00a3300.\u201d\n\tLord Cathcart later wrote[30] to Lord Loudoun from Aberdeen that \u201cI give your Lordship the trouble of this to acquaint you that yesterday we were joined by your Captains McKay, Sir Harry, [Munro] Ld Charles, [Gordon] and Laird of Mcleod, with 20 [French] Officers and 150 private prisoners. They had taken in Strathnavrin after they had been driven on shore from the Hazard Sloop by the Sheerness. They had likewise taken about 12,000\u00a3 in money. Your Lordship\u2019s Governour Mr Camel with your papers and all your money was of the party. His R.H. has taken the specie for which Capt Mckay has a receipt, and I have sent Campbell with the Portmantel and Papers to Edgh.\u201d [Edinburgh]\n\n'''The Argyllshire Companies in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire'''\n\tOn 20th January 1746 Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, at [South] Queensferry, made a return[31] of his Company. Present in Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell's company were himself; Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Kilberrie and Ensign Archibald Campbell. There were 5 sergeants; 3 corporals, 2 drummers and 59 Centinels. The Centinels sick present were 2; sick left behind 4; on command 4; lost at Falkirk 3. Total 72 Centinels. \n\tAs the Young Pretender withdrew north, the Duke of Cumberland pursued him. On 5th February the Duke was at Crieff, with the Young Pretender only 25 miles away at Weem, north of Taybridge. The Duke of Cumberland travelled to Perth. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell commanded more than 1,000 Argyll men in the Duke's army. \n\tOn 20th February Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell was ordered[32] to leave 420 of his men to be posted in North Perthshire. On 21st February he marched east towards Dundee and Aberdeen, keeping between the foothills of the Grampian Mountains and the Royal Army.\n\tLieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell reached Aberdeen[33] on 26th February. Two days later Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, with some of Cobham's Dragoons under his command, marched out to Old Meldrum.\n\tOn 12th March Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell was joined at Old Meldrum, 15 miles north of Aberdeen, by General Bland with Kingston's Light Horse and four infantry Battalions.\n\tMeanwhile 420 of the Argyll Militia had been ordered north to guard a line from Blair Atholl, Tummel and Kynachan to Kinloch Rannoch. Amongst the Militia officers were three from Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment. Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure, of Sir Harry Munro\u2019s Company; Lieutenant Patrick Campbell of Captain Sutherland\u2019s Company and Lieutenant Hugh Maclean of Kingarlosk of Captain Alexander Mackay\u2019s Company.\n\tOn the night of 16th March Lord George Murray, with Ewan MacPherson[34] of Cluny, surprised the Militia posts in North Perthshire, taking 16 officers and 400 prisoners. Captain Campbell of Knockbuy, commanding at Kynachan, and Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure, commanding at Kinlochrannoch, had been absent from their posts.\n\tAmongst the officers taken prisoner were Lieutenant Patrick Campbell and Lieutenant Hugh Maclean of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment.\n\n'''Surprise at Keith'''\n\tAs the attack was taking place in Blair Atholl and Rannoch, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell marched towards Strathbogie. General Bland came up at noon, and together they surprised the Rebels commanded by John Roy Stuart and Gordon of Avochie in the town of Huntly, 22 miles away. Captain Colin Campbell of Ballemore took a detachment to Keith, 10 miles further north-west, but returned to Huntly. \n\tOn 20th March Lieutenant Alexander Campbell, Barcaldine's brother, with a handpicked command of 60 men and 30 Light Horse marched as far as Fochabers, 7 miles beyond Keith, and then retired to Keith as night fell. Just after 1am the Rebels attacked and Lieutenant Alexander Campbell hurried back to the guard house, cutting his way through the Rebels. Lieutenant Alexander Campbell later wrote[35] that \u201cWhen I came to the Guard house I found everything in disorder, four of the men killed, the Captain wounded and what remained of the men in the house quite inactive in their duty. I told Ardslignish that the only chance left is now for our Lives and reputation was to make a brisk attempt to gett thro' the enemy back again which he agreed to, we both Rushed out of the house but could not make our post good. He was immediately taken prisoner upon his getting out of the Door\u2026 a fellow came behind me with a clubbed firelock and knocked me down, and then they slashed at me with till they left me in the miserable pickle I am now in: for I gott no cut while I was standing except one across the Face and Nose. After I was flatt upon the ground I gott a wound in the head, one in the right shoulder, and a very bad one in the left wrist which is the one now confines me to my bed.\u201d Lieutenant Alexander Campbell was left for dead, but after twenty minutes staggered out to a farm where eventually he was bound up and the next day found a military surgeon.\n\tDavid Campbell wrote[36] that \u201cSandy Campbell a Brother of Barcaldine's belonging to your Lordships Regiment, with an advance party of 60 Argyleshire folk & 30 of the Duke of Kingston\u2019s Light Horse have been totally Surprised at Keith by a Superior Number of the rebels, some killed & the rest taken prisoner after a smart resistance, Sandy's Arm Cutt off and otherwayes Sorely wounded.\u201d\n\tThe skirmish at Keith had a bad effect on Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell's men.[37] \u201cThere has been great numbers deserted & a General discontent nay even a mutiny thro the whole.\u201d Eventually Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell agreed to send representatives back to Argyll to distribute meal to the families of the soldiers, but urged his father, General John Campbell, to punish deserters severely.\n\n'''The Battle of Culloden'''\n\tOn 8th April the Duke of Cumberland left Aberdeen, concentrating his Army at Cullen on 11th, where Lord Albemarle joined him with Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell's Argyllshire men. The Army crossed the River Spey on 12th April and entered Elgin the following day. On 14th April the Army had reached Nairn, and the next day, being the Duke's birthday, rested.\n\t\u201cThe 16th,\u201d wrote[38] Captain Campbell of Airds, \u201cthe army decampt early, officers & soldiers in the Highest Spirits.\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell's men were divided into two parties to guard the Army's flanks with some of Kingston's Light Horse. They were joined by the officers of Lord Loudoun's Regiment, newly arrived from Tongue on board Hazard, with Ensign John Grant of Dalrachnie, already at Aberdeen, and some 60 men of Lord Loudoun's Regiment.\n\tCaptain Colin Campbell of Ballemore, commanded his own company of Lord Loudoun's New Highland Regiment, and three Argyll Militia companies, totalling about 140 men, were on the left flank. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell with his own company and Ardkinglas's company, and the remainder of the Argyll Militia were stationed on the right. Each party was ordered to fall back when the Army engaged the Rebels, to defend the baggage.\n\tCaptain Colin Campbell of Ballemore, on the left, did not retire. His men climbed and demolished some walls so that General Hawley's and General Bland's cavalry could ride through.\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland wrote[39] that \u201cOur horse on the left under Generals Hawley and Bland, had by the Help of some of our Highlanders who behaved very well broke down two little Park walls.\u201d \n \tCaptain Colin Campbell of Ballemore's men turned right and advanced up the slope towards another field dyke, where Ballemore's men came into contact with Lord George Murray's Atholl Brigade, on the right flank of the Rebel Army.\n\tDespite a desperate charge by the Jacobite right wing, the Regiments on the Duke of Cumberland\u2019s left held fast and poured in a devastating fire. In twenty minutes the Rebels were riven from the field.\n\tPassing a \u201cslap\u201d in the wall, Captain Colin Campbell of Ballemore was shot dead and Captain Campbell of Achnaba, of the Argyll Militia, was mortally wounded.\n\tAn unnamed report[40] from Edinburgh stated that \u201cCollodoun Moor is Covered with the Slain, of the Rebels In so much that he had Difficulty to get thro them and adds further he was told that the Killed and prisoners of the rebels would amount to above three thousand that the Pretenders son was reported to be wounded in the thigh.\n\t\u201cThere was a Good number of the Rebels taken Prisoners and above three hundred French. Later Expresses mention Lord Ogilvy Locheil and the Duke of Perth amongst the Killed.\u201d\n\n'''The shattered remains of your Regiment'''\n\tLieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, who had been on the field of battle, on the left flank and then withdrawn to the baggage guard at the rear, wrote[41] on 25th April, nine days after the battle that \u201cI had the shatterd remains of Your regiment out this day which I could not do before as most of the officers were absent.\n\t\u201cYour Lordship knows that all our camp necessarys are taken and that by several of the men being taken prisoners a great many of the arms are lost in short never poor regiment was in such order and I don\u2019t understand how it will be possible for us to march in this country without tents. \n\t\u201cI shall represent the state of the Regiment to his Royal Highness & desire we may have a little time to put ourselves in condition to march with the army especially as Capt Mcleods, Sutherlands, & Mcays companys would be soon completed if we could stay here a little but I beg your Lordship would write to the Duke on this head. \n\t\u201cThere is some cloathing on board a ship here. I should be glad to know if I am to distribute it to those that have been strip\u2019t by the rebells. The Major & the rest of the officers taken at Dornich after being examind by a committee of General officers are orderd to do their duty as formerly.\n\u201cCapt Campbell of Ballemore was killed at the action  the few men of Your regiment who were ingaged behav\u2019d uncomparably well Myself & most of the men were orderd to guard the baggage. The three Argyleshire companys considering our loss at Keith & are very compleat. I should be glad to know if You don\u2019t think it necessary to order a new set of camp equipment from Edinr.\u201d\n\tAt Inverness Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell was attempting to piece together Lord Loudoun's Regiment. He wrote[41] about the vacant Commissions in Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment. \u201cYou are likely to have two Captains put in your Regiment the one of which deserves nothing less than a halter, [to be hanged] and the other nothing more than a halberd [to be a sergeant]\u201d\n\tOne of the officers was Lieutenant John [correctly James] Campbell [of Stronslany], Lieutenant in Lord John Murray\u2019s Regiment, The Black Watch, the other [Alexander] Grant [of Knockando] also of Lord John Murray\u2019s Regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell hoped that Lord Loudoun would prevent the appointments.\n\tOn 8th May the Duke of Cumberland noted[42] that there were two vacancies in Lord Loudoun's Regiment, through the death of Captain Campbell and by the Captain killed at Culloden. The Duke recommended Lieutenant Alexander Grant and Lieutenant James Campbell. They were both officers of Lord John Murray's Highland Regiment, but had been sent to Scotland to recruit.\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland could not understand why Lord Loudoun's Regiment had thirteen companies, when all other Regiments had only 12 companies. Knowing that Captain John Murray had never served with the Regiment and that his two subaltern's had joined the Rebels, he wrote to the Duke of Newcastle reducing Lord Loudoun's Regiment to 12 companies.\n\tThe commissions for the two new Captains were signed  by the King on 23rd May but neither of the men were to learn of their preferments until the autumn.\n\tThe King also took the unprecedented step of issuing new orders to raise Lord Loudoun's Regiment.\n\n'''Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment in Aberdeenshire'''\n\tCaptain Harry Munro\u2019s father had been killed at the Battle of Falkirk. His son was now Sir Harry Munro. He had marched east to Cullin where some of his men had mutinied. Captain Alexander Mackay wrote[43] that \u201cThe ringleader of them was immediately put into prison, where there happen'd to be lying a rusty firelock belonging to the rebels, & the serjant that confin'd him forgot to take of his cartouch box. He loaded the firelock & shot him throu the window. The occasion of the mutiny, as I am told, was there not being allowed to plunder.\u201d The unfortunate officer killed was Ensign Alexander Maclaggan.\n\tThe Duke of Cumberland had written[44] on 19th May that the Major was to march \u201cthrough the Hills to Strathbogie with my Lord Loudoun's Battalion, which consists at present of between two and three hundred men & who are in very bad order.\u201d\n\tOn 23rd May the Duke of Cumberland, in triumph, left Inverness and marched south west along Loch Ness to Fort Augustus. Lord Loudoun, commanding the Independent Companies, moved further down the Great Glen to Aberchirder. Major General John Campbell moved the Argyll Militia north to Fort William. The Royal Army was now at the centre of the Rebels lands of the Camerons and the MacDonells of Glengarry.\n\n'''Major MacKenzie marched east towards Aberdeenshire.'''\n\tThe Return of Detachmen[45] of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment, on 29th May,  commanded by Major MacKenzie were: 4 Captains, 6 Lieutenants, 7 Ensigns, 1 Quartermaster, 1 Surgeon 23 Sergeants 9 Drums, 18 Corporals 312 Private men, making 330 rank and file fit for duty.\n\tOn 14th June Lord Loudoun's Regiment was spread about Aberdeenshire,[46] at Strathbogie, Invercauld, Skeliter, Tarlan, Abergeldie, for a total of 4 Captains, 6 Lieutenants, 7 Ensign and 300 men.\n\tAt Inverness on 11th June Captain John Stuart made a return[47]  of the men in Lord Loudoun's Regiment. There were 2 sergeants, 2 drummers and 23 men fit for duty, with 17 men sick, 4 on furlough and 4 recruiting, making 48 men in total.\n\tMajor William MacKenzie ruffled his officers\u2019 feathers by arresting Captain John MacLeod and Ensign John Martin and then arresting Lord Charles Gordon for leaving their posts without leave.\n\tMajor William MacKenzie was ordered to march the Regiment to Ruthven, which it reached on 14th August. On 23rd August the Regiment crossed the Corrieyarrick Pass and marched into Fort Augustus. Lord Albemarle, now commanding in Scotland had retired to Edinburgh.\n\tCaptain William Wilkinson wrote[48] from London on 5th June \u201cI have long wish'd and waited for an open Commission of Letters with your Lordship, having a hundred Things to say and a hundred to that, and don't know where to begin, or where to End.\n\t\u201cAs to the Accounts of the Regiment It's utterly impossible for me to make out any thing like an Abstract Either for the officers or the Companys.\n\t\u201cBut this state is in general measure Overturn'd by H.R.Hs. Letter to The Duke of Newcastle which reduced your Regiment to 12 Companys and how that will be adjusted is more than I can yet comprehend \u2013 For if there were no Men raised, we all know there were Officers for 13 Companys And besides the Subsistance the Assignment has been made out and allow'd for 13 Companys, and money issued for Accoutrements, So that it will prove a ravell'd hasp, very difficult to Rid.\u201d\nLord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment at Fort Augustus\n\tLord Loudoun had been commanding the 18 Independent Companies in the heart of the Highlands. Many people had been appalled by the Duke of Cumberland\u2019s harsh measures. By comparison many of the rebels were prepared to surrender to Lord Loudoun, including Simon Fraser, Master of Lovat and Donald MacDonald of Lochgarry. The Earl of Stair was to write[49] that \u201call other methods of Changing of Language, changing of habits, and Transportations seem to me to be Intailing the heatred of every Highlander against this government for ever, which cannot be without great Danger.\u201d\n\tLord Loudoun and his officers set about recruiting men for the Regiment.\n\tOn 1st September Lord Loudoun made[50] a return of his Regiment to Lord Albemarle. Lord Loudoun was present with his Major, 5 Captains, 10 Lieutenants and 9 Ensigns. The Adjutant, Quartermaster and Surgeon were present. There were 27 Sergeants and 15 drummers. There were 475 men fit for duty and 24 men sick. There were 14 men recruiting, making a total of 573 men.  The Regiment was wanting 303 men to complete. 60 men had been listed since the last return, 5 discharged, 6 deserted and 3 had died.\n\tJohn Campbell of Strachur, the senior Lieutenant was promoted Captain-Lieutenat in the Colonel\u2019s company. James Fraser was promoted to replace Lieutenant Donald MacDonald who had deserted to the Rebels. Alexander Maclaggan, murdered at Cullen was replaced by Patrick or Peter Campbell. Robert Grant, formerly Sergeant Major of the Old Highland Regiment was appointed Ensign in Sir Harry Munro\u2019s company in place of Malcolm Ross who had joined the Rebels. Lieutenant Patrick Grant had gone to command the Grant Independent Company and was replaced by Lieutenant John Murray, originally preferred in August 1745. Archibald Campbell was promoted Lieutenant in Captain John Sutherland\u2019s company. Captain-Lieutenant Archibald MacNab was promoted Captain in place of Ewan MacPherson who joined the Rebels. Hugh Arnott was the new Ensign. In Captain Alexander Campbell\u2019s company Daniel MacNeill was promoted Lieutenant. There were five new Ensigns.\n\n'''Reducing the Independent Companies'''\n\tLord Albemarle wrote[51] that \u201can order from His Majesty thro\u2019 the Duke of Newcastle to reduce all the Independent Companies under your Command wch I beg you will comply wth forthwith, taking all the Arms from the them, wch you will be pleased to lodge at Inverness, in the care of Genl Blakeney.\n\t \u201cAs by this reduction you will be very much weakened at Fort Augustus it will be absolutely necessary that Your Lordship shoud forthwith compleat your Regt out of ye best men of the Companys that are reduced, wch will not only be a Sufficient number to do duty at that Place, but also enable you to send Detachments now & then from thence where you shall think it necessary.\u201d\n\n'''The Young Pretender sailed out of Loch nan Uamh'''\n\tThe Young Pretender had escaped to the Western Isles and then crossed back to Skye. Information had been circulating through the Highlands that the Young Pretender was attempting to make his escape from Scotland. \n\tAeneas MacDonald of Scotus, whose son joined the Jacobites and whose grandson was a volunteer with Lord Loudoun, wrote[52] on 27th September that the French ships had sailed away \u201cuntil 16th and returned to some creek and came further in than they were before. There they continued without admitting any man on board until Fryday the nineteenth that the Young Pretender actually arriv\u2019d and in company with him Locheil; [MacDonald of] Loch Gary, the Doctor Locheils brother [Archie Cameron] and John Roy Stuart. These with two Barisdales were all brought alongst and upon their embarking all other who had gone on board before were set on shore and left.\u201d\n\tOn 21st September 1746 Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, sailed out of Loch nan Uamh to fame and immortality. The lands and houses of the men who had followed him lay burned and in ruins, the cattle driven away by avenging soldiers.\n\n'''Completing Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment'''\n\tOn 21st October the return[53] for Lord Loudoun's Regiment showed that numbers had increased by 29 men to 790 men, wanting 50 men to complete. 7 men had been listed, 2 men had been discharged and 3 men had died.\n\tFinally, on 18th November 1746 Lord Loudoun's Regiment was complete.[54] Lord Loudoun was at Fort Augustus to see his Regimental ambition rewarded. 12 men had been listed to complete the Regiment. In the past five weeks 11 men had been discharged and 12 men had died. There were still 46 men out recruiting, but there were also 77 men sick, with 51 at Fort Augustus and 26 elsewhere, a sharp improvement from the 132 men sick, with 104 at Fort Augustus and 28 elsewhere, of three weeks previously.\n\tOn the 16th, 17th and 18th November all the companies in Lord Loudoun's Regiment, for the first time, made Nominal Returns of their men.\n\tThe Regiment, however, was chronically short of cloathing. \n\tOn 25th June 1746, each sergeant, drummer, corporal and centinel should have received a new coat \u2013 the old one was turned into a waistcoat - new shifts, new hose and a new bonnet, with the Second Assignment. At that date Lord Loudoun's Regiment numbered some 540 rank and file and while all of them may have had plaids, only some 480 had coats and waistcoats. Some 60 men were without coats and waistcoats.\n\tThe Regimental tartan, which was dark green and dark blue, divided by black, with yellow and blue stripes. [Seton, James.[55] Tartan sample. Thread count: Red 7 Black 7 Blue 49 Black 46 Green 41 Yellow 6.] Later James Seton was to send a sample of red and white \u201ccada\u201d tartan for hose. [Red 48, white 48, 40.5mm per square. Seton, James.[56]]\n\tOn 21st October, Lord Loudoun's Regiment numbered[57] 790 rank and file. 440 men had been recruited since June. None of these new recruits would have received plaids, coats and waistcoats. The Regiment had more than 500 men without coats and waistcoats and more than 450 men without plaids.\n\tBy 18th November, Lord Loudoun's Regiment was complete[58] with 840 rank and file, so that a further 50 men would have been without coats, waistcoats and plaids. There were now more than 550 men without coats and waistcoats and more than 500 men without plaids.\n.\tOn 7th January 1747, when a return[59] was made of the cloathing of Lord Loudoun's Regiment, there were 112 plaids wanting and 184 coats wanting. \n\n'''Every body who has an intrigue'''\n\tSir Hew Dalrymple, Lord Drummore, Lord Loudoun\u2019s mother\u2019s cousin wrote[60] that  \u201cEvery body who has an intrigue hopes, at Lest wishes, it should not be known, and one is apt to persuade himself, that it may produce only an abundance of Joy & pleasure and no bad consequence, \n\t\u201cMemorandums\n\t\u201cA piper formerly Servant to Lady Mackintosh call\u2019d David Ross now Butler to Ld Loudoun\n\t\u201cDonald Fraser Blacksmith, who carried the intelligence to the Pretender of Ld Loudoun\u2019s intention to Surprise him at Lady Mackintosh\u2019s house now Armourer at fort Augustus, he was a Captain in Lady Mackintosh\u2019s Regiment\n\t\u201c__ McDonald formerly a Piper to young [MacDonald of] Scothouse now a Runner at Lord Loudoun\u2019s\n\t\u201cMr Mcpherson of Dalwhiny, now private Soldier in Capt Stuart\u2019s Co\u2019 who was Lieut Col to Cluny Mcpherson\u2019s Regt\n\t\u201cThis is Sum of the things, wt what I began wt, which Lord Justice Clerk was able to pick up, Lord Albemarle was very concern\u2019d at what he heard, & was going himself to write your Lop, but Ld Justice Clerk very kindly interposed and said he would write himself, and at the meeting I have mentioned put it upon me.\u201d\n\tSo, at last, all the hints and tales were out in the open. Lord Loudoun had been so often at Inverness to see Anne Farquhar, Lady Mackintosh. She had raised her husband's clan for the Young Pretender, while her husband, Aeneas Mackintosh was a Captain in Lord John Murray's old Highland Regiment at Inverness.\n\tThe scandal had even got to London. Norman MacLeod of MacLeod wrote[61] to Lord Loudoun about his wife that \u201cKate has been dangerously Ill, .. you Can\u2019t Imagine how much she is affected wt the Idle Storys told her by Idler People about you. I swore it was all a lye & said Things Tenn times Stronger then I would have done, had I found her in health & Spirits, in short she Cannot Mention you wtout Crying & in that way she desired me give her Love to you-\u201d\n\tMeanwhile Captain William Wilkinson wrote[62] his long scolding letter to Lord Loudoun about the Regimental Accounts. \n\t\u201cMy Lord, That you have ever Since you left London been in a constant hurry of business, as much at least as any One man in the Kingdom, I readily believe But Still, dont Allow that as a good Excuse for your Omissions in Matters of no Small Consequence to your own Interests ffor no hurry could be So great but that the Sixtieth part of a Minute might be found to write these five Easy Letters L.O.U.D.O.U.N. the remaining fifty Nine parts of the Minute, might be thrown into other hands, to Witness, Seal, Enclose, and direct.\u201d\n\n'''Winter at Fort Augustus'''\n\tThe accommodation for the soldiers at Fort Augustus was deplorable. The fort itself had been blown up by the Rebels and not repaired. Some huts had been built but these leaked. Provision was made for fire, coal and candle and rations. Sergeants and corporals were to check rations to prevent embezzlement. Married men would require more. Four women were allowed in each company, though most companies had twice as many. A married quarter was a blanket on a ropes pulled across the end of an eight manned room.\n\tOn 9th January 1747 a return[63] was made of plaids, coats and vest, old and new. Finally on 21st January63 new plaids, coast and vest, with shirts and hose were issued to the centinels. A return[64] was made of Regimental Firelocks but the companies could ony muster 236 from the 900 originally made for the Regiment. 664 Regimental firelocks had been lost during the Rising. The Regiment was still short of 86 firelocks.\n\n'''Rebels in the Regiment'''\n\tJust as Lord Loudoun thought that he had completed his Regiment on 18th November 1746, he was to find out which of the men listed had been Rebels. In August, September, October and into November 1746 Lord Loudoun and his Captains had to recruit more than 250 men for his Regiment. Recruiters must have known that some of the recruits would be deserters and that many of them had been Rebels. But perhaps not quite so many. \n\tTen men recruited into Lord Loudoun's Regiment had been deserters from other Regiments who had then joined the Rebels. They were liable to be executed or sentenced to 1,000 lashes.\n\t84 men recruited into Lord Loudoun's Regiment had joined the Rebels. 23 of these men were in Major MacKenzie's company. 21 of these men were in Captain John Stuart's company. Both these men had been away in London and Windsor since autumn 1746. Their companies were being commanded by Lieutenant James Fraser and Lieutenant John Reid.\n\tOf the 94 men listed as deserters or rebels, 52 men appeared on company rolls in December 1746 and January 1747.\n\tOn 9th March Captain Alexander Mackay wrote[65] that Lord Loudoun was to send a letter to discharge all Rebels in the Regiment. Captain Mackay would be sorry if it was done without any exceptions. The officers of the Regiment did not have long to act. New recruits had to be found in March and April 1747. \n\n'''The state of the Regiment'''\n\tLord Loudoun had been collecting evidence for the impeachment of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat and had been at Inverness. The Lieutenant Colonel, MP for Glasgow, and Major William MacKenzie were in London. At last, in February 1747, Captain Alexander Mackay, who had been sick in Edinburgh for more than a year, joined the Regiment. He was appalled at the condition and training of the men and the condition of their uniforms and arms.\n\tOn 19th February Captain Mackay wrote[66] that he had received Lord Loudoun\u2019s letter. \u201cThe ministry are bent on ruing the poor Military, its very extraordinary that the only branch they can find to save upon in time of war should be the army.\u201d Only nine days after arriving at Fort Augustus, Captain Mackay complained of the unfitness of the Regiment to take the field. He wanted horses. He needed ammunition. There were no flints for the firelocks.\n\tCaptain Mackay was concerned about the Rebels in the Regiment. The Major\u2019s, Captain Stuart\u2019s, Captain McNab\u2019s, Lord Charles Gordon\u2019s companies \u201chave great numbers among them.\u201d He had more bad men than he had expected. He would discharge men that day.\n\tOn 24th February, two weeks after arriving at Fort Augustus, Captain Mackay wrote[67] that \u201cI have the Regt: under arms every day since the weather has begun to mend, which they have great need of, I have examin\u2019d all the men here as exact as I can, & to tell your Lop sincerely my opinion, I never saw so many bad men in on Regt since the day I was born, Severalls actually deform\u2019d, Allmost the whole as Dirty as devils & their arms in a Shocking Situation, the places where the locks &c were mended, are breaking every day, there is no Bayonets fits but what few there is of small ones, & many of them that were in the Rebells hands quite abused. \n\t\u201cSuch is the situation of the Regt, that if we wholly incamp here along with the other Corps, In my Opinion we shall be laughed at, & Im afraid with too much cause, Tho were the case impartially examined we have plenty of Excuse, but that wont be minded.\u201d\n\tCaptain Mackay added[68] that the meal was very poor. It was \u201cabused in the bringing here.\u201d A \u201ccursed distemper got in amongst men here\u201d they call scurvy but it is really a violent dry pox. Some men were in hospital. The weather was better, and the men were out on exercise daily.\n\tAt the end of March Captain Alexander Mackay was at last allowed to visit his father at Tongue in Sutherland. Captain Archibald Macnab took over the training of the Regiment. He wrote[69] on 7th April about disciplining the Regiment. The weather was favourable and the officers and all the men were in the field from 5 to 10 in the morning and from 3 to 7 in the afternoon. The Regiment had exercised the day before in one body of 350 and in a few days hence Captain Macnab would have about 100 more that would be fit to join. Captain Macnab felt that the Regiment was fit for any service. Even Captain Mackay had changed his view.\n\tOn 22nd April Captain Macnab made a return[70] of arms at Fort Augustus. There were Officers fuzies 10; Regt Firelocks 240; English Firelocks 568; Foreign Arms 37; Total 840\u201d Since January only 4 more Regimental firelocks had been recovered but 187 English muskets had been issued to make the Regiment complete. That same day Captain Macnab wrote[71] that he had left 120 half files in the field exercising. \u201cWe go throw the Evolutions and all the firings and in a days more must try to form a Square.\u201d\n\tThe Regiment was woefully short of officers at Fort Augustus during the winter of 1746-47. From February 1746 there were only 5 Captains, though Captains James Campbell and Alexander Grant were to join the Regiment; the captain-Lieutenant and 8 Lieutenants, with 2 sick, one on command and one on leave, and 7 Ensigns, with one at Inverness, one on command and two absent. \n\tCaptain Mackay complained[72] in February that \u201cWe would need to call some of our subalterns to quarters that we may have the face of a Regt an officer to a Company.\u201d In March he wrote73 that officers were absent and \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say too many of our people have neither the honour nor interest of the Regt at heart.\u201d\n'''\nHis behaviour this winter has been very imprudent'''\n\tIn April 1747 Captain John Stuart was removed[74] as Captain in the Regiment. Captain Stuart had been in the south, since the summer, attending Parliament and living comfortable at the Little Lodge in Windsor Great Park. It was reported that Captain Stuart was removed \u201cfrom Lord Loudoun's Regiment for his behaviour this winter, which indeed has been very imprudent.\u201d Lord Loudoun, as a close friend of John Stuart, must have been mortified. \n\n'''Orders for Holland'''\n\tOn 24th April 1747 King George II personally ordered Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment to Holland. That day Henry Fox, Secretary at War, saw the Duke of Newcastle and the following day wrote[75] to Lord Loudoun that \u201cH.M. has ordered me to write to Blakeney and Churchill; to get in readiness, & to march to Leith the Regt under command of Lord Loudoun & the 2nd battalion of St.Clair\u2019s.\u201d [Royal Scots]\n\tLord Loudoun had spent all winter in the Highlands collecting information for the trail of Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat. He eventually reached London on 27th March. Lord Loudoun was later to write[76] that \u201cI was kept in the North above 17 Months and then allowed to go to London in order to settle my Affairs I was not there three weeks when all at once I was sent away to march my Regt out of the Highlands for Foren Service.\u201d\n\tLord Lovat had been found guilty of High Treason by his Peers in the House of Lords, on 19th March. He was executed on 9th April.\n\tDespite Lord Loudoun\u2019s recalling that \u201call at once I was sent away to march my Regt out of the Highlands for Foren Service\u201d the officers at Fort Augustus must always have anticipated being sent to Holland. On 7th April Captain Archibald MacNab had written[77] that the Regiment was fit for any service and that even Captain Mackay had changed his view. Rumours and then positive news doubtless travelled fast to Fort Augustus. Soon everyone at Fort Augustus knew that the Regiment was ordered to Flanders.\n\tCaptain Alexander Mackay had immediately to cloathe the Regiment with the Third Assignment of a new coat, new plaids, hose, shirt, bonnet and shoes ordered from Birmingham. These had been sent north by James Seton in April and early May.[78]\n\tTen of the twelve companies were to be sent to Holland, and the companies of the two junior Captains would remain in Scotland as Additional Companies. These were the companies of James Campbell of Stronslany and Captain Alexander Grant of Knockando. Different arrangements, however, were made. Captain John Stuart's, now Captain George Mackay's, and Sir Harry Munro's companies were to remain in Scotland.\n\n'''Death of the Earl of Stair.'''\n\tLord Loudoun hurried north to Edinburgh to join his Regiment at Fort Augustus for foreign service.\n\tIt was in Edinburgh that Lord Loudoun learned[79] of the death of his uncle, John Dalrymple, Field Marshall the Earl of Stair, Knight of the Thistle, at Queensberry House in the Canongate, Edinburgh, on the 9th May. Lord Stair had been Lord Loudoun\u2019s military and political sponsor and close friend.\n\tThe Laird of MacLeod was to write[80] that \u201cTho it was some time dreaded, & suspected that Lord Stair was in a Bad way, yett his loss must have affected one so nearly Connected wt him as you are very Deeply, & Indeed he was so worthy & so Valuable a Man, that all Good People must feel The Want of him Very Sensibly.\u201d\n\tAfter the funeral of his uncle, Lord Loudoun hurried up over the Corrieyarrick pass to Fort Augustus. \n\tThe Laird of MacLeod wrote[81] that \u201cI dare say you are by this time drawing Towards the Water Side. I was highly Pleased to hear how Chearfully the regiment received the news of their going abroad & as they have you now wt them, Thiers no fear but that Spirit will be keeped up Properlie.\u201d\n\n'''March from Fort Augustus to Burntisland'''\n\tOn 20th May Major General William Blakeney, at Inverness, received[82] orders from London. He ordered the Regiment to march from Fort Augustus to Burntisland in Fife, to embark for Holland. \n\tOn 24th May83 the 1st Battalion of St Clair\u2019s Regiment, the Royals, sailed from Leith.\n\tOn 30th May, six days later, Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment embarked84 at Burntisland. The march of 130 miles, by the Corrieyarrick pass to Dalwhinnie, Blair Atholl, Dunkeld, Perth and Cowdenbeath had taken less than 10 days.\n\n'''Sailing to Holland'''\n\tLord Loudoun's Regiment sent 10 companies to Holland in 1747. Each company, when complete, mustered 70 men, 2 drummers and 3 sergeants, for a total of 750 men. In addition[84] there were at least 40 servants, some 10 volunteers, 30 boys, and perhaps 70 women, making another 150 persons. \n\tThough Lord Loudoun hurried north to Scotland, Lieutenant Colonel Jack Campbell, Major William MacKenzie and Sir Harry Munro were still in London attending Parliament. Lieutenants Alexander Campbell and John Campbell were still recovering from their wounds at Keith. The Chaplain was sick at Bath.\n\tThe Regiment mustered only 30 officers and their servants at Burntisland.\n\tThe total to be transported to Holland was about 925 officers, privates, drummers and sergeants, volunteers, boys, servants and women. In addition there were the officers' and company horses.\n\tTwo Additional Companies were left behind in Scotland, now commanded by Sir Harry Munro and Captain George Mackay in place of John Stuart. George Mackay had commanded an Independent Company in 1746. He was the brother of Captain Alexander Mackay.\n\tFour ships[85] were made ready to carry the regiment: Friendship, Thomas and Hannah, Marlborough, Neptune, and Jonathan and Catherine. There was space for 900 and 86 horses.\n\tAlthough the men were put on board, the ships did not sail for three weeks because of contrary weather and a lack of escort ships.\n\tOn 25th June 1747, Lord Loudoun's Regiment was due to receive its Third Assignment of new cloathing. This consisted of a new plaid, coat, shirt, rollers, blue bonnet and four pairs of hose. With the Regiment due for foreign service, the new cloathing was probably issued to the Regiment when it arrived in Fife in preparation for embarking for Holland\n\tIt was while the ships were waiting at Burntisland that Lord Loudoun visited Edinburgh and was probably painted by Alan Ramsay. Though wearing a scarlet coat, it was not of the Regimental pattern and the red tartan, Murray of Tulliebardine, was not the Regimental tartan, which was green and blue, divided by black, with red and yellow stripes.[86] \n\tLord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment sailed from Burntisland on 19th June and reached Flushing on Campvere on 23rd June, 4th July, New Style, unaware that, 80 miles east, outside Maastricht, the Duke of Cumberland had been defeated at the Battle of Laufeldt.  \n\n'''Active service in Holland'''\n\tOn landing at Flushing, Lord Loudoun's Regiment, with the newly arrived 1st Battalion the Royals, joined with Lord John Murray's Regiment, The Black Watch. It was the first time that the old and new Highland Regiments had served together. It was a rude awakening for Lord Loudoun's Regiment, suddenly on active service and called into the line. \n\tLord Loudoun's new Highland Regiment went into the lines north and east of Bergen-op-Zoom, a well defended town on the west of the Allied line. On 25th July the Regiment made a sally from Fort Rovers, outside Bergen-op-Zoom, and 7 men were killed. On 4th August a second sally was made and on 17th August the Regiment was withdrawn to Haltern Camp, two miles north Of Bergen-op-Zoom. The Return on 28th August[87] showed only 555 men fit for duty. 122 were sick; 24 were wounded; 7 had been killed and 2 had died.\n\tOn 1st September the two Highland Battalions were withdrawn from Bergen-op-Zoom to Breda. The French had been busily investing the fort and on 16th September, at 4am, the French sprung a mine. The Garrison commander and the officers were asleep and the French quickly rushed into the fort. There were 3,000 Dutch casualties and only 479 French casualties. 200 siege guns were captured and 17 fully loaded supply ship. Then the French soldiers lost control and sacked the town. The French now had control of the whole length of the River Schelde. There was a rift between the Dutch and the British Allies and reluctantly the British Government recalled the Congress of Breda to negotiate a peace treaty with France.\nThe Additional Companies in Scotland\n\tBack in Scotland the two Additional Companies, commanded by Sir Harry Munro and Captain George Mackay were augmented[88] by adding an ensign, sergeant, corporal, drummer and 30 men to each company. Hector Munro, brother of Ensign George Munro of Novar was appointed Ensign in Captain Mackay\u2019s company. Hugh Mackay, son of Hugh Mackay of Bighouse, nephew of Captains Alexander and George Mackay, and grandson of Lord Reay was appointed Ensign in Captain George Mackay\u2019s company. His sister was to marry Lieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure. \n\tEnsign Peter Campbell  was quartermaster for the Regiment at Inverness and, on his death in January 1748, left a long record[89] of the arms, ammunition, uniforms and camp equipment that he had issued.\n\tBoth Sir Harry Munro and George Mackay were elected Members of Parliament and spent the winter in London.\n\n'''Winter in Holland'''\n\tBoth Armies in Flanders went into winter quarters. There was no fighting but it was a miserable time for everyone. On 1st January 1748 Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment[90] was stationed at Williamstadt, fifteen miles north of Bergen-op-Zoom. The Regiment could muster only 631 firelocks and was wanting 76 bayonets and 61 swords. Lord Loudoun and Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell were in London for most of the winter, attending Parliament. \n\tRichard Huck was the new surgeon[91] and had a constant battle to keep the men healthy. Eventually on only 170 men in the Regiment had NOT been sick in Holland.\n\tLieutenant Colin Campbell of Glenure resigned his commission on being appointed by the Forfeited Estates factor for the Cameron and Stewart lands. He was succeeded by Ensign James Stewart of Urrard. Ensign John Grant of Dalrachney, who had been sick all winter, resigned and was replaced by John Small, nephew of Baron Reid of Straloch and previously an Additional Ensign in Lord John Murray\u2019s Regiment.\n\n'''The Congress of Breda adjourned to Aix-la-Chappelle'''\n\tThe Congress of Breda adjourned to Aix-la-Chappelle, or Aachen, which lay 20 miles east of Maastricht, just across the German border. On 24th April, 1748, NS, the congress re-convened. \n\tOn 7th May, NS, the Dutch town of Maastricht, after a short siege, surrendered to the French. \n\tThe minds of the Allies were at last concentrated on peace negotiations at Aix-la-Chappelle. France was to restore Madras to the British and the British to restore Nova Scotia and Fort Louisburg to the French. Everyone would retired behind the lines from before the war. It was not a peace that would last for long. \n\tMaria Theresa would be accepted as Empress of Austria but would have to cede Silesia to Prussia. The French at last accepted the Hanoverians as Kings of Great Britain. The Old and Young Pretenders, James and Charles Stuart, were to be excluded from France.\n\tThe war really had come to an end.\n\tOn 22nd May 1748 the Regiment was at Nesselroy Camp. It was due its Fourth Assignment of cloathing in June 1748 to mark the King's birthday. The Assignment would consist of a red coat \u2013 the previous year's coat was turned into a waistcoat \u2013 shirt, hose and plaid. This was the third issue of plaids. There were 29 tailors in the Regiment.[92] With 4 tailors employed from other Regiments, they fitted 85 coats and 4 \u201cVoascots.\u201d \n\n'''New drafts for the Regiment'''\n\tIn March 1748 a large draught of men was sent from the Highlands to Lord Loudoun's Regiment in Holland. These men had been recruited by Sir Harry Munro and Captain George Mackay whose Additional Companies remained in the Highlands. A List of Draughts,[93] gave the names of 113 recruits distributed amongst the 10 companies of Lord Loudoun's Regiment in Holland.\n\tIn May 1748 a second draught of 51 men were gathered together in Scotland from the two Additional Companies of Lord Loudoun's Regiment. The draught was commanded by Sir Harry Munro, MP, and arrived in Holland by the end of May. Captain John Sutherland of Forse returned to Scotland to command the Additional Company.\n\tOn 29th May 1748, NS, there was a \u201cReturn[94] of The Draughts of the Right Honble The Earl of Loudoun's Regiment Nisselroy Camp.\u201d The return gave names, age, size, by whom listed and from what company draughted for 51 men. \n\tOn 20th June, NS, Lord Loudoun's Regiment received orders[95] to move from Nesselroy [Nistelrode] to Geldorp, 20 miles south, five miles east of Eindhoven.\nCaptain James Campbell and Lieutenant MacLean quarrelled in public\n\tOn 7th July 1748, 18th July, NS, Captain James Campbell and Lieutenant Hugh Maclean had a furious row. Ensign John Campbell of Glendaruel, of Lord John Murray's old Highland Regiment, The Black Watch, wrote[96] from Eindhoven that \u201cthe following narrative will not displease you. Some time ago in Nistelrooy Camp your friend Captain James Campbell of Stronslany and Lieutenant MacLean of Kingerloch quarrelled in public, called one another all the Rogues, Villians and Scoundrels that was ever heard. \n\t\u201cAt length Baron MacLean\u2019s noble blood running more warm than ordinary he challenged Stron to fight him with pistols, so the time and place being agreed upon, the Champions met but Stron declined fighting with fire arms and as little would the other with swords. \n\t\u201cBy this time there was a crowd gathering from all parts of the camp to behold the battle but they found the combatants engaged with no other weapon but their tongues which they used more dextrously. At last some Officers came riding that way and observing a great mob, galloped up in order to learn what the matter was. And upon seeing Officers who had challenged one another and would not fight, they said that such scandalous behaviour was never known in the Army and ordered them both to arrest.\u201d\n\tOn 13th July, Captain James Campbell wrote1[97] from Geldorp that \u201cShall I have no Redress for my money or the Scandell this Lieut McLean made cuse of in the face of ane open court, If I do not I think I am not well cusd.\u201d\n\tEnsign John Campbell added[98] that \u201cThey were tried last week by a General Court-Martial and both broke for cowardice. They were also ordered forthwith to depart from the Army.\u201d\n\tCaptain James Campbell was replaced by Captain John Mackay, a name new to the Regiment. Lieutenant Hugh Maclean was replaced by John Martin, the senior Ensign, of Captain Archibald Macnab's company. The new Ensign was David Calder, a volunteer with the Regiment.\n\tOn 17th July 1748 Lord Loudoun wrote[99] from Holland to Lieutenant John Forbes of New, Lieutenant in Captain MacPherson\u2019s additional company of Lord John Murray\u2019s Regiment, The Black Watch, informing him that he had been promoted Captain-Lieutenant in Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment.\n\n'''Seniority of officers in the Regiment'''\n\tIn the summer of 1748 a list[100] was made of the seniority of the officers.\n\t\u201cList of The Officers According to Seniority Of The Earl of Loudouns Regt\n\tCapts\t\t\t\t    Lieutannants\n\tColl Earl of Loudoun\t\t    Donald McDonald\n\tLieut Coll Campbell\t\t    John Reid\n\tMajor William Mckenzie\t\t    James Mcpherson\n\tAlexander Mckay\t\t\t    Collin Campbell Recruiting [Kilberrie]\n\tSir Harry Munro\t\t\t    Alexr Campbell Wt The Additionals\n\tLord Cha Gordon\t\t\t    John Campbell Recruiting [Ardslignish]\n\tJohn Sutherland Wt The Additionals  John Murray\n\tJohn McLeod\t\t\t    Dannl McNeil Wt the Additionals\n\tArchibald McNab\t[Dec 1745]\t    James Frazer\t[6 Dec 1745]\n\tJohn Campbell\t[Nov 1746]\t    Archibald Campbell\t[6 Dec 1745]\n\tJohn Mckay\t[July 1748]\t    James Stueart\t[13 Feb 1748]\n\tJohn fforbas Capt Lieut\t\t    John Martine\t[July 1748]\n\tEnsigns\n\tRobert Bisset\n\tRobt Mckay\n\tGeorge Munro Wt the Additionals\n\tRobert Grant\t[6 Dec 1745]\n\tHugh Arnot\t[6 Dec 1745]\n\tJames Gray\t[6 Dec 1745]\n\tHugh Mckay Wt the Additional [Add 27 May 1747]\n\tHector Munro\t[Add 27 May 1747]\n\tWilliam Baillie [Volunteer, Dec 1747]\n\tCollin Campbell Wt the Additionals \t[16 Jan 1748]\n\tJames Small\tWith the Additionals\t[Feb 1748]\n\tJames Ross\t[13 Feb 1748]\n\tDavid Calder\t[July 1748]\n\n\tRobert Grant\t\tAdjutant\n\tJohn Murray\t\tQuartermaster\n\tAlexr Hume\t\tChaplain\n\tArchd Hugh\t\tSurgeon\n\tJohn Duncanson\tMate\u201d\n\n\tThe seniority list showed that, over three years, the Regiment still had eight of its twelve original company commanders. Only one Captain-Lieutenant and one Lieutenant had been promoted Captain. Lieutenant Donald MacDonald, second senior Lieutenant in July 1745 was passed over twice and was only senior Lieutenant in 1748. Five Ensigns, however, had been promoted Lieutenant. Ensign Bisset, who had lost out on the throw of a dice to Archibald Campbell, James Stewart and John Martin, was now the senior Ensign. The Regiment, in the summer of 1748, had ten new Ensigns.\n\n'''The Regiment camping out at Geldross'''\n\tIn July, with the Regiment camping out at Geldross, a return[101] was made of camp equipage deficiencies. Two weeks later Lord Loudoun made a return[102] of the 28 boys in the Regiment. The Regiment also supported[103] 52 married and 17 unmarried women, about one woman to every 10 soldiers. The married women were given rations in return for doing the washing.\n\tOn 16th October Lord Loudoun drew up a return[104] of the men of his Regiment \u201cthat has not been sick since landed in Holland\u201d, made at Geldrosse. Only 8 sergeants, 5 corporals, 6 drummer and 170 men had not been sick in the 17 months since the Regiment had landed in Holland in July 1747. That was 8 sergeants and 5 corporals out of 30: 6 drummers out of 20 and 170 men out of 700. More than 500 men had been sick at some time in Holland, probably more, since men returned to Britain and were replaced by new drafts.\n\tBy early October Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment was back at Geldorp.\n\n'''Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle finally signed'''\n\tWith the Aix-la-Chapelle Treaty finally signed on 18th October 1748 all the military in Holland knew that the War of the Austrian Succession had come to an end. British Regiments would soon be shipped back to Britain. Some Regiments would be reduced. Lord Loudoun\u2019s Highlanders were the junior Regiment in the Army.\nMen of the Regiment to be discharged and transferred\n\tIn October 1748 Lord Loudoun drew up a comprehensive list[105] of the men of the Regiment to be discharged and the men \u201cRecommended by Lord Loudoun to Lord Albemarle.\u201d\n\t182 men were recommended for discharge and of these 90 had an X marked against them.\n\tLord Loudoun then recommended that 71 men of his Regiment should be transferred to other units. With 40 men not fit to serve, 182 men discharged and 71 men transferred to other Regiments, Lord Loudoun's Regiment was reduced from 700 men to 400 men, or 40 men for each company.\n\n'''I was sent North single to take the Command'''\n\tOn 18th October 1748, OS, [29th Oct NS] Lord Loudoun wrote[106] at length to Andrew Hunter, his \u201cdoer\u201d in Scotland about an unnamed person to whom he owed \u00a31,000.\n\t\u201cMy Present case is that when the Rebellion brook out I was conveyd North with Sir John Cope immediately after the Battol of Preston I was sent North single to take the Command no troops to Command but ordered to rease the Independent Companys and not a Shilling ordered to do it with. In this Situation I was forced to rease Money I was afterwards supplied but very spairingly, and presantly after arival shutt up from all communications with the Goverment Credit Quits you and I was forsed to borrow Money on my own to keep the people under my Command together. I was keept in the North above 17 Months and then allowed to go to London in order to settel my Affairs I was not there three weeks when all at once I was sent away to March my Regt out of the Highlands for Foren Service and thrown Directly into the Siege of Bergen op Zoom last Winter I was a little while in London but so ill almost the whole time that I was able to do very little business. By this Scratch of my Scetch of my History you will see that the Goverment must be very considerably in my Debt which they realy are tho I have charged them nothing for Actual Debursments.\u201d \n\tThose accounts were now ready to pass and they should do so. Lord Loudoun asked his creditor for a delay in repayment.\n\n'''Om aldaan nan Engelland geembarqueert'''\n\tOn 12th November  Prince Willem of Orange Nassau, appointed Stadt Holder of all the Dutch United Provinces, from 's\u2019Gravenhage, wrote[107] to Lord Loudoun ordering his Regiment \u201com met deselve uyt de Respective Cantonmente, tot Geldorp, Prg to begeren nan de Willemstad, om aldaan nan Engelland geembarqueert te worden.\u201d [from the same respective cantonments at Geldorp to go to Willemstad, from there to embark for England.]\n\t\u201cEnde sal hy Collonel of commandeerende Officier soodanige scherpe en exacte ordre hebben te houden, dat door sijne onderhebbende Manshap heene foules of desordres werden gepleegt.\u201d [And that the Colonel or officer commanding shall keep such careful and exact order, that the troops under his command shall not do any dirtiness or disorder.]\n\tPrince Willem, married to Anne, the Princess Royal, sister of the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cumberland, had effectively made himself King of the Dutch Republic.\n\n'''Departure from Holland'''\n\tThe Regiment marched from Geldorp on 23rd November and reached Williamstadt on 30th November. \n\tAltogether Lord Loudoun's Regiment[108] numbered 23 sergeants, 22 corporals and 15 drummers, with 421 rank and file, as well as 31 boys, 43 women and 21 officers' servants who were not soldiers Three of the boys had remained in Holland and 18 of the women had remained.\n\tOn 18th December Lord Albemarle wrote[109] from Eindhoven that Lord Loudoun had been detained at Helvoet [Hellevoetsluis] further down the channel towards the open sea, since 24th by bad weather.\n\tFinally, on 27th December, OS, 16th December OS, the transports received the signal to sailed out into the Channel.\n\n'''I did not arrive here till 12 o'clock this day'''\n\tFour days later, on 20th December 1748, OS, 31st December 1749, NS, Lord Loudoun wrote[110] from Yarmouth to Henry Fox, Secretary at War, that \u201cI did not arrive here till 12 o'clock this day & finding Lord H. Beauclerk not arrived, I am sat down to send you the best account I can pick up of the Situation of the troops arrived here.\n\t\u201cOn Friday the 16th the Signal was made in Helvoet Road at 5 for the Ships of the Scots Embarkation to get under sail which they accordingly did and went of. \n\t\u201cAt 8 in the morning the Signal was made for the Ships for England to get under Sail, which they did in about 2 hours, excepting about 12 Ships which had not their Anchors up when we came away.\n\t\u201cThe Regimts on board were, The Greys, [North British Dragoons], The Dukes [of Cumberland's 15th Light Dragoons] Part of Rothes, [25th Foot] Skeltons, L.H Beauclerk, [31st Foot] Johnsons, [33rd Foot] Dejeans [37th Foot] and Loudouns.  \n\t\u201cIn the evening the Wind was Westerly and drove us to the Northward to such a point we drove all Night, next day, and till 12 o'Saturday night, [17th Dec] at which time we tackt to the Southwest and at 12 on Sunday [18th Dec] made the land which they did not know for several hours after but found at last to be Yarmouth Port, got in on Sunday [18th Dec] some in yesterday [19th Dec] other this morning [20th Dec] and some are still seen without the land.\n\t\u201cAs to my own Regimt. I have lost one man wash'd overboard which is the only accident that hath happen'd to us.\n\t\u201cCollo McDougall of the N. British Dragoons [The Greys] is come on Shore Since writing the above and tells me that the Horses which Remain are so Bruis'd they think they shall still lose a great many more, he knows of no more of their Ships as yet. It is the Opinion of all the Captains of Ships here that the Transports that are missing are still Safe.\u201d\n\tColonel MacDougall\u2019s daughter was married to Lord Loudoun.\n\tOn 21st December, Henry Fox, Secretary at War, wrote[111] from the War Office, that he had received Lord Loudoun's letter of 20th giving the melancholy account of the distress of the troops on board the transports. Lord Loudoun was to stay at Yarmouth to \u201csee the enclosed order in execution.\u201d The sick to be sent in waggons (fit for hospital) to Ipswich \u2013 where hospitals have been prepared for the sick brought from the Netherlands. \n\tHenry Fox also wrote[112] to the Duke of Newcastle that \u201cI have this Evening receiv'd by Express a Letter from the Earl of Loudoun, of which the enclosed is a Copy, and in return, I have sent an Order by Express to His Lordship to Disembark & Quarter, All the Men & Horses belonging to any of His Majesty's Forces, which are or shall arrive on Board the Transports off Yarmouth, in all Towns, Villages and Places he shall think most Convenient, 'till thay shall be in a condition to proceed to their several intended Quarters, and that His Lordship should send all the Sick for Hospital in Waggons and all other proper ways to Ipswich, where Hospitals have been provided for the reception of the Sick from the Netherlands;\u201d\nReturn of the Regimental sick at Yarmouth\n\tOn 29th December the Regimental surgeon, Richard Huck, made a return[113] of the 28 men in the Regiment who were sick at Yarmouth with distempers. 17 men were sick of the flux; 2 of fevers; 3 of agues; 2 of rheumation and 2 were lame. Two women were also sick.\n\tOn 5th January 1748, English style, but 1749 Scottish style, Dr Richard Turner made a return[114] of the sick at Yarmouth. There were 28 sick men and 7 sick women in Lord Beauclerk\u2019s Regiment and 13 sick men and 2 sick women of Lord Loudoun\u2019s Regiment.\n\n'''I have never yet received my Commission'''\n\tFar away in Aberdeenshire, Captain-Lieutenant John Forbes, still unable to get away from his Additional Company of Lord John Murray's Regiment, because of the absence of his Captain, wrote[115] to Lord Loudoun that \u201cI have never yet received my Commission, tho I wrote the Agent about it.\u201d He wanted to know from Lord Loudoun \u201cthe fate of the Regt as I understand we were once under sentence.\u201d\n\n'''Disbanding Lord Loudoun's Regiment'''\n\tOn 30th December 1748, Henry Fox, Secretary at War wrote[116] from the War Office to Lord Loudoun.\n \t\u201cI have the Honour to transmit to Your Lordship enclos\u2019d High Majesty\u2019s Orders & Instructions for disbanding the Ten Companies of Your Lordships Regt of Foot, Landed at Yarmouth, and to signify to You it is His Majesty\u2019s Pleasure, that the same be immediately put in Execution.\n\t\u201cUpon my acquainting His Majesty it would be agreeable to Your Lordship, that the disbanded men should be allow\u2019d Twenty One Days Subsistence each, to carry them home, His Majesty was graciously pleas\u2019d to come into it, which Allowance is accordingly inserted in the sd orders.\u201d\n\t\u201cGEORGE R[117]\n\t\u201cWhereas We have thought fit to order the Ten Companies of Our Regiment of Foot landed at Yarmouth under your Command to be forthwith disbanded Our W and P therefore is that you disband them accordingly and that in the disbanding of them the following Rules be observed Vizt.\u201d\n\tLord Loudoun was to take musters of all the companies. The men were to be paid off and the Officers put on Half Pay. The arms were to be put into store. The Other Ranks were to be allowed to carry away their cloathes and were to be paid 3/- for their swords. \n\tOn 4th January 1749 Lord Loudoun wrote[118] a discharge for William Sutherland of Capt Mackay\u2019s Company, on disbanding the Regiment. There were printed slip with the discharge.\n\tOn the same day Lord Loudoun issued[119] 30 day passes on disbanding to William Sutherland, John Finlayson, Angus McInish, and George McDonald all soldier in Major William MacKenzie\u2019s Company.\n\tThus, after three years, seven months and 21 days, Lord Loudoun's Regiment was to be disbanded. The officers were to receive half pay. The sergeants, corporals, drummer and private soldiers were to be allowed to keep their cloathing, belts and knapsacks and were to be paid three shillings for their swords. The men were to receive their arrears of pay and an allowance of 21 day's subsistence to get them home. They were to receive a pass but were not to travel in groups of more than three.\n\tAt 6 pence a day, each soldier would have received 10 shillings and 6 pence plus the 3 shillings paid for their swords.\n\tThe soldiers were to be sensible of the care that the King had taken upon their dismission. The days of subsistence was increased from 14 to 21 days. The King's generosity would have cost about \u00a375 for purchasing the swords and about \u00a3300 for the 21 days subsistence. Lord Loudoun extended the pass to 30 days.\n\tTravelling twenty miles a day, in 21 days then soldiers might have walked 420 miles and perhaps reached Edinburgh. Some of the men then had more than 200 miles to walk to get them back to their homes in Argyll and Sutherland. The 30 day pass might have taken William Sutherland 250 miles north to Halkirk in Caithness.\n\n'''Their qualities in order of their being plac'd upon half pay'''\n\tCaptain William Wilkinson, agent to Lord Loudoun's Regiment, wrote[120] on 27th January 1749 enclosing memoranda from Henry Fox. \n\tOn 23rd February Henry Fox wrote[121] to Lord Loudoun that asking for the names of the \u201cField and Staff Officers & of commission officers & their Qualities\u201d of the 10 companies of Lord Loudoun's Regiment \u201cin order of their being plac'd upon half pay.\u201d\nThe two additional companies of Lord Loudoun's Regiment disbanded\n\tIt was only on 31st May 1749 that the two additional companies of Lord Loudoun's Regiment, as well as the three additional companies of Lord John Murray's Regiment, were disbanded.[122]\n\tOn 19th August 1749 Henry Fox, Secretary at war announced[123] that there would be a meeting next day at 10am at the Pay Office with Mr Pitt. Mr Wilkinson must attend as well.\n\tMuch later in the year, Henry Fox wrote[124] to Lord Loudoun that \u201cI fancy Your Commission of Col to late Frampton's is signed this Day.\u201d \n\tLord Loudoun had been appointed Colonel of 30th Regiment of Foot.\n\n'''Lord Loudoun\u2019s Accounts'''\n        Sorting out the account's for Lord Loudoun's Regiment rumbled on and on. Lord Loudoun was later to draw up a dozen memorandums and memorials. There was to be a Memoria[l125] to the Paymaster General, and the Secretary of War, with notes to William Pitt and Henry Fox, probably dated 1749.There was to be a Memorial[126] to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty\u2019s Treasury. There was a project for a Report from the Auditors Office.[127]  There was a memorial to the Lords Commissioners.[128] There was to be a Memorial to the Duke of Argyll relative to Public Accounts.[129]  There was to be a Memorandum of Proceedings of Lord Loudoun\u2019s memorial,[130]  and a State of Money Drawn, during his command.[131]\n\tThe only dated accounts were for a Memorial[132] of Facts and Public Accounts, 3rd June 1749 and for Lord Loudon\u2019s Notes[133] of a letter to be written, 14th Oct 1749, 21 months after the regiment was reduced.\n\tLord Loudoun and his agent, Captain William Wilkinson, had a never ending struggle to get the Regimental and other accounts finalized.\n\n'''Recruiting for the Regiment''' \n\tWith the accidents that the Regiment met at Prestonpans, Dornoch and recruiting Rebels, it is difficult to know exactly how many men served in the Regiment, but 35 company rolls have survived for the 13 companies and contain more than 2,400 name. Many of these named were repeated for the soldier who stayed with the Regiment\n\tAfter the first recruiting drive in the summer of 1745, over three years, perhaps 1,000 new soldiers were recruited for the Regiment. Perhaps as many as 1,800 men may have served with the colours. \n\tThere was no forcing of men to join up but clearly clan chiefs found it easier to raise men that those who had less influence. The soldiers all spoke Gaelic, perhaps with the exception of William Wilson, of Captain Alexander Campbell\u2019s Company,  who came from Cornwall. Even the men in Captain Sutherland's Caithness company spoke Gaelic, though some of Lord Charles Gordon\u2019s men were described as lowlandmen.\n\tIn the four months, from August 1746, when Lord Loudoun's Regiment was being recruited up to strength, twelve men died of sickness at Fort Augustus. More died in Holland as well.\n\tThree men of the Argyll companies had been killed at the Battle of Falkirk, in January 1746; two more soldiers died of their wounds. A piper was killed at Moy in February 1746. Ensign Maclaggan was murdered at Cullen and his assailant was executed. Later another sergeant was executed for desertion at Fort Augustus.\n\tIn Flanders seven men were killed at the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom, so altogether perhaps twenty men from the Regiment were killed. \n\n'''Ages and heights'''\n\tOf the almost 500 soldiers whose ages were given, the average age was 24 years and 9 months. 82 men were under the age of 20, 17%; 280 were aged between 20 and 30, 58% and 100 men were aged over 30 years, 20%, with 22 men aged over 40 years and five men aged over 50 years.\n\tThree men were six foot tall or higher, but one joined the rebels and one had been a rebel. Of the 286 men whose height was given the average height was 5 foot 6.1 inches, almost an inch below the allowed height. 231 men were over 5 foot seven inches tall, 48%, 255 men were under 5 foot 7 inches, 52%, and of these 155 were under five foot six inches, 32%.\nNames in the Regiment\n\tThe commonest name recorded in the Regiment was MacDonald, with 52 recorded, in eight different companies, but 22 of the rebels were also called MacDonald. The next commonest name was Campbell, with some 49 in nine different companies, but four of the rebels were also called Campbell. There were 44 Mackays, half in Captain Alexander Mackay's company. There were 38 MacLeods, half in Captain John MacLeod's company, and 30 Munros, half in Sir Harry Munro's company. There were 25 Mackenzies, but 6 of the rebels were called Mackenzie. There were 20 Sutherlands, 19 Grants, 15 Rosses, 15 Macleans, 12 Camerons, 12 Stewarts and 11 Frasers. These names accounted for 342 men and thus some 200 men were called by other names or patronymics.\nOfficers\n\tIn January 1749 there were 30 battalion and 8 additional company officers. By 1756 only half of these were receiving half pay. The others were either still in the army, in some other Regiment, or were dead. \n\n'''Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell'''\n\tAs son of the heir to the Duke of Argyll, Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell was quickly given another appointment. On the sudden death of Lieutenant Colonel John Munro, Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell was appointed to command Lord John Murray's old Highland Regiment, The Black Watch. In 1756 he was appointed Colonel of 56th Regiment of Foot and in 1757 Colonel of 14th Dragoons. In 1759 he became a Major General and in 1761 a Lieutenant General, in the year in which the 3rd Duke of Argyll died and his father, Major General John Campbell of Mamore became 4th Duke of Argyll. Lieutenant General John Campbell was now style the Marquis of Lorne. In 1765 he was appointed Colonel of 1st Regiment of Foot, the Royal Scots and in 1771, on the death of his father, succeeded as 5th Duke of Argyll. In 1778 he was promoted General and in 1782 he succeeded Lord Loudoun as Colonel of the 3rd Foot Guards. In 1796 he was appointed Field Marshall, and at his death was junior only to the Duke of York, in the British Army.\n\n'''Major William MacKenzie'''\n        Major William MacKenzie went onto half pay and was listed in 1756. He was to continue on half pay until his death in 1770. He married Mary Humberston, a Yorkshire heiress and had two sons, Thomas Frederick MacKenzie Humberston who died on his way to India in 1783, and Francis Humberston MacKenzie who succeeded to his brother\u2019s Humberston estate and his cousin\u2019s Seaforth estate. He was to raise the 78th Highlanders. He was to be created Lord Seaforth, the last lord Seaforth, and his estates passed to his daughter Mary.\n\n'''Captain Alexander Mackay'''\n\tBy 1756 Captain Alexander Mackay, the Regiment's senior Captain,  had already exchanged with an officer on the active list and in 1762 was appointed Colonel of 122nd Foot, and two years later Colonel of 64th Foot. In 1768 Alexander Mackay was promoted Major General and in 1770, on the death of John Campbell, Duke of Argyll, Colonel of Royal Scots Fusiliers. In 1777 he was promoted Lieutenant General and that year was appointed Command-in-Chief in Scotland. He died in 1789.\n\n'''Captain John Stuart'''\n\tCaptain John Stuart had been forced to leave Lord Loudoun's Regiment in March 1747 but by July was Lieutenant Colonel of Lord Drumlanrig's Regiment in the Dutch Service. In 1754 he was appointed Colonel of Charles Halkett's Regiment and in 1758 Colonel-Commandant of Major General Charles Stewart's Regiment. He was appointed a Colonel in the Dutch service in 1760, Major-General in 1772 and retired in 1795, and died the following year.\n\n'''Captain John Campbell of Strachur'''\n\tYoung Captain John Campbell of Strachur exchanged from half pay and was appointed Captain in Lord John Murray's Regiment, The Black Watch. He went to North America and was wounded at the Battle of Ticonderoga in 1758. In 1759 he was appointed Major of 17th Regiment and then Lieutenant Colonel and then Colonel of 57th Regiment. In 1779 he was made Major General. In 1783 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief in North America and in 1787 Lieutenant General. He was made General in 1797, and died in 1806 one of the most senior officers in the British Army.\n\n'''Lieutenants John Reid'''\n\tJohn Reid, in 1751, exchanged with Paul MacPherson of Lord John Murray's Regiment, and was to have a distinguished career. He was promoted Major and commanded 1st Battalion The Black Watch in the West Indies, before going onto half pay again. He was appointed Colonel of 88th Regiment, a General and died in 1806. He endowed Edinburgh University School of Music and there is a portrait of him, wearing the uniform of Lord Loudoun's Regiment, at Edinburgh University.\n\n'''Ensigns Hector Munro'''\n\tHector Munro, the junior additional Ensign in 1747, was appointed Ensign in 48th Regiment in 1748 and Captain in 1758. In 1759 he was appointed Major of 89th Regiment, and went onto half pay as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1765. In 1777 he was made Colonel and in India a Major General. In 1782 he was made Major General and in 1787 Colonel of 42nd Highlanders, The Black Watch, the old Highland Regiment. He was made Lieutenant General in 1793 and General in 1798, and died in 1805.\n\tThus six of Lord Loudoun's officers, including himself, rose to be Lieutenant Generals. Alexander Mackay died in 1789. John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll, was made General in 1778 and Field Marshall in 1796. John Campbell of Strachur, John Reid and Hector Munro were all made Generals in the late 1790s and, with the 5th Duke of Argyll, died in the first decade of the 19th century.\n\n'''John Campbell, Earl of Loudoun'''\n\tLord Loudoun was appointed Colonel of 30th Regiment, late Frampton's, in November 1749. He was made Colonel-in-Chief of the 60th American Rifles. In February 1756 Lord Loudoun was appointed Captain General and Governor-in-Chief of Virginia and in March 1756 Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in North America. \n\tLord Loudoun reached New York in July 1756, but his command was not a happy one. He assumed command of the British Forces at Albany, in upstate New York, but there was much confusion and the authorities at home were slow to react. Lord Loudoun planned to capture the French Fort Louisburg in Cape Breton. To keep the mission secret he placed an embargo on all outward going ships on 3rd January 1757. He was bitterly criticized in both North America and Britain for the move. Lord Loudoun sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia, but wasted time and seemed unable to decide upon a definite course of action, and retired to New York. As a result he was recalled to Britain and replaced by General Amherst. Lord Loudoun was described by a Philadelphian as being \u201clike Saint George upon the signpost, always on horseback but never advancing.\u201d\n\tIn 1762, in the war against Spain, he was appointed second in command of the Army in Portugal. In 1770 he was appointed Colonel of the 3rd Foot Guards, the Regiment in which he had served, and Lieutenant General. He was appointed Governor of Edinburgh Castle.\n\tLord Loudoun retired to his family home in Ayrshire, where he had always been an agricultural improver. He was particularly interested in growing willows and brought back many varieties from North America.\n\tThere is no further trace of Lord Loudoun's wife K MacDougall. Lord Loudoun certainly had affairs and took a mistress with him to America in 1756.\n\n'''Samuel Johnson and James Boswell'''\n\tOn 30th October 1773 Lord Loudoun, with his old mother Margaret, dowager Countess of Loudoun, aged 95, entertained Dr Samuel Johnson and James Boswell at Loudoun Castle.\n\tJames Boswell wrote[134] that \u201cI cannot here refrain from paying a just tribute to the character of John Earl of Loudoun, who did more service to the county of Ayr in general, as well as the individuals in it, than any man we have ever had. It is painful to think that he met with such ingratitude from persons both in high and low rank; but such was his temper, such his knowledge of 'base mankind', [a reference to Pope's line, \u201cThe unwilling gratitude of base mankind\u201d] that, as if he had expected no other return, his mind was never soured, and he retained his good-humour and benevolence to the last. The tenderness of his heart was proved in 1745-6, when he had an important command in the Highlands, and behaved with generous humanity to the unfortunate. \n\t\u201cHis kind and dutiful attention to his mother was unremitted. At his house was true hospitality; a plain but plentiful table; and every guest, being left at perfect freedom, felt quite easy and happy. While I live, I shall honour the memory of this amiable man.\u201d\n\tLord Loudoun died in 1782 and was succeeded by his cousin John Mure Campbell of Lawers, the son of Sir James Campbell of Lawers who had been killed at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745.\n\n'''The officer of Lord Loudoun's Regiment''' \nRank\t\tName\t\t\t\t\tCommission\tSeniority 48\t1748 Half pay\nColonel \tJohn Campbell, Earl of Loudoun. \t25 May 1745;  \t\t1749 half pay\nLieutenant Colonel John Campbell. \t\t\t8 June 1745 \t\t\t1749 half pay\nMajor\t\tWilliam MacKenzie. \t\t\t8 June 1745\t\t\t1749 half pay\nCaptains\tAlexander Mackay. \t\t\t8 June 1745.\tSenior\t\t1749 half pay\n\t\tJohn Stuart. \t\t\t\t8 June 1745. \tCashiered April 1747\n\t\tReplaced by Capt George Mackay.

By December 1746 there were records of 31 sergeants in ten companies. Only seven of those sergeants had enlisted in 1745. Donald Ross, on 1st July 1745 in the Major's company; John Aird, on 1st August and Robert Ross, on 6th August 1745, in Sir Harry Munro's company; John McPherson, on 22nd July 1745 in Lord Charles Gordon's company; George Gunn, on 17th July 1745, and James Campbell, on 10th August 1745 and Andrews Buchanan, enlisted on 1st July 1745, in Captain Alexander Campbell of Ardkinglas's company, from September 1746 Alexander Grant's company.\n\tOn 2nd January 1747 Lord Loudoun gave orders[117] for regulatory extra allowance for the Sergeant Major and the Drum Major at 1d a day from each Captain to be paid at the end of each month.\n\tThe Sergeant Major was probably Lord Loudoun\u2019s own sergeant, Robert Grant, recruited on 10th May 1746. He doubtless had service in some other Regiment. He would receive one shilling a day extra, or \u00a31.10 a month extra.\n\tBy October 1747 there were records of 28 sergeants in nine companies. Five of the sergeants had been appointed in 1747, and one had been promoted from being a corporal.\n\n'''Corporals in Lord Loudoun's Regiment'''\n\tThirty corporals were recorded in eleven companies in 1746. Of these nine were recruited in 1745.There were ten new corporals by 1747, one a promoted private.\n\n'''Drummers and pipers in Lord Loudoun's Regiment'''\n        There were records of 22 drummers and four pipers.\n\tDonald Ban MacCrummen, piper to Captain John MacLeod's company, was not recorded. He was killed at the Rout of Moy in February 1746. Captain MacLeod had great difficulty in finding a replacement, but eventually, in March 1747, Lieutenant Donald MacDonald, stationed at Glenelg, wrote[135] that he had \u201clisted a good piper for the Grandr Company.\u201d He was Neil McCartan or MacArthur, from the Trotternish piping family.\n\tIn December 1746 John Campbell was the piper in the Lieutenant Colonel\u2019s company, as was Kenneth McKenzie, in the Major's. Duncan McPharling, from Dumbarton, aged 21, was piper in Captain Archibald Macnab\u2019s company, and Finlay Ferguson, from Tarbert, Argyll, was piper in Captain Grant\u2019s company, formerly Captain Alexander Campbell\u2019s company.

Authority, therefore, was given to [[John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun]] to raise another Highland regiment under the patronage of the noblemen, chiefs, and gentlemen of that part of the kingdom, whose sons and connections would be appointed officers. The regiment was raised at [[Inverness]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] in August 1745 and the Earl of Loudoun served as its colonel throughout its short life.
