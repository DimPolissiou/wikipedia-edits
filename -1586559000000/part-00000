In the first decade of the 20th century, the Qing government began implementing the so-called [[New Policies]], aimed at a further integration of Outer Mongolia. Upset by the prospect of the colonization akin to the developments in [[Inner Mongolia]] during the 19th century, the Mongolian aristocracy turned to the [[Russian Empire]] for support. In August 1911, a Mongol delegation went to [[Saint Petersburg]] and obtained a pledge of limited support. When they returned, the [[Xinhai Revolution]]\u2014that eventually led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty\u2014had begun. In December 1911 the Mongols deposed the Qing [[Amban]] in [[Ulaanbaatar]] and declared their independence under the leadership of the 8th [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], who was appointed [[Bogd Khan]] of Mongolia, breaking away from the Qing dynasty. Attempts to include Inner Mongolia into the new state failed for various reasons, including the military weakness of the Inner Mongols to achieve their independence, the lack of Russian assistance to them (Russia was bound in Inner Mongolian affairs by secret treaties with Japan), and the lack of support from Inner Mongolian aristocrats and the higher clergy. In the [[Kyakhta|Khiagt]] agreement of 1915, China, Russia and Mongolia agreed on Mongolia's status as maintaining autonomy under Chinese suzerainty.<ref>C.R.

In 1936, Stalin then ordered the liquidation of the country's Buddhist institutions. Meanwhile, Japanese incursions in Manchuria were a ''casus belli'' for Moscow to station troops in Mongolia.

The Soviet and Mongolian armies defeated Japanese forces that had invaded eastern Mongolia in the summer of 1939 at the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]], and a truce was signed setting up a commission to define the Mongolian-Manchurian border in the autumn of that year.\n\nAfter 1941, Mongolia's economy was readjusted to support the Soviet Union in every way possible, including providing funding for several Soviet military units.

Suvorov wrote that Mongolian aid during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet\u2013German War]] was important like the [[United States]] assistance because warm clothes often decided victory in battles on the Eastern Front.<ref>[http://www.polit.mn/content /2206.htm;jsessionid=FAF6B2B851F446ED2DF18E8399923D43 \u0413\u0415\u0420\u041c\u0410\u041d\u042b\u0413 \u0414\u0410\u0420\u0421\u0410\u041d \u0425\u041e\u041b\u0411\u041e\u041e\u0422\u041e\u041d \u0423\u041b\u0421\u042b\u041d \u041d\u042d\u0413 \u041d\u042c \u041c\u041e\u041d\u0413\u041e\u041b]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Mongolian)</ref><ref>[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov3/08.html \u0412.\u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u0410 8  \u0423 \u041a\u041e\u0413\u041e \u0421\u041e\u042e\u0417\u041d\u0418\u041a\u0418 \u041b\u0423\u0427\u0428\u0415?] (Russian)</ref><ref>V.Suvorov, The last republic</ref> Additionally, Mongolian volunteers fought in the Red Army against the Axis Powers in Europe.<ref>Denys J.

The preceding build-up brought 650,000 Soviet soldiers to Mongolia, along with massive amounts of equipment. The [[Mongolian People's Army]] played a limited support role in the conflict, but its involvement gave Stalin the means to force the Chinese side finally to accept Mongolia's independence.\n\n=== 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty and Mongolia's independence ===\n{{Main|Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance|Mongolian independence referendum, 1945}}\n{{See also|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505}}\n\nThe February 1945 Yalta Conference provided for the [[Soviet Union]]'s participation in the [[Pacific War]]. One of the Soviet conditions for its participation, put forward at Yalta, was that after the war Outer Mongolia would retain its \"status-quo.\" The precise meaning of this \"status-quo\" became a bone of contention at Sino-Soviet talks in Moscow in the summer of 1945 between Stalin and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s envoy [[T. V. Soong]].\n\nStalin insisted on the Republic of China's recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence \u2013 something that it already enjoyed de facto even as it remained a part of China de jure. Chiang Kai-shek resisted the idea but eventually gave in. However, Chiang extracted from Stalin a promise to refrain from supporting the Chinese Communist Party, partly as a quid pro quo for giving up Outer Mongolia.\n\nThus, the Sino-Soviet Treaty guaranteed Outer Mongolia's independence, but it also ended Khorloogiin Choibalsan's hopes for uniting Outer Mongolia with Inner Mongolia, which remained in China's hands. Choibalsan initially hoped that Stalin would support his vision of Great Mongolia but the Soviet leader easily sacrificed Choibalsan's vision for Soviet gains, guaranteed by the Sino-Soviet Treaty and legitimized by the Yalta agreements. In this sense, the Sino-Soviet Treaty marked Mongolia's permanent division into an independent Mongolian People's Republic and a neighboring Inner Mongolia of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mhJY7VgEWTUC&pg=PA2003&dq=reins+of+liberation&sig=ACfU3U1gNusc78Fwt-lkrPBBSb7FuHKDMQ Liu Xiaoyuan, Reins of Liberation: An Entangled History of Mongolian Independence, Chinese Territoriality, and Great Power Hegemony, 1911\u20131950 (Washington D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Press, 2006)]</ref>\n\n===Cold War politics (1945\u201385)===\nSecure in its relations with Moscow, the Mongolian government shifted to postwar development, focusing on civilian enterprise. Mongolia was at this time one of the world's most isolated countries, having almost no contact with any nation outside of the Soviet Union. After the war, international ties were expanded and Mongolia established relations with [[North Korea]] and the new [[Communist state]]s in [[Eastern Europe]]. Mongolia and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) recognized each other in 1949, and the PRC relinquished all claims to Outer Mongolia. However, Mao Zedong privately hoped for Mongolia's reintegration with China. He raised this question before the Soviet leadership as early as 1949 (in meeting with [[Anastas Mikoyan]] at Xibaipo), and then, after having been firmly rebuffed by Stalin, again in 1954, a year after Stalin's death. In 1956, following Nikita Khrushchev's [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denunciation of Stalin]], the Chinese leaders attempted to present Mongolia's independence as one of Stalin's mistakes in meetings with Mikoyan. The Soviet response was that the Mongols were free to decide their own fate.<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/CWIHPBulletin16_p4.pdf Sergey Radchenko, \"New Documents on Mongolia and the Cold War,\" Cold War International History Project Bulletin no. 16 (2008)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910113957/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/CWIHPBulletin16_p4.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal Berlin, VIII.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] led Mongolia for over 44 years]]\nIn 1952, Choibalsan died in Moscow where he had been undergoing treatment for cancer. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]]. Unlike his predecessor, Tsedenbal was enthusiastic about incorporating Mongolia as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. The idea met with strenuous opposition from other MPRP members and was subsequently abandoned.\n\nIn the 1950s relations between the MPR and the PRC improved considerably. China provided much needed economic aid, building up entire industries in Ulaanbaatar, as well as apartment blocks. Thousands of Chinese laborers were involved in these projects until China withdrew them after 1962 in a bid to pressure Mongolia to break with Moscow at the time of worsening Sino-Soviet relations.\n\nAfter the beginning of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mongolia briefly vacillated, but soon took a sharply pro-Soviet stand, being one of the first socialist countries to endorse the Soviet position in the quarrel with China. Military build-up on the Sino-Mongolian border began as early as 1963; in December 1965 the Mongolian Politburo requested the Soviet Union to station its military forces in Mongolia. In January 1966, with Leonid Brezhnev's visit to Mongolia, the two countries signed a mutual assistance treaty, paving way to Soviet military presence in the MPR. In February 1967, following weeks of worsening Sino-Soviet tensions, Moscow officially approved the stationing of the reorganised [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Soviet Army]] in Mongolia.\n\nWith Soviet encouragement, Mongolia increased its participation in communist-sponsored conferences and international organizations. In 1955, Mongolia attempted to join the [[United Nations]], but the request was [[veto]]ed by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (now based on [[Taiwan]]) which maintained their renewed claim over Mongolia. Mongolia became a member of the UN in 1961 after the Soviet Union threatened to veto the admission of all of the newly decolonized states of Africa if the Republic of China again used its veto. Diplomatic relations with the United States were not established until near the end of the Cold War. Mongolia became a bone of contention between the Soviet Union and China following the Sino-Soviet split because of the presence of Soviet nuclear arms.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, Tsedenbal became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and erratic. Following a series of party [[purge]]s, he was expelled from office in August 1984 on the pretext of \"old age and mental incapacity\". The removal of Tsedenbal had full Soviet backing, and he retired to Moscow where he lived until his death from cancer in 1991. [[Jambyn Batm\u00f6nkh]] took over as General Secretary and enthusiastically plunged into the reforms implemented in the Soviet Union by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n=== Collapse (1985\u201392) ===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Hunger strikers in Mongolia.png|thumb|right|200px|Hunger strikers in 1990]] -->\n{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}\nAfter [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power in the Soviet Union, he implemented the policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]''. The atmosphere of reform in the Soviet Union prompted similar reforms in Mongolia. Following mass demonstrations in the winter of 1990, the MPRP began to loosen its controls of the political system. The [[Politburo]] of the MPRP resigned in March, and in May the constitution was amended, deleting reference to the MPRP's role as the guiding force in the country, legalizing opposition parties, creating a standing legislative body, and establishing the office of president. On July 29, 1990, the first multiparty elections in Mongolia were held.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-24/news/wr-748_1_mongolian-democratic-party|title=Briefing Paper : For the First Time, Mongolians Have Political Choices|last=Holley|first=David|date=24 July 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|place=Los Angeles, CA|accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> The election results returned a majority for the MPRP, which won with 85% of the vote.

Farming and industry were almost nonexistent; transportation and communications were primitive; banking, services, and trade were almost exclusively in the hands of Chinese or other foreigners. Most of the people were illiterate nomadic herders, and a large part of the male labour force lived in the monasteries, contributing little to the economy. Property in the form of livestock was owned primarily by aristocrats and monasteries; ownership of the remaining sectors of the economy was dominated by Chinese or other foreigners. Mongolia's new rulers thus were faced with a daunting task in building a modern, socialist economy.\n\nMongolia's economic development under the [[communist regime]] can be divided into three periods: 1921\u20131939; 1940\u20131960; and 1961 to the present. During the first period, which the People's Republic called the stage of \"general democratic transformation,\" the economy remained primarily [[agrarian economy|agrarian]] and underdeveloped. After an abortive attempt to collectivize herders, livestock remained in private hands. The state began to develop industry based on processing of animal husbandry products and crop raising on state farms. Transportation, communications, domestic and foreign trade, and banking and finance were nationalized with Soviet assistance; they were placed under the control of Mongolian state and cooperative organizations or Mongolian-Soviet [[joint-stock]] companies. [[Ulaanbaatar]] became the nation's industrial center.\n\nDuring the second period, called the \"construction of the foundations of socialism,\" [[Negdel#Introduction of the negdel|agriculture was collectivized]], and industry was diversified into mining, timber processing, and [[consumer goods]] production. [[Central planning]] of the economy began in 1931 with an abortive five-year plan and with annual plans in 1941; five-year plans began anew with the [[First Five-Year Plan (Mongolian People's Republic)|First Five-Year Plan]] (1948\u201352). Soviet, and after 1949 [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]], aid increased, allowing the construction of the [[Trans-Mongolian Railway]] \u2013 the Ulaanbaatar Railway \u2013 and various industrial projects. Although industrial development still was concentrated in Ulaanbaatar, economic decentralization began with the completion of the Ulaanbaatar Railroad and the establishment of food processing plants in [[Aimags of Mongolia|aimag]] centers.\n\nThe third stage, which the government called the \"completion of the construction of the material and technical basis of socialism,\" saw further industrialization and agricultural growth, aided largely by Mongolia's joining the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (Comecon) in 1962. After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Chinese aid ceased, but continued Soviet and East European financial and technical assistance in the forms of credits, advisers, and joint ventures enabled Mongolia to modernize and to diversify industry, particularly in mining. New industrial centers were built in [[Baganuur]], [[Choibalsan (city)|Choibalsan]], [[Darkhan (city)|Darkhan]], and [[Erdenet]], and industrial output rose significantly. Although animal husbandry was stagnant, crop production increased dramatically with the development of virgin lands by state farms. Foreign trade with Comecon nations grew substantially. Transportation and communications systems were improved, linking population and industrial centers and extending to more remote rural areas. In the late 1980s, Mongolia had developed into an agricultural-industrial economy, but the inefficiencies of a centrally planned and managed economy and the example of [[perestroika]] in the Soviet Union led Mongolian leaders to undertake a reform program to develop the economy further.\n\n== Mongolian People's Army ==\n{{Main|Mongolian People's Army}}\n \n[[File:Key Soviet Forces Opposite Norteastern China.png|250px|thumb|Distribution of military power in the Far East and Mongolia of the Soviet Union during the Cold War]]\nThe Mongolian People's Army ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0410\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438, or \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0410\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0425\u0443\u0432\u044c\u0441\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0442 \u0426\u044d\u0440\u044d\u0433) or Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army was established on 18 March 1921 as a secondary army under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] command during the 1920s and during [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]], elite [[Qinghai]] Chinese Muslim cavalry were sent by the Chinese government to destroy the Mongols and the Russians in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=warlords+and+muslims#v=snippet&q=elite%20tungan%20cavalry%20incident&f=false |title = Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911\u20131949 |author = Andrew D.

In the first decade of the 20th century, the Qing government began implementing the so-called [[New Policies]], aimed at a further integration of Outer Mongolia. Upset by the prospect of the colonization akin to the developments in [[Inner Mongolia]] during the 19th century, the Mongolian aristocracy turned to the [[Russian Empire]] for support. In August 1911, a Mongol delegation went to [[Saint Petersburg]] and obtained a pledge of limited support. When they returned, the [[Xinhai Revolution]]\u2014that eventually led to the collapse of the Qing dynasty\u2014had begun. In December 1911 the Mongols deposed the Qing [[Amban]] in [[Ulaanbaatar]] and declared their independence under the leadership of the 8th [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], who was appointed [[Bogd Khan]] of Mongolia, breaking away from the Qing dynasty. Attempts to include Inner Mongolia into the new state failed for various reasons, including the military weakness of the Inner Mongols to achieve their independence, the lack of Russian assistance to them (Russia was bound in Inner Mongolian affairs by secret treaties with Japan), and the lack of support from Inner Mongolian aristocrats and the higher clergy. In the [[Kyakhta|Khiagt]] agreement of 1915, China, Russia and Mongolia agreed on Mongolia's status as maintaining autonomy under Chinese suzerainty.<ref>C.R.

In 1936, Stalin then ordered the liquidation of the country's Buddhist institutions. Meanwhile, Japanese incursions in Manchuria were a ''casus belli'' for Moscow to station troops in Mongolia. At the same time, [[Stalinist purges in Mongolia|the Great Purge]] spilled into Mongolia. Among those killed included Genden, [[Anandyn Amar]], [[Gelegdorjiin Demid|Demid]], and Losol.

The Soviet and Mongolian armies defeated Japanese forces that had invaded eastern Mongolia in the summer of 1939 at the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]], and a truce was signed setting up a commission to define the Mongolian-Manchurian border in the autumn of that year.\n\nAfter 1941, Mongolia's economy was readjusted to support the Soviet Union in every way possible, including providing funding for several Soviet military units. Russian historian V. Suvorov wrote that Mongolian aid during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Soviet\u2013German War]] was important like the [[United States]] assistance because warm clothes often decided victory in battles on the Eastern Front.<ref>[http://www.polit.mn/content /2206.htm;jsessionid=FAF6B2B851F446ED2DF18E8399923D43 \u0413\u0415\u0420\u041c\u0410\u041d\u042b\u0413 \u0414\u0410\u0420\u0421\u0410\u041d \u0425\u041e\u041b\u0411\u041e\u041e\u0422\u041e\u041d \u0423\u041b\u0421\u042b\u041d \u041d\u042d\u0413 \u041d\u042c \u041c\u041e\u041d\u0413\u041e\u041b]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Mongolian)</ref><ref>[http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov3/08.html \u0412.\u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u0410 8  \u0423 \u041a\u041e\u0413\u041e \u0421\u041e\u042e\u0417\u041d\u0418\u041a\u0418 \u041b\u0423\u0427\u0428\u0415?] (Russian)</ref><ref>V.Suvorov, The last republic</ref> Additionally, Mongolian volunteers fought in the Red Army against the Axis Powers in Europe.<ref>Denys J.

The preceding build-up brought 650,000 Soviet soldiers to Mongolia, along with massive amounts of equipment. The [[Mongolian People's Army]] played a limited support role in the conflict, but its involvement gave Stalin the means to force the Chinese side finally to accept Mongolia's independence.\n\n=== 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty and Mongolia's independence ===\n{{Main|Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance|Mongolian independence referendum, 1945}}\n{{See also|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505}}\n\nThe February 1945 Yalta Conference provided for the [[Soviet Union]]'s participation in the [[Pacific War]]. One of the Soviet conditions for its participation, put forward at Yalta, was that after the war Outer Mongolia would retain its \"status-quo.\" The precise meaning of this \"status-quo\" became a bone of contention at Sino-Soviet talks in Moscow in the summer of 1945 between Stalin and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s envoy [[T. V. Soong]].\n\nStalin insisted on the Republic of China's recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence \u2013 something that it already enjoyed de facto even as it remained a part of China de jure. Chiang Kai-shek resisted the idea but eventually gave in. However, Chiang extracted from Stalin a promise to refrain from supporting the Chinese Communist Party, partly as a quid pro quo for giving up Outer Mongolia.\n\nThus, the Sino-Soviet Treaty guaranteed Outer Mongolia's independence, but it also ended Khorloogiin Choibalsan's hopes for uniting Outer Mongolia with Inner Mongolia, which remained in China's hands. Choibalsan initially hoped that Stalin would support his vision of Great Mongolia but the Soviet leader easily sacrificed Choibalsan's vision for Soviet gains, guaranteed by the Sino-Soviet Treaty and legitimized by the Yalta agreements. In this sense, the Sino-Soviet Treaty marked Mongolia's permanent division into an independent Mongolian People's Republic and a neighboring Inner Mongolia of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mhJY7VgEWTUC&pg=PA2003&dq=reins+of+liberation&sig=ACfU3U1gNusc78Fwt-lkrPBBSb7FuHKDMQ Liu Xiaoyuan, Reins of Liberation: An Entangled History of Mongolian Independence, Chinese Territoriality, and Great Power Hegemony, 1911\u20131950 (Washington D.C.: Woodrow Wilson Press, 2006)]</ref>\n\n===Cold War politics (1945\u201385)===\nSecure in its relations with Moscow, the Mongolian government shifted to postwar development, focusing on civilian enterprise. Mongolia was at this time one of the world's most isolated countries, having almost no contact with any nation outside of the Soviet Union. After the war, international ties were expanded and Mongolia established relations with [[North Korea]] and the new [[Communist state]]s in [[Eastern Europe]]. Mongolia and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) recognized each other in 1949, and the PRC relinquished all claims to Outer Mongolia. However, Mao Zedong privately hoped for Mongolia's reintegration with China. He raised this question before the Soviet leadership as early as 1949 (in meeting with [[Anastas Mikoyan]] at Xibaipo), and then, after having been firmly rebuffed by Stalin, again in 1954, a year after Stalin's death. In 1956, following Nikita Khrushchev's [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denunciation of Stalin]], the Chinese leaders attempted to present Mongolia's independence as one of Stalin's mistakes in meetings with Mikoyan. The Soviet response was that the Mongols were free to decide their own fate.<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/CWIHPBulletin16_p4.pdf Sergey Radchenko, \"New Documents on Mongolia and the Cold War,\" Cold War International History Project Bulletin no. 16 (2008)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910113957/http://www.wilsoncenter.org/topics/pubs/CWIHPBulletin16_p4.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal Berlin, VIII.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] led Mongolia for over 44 years]]\nIn 1952, Choibalsan died in Moscow where he had been undergoing treatment for cancer. He was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]]. Unlike his predecessor, Tsedenbal was enthusiastic about incorporating Mongolia as a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. The idea met with strenuous opposition from other MPRP members and was subsequently abandoned.\n\nIn the 1950s relations between the MPR and the PRC improved considerably. China provided much needed economic aid, building up entire industries in Ulaanbaatar, as well as apartment blocks. Thousands of Chinese laborers were involved in these projects until China withdrew them after 1962 in a bid to pressure Mongolia to break with Moscow at the time of worsening Sino-Soviet relations.\n\nAfter the beginning of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mongolia briefly vacillated, but soon took a sharply pro-Soviet stand, being one of the first socialist countries to endorse the Soviet position in the quarrel with China. Military build-up on the Sino-Mongolian border began as early as 1963; in December 1965 the Mongolian Politburo requested the Soviet Union to station its military forces in Mongolia. In January 1966, with Leonid Brezhnev's visit to Mongolia, the two countries signed a mutual assistance treaty, paving way to Soviet military presence in the MPR. In February 1967, following weeks of worsening Sino-Soviet tensions, Moscow officially approved the stationing of the reorganised [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Soviet Army]] in Mongolia.\n\nWith Soviet encouragement, Mongolia increased its participation in communist-sponsored conferences and international organizations. In 1955, Mongolia attempted to join the [[United Nations]], but the request was [[veto]]ed by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (now based on [[Taiwan]]) which maintained their renewed claim over Mongolia. Mongolia became a member of the UN in 1961 after the Soviet Union threatened to veto the admission of all of the newly decolonized states of Africa if the Republic of China again used its veto. Diplomatic relations with the United States were not established until near the end of the Cold War. Mongolia became a bone of contention between the Soviet Union and China following the Sino-Soviet split because of the presence of Soviet nuclear arms.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, Tsedenbal became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and erratic. Following a series of party [[purge]]s, he was expelled from office in August 1984 on the pretext of \"old age and mental incapacity\". The removal of Tsedenbal had full Soviet backing, and he retired to Moscow where he lived until his death from cancer in 1991. [[Jambyn Batm\u00f6nkh]] took over as General Secretary and enthusiastically plunged into the reforms implemented in the Soviet Union by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n=== Collapse (1985\u201392) ===\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Hunger strikers in Mongolia.png|thumb|right|200px|Hunger strikers in 1990]] -->\n{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}\nAfter [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power in the Soviet Union, he implemented the policies of ''[[perestroika]]'' and ''[[glasnost]]''. The atmosphere of reform in the Soviet Union prompted similar reforms in Mongolia. Following mass demonstrations in the winter of 1990, the MPRP began to loosen its controls of the political system. The [[Politburo]] of the MPRP resigned in March, and in May the constitution was amended, deleting reference to the MPRP's role as the guiding force in the country, legalizing opposition parties, creating a standing legislative body, and establishing the office of president. On July 29, 1990, the first multiparty elections in Mongolia were held.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-24/news/wr-748_1_mongolian-democratic-party|title=Briefing Paper : For the First Time, Mongolians Have Political Choices|last=Holley|first=David|date=24 July 1990|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|place=Los Angeles, CA|accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> The election results returned a majority for the MPRP, which won with 85% of the vote.

Farming and industry were almost nonexistent; transportation and communications were primitive; banking, services, and trade were almost exclusively in the hands of Chinese or other foreigners. Most of the people were illiterate nomadic herders, and a large part of the male labour force lived in the monasteries, contributing little to the economy. Property in the form of livestock was owned primarily by aristocrats and monasteries; ownership of the remaining sectors of the economy was dominated by Chinese or other foreigners. Mongolia's new rulers thus were faced with a daunting task in building a modern, socialist economy.\n\nMongolia's economic development under the [[communist regime]] can be divided into three periods: 1921\u20131939; 1940\u20131960; and 1961 to the present. During the first period, which the People's Republic called the stage of \"general democratic transformation,\" the economy remained primarily [[agrarian economy|agrarian]] and underdeveloped. After an abortive attempt to collectivize herders, livestock remained in private hands. The state began to develop industry based on processing of animal husbandry products and crop raising on state farms. Transportation, communications, domestic and foreign trade, and banking and finance were nationalized with Soviet assistance; they were placed under the control of Mongolian state and cooperative organizations or Mongolian-Soviet [[joint-stock]] companies. [[Ulaanbaatar]] became the nation's industrial center.\n\nDuring the second period, called the \"construction of the foundations of socialism,\" [[Negdel#Introduction of the negdel|agriculture was collectivized]], and industry was diversified into mining, timber processing, and [[consumer goods]] production. [[Central planning]] of the economy began in 1931 with an abortive five-year plan and with annual plans in 1941; five-year plans began anew with the [[First Five-Year Plan (Mongolian People's Republic)|First Five-Year Plan]] (1948\u201352). Soviet, and after 1949 [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]], aid increased, allowing the construction of the [[Trans-Mongolian Railway]] \u2013 the Ulaanbaatar Railway \u2013 and various industrial projects. Although industrial development still was concentrated in Ulaanbaatar, economic decentralization began with the completion of the Ulaanbaatar Railroad and the establishment of food processing plants in [[Aimags of Mongolia|aimag]] centers.\n\nThe third stage, which the government called the \"completion of the construction of the material and technical basis of socialism,\" saw further industrialization and agricultural growth, aided largely by Mongolia's joining the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (Comecon) in 1962. After the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Chinese aid ceased, but continued Soviet and East European financial and technical assistance in the forms of credits, advisers, and joint ventures enabled Mongolia to modernize and to diversify industry, particularly in mining. New industrial centers were built in [[Baganuur]], [[Choibalsan (city)|Choibalsan]], [[Darkhan (city)|Darkhan]], and [[Erdenet]], and industrial output rose significantly. Although animal husbandry was stagnant, crop production increased dramatically with the development of virgin lands by state farms. Foreign trade with Comecon nations grew substantially. Transportation and communications systems were improved, linking population and industrial centers and extending to more remote rural areas. In the late 1980s, Mongolia had developed into an agricultural-industrial economy, but the inefficiencies of a centrally planned and managed economy and the example of [[perestroika]] in the Soviet Union led Mongolian leaders to undertake a reform program to develop the economy further.\n\n== Mongolian People's Army ==\n{{Main|Mongolian People's Army}}\n \n[[File:Key Soviet Forces Opposite Norteastern China.png|250px|thumb|Distribution of military power in the Far East and Mongolia of the Soviet Union during the Cold War]]\nThe Mongolian People's Army ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u0410\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438, or \u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b \u0410\u0440\u0434\u044b\u043d \u0425\u0443\u0432\u044c\u0441\u0433\u0430\u043b\u0442 \u0426\u044d\u0440\u044d\u0433) or Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army was established on 18 March 1921 as a secondary army under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] command during the 1920s and during [[World War II]].\n\nDuring the [[Pei-ta-shan Incident]], elite [[Qinghai]] Chinese Muslim cavalry were sent by the Chinese government to destroy the Mongols and the Russians in 1947.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=IAs9AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=warlords+and+muslims#v=snippet&q=elite%20tungan%20cavalry%20incident&f=false |title = Warlords and Muslims in Chinese Central Asia: a political history of Republican Sinkiang 1911\u20131949 |author = Andrew D.

Based in [[Old Deer Park]], [[Richmond-upon-Thames]], London Welsh RFC played in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] in the [[2012\u201313 English Premiership (rugby union)|2012\u201313]] and [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315]] seasons, after gaining promotion from the [[RFU Championship]] in the 2012 and 2014 play-off final. The club returned to Old Deer Park in 2015 after three seasons at the [[Kassam Stadium]], [[Oxford]].\n\nThe club went into liquidation in December 2016 under Chairman Bleddyn Phillips, and was given a temporary licence to complete two fixtures in the Championship. On 24 January 2017 it was announced that London Welsh had been removed from the [[2016\u201317 RFU Championship|RFU Championship]] and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\".<ref name=londonwelshliquidation2>{{cite web|title=London Welsh: RFU refuses permission for Exiles to stay in Championship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/38736486|website=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2017}}</ref>  The remnants of the defunct club were amalgamated into [[London Welsh Amateur|their amateur set up]].\n\n==Affiliated teams==\nDuring professionalism, London Welsh's first-XV squad were fully professional, and they were complemented with the London Welsh Amateurs, Druids and Occies. Following the changes at the club in the 2016/17 season the club operates the 1st XV and Druids 2nd XV that form the performance playing squad, the Occies 3rd XV and the Under 23s Griffins player pathway.\n\nLondon Welsh has one of the longest-standing women's sides \u2013 LWWRFC \u2013 which celebrated thirty years of women's rugby at the club in the 2015\u201316 season. While still being amateur, the club has succeeded both in XVs in the winter and 7s during the summer as well as players representing England at the regional level and on the Wales national touch team. There is also a mini and junior section.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nLondon Welsh was formed in 1885 by and for London's [[Wales|Welsh]] community, and has played senior-level rugby since then.<ref name=\"Jones3\">Jones (1985), pg 3.</ref> Its name in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], is ''Clwb Rygbi Cymry Llundain''.\n\n===Players who have won international and Lions caps===\nOver the years the club has contributed 177 players to the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales national team]] and 43 players to the [[British and Irish Lions]]. Seven London Welsh players were selected for the [[1971 British Lions tour to New Zealand|1971 tour to New Zealand]] (a Lions record which remains unbroken to this day): captain John Dawes (now London Welsh president), JPR Williams, Gerald Davies, Mervyn Davies, John Taylor (now Managing Director<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.london-welsh.co.uk/club_contacts.asp|title=London Welsh \u2013 Club Contacts|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019193126/http://www.london-welsh.co.uk/club_contacts.asp|archivedate=19 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and ITV commentator), Mike Roberts and Geoff Evans.\n\n===1960s===\nLondon Welsh enjoyed great success in the late 1960s. [[John Dawes]] was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards.

The team was also defeated in every single European Challenge Cup game, as well as every single Anglo-Welsh cup game. As a result, they became the first top-flight English side for over 10 years to suffer defeat in every single competitive match over a season.\n\n===2015\u2013present: return to Richmond and liquidation===\nThe club left Oxford and returned to Old Deer Park at the end of the [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315 season]].

Based in [[Old Deer Park]], [[Richmond-upon-Thames]], London Welsh RFC played in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]] in the [[2012\u201313 English Premiership (rugby union)|2012\u201313]] and [[2014\u201315 English Premiership (rugby union)|2014\u201315]] seasons, after gaining promotion from the [[RFU Championship]] in the 2012 and 2014 play-off final. The club returned to Old Deer Park in 2015 after three seasons at the [[Kassam Stadium]], [[Oxford]].\n\nThe club went into liquidation in December 2016 under Chairman Bleddyn Phillips, and was given a temporary licence to complete two fixtures in the Championship. On 24 January 2017 it was announced that London Welsh had been removed from the [[2016\u201317 RFU Championship|RFU Championship]] and their results expunged. The RFU stated that their place in the league was \"untenable\".<ref name=londonwelshliquidation2>{{cite web|title=London Welsh: RFU refuses permission for Exiles to stay in Championship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/38736486|website=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2017}}</ref>  The remnants of the defunct club were amalgamated into [[London Welsh Amateur|their amateur set up]].\n\n==Affiliated teams==\nDuring professionalism, London Welsh's first-XV squad were fully professional, and they were complemented with the London Welsh Amateurs, Druids and Occies. Following the changes at the club in the 2016/17 season the club operates the 1st XV and Druids 2nd XV that form the performance playing squad, the Occies 3rd XV and the Under 23s Griffins player pathway.\n\nLondon Welsh has one of the longest-standing women's sides \u2013 LWWRFC \u2013 which celebrated thirty years of women's rugby at the club in the 2015\u201316 season. While still being amateur, the club has succeeded both in XVs in the winter and 7s during the summer as well as players representing England at the regional level and on the Wales national touch team. There is also a mini and junior section.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nLondon Welsh was formed in 1885 by and for London's [[Wales|Welsh]] community, and has played senior-level rugby since then.<ref name=\"Jones3\">Jones (1985), pg 3.</ref> Its name in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], is ''Clwb Rygbi Cymry Llundain''.\n\n===Players who have won international and Lions caps===\nOver the years the club has contributed 177 players to the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales national team]] and 43 players to the [[British and Irish Lions]].

[[John Dawes]] was appointed captain, and effectively also as coach, for the 1965-66 season. He initially significantly increased fitness levels, and then led the club in an open, running, quick-passing, attacking style of rugby, including an overlapping full-back, and relatively skilled forwards.

In 1871/72, the surrounding rural areas from these three prefectures and the Setagaya exclave of [[Hikone Domain|Hikone ex-domain/prefecture]] were merged into Tokyo.\n\nThe \"system of large and small/major and minor districts\" (\u5927\u533a\u5c0f\u533a\u5236, ''daiku-sh\u014dku-sei'') which was tied to the modernized family registration system ''([[koseki]])'' created an (unpopular) subdivision of all prefectures into numbered subunits.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+Tokyo's administrative structure between [[Koseki|1871/72]] and 1878<br />(not substantially different from other prefectures)\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

That increased further during the progressing industrialization and the explosive growth of the city in the early 20th century, only temporarily set back by the devastation brought about by the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The outskirts grew, but eventually Tokyo City's dominance within Tokyo only increased again as many of the explosively grown suburbs were merged into Tokyo City in 1932, including some of the largest [[Towns of Japan|towns]] in Japanese history with over 100,000 inhabitants each such as [[Nishisugamo, Kitatoshima, Tokyo|West Sugamo in North Toshima District]] and [[Shibuya, Toyotama, Tokyo|Shibuya in Toyotama District]].\n\nVarious plans for a unification of the prefectural and city government were discussed over the decades. An early proposal in the 1890s by then Home Minister [[Nomura Yasushi]] envisioned to separate the rural areas of Tokyo as Musashi prefecture and transform only Tokyo City into a \"Metropolis\", but it failed in the Imperial Diet. Some plans, especially those by the commoner political parties and during the \"Taish\u014d democracy\" of the 1920s, envisioned a \"Metropolis\" more similar to a [[Special cities of Japan (1947\u20131953)|special city]]: an enlarged, prefecture-level city with ''more'' local autonomy. While the city did gain some additional authority under the 1922 \"six major cities law\" (more formally: \u516d\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u884c\u653f\u76e3\u7763\u30cb\u95a2\u30b9\u30eb\u6cd5\u5f8b, ''roku-daitoshi gy\u014dsei kantoku ni kan suru h\u014dritsu'', \"Law relating to the administrative supervision of the six major cities\"), and the governments made plans for a \"Metropolis\" system \u2013 the 1932 \"Greater Tokyo City\" mergers had been part of a Metropolis plan from the Tokyo City Assembly \u2013, the actual reform was carried out later as part of the T\u014dj\u014d cabinet's wartime authoritarian centralization measures (or \"simplification of local government\"). Not only was the Home Ministry control over prefectures and municipalities tightened as in the whole country \u2013 municipal mayors became appointive similar to the Meiji era \u2013; Tokyo's prefectural government and Tokyo City's municipal government were indeed unified into one \"Metropolitan\" government, but under still tighter central government supervision.\n\nThus, in 1943, 86 of Tokyo's 87 municipalities remained Tokyo's municipalities, [[Tokyo City]] was abolished, all municipalities and the 35 ex-city wards were now part of {{nihongo|[[Tokyo|Tokyo Metropolis]]|\u6771\u4eac\u90fd|T\u014dky\u014d-to}} which continues to serve as prefectural government for all of Tokyo, but now additionally as the municipal government in former Tokyo City. The governor of Tokyo, previously ''chiji'' as in all prefectures, was now called ''ch\u014dkan'' (\"head/chief\" [often of a central government agency]) and tied even more closely to the Imperial government than the governors of other prefectures. He became a ''shinninkan'' (\u89aa\u4efb\u5b98), meaning he was appointed directly by the Emperor, [[Shinninshiki#Empire of Japan|in the same procedure]] as a member of the Cabinet, the governors of Ch\u014dsen/Korea or Taiwan/Formosa, or an Army General or Navy Admiral.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+Tokyo's wartime administrative structure from [[T\u014dj\u014d Cabinet|1943]] (unique)\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

And on the local level, the pre-existing neighbourhood associations (see ''[[ch\u014dnaikai]]'' and ''[[Tonarigumi]]'') had been tied into the totalitarian Yokusankai vision and were endowed with far-reaching authority to establish an authoritarian system of control reaching down even to individual citizens. But the war tide had turned, and soon, the occupation under Douglas MacArthur overturned the wartime centralization, and beyond that, introduced new far-reaching local autonomy rights for prefectures, municipalities and even citizens in the form of \"direct demands\" (''chokusetsu seiky\u016b'': recalls, popular initiative referenda for prefectural/municipal by-laws [excluding taxation], petitions, etc.).\n\nThe title ''ch\u014dkan'' for the governor actually remained in place until 1947 when the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]] and the [[Local Autonomy Law]] made Tokyo equal with other prefectures again and gave the residents of former Tokyo City (almost) the same rights as in other municipalities with the introduction of [[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]].

In 1871/72, the surrounding rural areas from these three prefectures and the Setagaya exclave of [[Hikone Domain|Hikone ex-domain/prefecture]] were merged into Tokyo.\n\nThe \"system of large and small/major and minor districts\" (\u5927\u533a\u5c0f\u533a\u5236, ''daiku-sh\u014dku-sei'') which was tied to the modernized family registration system ''([[koseki]])'' created an (unpopular) subdivision of all prefectures into numbered subunits.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+Tokyo's administrative structure between [[Koseki|1871/72]] and 1878<br />(not substantially different from other prefectures)\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

That increased further during the progressing industrialization and the explosive growth of the city in the early 20th century, only temporarily set back by the devastation brought about by the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake. The outskirts grew, but eventually Tokyo City's dominance within Tokyo only increased again as many of the explosively grown suburbs were merged into Tokyo City in 1932, including some of the largest [[Towns of Japan|towns]] in Japanese history with over 100,000 inhabitants each such as [[Nishisugamo, Kitatoshima, Tokyo|West Sugamo in North Toshima District]] and [[Shibuya, Toyotama, Tokyo|Shibuya in Toyotama District]].\n\nVarious plans for a unification of the prefectural and city government were discussed over the decades. An early proposal in the 1890s by then Home Minister [[Nomura Yasushi]] envisioned to separate the rural areas of Tokyo as Musashi prefecture and transform only Tokyo City into a \"Metropolis\", but it failed in the Imperial Diet. Some plans, especially those by the commoner political parties and during the \"Taish\u014d democracy\" of the 1920s, envisioned a \"Metropolis\" more similar to a [[Special cities of Japan (1947\u20131953)|special city]]: an enlarged, prefecture-level city with ''more'' local autonomy. While the city did gain some additional authority under the 1922 \"six major cities law\" (more formally: \u516d\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u884c\u653f\u76e3\u7763\u30cb\u95a2\u30b9\u30eb\u6cd5\u5f8b, ''roku-daitoshi gy\u014dsei kantoku ni kan suru h\u014dritsu'', \"Law relating to the administrative supervision of the six major cities\"), and the governments made plans for a \"Metropolis\" system \u2013 the 1932 \"Greater Tokyo City\" mergers had been part of a Metropolis plan from the Tokyo City Assembly \u2013, the actual reform was carried out later as part of the T\u014dj\u014d cabinet's wartime authoritarian centralization measures (or \"simplification of local government\"). Not only was the Home Ministry control over prefectures and municipalities tightened as in the whole country \u2013 municipal mayors became appointive similar to the Meiji era \u2013; Tokyo's prefectural government and Tokyo City's municipal government were indeed unified into one \"Metropolitan\" government, but under still tighter central government supervision.\n\nThus, in 1943, 86 of Tokyo's 87 municipalities remained Tokyo's municipalities, [[Tokyo City]] was abolished, all municipalities and the 35 ex-city wards were now part of {{nihongo|[[Tokyo|Tokyo Metropolis]]|\u6771\u4eac\u90fd|T\u014dky\u014d-to}} which continues to serve as prefectural government for all of Tokyo, but now additionally as the municipal government in former Tokyo City. The governor of Tokyo, previously ''chiji'' as in all prefectures, was now called ''ch\u014dkan'' (\"head/chief\" [often of a central government agency]) and tied even more closely to the Imperial government than the governors of other prefectures. He became a ''shinninkan'' (\u89aa\u4efb\u5b98), meaning he was appointed directly by the Emperor, [[Shinninshiki#Empire of Japan|in the same procedure]] as a member of the Cabinet, the governors of Ch\u014dsen/Korea or Taiwan/Formosa, or an Army General or Navy Admiral.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+Tokyo's wartime administrative structure from [[T\u014dj\u014d Cabinet|1943]] (unique)\n|-align=\"center\"\n!

And on the local level, the pre-existing neighbourhood associations (see ''[[ch\u014dnaikai]]'' and ''[[Tonarigumi]]'') had been tied into the totalitarian Yokusankai vision and were endowed with far-reaching authority to establish an authoritarian system of control reaching down even to individual citizens. But the war tide had turned, and soon, the occupation under Douglas MacArthur overturned the wartime centralization, and beyond that, introduced new far-reaching local autonomy rights for prefectures, municipalities and even citizens in the form of \"direct demands\" (''chokusetsu seiky\u016b'': recalls, popular initiative referenda for prefectural/municipal by-laws [excluding taxation], petitions, etc.).\n\nThe title ''ch\u014dkan'' for the governor actually remained in place until 1947 when the [[Constitution of Japan|Constitution]] and the [[Local Autonomy Law]] made Tokyo equal with other prefectures again and gave the residents of former Tokyo City (almost) the same rights as in other municipalities with the introduction of [[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]].
