He grew up on a working farm in [[Kansas]]. When he was five years old, he was raped by an older boy.<ref name=\"Intelligencer\"/> He and his family moved to Texas where he joined the [[Eastvale, Texas]] police department, soon becoming chief of the small department.

However, Schreibvogel, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died. Schreibvogel and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Schreibvogel. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Schreibvogel acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him.

He also staged shows at fairs and in shopping malls.<ref name=\"NATGEO\"/> \n\nIn 2006, the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park was cited multiple times by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] for violations of [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]] standards.<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite news |title=AWA Docket No. 05-0014 Consent Decision and Order |url=https://oalj.oha.usda.gov/sites/default/files/AWA_05-0014_012606.pdf |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |website=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |date=January 26, 2006}}</ref> In 2011, [[Carole Baskin]], founder of [[Big Cat Rescue]] sanctuary in Florida, organized protests against his use of cubs in his shows.

In the summer of 2003, John Finlay was hired as an employee of the G. W. Zoo, and within a month, had begun a relationship with Exotic. By this point, the relationship between Exotic and Hartpence had deteriorated, due to drug and alcohol addiction.

However, Schreibvogel, local volunteers, and Red Oak police were quickly overwhelmed by the task of corralling the large and fast-running birds, several of which died. Schreibvogel and another man resorted to killing emus with shotguns and were accused of animal cruelty by police. However, since the emus were considered [[livestock]], they could lawfully be killed humanely in Texas, and a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] declined to indict Schreibvogel. Most surviving birds ultimately wound up at Texas ranches.<ref name=DMN_3Apr20/>\n\nIn 2000, Schreibvogel acquired his first tigers (two abandoned tigers).<ref name=\":0\" /> To feed his growing zoo of [[big cat]]s, he took in horses that were donated to him.
