The latter were scarce out of the Gates, when they were surrounded by those of the Enemy. General Jacquemin was posted with the Regiment of Lowenstein near Buchelsdorff on the road to Steinau, General Laudohn followed with the Regiment of Palfy and 2000 Croats, supported by 14 Companies of Grenadiers; a thousand of their Hussars were upon our right flank, the advanced Guard of which consisted of 100 Men under Capt. [[von Blumenthal|Blumenthal]] of the Regiment of [[Manteuffel]]. Capt [[Zitzewitz]] commanded the Rear Guard, consisting of the same number; and the rest of the aforesaid regiment, with a Squadron of Dragoons of Bareith under Capt. Chambaud, followed with the Baggage. General Laudohn summoned out Troops twice, by Sound of Trumpet, to lay down their Arms; which they not complying with, he ordered all his Cavalry to advance: Whereupon General Jacquemin fell upon the advance Guard, while General Laudohn himself attacked the Rear, and the Hussars, in Platoons, flanked the Baggage. The Captains Blumenthal and Zittzwitz formed their small Force in a Kind of Square, from whence they kept a continual fire. The enemy's Cavalry nevertheless advanced six Times on a Gallop, to within ten Paces of our Troops; but perceiving many fall on their Side, among whom were several Officers, they retreated in great Disorder... The Loss of the Austrians however greatly exceeds ours; they buried above 300 Men, in different Places, and sent 500 Wounded to Neustadt.

During the [[Seven Years' War]] it was the scene of a bloody surprise attack upon the Prussians as they were marching out of the city. ''[[The London Gazette]]'' of 25 March 1760 reported \"General [[Ernst von Laudon|Laudohn]], who had set out from his Quarters on 14th with Palfy's Regiment of Cuirassiers, Lowenstein's Dragoons, 500 Hussars of Nadaski, 500 of Kalnocki, 2000 [[Croats]] and 14 Companies of Grenadiers, marched all Night with a View to surprise our Troops at Neustadt. The latter were scarce out of the Gates, when they were surrounded by those of the Enemy. General Jacquemin was posted with the Regiment of Lowenstein near Buchelsdorff on the road to Steinau, General Laudohn followed with the Regiment of Palfy and 2000 Croats, supported by 14 Companies of Grenadiers; a thousand of their Hussars were upon our right flank, the advanced Guard of which consisted of 100 Men under Capt. [[von Blumenthal|Blumenthal]] of the Regiment of [[Manteuffel]]. Capt [[Zitzewitz]] commanded the Rear Guard, consisting of the same number; and the rest of the aforesaid regiment, with a Squadron of Dragoons of Bareith under Capt. Chambaud, followed with the Baggage. General Laudohn summoned out Troops twice, by Sound of Trumpet, to lay down their Arms; which they not complying with, he ordered all his Cavalry to advance: Whereupon General Jacquemin fell upon the advance Guard, while General Laudohn himself attacked the Rear, and the Hussars, in Platoons, flanked the Baggage. The Captains Blumenthal and Zittzwitz formed their small Force in a Kind of Square, from whence they kept a continual fire. The enemy's Cavalry nevertheless advanced six Times on a Gallop, to within ten Paces of our Troops; but perceiving many fall on their Side, among whom were several Officers, they retreated in great Disorder... The Loss of the Austrians however greatly exceeds ours; they buried above 300 Men, in different Places, and sent 500 Wounded to Neustadt. Besides which we have taken 25 Prisoners, amongst whom are several Officers. We had 35 men killed, and four Officers and 65 private Men wounded, in Manteuffel's Regiment, as also one Lieutenant, with three Dragoons in Bareich's... The Officers, taken Prisoners, by our Troops, commend highly the Bravery of the Regiment of [[Manteuffel]] upon this Occasion.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8gqAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA222|title=The London Magazine, Or, Gentleman's Monthly Intelligencer|date=1760|publisher=R.

[[Hitler's government]] stated that [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch [[council communism|council communist]], was the culprit, and they attributed the fire to communist agitators in general\u2014though a German court decided later that year that Van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed. After the fire, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] was passed. The [[Nazi Party]] used the fire as a pretext to claim that communists were plotting against the German government, and the event is considered pivotal in the establishment of [[Nazi Germany]]. The term \"Reichstag fire\" has come to refer to [[false flag]] actions facilitated by an authority to promote their own interests through popular approval of retribution or retraction of civil rights.\n\nThe first report of the fire came shortly after 21:00, when a Berlin fire station received an alarm call.<ref name=\"tobias1964\">{{cite book|author=Tobias, Fritz|date=1964|title=The Reichstag Fire|publisher=Putnam}}</ref>{{rp|26\u201328}} By the time that police and firefighters arrived, the main [[Chamber of Deputies]] was engulfed in flames. The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and accused Van der Lubbe. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler urged President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to pass an [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] to suspend civil liberties and pursue a \"ruthless confrontation\" with the [[Communist Party of Germany]].<ref>Holborn, Haljo (1973) ''Republic to Reich: the Making of the Nazi Revolution''</ref> After passing the decree, the government instituted mass arrests of communists, including all of the Communist Party parliamentary delegates. With their bitter rival communists gone and their seats empty, the Nazi Party went from being a plurality party to the majority, thus enabling Hitler to consolidate his power.\n\nIn February 1933, Bulgarians [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Vasil Tanev]], and [[Blagoy Popov]] were arrested, and they played pivotal roles during the Leipzig Trial, known also as the \"Reichstag Fire Trial\". They were known to the Prussian police as senior [[Communist International|Comintern]] operatives, but the police had no idea how senior they were; Dimitrov was head of all Comintern operations in Western Europe. The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains a topic of debate and research.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Reichstag Fire |url= http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007657 |encyclopedia= Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate= 12 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= 75 Years Ago, Reichstag Fire Sped Hitler's Power Grab |url= http://www.dw.de/75-years-ago-reichstag-fire-sped-hitlers-power-grab/a-3150026-1 |accessdate= 12 August 2013 |newspaper= Deutsche Welle |date= 27 February 2008 |author= DW Staff}}</ref> The Nazis accused the Comintern of the act.

In 2008, Germany posthumously pardoned Van der Lubbe under a law introduced in 1998 to lift unjust verdicts dating from the Nazi era.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the [[November 1932 German federal election]], the National Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party had a plurality, not a majority; the Communists posted gains.  [[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] and head of the [[coalition government]] on 30 January 1933. As Chancellor, Hitler asked [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|German President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to dissolve the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and call for a new parliamentary [[election]]. The date set for the elections was 5 March 1933. Hitler's aim was first to acquire a National Socialist majority, to secure his position and to remove the communist opposition. If prompted or desired, the President could remove the Chancellor. Hitler hoped to abolish [[democracy]] in a more or less [[legal]] fashion, by passing the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. The Enabling Act was a special law that gave the Chancellor the power to pass laws by decree, without the involvement of the ''Reichstag''. These special powers would remain in effect for four years, after which time they were eligible to be renewed. Under the [[Weimar Constitution]], the President could rule by decree in times of emergency using [[Article 48]].<ref>{{cite book |first= Rita |last= Botwinick |title= A History of The Holocaust: From Ideology to Annihilation |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofholocau00rita |url-access= registration |location= New Jersey |publisher= Peason |year= 2004 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/historyofholocau00rita/page/90 90\u201392]}}</ref> The unprecedented element of the Enabling Act was that the Chancellor possessed the powers. An Enabling Act was only supposed to be passed in times of extreme emergency and had only been used once, in 1923\u201324 when the government used an Enabling Act to end [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]]. To pass an Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority vote in the ''Reichstag''. In January 1933, the Nazis had only 32% of the seats.{{citation needed|date = February 2019}}\n\nDuring the election campaign, the Nazis alleged that Germany was on the verge of a [[Communist revolution]] and that the only way to stop the Communists was to pass the Enabling Act. The message of the campaign was simple: increase the number of Nazi seats so that the Enabling Act could be passed. To decrease the number of [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] members of parliament who could vote against the Enabling Act, Hitler planned to ban the ''[[Communist Party of Germany|Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]]'' (the Communist Party of Germany or ''KPD''), which at the time held 17% of the seats, after the elections and before the new ''Reichstag'' convened.{{citation needed|date = February 2019}}\n\n==Fire==\nShortly after 21:00 on 27 February 1933, the Berlin Fire Department received a message that the ''Reichstag'' was on fire. Despite the best efforts of the firefighters, most of the building was gutted by the blaze. By 23:30, the fire was put out. The firefighters and police inspected the ruins and found 20 bundles of flammable material (firelighters) unburned lying about. At the time the fire was reported, Hitler was having dinner with [[Joseph Goebbels]] at Goebbels' apartment in Berlin. When Goebbels received an urgent phone call informing him of the fire, he regarded it as a \"tall tale\" at first and hung up. Only after the second call did he report the news to Hitler.<ref>{{cite book |last= Schirer |first= William L. |title= The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |publisher= Mandarin |location= London |year= 1991 |pages= 191\u2013192 |isbn= 0-7493-0697-1}}</ref> Both left Goebbels' apartment and arrived by car at the ''Reichstag'', just as the fire was being put out. They were met at the site by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Interior Minister of Prussia]], who told Hitler, \"This is Communist outrage! One of the Communist culprits has been arrested.\" Hitler called the fire a \"sign from God\" and claimed it was a ''Fanal'' (signal) meant to mark the beginning of a Communist ''[[Putsch]]'' (revolt). The next day, the ''Preussische Pressedienst'' (Prussian Press Service) reported that \"this act of incendiarism is the most monstrous act of terrorism carried out by Bolshevism in Germany\". The ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' newspaper warned its readers that \"the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still exists\".<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 286\u2013287}}.</ref>\n\n[[Walter Gempp]] was head of the Berlin fire department at the time of the [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February 1933, personally directing the operations at the incident.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkney|first=David H.|title=A Festschrift for Frederick B.

The Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including ''[[habeas corpus]]'', [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[freedom of association|right of free association]] and [[freedom of assembly|public assembly]], the [[Secrecy of correspondence|secrecy of the post and telephone]].<ref name=\"conscience33\">{{harvp|Koonz|2003|p= 33}}.</ref> These rights were not reinstated during Nazi reign. The decree was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered \"friendly\" to the Nazi cause. Despite the fact that Marinus van der Lubbe claimed to have acted alone in the Reichstag fire, Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a Communist plot to take over Germany. Nazi newspapers blared this \"news\".<ref name=\"conscience33\" /> This sent the Germans into a panic and isolated the Communists further among the civilians; additionally, thousands of Communists were imprisoned in the days following the fire (including leaders of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]) on the charge that the Party was preparing to stage a ''putsch''. Speaking to Rudolph Diels about Communists during the Reichstag fire, Hitler said \"These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses.\"<ref name=\"Gellately2001\">{{cite book |first= Robert |last= Gellately |title= Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany |url= https://archive.org/details/backinghitlercon00gell |url-access= registration |year= 2001 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-160452-2 |page= [https://archive.org/details/backinghitlercon00gell/page/18 18]}}</ref> With Communist electoral participation also suppressed (the Communists previously polled 17% of the vote), the Nazis were able to increase their share of the vote in the 5 March 1933, ''Reichstag'' elections from 33% to 44%.<ref name=\"conscience36\">{{harvp|Koonz|2003|p= 36}}.</ref> This gave the Nazis and their allies, the [[German National People's Party]] (who won 8% of the vote), a majority of 52% in the ''Reichstag''.<ref name=\"conscience36\" />\n\nWhile the Nazis emerged with a majority, they fell short of their goal, which was to win 50\u201355% of the vote that year.<ref name=\"conscience36\" /> The Nazis thought that this would make it difficult to achieve their next goal, which was to pass the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], a measure that required a two-thirds majority.<ref name=\"conscience36\" /> However, there were important factors weighing in the Nazis' favor. These were: the continued suppression of the Communist Party and the Nazis' ability to capitalize on national security concerns. Moreover, some deputies of the Social Democratic Party (the only party that would vote against the Enabling Act) were prevented from taking their seats in the ''Reichstag'', due to arrests and intimidation by the Nazi SA. As a result, the Social Democratic Party would be under-represented in the final vote tally. The Enabling Act, which gave Hitler the right to rule by decree, passed easily on 23 March 1933. It garnered the support of the right-wing German National People's Party, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and several fragmented middle-class parties. This measure went into force on 27 March and, in effect, made Hitler dictator of Germany.\n\nThe [[Kroll Opera House]], sitting across the ''K\u00f6nigsplatz'' from the burned-out Reichstag building, functioned as the Reichstag's venue for the remaining 12 years of the Third Reich's existence.\n\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1982, MiNr Block 068.jpg|thumb|Dimitrov on an [[East Germany|East German]] stamp]]\n\n==''Reichstag'' fire trial==\n{{redirect|Leipzig Trial|the post-World War I trials|Leipzig War Crimes Trials}}\n\nIn July 1933, [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], [[Ernst Torgler]], [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Blagoi Popov]], and [[Vasil Tanev]] were indicted on charges of setting the ''Reichstag'' on fire. From 21 September to 23 December 1933, the Leipzig Trial took place and was presided over by judges from the German Supreme Court, the ''[[Reichsgericht]]''. This was Germany's highest court. The presiding judge was Judge Dr. Wilhelm B\u00fcnger of the Fourth Criminal Court of the Fourth Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court.<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|p= 288}}.</ref> The accused were charged with arson and with attempting to overthrow the government.\n\n[[File:Reichstagfire1.jpg|thumb|The window through which [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] supposedly entered the building]]\nThe Leipzig Trial was widely publicized and was broadcast on the radio. It was expected that the court would find the Communists guilty on all counts and approve the repression and terror exercised by the Nazis against all opposition forces in the country. At the end of the trial, however, only Van der Lubbe was convicted, while his fellow defendants were found not guilty. In 1934, Van der Lubbe was beheaded in a German prison yard. In 1967, a court in West Berlin overturned the 1933 verdict, and posthumously changed Van der Lubbe's sentence to eight years in prison. In 1980, another court overturned the verdict, but was overruled. In 1981, a West German court posthumously overturned Van der Lubbe's 1933 conviction and found him not guilty by reason of insanity. This ruling was subsequently overturned. However, in January 2008, he was pardoned under a 1998 law for the crime on the grounds that anyone convicted under Nazi Germany is officially not guilty. The law allows pardons for people convicted of crimes under the Nazis, based on the idea that the laws of Nazi Germany \"went against the basic ideas of justice\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/secondworldwar/story/0,,2239610,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront |title= 75 years on, executed Reichstag arsonist finally wins pardon |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 12 January 2008 |accessdate= 1 May 2008 |location= London |first= Kate |last= Connolly}}</ref>\n\nThe trial began at 8:45 on the morning of 21 September, with Van der Lubbe testifying. Van der Lubbe's testimony was very hard to follow as he spoke of losing his sight in one eye and wandering around Europe as a drifter and that he had been a member of the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]], which he quit in 1931, but still considered himself a communist. Georgi Dimitrov began his testimony on the third day of the trial. He gave up his right to a court-appointed lawyer and defended himself successfully. When warned by Judge B\u00fcnger to behave himself in court, Dimitrov stated: \"Herr President, if you were a man as innocent as myself and you had passed seven months in prison, five of them in chains night and day, you would understand it if one perhaps becomes a little strained.\" During the course of his defence, Dimitrov claimed that the organizers of the fire were senior members of the Nazi Party and frequently verbally clashed with G\u00f6ring at the trial. The highpoint of the trial occurred on 4 November 1933, when G\u00f6ring took the stand and was cross-examined by Dimitrov.<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 288\u2013289}}.</ref> The following exchange took place:\n\n{{Quote|\nDimitrov: Herr Prime Minister G\u00f6ring stated on February 28 that, when arrested, the \"Dutch Communist Van der Lubbe had on his person his passport and a membership card of the Communist Party\". From whom was this information taken?\n\nG\u00f6ring: The police search all common criminals, and report the result to me.\n\nDimitrov: The three officials who arrested and examined Van der Lubbe all agreed that no membership card of the Communist Party was found on him. I should like to know where the report that such a card had been found came from.\n\nG\u00f6ring: I was told by an official. Things which were reported to me on the night of the fire...could not be tested or proven. The report was made to me by a responsible official, and was accepted as a fact, and as it could not be tested immediately it was announced as a fact. When I issued the first report to the press on the morning after the fire the interrogation of Van der Lubbe had not been concluded. In any case I do not see that anyone has any right to complain because it seems proved in this trial that Van der Lubbe had no such card on him.\n\nDimitrov: I would like to ask the Minister of the Interior what steps he took to make sure that Van der Lubbe's route to Hennigsdorf, his stay and his meetings with other people there were investigated by the police to assist them in tracking down Van der Lubbe's accomplices?\n\nG\u00f6ring: As I am not an official myself, but a responsible Minister it was not important that I should trouble myself with such petty, minor matters. It was my task to expose the Party, and the mentality, which was responsible for the crime.\n\nDimitrov: Is the Reichsminister aware of the fact that those that possess this alleged criminal mentality today control the destiny of a sixth part of the world&nbsp;\u2013 the Soviet Union?\n\nG\u00f6ring: I don't care what happens in Russia! I know that the Russians pay with bills, and I should prefer to know that their bills are paid! I care about the Communist Party here in Germany and about Communist crooks who come here to set the ''Reichstag'' on fire!\n\nDimitrov: This criminal mentality rules the Soviet Union, the greatest and best country in the world. Is Herr Prime Minister aware of that?\n\nG\u00f6ring: I shall tell you what the German people already know. They know that you are behaving in a disgraceful manner! They know that you are a Communist crook who came to Germany to set the ''Reichstag'' on fire! In my eyes you are nothing, but a scoundrel, a crook who belongs on the gallows!\".<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|p= 289}}.</ref>\n}}\n\nIn his verdict, Judge B\u00fcnger was careful to underline his belief that there had in fact been a Communist conspiracy to burn down the ''Reichstag'', but declared, with the exception of Van der Lubbe, there was insufficient evidence to connect the accused to the fire or the alleged conspiracy. Only Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. The rest were acquitted and were expelled to the Soviet Union, where they received a heroic welcome. The one exception was Torgler, who was taken into \"protective custody\" by the police until 1935. After being released, he assumed a pseudonym and moved away from Berlin.\n\nHitler was furious with the outcome of this trial. He decreed that henceforth treason\u2014among many other offenses\u2014would only be tried by a newly established [[People's Court (German)|People's Court]] (''Volksgerichtshof''). The People's Court later became associated with the number of death sentences it handed down, including those following the [[July 20 Plot|1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler]], which were presided over by then Judge-President [[Roland Freisler]].\n\n===Execution of van der Lubbe===\nAt his trial, Van der Lubbe was found guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. He was [[Decapitation|beheaded by guillotine]] (the customary form of execution in [[Saxony]] at the time; it was by axe in the rest of Germany) on 10 January 1934, three days before his 25th birthday. The Nazis alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of a Communist [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to burn down the ''Reichstag'' and seize power, while the Communists alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Nazi conspiracy to blame the crime on them.

In March 1973, the Swiss historian Walter Hofer organized a conference intended to rebut the claims made by Tobias. At the conference, Hofer claimed to have found evidence that some of the detectives who investigated the fire had been Nazis. Mommsen commented on Hofer's claims by stating, \"Professor Hofer's rather helpless statement that the accomplices of Van der Lubbe 'could only have been Nazis' is tacit admission that the committee did not actually obtain any positive evidence in regard to the alleged accomplices' identity.\" Mommsen also had a counter-study supporting Hofer, which was suppressed for political reasons, an act that he admits was a serious breach of ethics.<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 287\u2013288}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, [[Hans Gisevius]], a member of anti-Hitler resistance within the German government and former member of the [[Gestapo]], [[Abwehr]], and foreign ministry, indicated his supposition that the Nazis were the arsonists.<ref name=\"gisevius\">{{cite book |author=[[Gisevius]] HB |title=To the Bitter End |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company |location= Boston |year= 1947 |others= Translated by [[Richard and Clara Winston|Richard & Clara Winston]] |pages= 62\u201379}}</ref> Gisevius posits that [[Karl Ernst]] by order of possibly Goebbels, collected a commando of SA men headed by Hans Georg \"Heini\" Gewehr, who set the fire.

The chairman of the mock trial was [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[barrister]] [[Denis Nowell Pritt|D N Pritt]] [[King's Counsel|KC]] and the chief organiser was the KPD [[propaganda]] chief [[Willi M\u00fcnzenberg]]. The other \"judges\" were Meester [[Piet Vermeylen]] of Belgium, George Branting of Sweden, Ma\u00eetre [[Vincent de Moro-Giafferi]] and Ma\u00eetre Gaston Bergery of France, Betsy Bakker-Nort, a lawyer and member of parliament of the Netherlands for the progressive liveral partij [[Free-thinking Democratic League|Vrijzinning Democratische Bond]], Vald Hvidt of Denmark and [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] of the United States.<ref name=\"tobias1964\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe mock trial began on 21 September 1933. It lasted one week and ended with the conclusion that the defendants were innocent and the true initiators of the fire were to be found amid the leading Nazi Party elite. The counter-trial received much media attention and Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] delivered the opening speech. G\u00f6ring was found guilty at the mock counter-trial. The mock trial served as a workshop, during which all possible scenarios were tested and all speeches of the defendants were prepared. Most of the \"judges\", such as Hays and Moro-Giafferi, complained that the atmosphere at the \"Counter-trial\" was more like a [[show trial]], with M\u00fcnzenberg constantly applying pressure behind the scenes on the \"judges\", to deliver the \"right\" verdict without any regard for the truth. One of the \"witnesses\", a supposed SA man, appeared in court wearing a mask and claimed that it was the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] that really set the fire; in fact, the \"SA man\" was Albert Norden, the editor of the German Communist newspaper ''Rote Fahne''. Another masked witness whom Hays described as \"not very reliable\", claimed that Van der Lubbe was a drug-addicted homosexual, who was the lover of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] and a Nazi dupe. When the lawyer for [[Ernst Torgler]], asked the mock trial organisers to turn over the \"evidence\" exonerating his client, M\u00fcnzenberg refused the request because he lacked any \"evidence\" to exonerate or convict anyone of the crime.<ref name=\"tobias1964\"/>{{rp|122\u2013126}} The counter-trial was an enormously successful publicity stunt for the German Communists. M\u00fcnzenberg followed this triumph with another by writing under his name, the best-selling ''[[The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror]]'', an expos\u00e9 of what M\u00fcnzenberg alleged to be the Nazi conspiracy to burn down the Reichstag and blame the act on the Communists(ali A). (As with all of M\u00fcnzenberg's books, the real author was one of his aides; in this case, a [[Czechoslovak]] Communist named Otto Katz.<ref>{{cite book |last= Costello |first= John |title= Mask of Treachery |url= https://archive.org/details/maskoftreacheryt00cost_0 |url-access= registration |location= London |publisher= William Collins & Sons |year= 1988 |p= [https://archive.org/details/maskoftreacheryt00cost_0/page/296 296]}}</ref>) The success of ''The Brown Book'' was followed by another best-seller published in 1934, again ghost-written by Katz, ''The Second Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and the Hitler Terror''.\n\n''The Brown Book'' was divided into three parts. The first part, which traced the rise of the Nazis (or \"German Fascists\" as Katz called them, in conformity with [[Comintern]] practice, which forbade the use of the term Nazi), portrayed the KPD as the only genuine anti-fascist force in Germany and featured a bitter attack on the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]. Formed from dissidents within the SPD, the KPD led the communist uprisings in the early Weimar period\u2014which the SPD crushed. ''The Brown Book'' labelled the SPD \"Social Fascists\" and accused the leadership of the SPD of secretly working with the Nazis. The second section deals with the ''Reichstag'' fire, which is described as a Nazi plot to frame the Communists, who are represented as the most dedicated opponents of Nazism. The third section deals with the supposed puppet masters behind the Nazis.\n\n==As archetype of a \"false flag\" attack==\nThe term \"Reichstag fire\" is used to denote a calamitous event staged by a political movement, orchestrated in a manner that casts blame on their opponents, thus causing the opponents to be viewed with suspicion by the general public.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-reichstag-fire-and-nazis-rise-power-180962240/ |title=The True Story of the Reichstag Fire and the Nazi Rise to Power |last=Boissoneault |first=Lorraine |date=2017-02-21 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=2019-02-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is sometimes known as a [[false flag]] attack when the event itself is caused by proponents of a political movement to falsely accuse their opponents.

[[Hitler's government]] stated that [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch [[council communism|council communist]], was the culprit, and they attributed the fire to communist agitators in general\u2014though a German court decided later that year that Van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed. After the fire, the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] was passed. The [[Nazi Party]] used the fire as a pretext to claim that communists were plotting against the German government, and the event is considered pivotal in the establishment of [[Nazi Germany]]. The term \"Reichstag fire\" has come to refer to [[false flag]] actions facilitated by an authority to promote their own interests through popular approval of retribution or retraction of civil rights.\n\nThe first report of the fire came shortly after 21:00, when a Berlin fire station received an alarm call.<ref name=\"tobias1964\">{{cite book|author=Tobias, Fritz|date=1964|title=The Reichstag Fire|publisher=Putnam}}</ref>{{rp|26\u201328}} By the time that police and firefighters arrived, the main [[Chamber of Deputies]] was engulfed in flames. The police conducted a thorough search inside the building and accused Van der Lubbe. He was arrested, as were four communist leaders soon after. Hitler urged President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to pass an [[Reichstag Fire Decree|emergency decree]] to suspend civil liberties and pursue a \"ruthless confrontation\" with the [[Communist Party of Germany]].<ref>Holborn, Haljo (1973) ''Republic to Reich: the Making of the Nazi Revolution''</ref> After passing the decree, the government instituted mass arrests of communists, including all of the Communist Party parliamentary delegates. With their bitter rival communists gone and their seats empty, the Nazi Party went from being a plurality party to the majority, thus enabling Hitler to consolidate his power.\n\nIn February 1933, Bulgarians [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Vasil Tanev]], and [[Blagoy Popov]] were arrested, and they played pivotal roles during the Leipzig Trial, known also as the \"Reichstag Fire Trial\". They were known to the Prussian police as senior [[Communist International|Comintern]] operatives, but the police had no idea how senior they were; Dimitrov was head of all Comintern operations in Western Europe. The responsibility for the Reichstag fire remains a topic of debate and research.<ref>{{cite web |title= The Reichstag Fire |url= http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007657 |encyclopedia= Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate= 12 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= 75 Years Ago, Reichstag Fire Sped Hitler's Power Grab |url= http://www.dw.de/75-years-ago-reichstag-fire-sped-hitlers-power-grab/a-3150026-1 |accessdate= 12 August 2013 |newspaper= Deutsche Welle |date= 27 February 2008 |author= DW Staff}}</ref> The Nazis accused the Comintern of the act.

In 2008, Germany posthumously pardoned Van der Lubbe under a law introduced in 1998 to lift unjust verdicts dating from the Nazi era.\n\n==Prelude==\nAfter the [[November 1932 German federal election]], the National Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party had a plurality, not a majority; the Communists posted gains.  [[Adolf Hitler]] was sworn in as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] and head of the [[coalition government]] on 30 January 1933. As Chancellor, Hitler asked [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|German President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to dissolve the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and call for a new parliamentary [[election]]. The date set for the elections was 5 March 1933. Hitler's aim was first to acquire a National Socialist majority, to secure his position and to remove the communist opposition. If prompted or desired, the President could remove the Chancellor. Hitler hoped to abolish [[democracy]] in a more or less [[legal]] fashion, by passing the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. The Enabling Act was a special law that gave the Chancellor the power to pass laws by decree, without the involvement of the ''Reichstag''. These special powers would remain in effect for four years, after which time they were eligible to be renewed. Under the [[Weimar Constitution]], the President could rule by decree in times of emergency using [[Article 48]].<ref>{{cite book |first= Rita |last= Botwinick |title= A History of The Holocaust: From Ideology to Annihilation |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofholocau00rita |url-access= registration |location= New Jersey |publisher= Peason |year= 2004 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/historyofholocau00rita/page/90 90\u201392]}}</ref> The unprecedented element of the Enabling Act was that the Chancellor possessed the powers. An Enabling Act was only supposed to be passed in times of extreme emergency and had only been used once, in 1923\u201324 when the government used an Enabling Act to end [[hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]]. To pass an Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority vote in the ''Reichstag''. In January 1933, the Nazis had only 32% of the seats.{{citation needed|date = February 2019}}\n\nDuring the election campaign, the Nazis alleged that Germany was on the verge of a [[Communist revolution]] and that the only way to stop the Communists was to pass the Enabling Act. The message of the campaign was simple: increase the number of Nazi seats so that the Enabling Act could be passed. To decrease the number of [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] members of parliament who could vote against the Enabling Act, Hitler planned to ban the ''[[Communist Party of Germany|Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]]'' (the Communist Party of Germany or ''KPD''), which at the time held 17% of the seats, after the elections and before the new ''Reichstag'' convened.{{citation needed|date = February 2019}}\n\n==Fire==\nShortly after 21:00 on 27 February 1933, the Berlin Fire Department received a message that the ''Reichstag'' was on fire. Despite the best efforts of the firefighters, most of the building was gutted by the blaze. By 23:30, the fire was put out. The firefighters and police inspected the ruins and found 20 bundles of flammable material (firelighters) unburned lying about. At the time the fire was reported, Hitler was having dinner with [[Joseph Goebbels]] at Goebbels' apartment in Berlin. When Goebbels received an urgent phone call informing him of the fire, he regarded it as a \"tall tale\" at first and hung up. Only after the second call did he report the news to Hitler.<ref>{{cite book |last= Schirer |first= William L. |title= The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |publisher= Mandarin |location= London |year= 1991 |pages= 191\u2013192 |isbn= 0-7493-0697-1}}</ref> Both left Goebbels' apartment and arrived by car at the ''Reichstag'', just as the fire was being put out. They were met at the site by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Interior Minister of Prussia]], who told Hitler, \"This is Communist outrage! One of the Communist culprits has been arrested.\" Hitler called the fire a \"sign from God\" and claimed it was a ''Fanal'' (signal) meant to mark the beginning of a Communist ''[[Putsch]]'' (revolt). The next day, the ''Preussische Pressedienst'' (Prussian Press Service) reported that \"this act of incendiarism is the most monstrous act of terrorism carried out by Bolshevism in Germany\". The ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' newspaper warned its readers that \"the government is of the opinion that the situation is such that a danger to the state and nation existed and still exists\".<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 286\u2013287}}.</ref>\n\n[[Walter Gempp]] was head of the Berlin fire department at the time of the [[Reichstag fire]] on 27 February 1933, personally directing the operations at the incident.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pinkney|first=David H.|title=A Festschrift for Frederick B.

The Reichstag Fire Decree suspended most civil liberties in Germany, including ''[[habeas corpus]]'', [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[freedom of association|right of free association]] and [[freedom of assembly|public assembly]], the [[Secrecy of correspondence|secrecy of the post and telephone]].<ref name=\"conscience33\">{{harvp|Koonz|2003|p= 33}}.</ref> These rights were not reinstated during Nazi reign. The decree was used by the Nazis to ban publications not considered \"friendly\" to the Nazi cause. Despite the fact that Marinus van der Lubbe claimed to have acted alone in the Reichstag fire, Hitler, after having obtained his emergency powers, announced that it was the start of a Communist plot to take over Germany. Nazi newspapers blared this \"news\".<ref name=\"conscience33\" /> This sent the Germans into a panic and isolated the Communists further among the civilians; additionally, thousands of Communists were imprisoned in the days following the fire (including leaders of the [[Communist Party of Germany]]) on the charge that the Party was preparing to stage a ''putsch''. Speaking to Rudolph Diels about Communists during the Reichstag fire, Hitler said \"These sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses.\"<ref name=\"Gellately2001\">{{cite book |first= Robert |last= Gellately |title= Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany |url= https://archive.org/details/backinghitlercon00gell |url-access= registration |year= 2001 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-160452-2 |page= [https://archive.org/details/backinghitlercon00gell/page/18 18]}}</ref> With Communist electoral participation also suppressed (the Communists previously polled 17% of the vote), the Nazis were able to increase their share of the vote in the 5 March 1933, ''Reichstag'' elections from 33% to 44%.<ref name=\"conscience36\">{{harvp|Koonz|2003|p= 36}}.</ref> This gave the Nazis and their allies, the [[German National People's Party]] (who won 8% of the vote), a majority of 52% in the ''Reichstag''.<ref name=\"conscience36\" />\n\nWhile the Nazis emerged with a majority, they fell short of their goal, which was to win 50\u201355% of the vote that year.<ref name=\"conscience36\" /> The Nazis thought that this would make it difficult to achieve their next goal, which was to pass the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], a measure that required a two-thirds majority.<ref name=\"conscience36\" /> However, there were important factors weighing in the Nazis' favor. These were: the continued suppression of the Communist Party and the Nazis' ability to capitalize on national security concerns. Moreover, some deputies of the Social Democratic Party (the only party that would vote against the Enabling Act) were prevented from taking their seats in the ''Reichstag'', due to arrests and intimidation by the Nazi SA. As a result, the Social Democratic Party would be under-represented in the final vote tally. The Enabling Act, which gave Hitler the right to rule by decree, passed easily on 23 March 1933. It garnered the support of the right-wing German National People's Party, the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and several fragmented middle-class parties. This measure went into force on 27 March and, in effect, made Hitler dictator of Germany.\n\nThe [[Kroll Opera House]], sitting across the ''K\u00f6nigsplatz'' from the burned-out Reichstag building, functioned as the Reichstag's venue for the remaining 12 years of the Third Reich's existence.\n\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1982, MiNr Block 068.jpg|thumb|Dimitrov on an [[East Germany|East German]] stamp]]\n\n==''Reichstag'' fire trial==\n{{redirect|Leipzig Trial|the post-World War I trials|Leipzig War Crimes Trials}}\n\nIn July 1933, [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], [[Ernst Torgler]], [[Georgi Dimitrov]], [[Blagoi Popov]], and [[Vasil Tanev]] were indicted on charges of setting the ''Reichstag'' on fire. From 21 September to 23 December 1933, the Leipzig Trial took place and was presided over by judges from the German Supreme Court, the ''[[Reichsgericht]]''. This was Germany's highest court. The presiding judge was Judge Dr. Wilhelm B\u00fcnger of the Fourth Criminal Court of the Fourth Penal Chamber of the Supreme Court.<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|p= 288}}.</ref> The accused were charged with arson and with attempting to overthrow the government.\n\n[[File:Reichstagfire1.jpg|thumb|The window through which [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] supposedly entered the building]]\nThe Leipzig Trial was widely publicized and was broadcast on the radio. It was expected that the court would find the Communists guilty on all counts and approve the repression and terror exercised by the Nazis against all opposition forces in the country. At the end of the trial, however, only Van der Lubbe was convicted, while his fellow defendants were found not guilty. In 1934, Van der Lubbe was beheaded in a German prison yard. In 1967, a court in West Berlin overturned the 1933 verdict, and posthumously changed Van der Lubbe's sentence to eight years in prison. In 1980, another court overturned the verdict, but was overruled. In 1981, a West German court posthumously overturned Van der Lubbe's 1933 conviction and found him not guilty by reason of insanity. This ruling was subsequently overturned. However, in January 2008, he was pardoned under a 1998 law for the crime on the grounds that anyone convicted under Nazi Germany is officially not guilty. The law allows pardons for people convicted of crimes under the Nazis, based on the idea that the laws of Nazi Germany \"went against the basic ideas of justice\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/secondworldwar/story/0,,2239610,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=networkfront |title= 75 years on, executed Reichstag arsonist finally wins pardon |work= [[The Guardian]] |date= 12 January 2008 |accessdate= 1 May 2008 |location= London |first= Kate |last= Connolly}}</ref>\n\nThe trial began at 8:45 on the morning of 21 September, with Van der Lubbe testifying. Van der Lubbe's testimony was very hard to follow as he spoke of losing his sight in one eye and wandering around Europe as a drifter and that he had been a member of the [[Communist Party of the Netherlands|Dutch Communist Party]], which he quit in 1931, but still considered himself a communist. Georgi Dimitrov began his testimony on the third day of the trial. He gave up his right to a court-appointed lawyer and defended himself successfully. When warned by Judge B\u00fcnger to behave himself in court, Dimitrov stated: \"Herr President, if you were a man as innocent as myself and you had passed seven months in prison, five of them in chains night and day, you would understand it if one perhaps becomes a little strained.\" During the course of his defence, Dimitrov claimed that the organizers of the fire were senior members of the Nazi Party and frequently verbally clashed with G\u00f6ring at the trial. The highpoint of the trial occurred on 4 November 1933, when G\u00f6ring took the stand and was cross-examined by Dimitrov.<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 288\u2013289}}.</ref> The following exchange took place:\n\n{{Quote|\nDimitrov: Herr Prime Minister G\u00f6ring stated on February 28 that, when arrested, the \"Dutch Communist Van der Lubbe had on his person his passport and a membership card of the Communist Party\". From whom was this information taken?\n\nG\u00f6ring: The police search all common criminals, and report the result to me.\n\nDimitrov: The three officials who arrested and examined Van der Lubbe all agreed that no membership card of the Communist Party was found on him. I should like to know where the report that such a card had been found came from.\n\nG\u00f6ring: I was told by an official. Things which were reported to me on the night of the fire...could not be tested or proven. The report was made to me by a responsible official, and was accepted as a fact, and as it could not be tested immediately it was announced as a fact. When I issued the first report to the press on the morning after the fire the interrogation of Van der Lubbe had not been concluded. In any case I do not see that anyone has any right to complain because it seems proved in this trial that Van der Lubbe had no such card on him.\n\nDimitrov: I would like to ask the Minister of the Interior what steps he took to make sure that Van der Lubbe's route to Hennigsdorf, his stay and his meetings with other people there were investigated by the police to assist them in tracking down Van der Lubbe's accomplices?\n\nG\u00f6ring: As I am not an official myself, but a responsible Minister it was not important that I should trouble myself with such petty, minor matters. It was my task to expose the Party, and the mentality, which was responsible for the crime.\n\nDimitrov: Is the Reichsminister aware of the fact that those that possess this alleged criminal mentality today control the destiny of a sixth part of the world&nbsp;\u2013 the Soviet Union?\n\nG\u00f6ring: I don't care what happens in Russia! I know that the Russians pay with bills, and I should prefer to know that their bills are paid! I care about the Communist Party here in Germany and about Communist crooks who come here to set the ''Reichstag'' on fire!\n\nDimitrov: This criminal mentality rules the Soviet Union, the greatest and best country in the world. Is Herr Prime Minister aware of that?\n\nG\u00f6ring: I shall tell you what the German people already know. They know that you are behaving in a disgraceful manner! They know that you are a Communist crook who came to Germany to set the ''Reichstag'' on fire! In my eyes you are nothing, but a scoundrel, a crook who belongs on the gallows!\".<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|p= 289}}.</ref>\n}}\n\nIn his verdict, Judge B\u00fcnger was careful to underline his belief that there had in fact been a Communist conspiracy to burn down the ''Reichstag'', but declared, with the exception of Van der Lubbe, there was insufficient evidence to connect the accused to the fire or the alleged conspiracy. Only Van der Lubbe was found guilty and sentenced to death. The rest were acquitted and were expelled to the Soviet Union, where they received a heroic welcome. The one exception was Torgler, who was taken into \"protective custody\" by the police until 1935. After being released, he assumed a pseudonym and moved away from Berlin.\n\nHitler was furious with the outcome of this trial. He decreed that henceforth treason\u2014among many other offenses\u2014would only be tried by a newly established [[People's Court (German)|People's Court]] (''Volksgerichtshof''). The People's Court later became associated with the number of death sentences it handed down, including those following the [[July 20 Plot|1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler]], which were presided over by then Judge-President [[Roland Freisler]].\n\n===Execution of van der Lubbe===\nAt his trial, Van der Lubbe was found guilty and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. He was [[Decapitation|beheaded by guillotine]] (the customary form of execution in [[Saxony]] at the time; it was by axe in the rest of Germany) on 10 January 1934, three days before his 25th birthday. The Nazis alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of a Communist [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to burn down the ''Reichstag'' and seize power, while the Communists alleged that Van der Lubbe was part of the Nazi conspiracy to blame the crime on them. Van der Lubbe, for his part, maintained that he acted alone to protest the condition of the German working class.<ref>biography by Martin Schouten \"Rinus van der Lubbe 1909-1934\" (1989)</ref>\n\n==Dispute about Van der Lubbe's role in the ''Reichstag'' fire==\n[[File:Gedenkteken Marinus van der Lubbe.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial at the [[S\u00fcdfriedhof (Leipzig)|S\u00fcdfriedhof]] in [[Leipzig]]]]\nAccording to [[Ian Kershaw]], in ''Hitler 1889\u20131936: Hubris'', written in 1998, the consensus of nearly all historians at the time of writing was that Van der Lubbe did set the ''Reichstag'' on fire, and that it was generally believed that he acted alone and that the ''Reichstag'' fire was merely a stroke of good luck for the Nazis.<ref>{{harvp|Kershaw|1998|pp=456\u2013458, 731\u2013732}}.</ref>\n\nIt is alleged that the idea Van der Lubbe was a \"half-wit\" or \"mentally disturbed\" was [[propaganda]] spread by the Dutch Communist Party, to distance themselves from an insurrectionist [[anti-fascist]], who was once a member of the party and took action where they failed to do so.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.left-dis.nl/uk/marinus.htm |title= Dutch Council Communism and Van der Lubbe}}</ref> [[John Gunther]], who covered the trial, described him as \"an obvious victim of manic-depressive psychosis\", and said that the Nazis would not have chosen \"an agent so inept and witless\".

Tobias established that Van der Lubbe attempted to burn down several buildings in the days prior to 27 February. In March 1973, the Swiss historian Walter Hofer organized a conference intended to rebut the claims made by Tobias. At the conference, Hofer claimed to have found evidence that some of the detectives who investigated the fire had been Nazis. Mommsen commented on Hofer's claims by stating, \"Professor Hofer's rather helpless statement that the accomplices of Van der Lubbe 'could only have been Nazis' is tacit admission that the committee did not actually obtain any positive evidence in regard to the alleged accomplices' identity.\" Mommsen also had a counter-study supporting Hofer, which was suppressed for political reasons, an act that he admits was a serious breach of ethics.<ref>{{harvp|Snyder|1976|pp= 287\u2013288}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, [[Hans Gisevius]], a member of anti-Hitler resistance within the German government and former member of the [[Gestapo]], [[Abwehr]], and foreign ministry, indicated his supposition that the Nazis were the arsonists.<ref name=\"gisevius\">{{cite book |author=[[Gisevius]] HB |title=To the Bitter End |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company |location= Boston |year= 1947 |others= Translated by [[Richard and Clara Winston|Richard & Clara Winston]] |pages= 62\u201379}}</ref> Gisevius posits that [[Karl Ernst]] by order of possibly Goebbels, collected a commando of SA men headed by Hans Georg \"Heini\" Gewehr, who set the fire.

Later, nearly all of those with knowledge of the Reichstag fire were executed; Lennings said he had been warned and escaped to [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nLennings had asked that his account be certified in 1955, in the event the Reichstag fire case ever returned to trial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.haz.de/Nachrichten/Politik/Deutschland-Welt/Dokument-in-Hannover-belegt-SA-Mann-will-beim-Reichstagsbrand-1933-geholfen-haben |title=Dokument in Hannover belegt: SA-Mann will beim Reichstagsbrand 1933 geholfen haben |publisher=Haz.de |date=2019-07-26 |accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fr.de/politik/sa-mann-will-reichstagsbrand-beteiligt-gewesen-sein-12861189.html |title=Dokument Aufgetaucht \u2013 SA-Mann will an Reichstagsbrand beteiligt gewesen sein |language=de|publisher=Frankfurter Rundschau |date=2019-07-26 |accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Conrad von Meding |url=https://www.deutschlandfunkkultur.de/neues-zum-reichstagsbrand-die-legende-vom-einzeltaeter.1008.de.html?dram:article_id=454909 |title=Neues zum Reichstagsbrand \u2013 Die \"Legende\" vom Einzelt\u00e4ter wackelt erheblich |publisher=Deutschlandfunkkultur.de |date=2019-07-26 |accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/article197532259/Reichstagsbrand-Was-die-neue-Erklaerung-eines-SA-Manns-bedeutet.html |title=Was die neue Eidesstattliche Erkl\u00e4rung eines SA-Manns bedeutet |publisher=Welt.de |date=2019-07-26 |accessdate=2019-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/haben-doch-die-nazis-den-reichstag-abgefackelt-16305771.html |title=Neue Indizien Aufgetaucht: Haben die Nazis den Reichstag abgefackelt?

The chairman of the mock trial was [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[barrister]] [[Denis Nowell Pritt|D N Pritt]] [[King's Counsel|KC]] and the chief organiser was the KPD [[propaganda]] chief [[Willi M\u00fcnzenberg]]. The other \"judges\" were Meester [[Piet Vermeylen]] of Belgium, George Branting of Sweden, Ma\u00eetre [[Vincent de Moro-Giafferi]] and Ma\u00eetre Gaston Bergery of France, Betsy Bakker-Nort, a lawyer and member of parliament of the Netherlands for the progressive liveral partij [[Free-thinking Democratic League|Vrijzinning Democratische Bond]], Vald Hvidt of Denmark and [[Arthur Garfield Hays]] of the United States.<ref name=\"tobias1964\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nThe mock trial began on 21 September 1933. It lasted one week and ended with the conclusion that the defendants were innocent and the true initiators of the fire were to be found amid the leading Nazi Party elite. The counter-trial received much media attention and Sir [[Stafford Cripps]] delivered the opening speech. G\u00f6ring was found guilty at the mock counter-trial. The mock trial served as a workshop, during which all possible scenarios were tested and all speeches of the defendants were prepared. Most of the \"judges\", such as Hays and Moro-Giafferi, complained that the atmosphere at the \"Counter-trial\" was more like a [[show trial]], with M\u00fcnzenberg constantly applying pressure behind the scenes on the \"judges\", to deliver the \"right\" verdict without any regard for the truth. One of the \"witnesses\", a supposed SA man, appeared in court wearing a mask and claimed that it was the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] that really set the fire; in fact, the \"SA man\" was Albert Norden, the editor of the German Communist newspaper ''Rote Fahne''. Another masked witness whom Hays described as \"not very reliable\", claimed that Van der Lubbe was a drug-addicted homosexual, who was the lover of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] and a Nazi dupe. When the lawyer for [[Ernst Torgler]], asked the mock trial organisers to turn over the \"evidence\" exonerating his client, M\u00fcnzenberg refused the request because he lacked any \"evidence\" to exonerate or convict anyone of the crime.<ref name=\"tobias1964\"/>{{rp|122\u2013126}} The counter-trial was an enormously successful publicity stunt for the German Communists. M\u00fcnzenberg followed this triumph with another by writing under his name, the best-selling ''[[The Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and Hitler Terror]]'', an expos\u00e9 of what M\u00fcnzenberg alleged to be the Nazi conspiracy to burn down the Reichstag and blame the act on the Communists(ali A). (As with all of M\u00fcnzenberg's books, the real author was one of his aides; in this case, a [[Czechoslovak]] Communist named Otto Katz.<ref>{{cite book |last= Costello |first= John |title= Mask of Treachery |url= https://archive.org/details/maskoftreacheryt00cost_0 |url-access= registration |location= London |publisher= William Collins & Sons |year= 1988 |p= [https://archive.org/details/maskoftreacheryt00cost_0/page/296 296]}}</ref>) The success of ''The Brown Book'' was followed by another best-seller published in 1934, again ghost-written by Katz, ''The Second Brown Book of the Reichstag Fire and the Hitler Terror''.\n\n''The Brown Book'' was divided into three parts. The first part, which traced the rise of the Nazis (or \"German Fascists\" as Katz called them, in conformity with [[Comintern]] practice, which forbade the use of the term Nazi), portrayed the KPD as the only genuine anti-fascist force in Germany and featured a bitter attack on the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]. Formed from dissidents within the SPD, the KPD led the communist uprisings in the early Weimar period\u2014which the SPD crushed. ''The Brown Book'' labelled the SPD \"Social Fascists\" and accused the leadership of the SPD of secretly working with the Nazis. The second section deals with the ''Reichstag'' fire, which is described as a Nazi plot to frame the Communists, who are represented as the most dedicated opponents of Nazism. The third section deals with the supposed puppet masters behind the Nazis.\n\n==As archetype of a \"false flag\" attack==\nThe term \"Reichstag fire\" is used to denote a calamitous event staged by a political movement, orchestrated in a manner that casts blame on their opponents, thus causing the opponents to be viewed with suspicion by the general public.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-reichstag-fire-and-nazis-rise-power-180962240/ |title=The True Story of the Reichstag Fire and the Nazi Rise to Power |last=Boissoneault |first=Lorraine |date=2017-02-21 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |access-date=2019-02-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is sometimes known as a [[false flag]] attack when the event itself is caused by proponents of a political movement to falsely accuse their opponents.

Thus [[Baldwin V, Count of Flanders]], invited Jacob ben Yekutiel and his fellow Jews to settle in his lands; and soon after the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] likewise extended a welcome to continental Jews to take up residence there. Bishop [[History of the Jews in Speyer|R\u00fcdiger Huzmann]] called on the Jews of [[Mainz]] to relocate to [[Speyer]].

It may correspond to a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that may have existed in the Greek dialect of the Jews in [[Syria Palaestina]], or the text is corrupted from \"Germanica\". This view of Berechiah is based on the Talmud (Yoma 10a; Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 71b), where Gomer, the father of Ashkenaz, is translated by ''Germamia'', which evidently stands for Germany, and which was suggested by the similarity of the sound.\n\nIn later times, the word Ashkenaz is used to designate southern and western Germany, the ritual of which sections differs somewhat from that of eastern Germany and Poland.

Laws were passed to integrate Jews into their host countries, forcing Ashkenazi Jews to adopt family names (they had formerly used [[patronymics]]).

These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews. The role of religious parties, including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel's composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the [[Knesset]], a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature with 120 seats.<ref>{{cite web |title=Field Listing - Legislative Branch |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2101.html|work=[[World Fact Book]] |publisher=CIA |accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAshkenazi Jews have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics<ref>{{As of|2013}}, every [[President of Israel]] since the country's foundation in 1948 has been an Ashkenazi Jew</ref> of Israel since its founding.

Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, \"Ashkenazic\" refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. [[Reform Judaism]], which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html \"The Origins of Reform Judaism.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follows Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at [[Baghdad]] and in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a ''[[minhag]]'' of its own. Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebpronunciation.html \"Pronunciations of Hebrew.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is [[Sephardic]], since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or [[Mizrahi]] woman who marries into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a [[Sephardi]] or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] generally follows the practice of the [[beth din]] that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lieberman |first=Asaf |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-ashkenazi.premium-1.494628 |title=The unbearable lightness of being Ashkenazi. |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=18 January 2013 |access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nNew developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.

From the [[Rhineland]] to [[Riga]] to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, ''Yiddishkeit'' now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and [[Hasidism]], but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, ''Yiddishkeit'' can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\n\nAs Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of [[aliyah]] to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas such as [[South Africa]]; and Europe (particularly France) and [[Latin America]], the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has replaced Yiddish as the primary [[Jewish language]] for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many [[Hasidic]] and [[Hareidi]] groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. (There are numerous Ashkenazi Jewish anglophones and Russian-speakers as well, although English and Russian are not originally Jewish languages.)\n\nFrance's blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the [[Middle Ages]], by the time of the [[French Revolution]], there were two distinct Jewish populations. One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the [[Inquisition]] and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German [[Alsace]], and mainly speaking a German dialect similar to Yiddish. (A third community of Proven\u00e7al Jews living in [[Comtat Venaissin]] were technically outside France, and were later absorbed into the Sephardim.) The two communities were so separate and different that the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] emancipated them separately in 1790 and 1791.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06791.html \"French Revolution.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 2008. 29 May 2014.</ref>\n\nBut after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from [[antisemitism]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]], and the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, [[Paris]] had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in diverse political movements. After the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] years and the [[Holocaust]], the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by Ashkenazi refugees from Central Europe, and later by Sephardi immigrants and refugees from [[North Africa]], many of them [[francophone]].\n\nAshkenazi Jews did not record their traditions or achievements by text, instead these traditions were passed down orally from one generation to the next.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Frigyesi|first=Judit|date=September 2014|title=Scholarship on East European Jewish Music after the Holocaust|url=|journal=Hungarian Quarterly|volume=54|pages=150\u2013163|issn=1217-2545|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> The desire to maintain pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] traditions relating to Ashkenazi culture has often been met with criticism by Jews in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=\":02\" /> Reasoning for this could be related to the development of a new style of Jewish arts and culture developed by the [[Jews of Palestine]] during the 1930s and 1940s, which in conjunction with the decimation of European Ashkenazi Jews and their culture by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime made it easier to assimilate to the new style of ritual rather than try to repair the older traditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schleifer|first=Eliyahu|date=1995|title=Current Trends of Liturgical Music in the Ashkenazi Synagogue|journal=The World of Music|volume=37|issue=1|pages=59\u201372|issn=0043-8774|jstor=43562849}}</ref> This new style of tradition was referred to as the ''Mediterranean Style'', and was noted for its simplicity and metaphorical rejuvenation of Jews abroad.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was intended to replace the [[Galut]] traditions, which were more sorrowful in practice.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThen, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.<ref>Wall, Irwin.

University of California Press, pp. 164\u201390.</ref>\n\n===By ethnicity===\nIn an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews who settled in Central Europe. For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers ([[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]s) and for matrilineal markers ([[mitochondrion|mitotypes]]).<ref name=WadeNYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html |title=New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152054/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html| archivedate=10 December 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/science/y-chromosome-bears-witness-to-story-of-the-jewish-diaspora.html |title=Y Chromosome Bears Witness to Story of the Jewish Diaspora |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 May 2000 |first=Nicholas |last=Wade}}</ref>\n\nA 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort&nbsp;\u2013 that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. These Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.<ref name=\"pmid17044734\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Seldin MF, Shigeta R, Villoslada P |title=European population substructure: clustering of northern and southern populations |journal=PLOS Genet. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e143 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17044734 |pmc=1564423 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |display-authors=etal }}</ref>\n\n==Customs, laws and traditions==\nThe ''[[Halakha|Halakhic]]'' practices of ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of [[Sephardi Jews]], particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' itself, in the gloss of [[Moses Isserles]]. Well known differences in practice include:\n\n[[File:Prager Beerdigungsbruderschaft.jpg|thumb|The example of the ''[[chevra kadisha]]'', the Jewish burial society, Prague, 1772]]\n* Observance of ''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating [[legumes]], grain, [[millet]], and [[rice]] ([[quinoa]], however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.\n* Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.\n* Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] as a hair covering for married and widowed women.\n* In the case of ''[[kashrut]]'' for meat, conversely, Sephardi Jews have stricter requirements&nbsp;\u2013 this level is commonly referred to as ''[[Beth Yoseph|Beth Yosef]]''. Meat products that are acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews as kosher may therefore be rejected by Sephardi Jews. Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper [[Halakha|Halakhic]] removal of the [[sciatic nerve]], while many Ashkenazi Jews do not. This is not because of different interpretations of the law; rather, slaughterhouses could not find adequate skills for correct removal of the sciatic nerve and found it more economical to separate the hindquarters and sell them as non-kosher meat.\n* Ashkenazi Jews often name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as [[Chuts]].\n* Ashkenazi [[tefillin]] bear some differences from Sephardic tefillin. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don tefillin while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.\n* Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter [[Taw (letter)|tav]] in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /\u03b8/ sound. {{further|Ashkenazi Hebrew}}\n* The prayer shawl, or [[tallit]] (or tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew), is worn by the majority of Ashkenazi men after marriage, but western European Ashkenazi men wear it from Bar Mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/things/tallit.htm |title=''Tallit: Jewish Prayer Shawl'' |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===Ashkenazic liturgy===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|ethnicities}}\nThe term ''Ashkenazi'' also refers to the ''[[nusach Ashkenaz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \"liturgical tradition\", or rite) used by Ashkenazi [[Jew]]s in their ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, the order of prayers, the text of prayers, and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are [[Nusach Sefard]] (not to be confused with [[Sephardic law and customs|the Sephardic ritual]]), which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach, and [[Nusach Ari]], as used by Lubavitch Hasidim.\n\n===Ashkenazi as a surname===\nSeveral famous people have [[Ashkenazi (surname)|Ashkenazi as a surname]], such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. However, most people with this surname hail from within Sephardic communities, particularly from the [[Syrian Jew]]ish community. The Sephardic carriers of the surname would have some Ashkenazi ancestors since the surname was adopted by families who were initially of Ashkenazic origins who moved to Sephardi countries and joined those communities. Ashkenazi would be formally adopted as the family surname having started off as a nickname imposed by their adopted communities. Some have shortened the name to Ash.\n\n== Relations with Sephardim ==\n{{Further|Racism in Israel#Intra-Jewish racism: Racism between Jews}}\nRelations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have at times been tense and clouded by arrogance, snobbery and claims of racial superiority with both sides claiming the inferiority of the other, based upon such features as physical traits and culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John M.

Currently, there are three types of genetic origin testing, autosomal DNA (atDNA), [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), and Y-chromosomal DNA ([[Y-DNA]]). Autosomal DNA is a mixture from an individual's entire ancestry, Y-DNA shows a male's lineage only along his strict paternal line, mtDNA shows any person's lineage only along the strict maternal line. [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] have also been employed to yield findings relevant to genetic origins.\n\nLike most DNA studies of human migration patterns, the earliest studies on Ashkenazi Jews focused on the Y-DNA and mtDNA segments of the human genome.

However, it is possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim drove their heterozygosity up, while the maintenance of the [[Cousin marriage in the Middle East|FBD rule]] in native Middle Easterners has been keeping their heterozygosity values in check. Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to \"mine\" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/2012/07/how-to-interpret-patterns-of-genetic-variation-admixture-divergence-inbreeding/ |title=How to Interpret Patterns of Genetic Variation?

The authors found the greatest affinity and shared ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews to be firstly with other Jewish groups from southern Europe, Syria, and North Africa, and secondly with both southern Europeans (such as Italians) and modern Levantines (such as the [[Druze]], Cypriots, Lebanese and [[Samaritans]]). In addition to finding no affinity in Ashkenazim with northern Caucasus populations, the authors found no more affinity in Ashkenazi Jews to modern south Caucasus and eastern Anatolian populations (such as [[Armenians]], [[Azeris]], [[Georgians]], and Turks) than found in non-Ashkenazi Jews or non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as the [[Kurds]], Iranians, Druze and Lebanese).<ref name = \"WayneState2013\">{{cite journal|last1 = Behar |first1 = Doron M. |last2 = Metspalu |first2 = Mait |last3 = Baran |first3 = Yael |last4 = Kopelman |first4 = Naama M. |last5 = Yunusbayev |first5 = Bayazit |last6 = Gladstein |first6 = Ariella |last7 = Tzur |first7 = Shay |last8 = Sahakyan |first8 = Havhannes |last9 = Bahmanimehr |first9 = Ardeshir |last10 = Yepiskoposyan |first10 = Levon |last11 = Tambets |first11 = Kristiina |last12 = Khusnutdinova |first12 = Elza K. |last13 = Kusniarevich |first13 = Aljona |last14 = Balanovsky |first14 = Oleg |first15 = Elena |last15 = Balanovsky |first16 = Lejla |last16 = Kovacevic |first17 = Damir |last17 = Marjanovic |first18 = Evelin |last18 = Mihailov |first19 = Anastasia |last19 = Kouvatsi |first20 = Costas |last20 = Traintaphyllidis |first21 = Roy J. |last21 = King |first22 = Ornella |last22 = Semino |first23 = Antonio |last23 = Torroni |first24 = Michael F. |last24 = Hammer |first25 = Ene |last25 = Metspalu |first26 = Karl |last26 = Skorecki |first27 = Saharon |last27 = Rosset |first28 = Eran |last28 = Halperin |first29 = Richard |last29 = Villems |first30 = Noah A. |last30 = Rosenberg|year = 2013 |title = No Evidence from Genome-Wide Data of a Khazar Origin for the Ashkenazi Jews|url = http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol_preprints/41/ |journal = Human Biology Open Access Pre-Prints |publisher = [[Wayne State University]] |issue = 41 |accessdate = 14 October 2014 |quote = Final version at http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol85/iss6/9/}}</ref>\n\nA 2017 autosomal study by Xue, Shai Carmi et al. found an approximately even mixture of Middle-Eastern (Levantine) and European ancestry in Ashkenazi Jews: with the European component being largely Southern European with a minority being Eastern European, and the Middle Eastern ancestry showing the strongest affinity to Levantine populations such as the Druze and Lebanese.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Xue J, Lencz T, Darvasi A, Pe'er I, Carmi S | title = The time and place of European admixture in Ashkenazi Jewish history | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = e1006644 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28376121 | pmc = 5380316 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006644 }}</ref>\n\n===The Khazar hypothesis===\n{{Main|Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry}}\nIn the late 19th century, it was proposed that the core of today's Ashkenazi Jewry are genetically descended from a [[Khazar hypothesis of Ashkenazi ancestry|hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora]] who had migrated westward from modern Russia and Ukraine into modern France and Germany (as opposed to the currently held theory that Jews migrated from France and Germany into Eastern Europe).

The authors found no affinity in Ashkenazim with north Caucasus populations, as well as no greater affinity in Ashkenazim to south Caucasus or Anatolian populations than that found in non-Ashkenazi Jews and non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as the Kurds, Iranians, Druze and Lebanese).

Indeed, much awareness of \"Ashkenazi Jews\" as an ethnic group or category stems from the large number of genetic studies of disease, including many that are well reported in the media, that have been conducted among Jews. Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons:\n* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], yet they are sizable.<ref name=JewsasSubjects>{{cite journal|author=Carmeli, Daphna Birenbaum|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2004|title=Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: Figures, explanation, and potential implications |volume=130A|issue=1|pages=76\u201383|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20291|pmid=15368499}}</ref>\n* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.<ref name=JewsasSubjects/>\n\nThe result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]].

Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the [[Iberian Peninsula]], have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews.<ref name=\"meyers\">{{cite news |url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/22872/are-israel-s-marriage-laws-archaic-and-irrelevant/|title=Are Israel's Marriage Laws 'Archaic and Irrelevant'?|last=Meyers|first=Nechemia|date=12 July 1997|publisher=Jewish News Weekly|accessdate=17 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nReligious Ashkenazi Jews living in Israel are obliged to follow the authority of the chief Ashkenazi rabbi in [[halakha|halakhic]] matters.

These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews. The role of religious parties, including small religious parties that play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel's composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the [[Knesset]], a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature with 120 seats.<ref>{{cite web |title=Field Listing - Legislative Branch |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2101.html|work=[[World Fact Book]] |publisher=CIA |accessdate=8 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAshkenazi Jews have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics<ref>{{As of|2013}}, every [[President of Israel]] since the country's foundation in 1948 has been an Ashkenazi Jew</ref> of Israel since its founding.

Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations. On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past. In this sense, \"Ashkenazic\" refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry. [[Reform Judaism]], which does not necessarily follow those minhagim, did nonetheless originate among Ashkenazi Jews.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/The_Origins_of_Reform_Judaism.html \"The Origins of Reform Judaism.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follows Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at [[Baghdad]] and in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]]. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a ''[[minhag]]'' of its own. Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/hebpronunciation.html \"Pronunciations of Hebrew.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 27 May 2014.</ref>\n\nIn this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is [[Sephardic]], since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or [[Mizrahi]] woman who marries into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a [[Sephardi]] or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] generally follows the practice of the [[beth din]] that converted him or her. With the integration of Jews from around the world in Israel, North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside [[Orthodox Judaism]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lieberman |first=Asaf |url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being-ashkenazi.premium-1.494628 |title=The unbearable lightness of being Ashkenazi. |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=18 January 2013 |access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nNew developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.

From the [[Rhineland]] to [[Riga]] to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, ''Yiddishkeit'' now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and [[Hasidism]], but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, ''Yiddishkeit'' can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\n\nAs Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Europe, mostly in the form of [[aliyah]] to Israel, or immigration to North America, and other English-speaking areas such as [[South Africa]]; and Europe (particularly France) and [[Latin America]], the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has replaced Yiddish as the primary [[Jewish language]] for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many [[Hasidic]] and [[Hareidi]] groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. (There are numerous Ashkenazi Jewish anglophones and Russian-speakers as well, although English and Russian are not originally Jewish languages.)\n\nFrance's blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the [[Middle Ages]], by the time of the [[French Revolution]], there were two distinct Jewish populations. One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the [[Inquisition]] and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German [[Alsace]], and mainly speaking a German dialect similar to Yiddish. (A third community of Proven\u00e7al Jews living in [[Comtat Venaissin]] were technically outside France, and were later absorbed into the Sephardim.) The two communities were so separate and different that the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] emancipated them separately in 1790 and 1791.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06791.html \"French Revolution.\"] ''Jewish Virtual Library''. 2008. 29 May 2014.</ref>\n\nBut after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from [[antisemitism]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]], and the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, [[Paris]] had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in diverse political movements. After the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] years and the [[Holocaust]], the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by Ashkenazi refugees from Central Europe, and later by Sephardi immigrants and refugees from [[North Africa]], many of them [[francophone]].\n\nAshkenazi Jews did not record their traditions or achievements by text, instead these traditions were passed down orally from one generation to the next.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Frigyesi|first=Judit|date=September 2014|title=Scholarship on East European Jewish Music after the Holocaust|url=|journal=Hungarian Quarterly|volume=54|pages=150\u2013163|issn=1217-2545|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> The desire to maintain pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] traditions relating to Ashkenazi culture has often been met with criticism by Jews in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name=\":02\" /> Reasoning for this could be related to the development of a new style of Jewish arts and culture developed by the [[Jews of Palestine]] during the 1930s and 1940s, which in conjunction with the decimation of European Ashkenazi Jews and their culture by the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime made it easier to assimilate to the new style of ritual rather than try to repair the older traditions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schleifer|first=Eliyahu|date=1995|title=Current Trends of Liturgical Music in the Ashkenazi Synagogue|journal=The World of Music|volume=37|issue=1|pages=59\u201372|issn=0043-8774|jstor=43562849}}</ref> This new style of tradition was referred to as the ''Mediterranean Style'', and was noted for its simplicity and metaphorical rejuvenation of Jews abroad.<ref name=\":1\" /> This was intended to replace the [[Galut]] traditions, which were more sorrowful in practice.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThen, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and Central Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.<ref>Wall, Irwin.

For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have argued that genetic variations have been identified that show high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population, be they for patrilineal markers ([[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]s) and for matrilineal markers ([[mitochondrion|mitotypes]]).<ref name=WadeNYT>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html |title=New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2006 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152054/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html| archivedate=10 December 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/science/y-chromosome-bears-witness-to-story-of-the-jewish-diaspora.html |title=Y Chromosome Bears Witness to Story of the Jewish Diaspora |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 May 2000 |first=Nicholas |last=Wade}}</ref>\n\nA 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, homogeneous genetic subgroup. Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort&nbsp;\u2013 that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly common, many Haredi Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease. These Haredi Jews often have extremely large families.<ref name=\"pmid17044734\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Seldin MF, Shigeta R, Villoslada P |title=European population substructure: clustering of northern and southern populations |journal=PLOS Genet. |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=e143 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17044734 |pmc=1564423 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143 |display-authors=etal }}</ref>\n\n==Customs, laws and traditions==\nThe ''[[Halakha|Halakhic]]'' practices of ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of [[Sephardi Jews]], particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' itself, in the gloss of [[Moses Isserles]]. Well known differences in practice include:\n\n[[File:Prager Beerdigungsbruderschaft.jpg|thumb|The example of the ''[[chevra kadisha]]'', the Jewish burial society, Prague, 1772]]\n* Observance of ''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating [[legumes]], grain, [[millet]], and [[rice]] ([[quinoa]], however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.\n* Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.\n* Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] as a hair covering for married and widowed women.\n* In the case of ''[[kashrut]]'' for meat, conversely, Sephardi Jews have stricter requirements&nbsp;\u2013 this level is commonly referred to as ''[[Beth Yoseph|Beth Yosef]]''. Meat products that are acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews as kosher may therefore be rejected by Sephardi Jews. Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper [[Halakha|Halakhic]] removal of the [[sciatic nerve]], while many Ashkenazi Jews do not. This is not because of different interpretations of the law; rather, slaughterhouses could not find adequate skills for correct removal of the sciatic nerve and found it more economical to separate the hindquarters and sell them as non-kosher meat.\n* Ashkenazi Jews often name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as [[Chuts]].\n* Ashkenazi [[tefillin]] bear some differences from Sephardic tefillin. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don tefillin while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.\n* Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter [[Taw (letter)|tav]] in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /\u03b8/ sound. {{further|Ashkenazi Hebrew}}\n* The prayer shawl, or [[tallit]] (or tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew), is worn by the majority of Ashkenazi men after marriage, but western European Ashkenazi men wear it from Bar Mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/things/tallit.htm |title=''Tallit: Jewish Prayer Shawl'' |publisher=Religionfacts.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref>\n\n===Ashkenazic liturgy===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|ethnicities}}\nThe term ''Ashkenazi'' also refers to the ''[[nusach Ashkenaz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \"liturgical tradition\", or rite) used by Ashkenazi [[Jew]]s in their ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, the order of prayers, the text of prayers, and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are [[Nusach Sefard]] (not to be confused with [[Sephardic law and customs|the Sephardic ritual]]), which is the general Polish Hasidic nusach, and [[Nusach Ari]], as used by Lubavitch Hasidim.\n\n===Ashkenazi as a surname===\nSeveral famous people have [[Ashkenazi (surname)|Ashkenazi as a surname]], such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. However, most people with this surname hail from within Sephardic communities, particularly from the [[Syrian Jew]]ish community. The Sephardic carriers of the surname would have some Ashkenazi ancestors since the surname was adopted by families who were initially of Ashkenazic origins who moved to Sephardi countries and joined those communities. Ashkenazi would be formally adopted as the family surname having started off as a nickname imposed by their adopted communities. Some have shortened the name to Ash.\n\n== Relations with Sephardim ==\n{{Further|Racism in Israel#Intra-Jewish racism: Racism between Jews}}\nRelations between Ashkenazim and Sephardim have at times been tense and clouded by arrogance, snobbery and claims of racial superiority with both sides claiming the inferiority of the other, based upon such features as physical traits and culture.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John M.

Currently, there are three types of genetic origin testing, autosomal DNA (atDNA), [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), and Y-chromosomal DNA ([[Y-DNA]]). Autosomal DNA is a mixture from an individual's entire ancestry, Y-DNA shows a male's lineage only along his strict paternal line, mtDNA shows any person's lineage only along the strict maternal line. [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] have also been employed to yield findings relevant to genetic origins.\n\nLike most DNA studies of human migration patterns, the earliest studies on Ashkenazi Jews focused on the Y-DNA and mtDNA segments of the human genome. Both segments are unaffected by [[recombination (biology)|recombination]] (except for the ends of the Y chromosome \u2013 the [[pseudoautosomal region]]s known as PAR1 and PAR2), thus allowing tracing of direct maternal and paternal lineages.\n\nThese studies revealed that Ashkenazi Jews originate from an ancient (2000 BCE \u2013 700 BCE) population of the Middle East who had spread to Europe.<ref name=\"tony-frudakis-book\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Photofitting: Predicting Ancestry and Phenotype Using DNA |author=Tony Nick Frudakis |page=383 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9vXeydpj7VkC&pg=PA383&dq=ashkenazi+jews+middle+eastern+origin+bronze+age#v=onepage&q=ashkenazi%20jews%20middle%20eastern%20origin%20bronze%20age |isbn=978-0080551371 |date=2010-07-19}}</ref>\nAshkenazic Jews display the homogeneity of a [[Population bottleneck|genetic bottleneck]], meaning they descend from a larger population whose numbers were greatly reduced but recovered through a few founding individuals.\nAlthough the Jewish people, in general, were present across a wide geographical area as described, genetic research done by Gil Atzmon of the Longevity Genes Project at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] suggests \"that Ashkenazim branched off from other Jews around the time of the destruction of the First Temple, 2,500 years ago ... flourished during the Roman Empire but then went through a 'severe bottleneck' as they dispersed, reducing a population of several million to just 400 families who left Northern Italy around the year 1000 for Central and eventually Eastern Europe.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=What Do a Bunch of Old Jews Know About Living Forever? |author=Jesse Green |work=New York Magazine|date=6 November 2011|url=https://nymag.com/news/features/ashkenazi-jews-2011-11/ |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref>\n\nVarious studies have arrived at diverging conclusions regarding both the degree and the sources of the non-Levantine [[Miscegenation|admixture]] in Ashkenazim,<ref name=\"Summary of Recent Genetic Studies\"/> particularly with respect to the extent of the non-Levantine genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi maternal lineages, which is in contrast to the predominant Levantine genetic origin observed in Ashkenazi paternal lineages.

This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male [[genetic admixture]] in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with \"relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,\" and a total admixture estimate \"very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.\" This supported the finding that \"Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the [[Near East]] resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.\" \"Past research found that 50\u201380 percent of DNA from the Ashkenazi Y chromosome, which is used to trace the male lineage, originated in the Near East,\" Richards said.\nThe population has subsequently spread out.\n\nA 2001 study by Nebel ''et al.'' showed that both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish populations share the same overall paternal Near Eastern ancestries.

Richards of the [[University of Huddersfield]] in England reached different conclusions, in line with the pre-2006 origin hypothesis.

However, it is possible that the relaxation of marriage prescription in the ancestors of Ashkenazim drove their heterozygosity up, while the maintenance of the [[Cousin marriage in the Middle East|FBD rule]] in native Middle Easterners has been keeping their heterozygosity values in check. Ashkenazim distinctiveness as found in the Bray et al. study, therefore, may come from their ethnic endogamy (ethnic inbreeding), which allowed them to \"mine\" their ancestral gene pool in the context of relative reproductive isolation from European neighbors, and not from clan endogamy (clan inbreeding). Consequently, their higher diversity compared to Middle Easterners stems from the latter's marriage practices, not necessarily from the former's admixture with Europeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthropogenesis.kinshipstudies.org/2012/07/how-to-interpret-patterns-of-genetic-variation-admixture-divergence-inbreeding/ |title=How to Interpret Patterns of Genetic Variation?

Formed in 1968, the band went through several configurations until arriving at its longest and classic line-up when Peart replaced original drummer [[John Rutsey]] in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first tour of the United States.\n\nRush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]], and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which continued for the rest of their career. Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015, following the conclusion of their [[R40 Live Tour]]. After nearly three years of an uncertain future, Lifeson reluctantly announced in January 2018 that the band was not going to continue.<ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson-we-have-no-plans-to-tour-or-record-any-more-were-basically-done/|title=RUSH Guitarist ALEX LIFESON: \"We Have No Plans To Tour Or Record Anymore.

To achieve a broader, more progressive sound, Lifeson began to experiment with [[Classical guitar|classical]] and [[twelve-string guitar]]s, and Lee added [[Moog Taurus|bass-pedal synthesizers]] and [[Minimoog]].

Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with the progressive rock trends by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. As the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of its older styles of music in favour of shorter and sometimes softer arrangements. The lyrics up to this point were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song \"Anthem\" from ''Fly By Night'' and a specifically acknowledged derivation in ''2112'' (1976).<ref>2112 and Ayn Rand [http://www.nimitz.net/rush/faq2ans.html#62 Rush FAQ].

While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson's diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid-to-late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and razor-thin leads. ''Hold Your Fire'' represents both an extension of the guitar stylings found on ''Power Windows'', and, according to Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush.<ref>Hold Your Fire Review [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r17147|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic, Eduardo Rivadavia].

Although synthesizers were still used in many songs, the instrument was no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush's compositions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/presto-mw0000654443 |title=Presto |work=Allmusic.com |author=Gregory Heaney |accessdate=November 24, 2013}}</ref> Continuing this trend, ''Roll the Bones'' (1991) extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor.

To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound \"events\" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to \"play\" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}\n\nA staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called \"diversions\".

Formed in 1968, the band went through several configurations until arriving at its longest and classic line-up when Peart replaced original drummer [[John Rutsey]] in July 1974, two weeks before the group's first tour of the United States.\n\nRush is known for its musicianship, complex compositions, and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, [[fantasy]], and philosophy. The band's musical style has changed several times over the years, from a blues-inspired [[hard rock]] beginning, later moving into [[progressive rock]], and including a period marked by heavy use of synthesizers. In the early 1990s, Rush returned to a guitar-driven hard rock sound, which continued for the rest of their career. Rush announced plans to cease large-scale touring at the end of 2015, following the conclusion of their [[R40 Live Tour]]. After nearly three years of an uncertain future, Lifeson reluctantly announced in January 2018 that the band was not going to continue.<ref name=\"blabbermouth.net\">{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rush-guitarist-alex-lifeson-we-have-no-plans-to-tour-or-record-any-more-were-basically-done/|title=RUSH Guitarist ALEX LIFESON: \"We Have No Plans To Tour Or Record Anymore.

Peart's daughter Selena died in a car crash in August 1997, followed by the death of his wife Jacqueline from cancer in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect, during which he travelled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering {{convert|88,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound \"events\" in real-time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more [[MIDI controller]]s, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|title=Rush Rolls Again|date=September 2002|publisher=OnStage Magazine|accessdate=December 18, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021018005414/http://onstagemag.com/ar/performance_rush_rolls_again/index.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2002}}</ref> It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900300backstageclub.htm|title=Backstage Club Newsletter|date=March 1990|publisher=2112.net|work=Power Windows|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> The band members' coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to \"play\" sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially so on [[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]], their 2005 concert DVD.{{citation needed|date = March 2018}}\n\nA staple of Rush's concerts was a Neil Peart drum solo. Peart's drum solos included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw the solo more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart had used [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] [[Sound module|trigger pads]] to trigger sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a [[marimba]], [[harp]], [[temple blocks]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]], glockenspiel, [[Bell (instrument)|orchestra bells]], tubular bells, and [[vibraslap]] as well as other, more esoteric percussion.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne prominent feature of Rush's concerts were props on stage, at one point called \"diversions\". These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, or animations and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Joyce|first1=Mike|title=Colorful Diversions From Rush|work=The Washington Post|date=May 9, 1990}}</ref> Starting in the mid-90s, the props often took up Lee's side of the stage ([[Blocking (stage)|stage left]]) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson's side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue's house system instead of amps.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nRush actively participates in philanthropic causes. The band was one of several hometown favourites to play [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]], also dubbed SARStock, at [[Downsview Park]] in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people.

After Texas Vice President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] visited [[central Texas]] during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital (then located in [[Houston]]) be relocated to a site on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. In 1839 the site was officially chosen as the republic's new capital and given the name [[Waterloo, Texas]]; shortly thereafter the city's name was changed to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/faq2.htm|title=Austin Public Library|author=|date=|website=Austin Public Library|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> A new county was also established the following year, of which Austin would be the seat; the county was named '''Travis County''', after [[William B. Travis]]. Though the Republic's capital moved briefly back to Houston during the events surrounding the [[Texas Archive War]], by 1845 Austin was again the capital, and it became the capital of the new State of Texas when Texas was [[Annexation of Texas|annexed]] by the United States later that year.\n\n===Civil War and beyond===\n{{Further|History of Austin, Texas}}\nIn 1861 Travis County was one of the few Texas counties to vote against [[Texas in the American Civil War|secession]] from the Union. Since the majority of the state did favor secession, Travis County then became a part of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] for the duration of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the Confederacy's defeat, Texas was fully readmitted to the Union in 1870.\n\nFrom the end of the Civil War to the early twenty-first century, Travis County has experienced steady, rapid population growth (averaging more than a 36% increase every decade from 1870 to 2010), driven largely by the growth of Austin and its suburbs; it is now the fifth most populous county in Texas, after [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] (Houston), [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]], [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] ([[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]) and [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]] ([[San Antonio]]) counties.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:TravisCountyJusticeCenterTX.JPG|thumb|right|Travis County Justice Complex]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1023|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|990|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|33|sqmi}} (3.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_48.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 11, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> Travis County is located in the southern part of [[central Texas]], between [[San Antonio]] and [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]].

The western part of the county is characterized by the [[Karst|karst topography]] of the [[Texas Hill Country]], while the eastern part exhibits the fertile plains and farmlands of the [[Blackland Prairie]].

After the Confederacy's defeat, Texas was fully readmitted to the Union in 1870.\n\nFrom the end of the Civil War to the early twenty-first century, Travis County has experienced steady, rapid population growth (averaging more than a 36% increase every decade from 1870 to 2010), driven largely by the growth of Austin and its suburbs; it is now the fifth most populous county in Texas, after [[Harris County, Texas|Harris]] (Houston), [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]], [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] ([[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]) and [[Bexar County, Texas|Bexar]] ([[San Antonio]]) counties.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:TravisCountyJusticeCenterTX.JPG|thumb|right|Travis County Justice Complex]]\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|1023|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|990|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|33|sqmi}} (3.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_48.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=May 11, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref> Travis County is located in the southern part of [[central Texas]], between [[San Antonio]] and [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth]].
