Rudolph competed in the [[200 metres|200-meter]] dash and won a [[bronze medal]] in the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100-meter relay]]  at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. She also won three [[gold medal]]s, in the [[100 metres|100-]] and 200-meter individual events and the 4 x 100-meter relay at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Rudolph was acclaimed the fastest woman in the world in the 1960s and became the first American woman to win three [[gold medal]]s in a single Olympic Games.\n\nDue to the worldwide television coverage of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rudolph became an international star along with other Olympic athletes such as [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay]] (later known as Muhammad Ali), [[Oscar Robertson]], and [[Rafer Johnson]] who competed in Italy.\n\nAs an Olympic champion in the early 1960s, Rudolph was among the most highly visible black women in America and abroad. She became a role model for black and female athletes and her Olympic successes helped elevate women's track and field in the United States. Rudolph is also regarded as a civil rights and women's rights pioneer. In 1962 Rudolph retired from competition at the peak of her athletic career as the world record-holder in the 100- and 200-meter individual events and the 4 \u00d7 100-meter relays. After competing in the 1960 Summer Olympics, the 1963 graduate of [[Tennessee State University]] became an educator and coach. Rudolph died of brain and throat cancer in 1994, and her achievements are memorialized in a variety of tributes, including a U.S. postage stamp, documentary films, and a made-for-television movie, as well as in numerous publications, especially books for young readers.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRudolph was born prematurely at {{convert|4.5|lb|kg}} on June 23, 1940, in [[Saint Bethlehem, Tennessee]] (now part of Clarksville, TN).<ref name=sports-reference/><ref name=NBAW958-61>James E.

Physically disabled for much of her early life, Rudolph wore a leg brace until she was twelve years old.

She began attending second grade at Cobb Elementary School in Clarksville in 1947, when she was seven years old.<ref name=Hine-992-93/> Rudolph attended Clarksville's all-black Burt High School, where she excelled in basketball and track. During her senior year of high school, Rudolph became pregnant with her first child, Yolanda, who was born in 1958, a few weeks before her enrollment at [[Tennessee State University]] in Nashville.<ref name=Bio-WR/><ref>Liberti and Smith, pp. 124\u201325.</ref> In college, Rudolph continued to compete in track. She also became a member of the [[Delta Sigma Theta]] sorority. In 1963, Rudolph graduated from Tennessee State with a Bachelor's Degree in Education.

After completing several years of medical treatments to regain the use of her left leg, Rudolph chose to follow in her sister Yvonne's footsteps and began playing basketball in the eighth grade. Rudolph continued to play basketball in high school, where she became a starter on the team and began competing in track. In her sophomore year Rudolph scored 803 points and set a new record for high school girls' basketball.<ref name=NBAW958-61/> Rudolph's high school coach, C. C. Gray, gave her the nickname of \"Skeeter\" (for mosquito) because she moved so fast.<ref name=\"guardianolysrs\"/>\n\nWhile playing for her high school basketball team, Rudolph was spotted by [[Ed Temple]], [[Tennessee State University|Tennessee State's]] track and field coach, a major break for the active young athlete. The day that Temple saw the tenth grader for the first time, he knew she was a natural athlete. Rudolph had already gained some track experience on Burt High School's track team two years earlier, mostly as a way to keep busy between basketball seasons.<ref>Biracree (1988), p. 47</ref> As a high school sophomore Rudolph competed at [[Alabama]]'s [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]] in her first major track event. Although she lost the race, Rudolph was determined to continue competing and win.<ref name=NBAW958-61/>\n\nTemple invited fourteen-year-old Rudolph to join his summer training program at Tennessee State. After attending the track camp, Rudolph won all nine events she entered at an [[Amateur Athletic Union]] track meet in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=NBAW958-61/> Under Temple's guidance she continued to train regularly at TSU while still a high school student.

Rudolph competed in the [[200 metres|200-meter]] dash and won a [[bronze medal]] in the [[4 x 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100-meter relay]]  at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] at [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. She also won three [[gold medal]]s, in the [[100 metres|100-]] and 200-meter individual events and the 4 x 100-meter relay at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Rudolph was acclaimed the fastest woman in the world in the 1960s and became the first American woman to win three [[gold medal]]s in a single Olympic Games.\n\nDue to the worldwide television coverage of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rudolph became an international star along with other Olympic athletes such as [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay]] (later known as Muhammad Ali), [[Oscar Robertson]], and [[Rafer Johnson]] who competed in Italy.\n\nAs an Olympic champion in the early 1960s, Rudolph was among the most highly visible black women in America and abroad. She became a role model for black and female athletes and her Olympic successes helped elevate women's track and field in the United States. Rudolph is also regarded as a civil rights and women's rights pioneer. In 1962 Rudolph retired from competition at the peak of her athletic career as the world record-holder in the 100- and 200-meter individual events and the 4 \u00d7 100-meter relays. After competing in the 1960 Summer Olympics, the 1963 graduate of [[Tennessee State University]] became an educator and coach. Rudolph died of brain and throat cancer in 1994, and her achievements are memorialized in a variety of tributes, including a U.S. postage stamp, documentary films, and a made-for-television movie, as well as in numerous publications, especially books for young readers.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRudolph was born prematurely at {{convert|4.5|lb|kg}} on June 23, 1940, in [[Saint Bethlehem, Tennessee]] (now part of Clarksville, TN).<ref name=sports-reference/><ref name=NBAW958-61>James E.
