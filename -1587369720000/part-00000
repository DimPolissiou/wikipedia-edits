The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with [[Motorola]] as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are [[Thales Group]] (33 per cent), [[Fluor Corporation]] (18%), [[Motorola]] (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and [[HSBC]] (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32&nbsp;billion over twenty years.<br />Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\n\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the [[King's Cross fire]] disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006 the [[London Assembly]] published the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July Review Committee]] report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.<ref name=REGISTER />\n\nThe [[East London line]] was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface.

Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\n\n===Zonal fare system===\n{{main|London fare zones}}\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into [[London fare zones|eleven fare zones]], with every station on the [[London Underground]], [[London Overground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]] and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\n\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 1|Zone 1]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 2|Zone 2]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Zone 3]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 4|Zone 4]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 5|Zone 5]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 6|Zone 6]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zones 7\u2013W|Zones 7\u20139, C, G and W]]\n\n===Travelcard===\n{{Main|Travelcard}}\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the [[Travelcard]] system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\n\n===Oyster card===\n{{Main|Oyster card}}\nThe [[Oyster card]] is a [[contactless smart card]] system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all [[National Rail]] services within London.

The supply contract was signed in November 1999 with [[Motorola]] as the radio provider alongside Thales. Citylink's shareholders are [[Thales Group]] (33 per cent), [[Fluor Corporation]] (18%), [[Motorola]] (10%), Laing Investment (19.5%) and [[HSBC]] (19.5%). The cost of the design, build and maintain contract was \u00a32&nbsp;billion over twenty years.<br />Various subcontractors were used for the installation work, including Brookvex and Fentons.\n\nA key reasoning for the introduction of the system was in light of the [[King's Cross fire]] disaster, where efforts by the emergency services were hampered by a lack of radio coverage below ground. Work was due to be completed by the end of 2002, although suffered delays due to the necessity of installing the required equipment on an ageing railway infrastructure with no disruption to the operational railway. On 5 June 2006 the [[London Assembly]] published the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July Review Committee]] report, which urged TfL to speed up implementation of the Connect system.<ref name=REGISTER />\n\nThe [[East London line]] was chosen as the first line to receive the TETRA radio in February 2006, as it was the second smallest line and is a mix of surface and sub surface. In the same year it was rolled out to the District, Circle, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan and Victoria lines, with the Bakerloo, Piccadilly, Jubilee, Waterloo & City and Central lines following in 2007.<ref name=OFCOM>{{cite web |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/spec_trad/responses/lu.pdf|title=Response from the Chief Engineers' Directorate of London Underground to the OFCOM Consultative Document \"Spectrum Trading Consultation\"|page=10|publisher=[[Ofcom]]|date=November 2003|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> The final line, the Northern, was handed over in November 2008.\n\nThe 2010 TfL investment programme included the project \"LU-PJ231 LU-managed Connect communications\", which provided Connect with a new transmission and radio system comprising 290 cell sites with two to three base stations, 1,400 new train mobiles, 7,500 new telephone links and 180 [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] links.<ref name=ASCENDA />\n\n==Fares==\nMost of the transport modes that come under the control of TfL have their own charging and ticketing regimes for single fare. Buses and trams share a common fare and ticketing regime, and the DLR, Overground, Underground, and National Rail services another.\n\n===Zonal fare system===\n{{main|London fare zones}}\nRail service fares in the capital are calculated by a zonal fare system. London is divided into [[London fare zones|eleven fare zones]], with every station on the [[London Underground]], [[London Overground]], [[Docklands Light Railway]] and, since 2007, on National Rail services, being in one, or in some cases, two zones. The zones are mostly concentric rings of increasing size emanating from the centre of London. They are (in order):\n\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 1|Zone 1]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 2|Zone 2]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 3|Zone 3]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 4|Zone 4]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 5|Zone 5]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zone 6|Zone 6]]\n*[[List of stations in London fare zones 7\u2013W|Zones 7\u20139, C, G and W]]\n\n===Travelcard===\n{{Main|Travelcard}}\nSuperimposed on these mode-specific regimes is the [[Travelcard]] system, which provides zonal tickets with validities from one day to one year, and off-peak variants. These are accepted on the DLR, buses, railways, trams, and the Underground, and provide a discount on many river services fares.\n\n===Oyster card===\n{{Main|Oyster card}}\nThe [[Oyster card]] is a [[contactless smart card]] system introduced for the public in 2003, which can be used to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by scanning the card at a yellow card reader. Such readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all [[National Rail]] services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.\n\n===Contactless payments===\n{{Main|Contactless payments}}\nContactless Visa, Maestro, MasterCard and American Express debit and credit cards issued in the UK are accepted for travel on London Underground, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway, most National Rail, London Tramlink and Bus services. This works in the same way for the passenger as an [[Oyster card]], including the use of capping and reduced fares compared to paper tickets.

The roundel rendered in blue without any lettering represents TfL as a whole (see Transport for London logo), as well as used in situations where lettering on the roundel is not possible (such as bus receipts, where a logo is a blank roundel with the name \"London Buses\" to the right). The same range of colours is also used extensively in publicity and on the TfL website.\n\nTransport for London has always mounted advertising campaigns to encourage use of the Underground. For example, in 1999, they commissioned artist [[Stephen Whatley]] to paint an interior \u2013 'The Grand Staircase' \u2013 which he did on location inside Buckingham Palace. This painting was reproduced on posters and displayed all over the London Underground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Stephen%20B%20Whatley|title=Artist: Stephen B Whatley \u2013 Poster and poster artwork collection, London Transport Museum|first=London Transport Museum, 39 Wellington Street, Covent Garden, London WC2E 7BB|last=enquiry@ltmuseum.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 they commissioned artist Mark Wallinger to assist them in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Underground, by creating the Labyrinth Project, with one painting to hang permanently in each of the Tube's 270 stations.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tube celebrates 150th birthday with labyrinth art project |author=Mark Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/07/tube-150-birthday-labyrinth-art-project |newspaper=The Guardian |date=7 February 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, in partnership with the [[London Transport Museum]] and sponsored by [[Exterion Media]],<ref name=\"exterionmedia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.exterionmedia.com/uk/who-we-are/news/exterion-media-sponsors-tfls-transported-by-design-programme/|title=Exterion Media sponsors TfL|date=17 September 2015|access-date=7 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304190036/http://www.exterionmedia.com/uk/who-we-are/news/exterion-media-sponsors-tfls-transported-by-design-programme/|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"exterionmedia.com\"/> TfL launched [[Transported by Design]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design|title=Transported by Design|author=Transport for London|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417060006/https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design|archivedate=17 April 2016}}</ref> an 18-month programme of activities.

{"title_page": "Annianus of Alexandria", "text_new": "{{for|the first-century bishop|Anianus of Alexandria}}\n'''Annianus of Alexandria''' ({{lang-grc-gre|italic=yes|Annianos)}} was a monk who flourished in [[Alexandria]] during the [[bishop]]ric of [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]] around the beginning of the fifth century. He criticized the world history of his contemporary monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria]] for relying too much on secular sources rather than biblical sources for his dates.\n\nAs a result, Annianus developed his own [[chronology]] which placed [[Dating Creation|Creation]] on 25 March 5492 BC. This created the Alexandrian Era whose first day was the first day of the [[proleptic calendar|proleptic]] Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC. This year was eleven Paschal cycles of 532 years each before the Alexandrian year beginning 29 August 360, which itself was four [[Metonic cycle|19-year cycles]] after the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of the Diocletian Era on 29 August 284. The former is known as the Era of Grace in the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]], whereas the latter is known as the [[Era of Martyrs]]. He was the first [[computus|computist]] to recognize the 532-year cycle of [[Easter]]s in the [[Julian calendar]]. This cycle is often attributed to [[Victorius of Aquitaine|Victorius]] of [[Aquitaine]] in 457, the first to recognize such a cycle in the West.\n\nNone of Annianus's writings have survived.
