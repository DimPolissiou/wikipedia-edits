In 2007, following [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of [[influenza|flu]], the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" throughout the [[NHS]], on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.  \n\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the [[2009 flu pandemic]] caused by [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|swine flu]]. In that year, funding was granted for research to study [[Behavior change (public health)|public behaviour]] and the effect of initiatives such as the campaigns using the slogan. One of the researchers stated that \"Until a vaccine is ready, the main tool we have to combat pandemic flu is people's behaviour. For example, good respiratory and hand hygiene, as summed up in the NHS's 'Catch It, Bin It, Kill It' campaign, can slow the spread of the pandemic.\"<ref name=UCLresearchers/> The [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] later funded a [[randomised controlled trial]] to support evidence for the campaign. The message has been taught to children using an online game led by [[Public Health England]] (PHE), and a downloadable poster has been available, particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.\n\nThe phrase and poster was revived by PHE in subsequent campaigns, including in 2020 during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] caused by [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], and has been included in the government's \"Action Plan\", unveiled on 3 March 2020 following a rise of [[COVID-19]] [[2020 coronavirus outbreak in the United Kingdom|cases in the UK]].\n\n==Slogan==\n\"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" is a [[slogan]]<ref name=Management2009>{{Cite web|url=https://managementinpractice.com/news/catch-it-kill-it-bin-it-swine-flu-campaign-begins/|title=Catch It, Kill It, Bin It: swine-flu campaign begins -|date=26 October 2009|website=Management in Practice|url-status=live|access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> and the name associated with [[Public Health England]]'s (PHE) annual public awareness campaigns for flu and [[norovirus]].<ref name=NIHR2015>{{Cite web|url=https://discover.dc.nihr.ac.uk/content/signal-000150/handwashing-advice-reduces-the-number-of-colds-and-their-severity|title=Handwashing advice reduces the number of colds and their severity|date=24 November 2015|website=discover.dc.nihr.ac.uk|publisher=NIHR Dissemination Centre|url-status=live|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=Stuart>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/public-health/why-behaviour-change-marketing-can-still-deliver-long-term-cost-savings/5037782.article|title=Why behaviour change marketing can still deliver long-term cost savings|last=Stuart|first=Mark Blayney|date=n.d.|website=[[Health Service Journal]]|url-status=live|access-date=4 March 2020|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name=Russell13Feb2020/> The slogan appears on a downloadable poster, published by PHE and particularly targeted at primary care services in the UK.<ref name=infectionpreventioncontrol/><ref name=PHE2019>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/campaign-warns-people-to-catch-it-bin-it-kill-it-to-stop-the-spread-of-flu|title=Campaign warns people to \u2018Catch it.

In 2007, following [[evidence-based medicine|evidence]] that good respiratory and hand hygiene might reduce the spread of [[influenza|flu]], the phrase appeared in a government campaign that publicised the directive \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" throughout the [[NHS]], on buses and trains and in libraries, shopping centres and police stations.  \n\nIn 2009, the slogan received widespread attention when the government funded its use in a national media campaign in response to the [[2009 flu pandemic]] caused by [[Pandemic H1N1/09 virus|swine flu]].

The game is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'', and like the original game, combines characters and settings from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films with those of Square Enix's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. An expanded re-release of the game featuring new and additional content, '''''Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix''''', was released exclusively in Japan in March 2007. The ''Final Mix'' version of the game was later re-mastered in high definition and released globally as a part of the ''[[Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix]]'' collection for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Kingdom Hearts II'' is the third game in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series.

In developing ''Kingdom Hearts II'', the development team sought to address user feedback from the first game, give the player more freedom and options in combat and present a deeper and more mature plot than the first game. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.khinsider.com/news/Kingdom-Hearts-II-Ultimania-Main-Nomura-Interview-2553 |title=Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania Main Nomura Interview|date=December 2005 |access-date=4 April 2020| publisher=KH Insider}} </ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.khinsider.com/kingdom-hearts-2/interviews/dengeki-playstation-october-2003 |title=Dengeki Playstation - October 2003|date=October 2003 |access-date=4 April 2020| publisher=KH Insider}} </ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.khinsider.com/news/Playstation-com-Europe-May-2005-Interview-2567 |title=Dengeki Playstation.com Europe May 2005 Interview|date=May 2005 |access-date=4 April 2020| publisher=KH Insider}} </ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.khinsider.com/news/1up-E3-2005-Interview-2566 |title=1up E3 2005 Interview|date=June 2005 |access-date=4 April 2020| publisher=KH Insider}} </ref>\n\nThe game earned several awards upon release, and has since been cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/why-kingdom-hearts-ii-one-greatest-games-ever-made/ |title=Why Kingdom Hearts II is one of the greatest games ever made |last=Cooper |first=Hollander |date=25 July 2012 |access-date=27 July 2018 |work=[[Games Radar]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref> In both Japan and North America, it shipped more than one million copies within weeks of its release, with over four million worldwide by April 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://bestof.ign.com/2006/ps2/38.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070110000202/http://bestof.ign.com/2006/ps2/38.html| archivedate = January 10, 2007| title = News\u2014IGN Best of 06| publisher = IGN |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"square-enix.com\">http://www.square-enix.com/jp/common/images/sqex_07profile_e.pdf#page=6</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Kingdom Hearts#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Kingdom Hearts}}\n[[File:KH2 gameplay.png|thumb|left|Sora battles [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] in Radiant Garden.

Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via [[cutscene]]s, though there are numerous [[quest (gaming)|side-quests]] available that provide bonuses to characters.\n\nLike many traditional [[role-playing video game]]s, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' features an [[experience point]] system which determines character development.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\">{{cite book|last=Hollinger|first=Elizabeth|year=2006|title=Kingdom Hearts II Official Strategy Guide|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|isbn=0-7440-0526-4}}</ref> As enemies are defeated, the player and allies culminate experience to \"level up\", in which the [[player character|playable characters]] grow stronger and gain access to new [[Skill (role-playing games)|abilities]].<ref name=\"Instructions\">{{cite book|author=[[Square Enix]]|year=2006|title=Kingdom Hearts II Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Square Enix]]}}</ref>\n\nCombat in ''Kingdom Hearts II'' is in real-time and involves heavy [[hack and slash]] elements with button presses which initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, similar to those found in ''Final Fantasy'' games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/> A new feature is the \"Reaction Command\", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\">{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/games/ps2/19829/Kingdom-Hearts-II/review/|title=Kingdom Hearts II|publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a [[boss (video games)|boss]] battle.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat.<ref name=\"EuroGamerReview1\"/> Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen, such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.\n\nIn response to criticism, the \"Gummi Ship\" feature of the first game was re-imagined to be \"more enjoyable\". Although retaining its basic purpose of travel, the system was completely redone to resemble a combination of [[rail shooter]] and \"Disney theme park ride\".<ref name=\"KH-NI-1UP2005\"/> In the world map, the player must now control the Gummi Ship from a [[Top-down perspective|top-down view]] and fly to the world the player wishes to enter. Worlds are no longer open from the beginning\u2014the player must unlock the routes to them by entering a new level, controlling the ship from a third-person point of view, and battling enemy ships.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/> After the route is opened, travel to the world is unimpeded, unless it is blocked again due to a plot-related event. The player may also gain new Gummi Ships from completing routes, which is also a new feature from the first game.\n\n===Drive Gauge===\nOne of the new features is a meter known as the \"Drive Gauge\". The Drive Gauge has dual functions: to transform Sora into a \"Drive Form\" or to summon a special character. While in a Drive Form, Sora bonds with party members to become more powerful and acquire different attributes;<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\">{{cite web|first= Stephen|last=Coleman|title=Kingdom Hearts II Gets All-Star Cast|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/686/686944p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052517/http://games.ign.com/articles/686/686944p1.html|archivedate=April 18, 2006|publisher=IGN|date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2007}}</ref> all but two Forms also allow the use of two Keyblades. When a Drive is executed, Sora's combat statistics are heightened. Drive Forms also give Sora new abilities that can be used in normal form, called \"Growth Abilities.\" Sora's first two Drive Forms only combine power with one party member; later-obtained Drive Forms require him to bond with both party members. When allies are used in a Drive, they are temporarily removed from battle for its duration. Unlike the [[Health (game mechanic)|HP]] and [[magic (gaming)|MP]] gauges, the Drive Gauge is not refilled at save points.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/>\n\nLike in the first game, Sora can summon a Disney character to aid him in battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\"/> Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora for as long as the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--This section is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand plot at its most basic level, to comply with the featured article criteria.

The game's setting is a collection of various [[level (video games)|levels]] (referred to in-game as \"worlds\") that the player progresses through. As in the first game, the player can travel to various Disney-based locales, along with original worlds specifically created for the series. While Disney-based worlds were primarily derived from the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated features canon]] in the first game, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' introduces worlds that are based on live-action franchise ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' as well.<ref name=\"liveworlds\">{{cite web|date=June 8, 2005 |title=Tetsuya Nomura Dengeki Interview #3 |url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/dengeki-3 |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611213907/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FDengeki-3 |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"KH-NI-PSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/playstation |title=Playstation.com Europe\u2014E3 Interview |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=June 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418212412/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FPlaystation |archivedate=April 18, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Each world varies in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney film on which it is based. The graphics of the world and characters are meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney films. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately; with few exceptions, players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.\n\nSome worlds featured in the previous games reappear, but with new and expanded areas. There are also new worlds that are introduced, including the Land of Dragons (based on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''), Beast's Castle (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''), Timeless River (''[[Steamboat Willie]]''), Port Royal (''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), Pride Lands (''[[The Lion King]]''), and Space Paranoids (''[[Tron]]''). Twilight Town, an original world first seen in ''Chain of Memories'', has a greater role as the introductory world. The World That Never Was is a new world that serves as the headquarters of Organization XIII.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n===Characters===\n{{further|Characters of Kingdom Hearts}}\nThe three [[protagonist]]s of the game are [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], a 15-year-old boy chosen as a wielder of the Keyblade, a mystical key-shaped weapon that can combat darkness; [[Donald Duck]], the court magician of Disney Castle; and [[Goofy]], the captain of the Disney Castle guards.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> Both Donald and Goofy are under orders from their missing king, [[Mickey Mouse]], to accompany Sora and his Keyblade.<ref name=\"MickeyNote\"/> which refers to Sora and his Keyblade. Other original characters include [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] and [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]], Sora's friends from his home world of [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Original worlds|Destiny Islands]]; [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]], a boy who can also wield the Keyblade and is playable in the game's beginning sequence; [[Namin\u00e9]], a girl with the power to manipulate memories; and [[DiZ]], a man in red robes with a vendetta against [[Organization XIII]], who is later revealed to be Ansem the Wise, the mentor of [[Xehanort]].\n\nAs in the previous games, there are numerous appearances of characters from both Disney and Square Enix works. While some make a return from ''Kingdom Hearts'', new characters from Disney fiction are also introduced, such as [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] from ''The Lion King'' and [[Scrooge McDuck]]. [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] appears as a persistent enemy who works with the resurrected [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]. Nearly twenty characters from ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games appear, notably [[\u0100ron|Auron]] of ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', [[Tifa Lockhart|Tifa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and the return of [[Squall Leonhart]], [[Cloud Strife|Cloud]], and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]. It was stated that although the first game strictly stuck to characters [[Tetsuya Nomura]] designed, this time around they were going to \"take some risks\", implying that characters not directly designed by Nomura might make an appearance.<ref>{{cite web| first = Bryan| last = Boulette| url = http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| publisher = RPGamer| title = Nomura Divulges Kingdom Hearts II Details| accessdate = May 29, 2007| date = November 27, 2005| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030420/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| archivedate = September 30, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Other new characters to series are [[Vivi (Final Fantasy)|Vivi]] of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', [[Seifer Almasy]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''  and [[Setzer Gabbiani|Setzer]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''.\n\nThe various worlds that Sora explores often have an optional party character from the film on which the world is based. Such party members include [[Fa Mulan]], the woman who passes as a man in order to take her ailing father's place in the army; [[Jack Sparrow]], a pirate who seeks to reclaim his ship, the [[Black Pearl]]; [[Simba]], the self-exiled lion who is the rightful king of the Pride Land; and ''[[Tron (franchise)|Tron]]'', a security program in Hollow Bastion's computer network who seeks to end the dictatorship of the Master Control Program.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\nOrganization XIII, a group of powerful Nobodies\u2014the \"empty shells\" left over when a strong-hearted person becomes a Heartless\u2014introduced in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|Chain of Memories]]'', is established as the primary group of antagonists early on. [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xemnas|Xemnas]], the leader of Organization XIII, serves as the main antagonist and [[Boss (video gaming)#Final boss|final boss]] of the game. Villains unique to the worlds are still prevalent, and are often presented as challenges that Sora's group must overcome.\n\n===Story===\nSora, Donald, and Goofy have been in [[suspended animation]] for the past year to regain their lost memories. Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town created by DiZ to merge him with his original self to restore Sora's power.<ref name=\"half of one\"/> DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town to extract Roxas. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merge with Sora.<ref name=over /> Sora, Donald, and Goofy awaken in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and [[Yen Sid]], who send them on another journey; their goal is to find Riku and uncover the Organization's plans. Afterward, Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power.<ref name=\"riku?\"/>\n\nSora travels to familiar and unfamiliar worlds, where he resolves several problems caused by Organization XIII, the Heartless, and various local villains. During a visit to Hollow Bastion, they reunite with Mickey, who explains that the Heartless \"Ansem\" they defeated is an imposter named Xehanort, whose Nobody, Xemnas, is the Organization's leader.<ref name=revelation1 /> The Organization also reveal that they seek the power of Kingdom Hearts, creating one from the hearts Sora has released from the Heartless with his Keyblade, to regain their lost hearts;<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix, [[Buena Vista Games]]|date=March 28, 2006|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=|level=Hollow Bastion|isolang=|quote='''Sa\u00efx''': Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts.

Sora revisits the worlds to solve lingering problems and new complications while seeking a path to Organization XIII's base of operations in the World That Never Was. Throughout his endeavors, Sora is secretly aided by a hooded figure whom Sora believes to be Riku.<ref name=\"riku?\" />\n\nFollowing a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a passageway to the World That Never Was through Twilight Town, where Axel sacrifices himself to give them safe passage. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has been changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless as a result of capturing Roxas. Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor.<ref name=revelation3 /> Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. Atop of the Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to fight them. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two become trapped in the realm of darkness, where they discover a portal to the realm of light in a bottled letter sent by Kairi, allowing them to return to the Destiny Islands and reunite with their friends. In a [[post-credits scene]], Sora, Kairi, and Riku receive and read a letter from Mickey, the contents of which are hidden from the player.<ref name=\"riku?\" />\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment plans for ''Kingdom Hearts II'' began around the completion of ''[[Kingdom Hearts Final Mix]]'', but specific details were undecided until July 2003.<ref name=\"GS-NI-Dengeki\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/news.html?sid=6076646| author = GameSpot Staff| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| date = October 10, 2003| title = Kingdom Hearts II's Tetsuya Nomura Q & A |accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref> Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel.

New voice actors included [[K\u014dki Uchiyama]] and [[Jesse McCartney]] as Roxas, Iku Nakahara and [[Brittany Snow]] as Namin\u00e9, and [[Genz\u014d Wakayama]] and [[Christopher Lee]] as DiZ.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/><ref name=\"1upvoice\">{{cite web |title=Kingdom Hearts II Voices Announced |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147824 |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |work=[[1UP.com]] |author=Pinckard, Jane |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016050549/http://www.1up.com/news/kingdom-hearts-voices-announced |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game, including [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Mulan, [[James Woods]] as Hades, [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Tron, [[Chris Sarandon]] as Jack Skellington and [[Zach Braff]] as Chicken Little.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/> Some voice actors from the related television series or [[direct-to-video]] sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable, such as [[Robert Costanzo]] as Philoctetes rather than [[Danny DeVito]] or [[Cam Clarke]] as Simba instead of [[Matthew Broderick]]. Some characters were given new voice actors in the English version; Ansem, Aerith, Leon, Sephiroth and Hercules, who were originally voiced by [[Billy Zane]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Lance Bass]], and [[Sean Astin]] respectively in the first game, were voiced by [[Richard Epcar]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Doug Erholtz]], [[George Newbern]], and [[Tate Donovan]] (Hercules' original voice actor), and newcomer Tifa was voiced by [[Rachael Leigh Cook]].<ref name=\"1upvoice\"/>\n\n===Content editing===\n[[File:Xigbar gun comparison.png|thumb|left|200px|Xigbar's [[telescopic sight]] view and his weapons were altered from the Japanese version (top) to the English version (bottom).]]\nBesides English translation and [[language localisation|localization]], the international version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' differs from the original Japanese version in the content of gameplay and several scenes. The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] boss in the ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, [[Daisy Duck]] pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.\n\n[[Organization XIII#Xigbar|Xigbar]]'s [[telescopic sight]] was changed from a [[crosshair]] and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, which is used to shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun.  The death of Organization XIII member [[Organization XIII#Axel|Axel]] was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.\n\nPort Royal, based on ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', contains the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to remove some of the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/698/698488p1.html| title = Nomura Discusses Kingdom Hearts and Future Titles| publisher = IGN| first=Anoop|last=Gantayat|date=March 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 11, 2007}}</ref> though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.\n\n===Promotion===\nAn unlockable trailer in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' hinted at the possibility of a sequel.

Unlike the [[Health (game mechanic)|HP]] and [[magic (gaming)|MP]] gauges, the Drive Gauge is not refilled at save points.<ref name=\"Instructions\"/>\n\nLike in the first game, Sora can summon a Disney character to aid him in battle.<ref name=\"KH2x-play\"/> Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora for as long as the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--This section is meant to be as comprehensive as possible, while only containing the details needed to understand plot at its most basic level, to comply with the featured article criteria. Please discuss any additions on the talk page first.-->\n\n===Setting===\n{{Kingdom Hearts chronology}}\n{{further|Universe of Kingdom Hearts}}\n''Kingdom Hearts II'' begins one year after the events of ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Chain of Memories''. The game's setting is a collection of various [[level (video games)|levels]] (referred to in-game as \"worlds\") that the player progresses through. As in the first game, the player can travel to various Disney-based locales, along with original worlds specifically created for the series. While Disney-based worlds were primarily derived from the [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Disney animated features canon]] in the first game, ''Kingdom Hearts II'' introduces worlds that are based on live-action franchise ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (franchise)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' as well.<ref name=\"liveworlds\">{{cite web|date=June 8, 2005 |title=Tetsuya Nomura Dengeki Interview #3 |url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/dengeki-3 |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611213907/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FDengeki-3 |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"KH-NI-PSE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kh2.co.uk/website/interviews/playstation |title=Playstation.com Europe\u2014E3 Interview |publisher=Kingdom Hearts Ultimania |accessdate=June 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418212412/http://www.kh2.co.uk/?page=NI%2FPlaystation |archivedate=April 18, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Each world varies in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney film on which it is based. The graphics of the world and characters are meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney films. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately; with few exceptions, players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.\n\nSome worlds featured in the previous games reappear, but with new and expanded areas. There are also new worlds that are introduced, including the Land of Dragons (based on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]''), Beast's Castle (''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''), Timeless River (''[[Steamboat Willie]]''), Port Royal (''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), Pride Lands (''[[The Lion King]]''), and Space Paranoids (''[[Tron]]''). Twilight Town, an original world first seen in ''Chain of Memories'', has a greater role as the introductory world. The World That Never Was is a new world that serves as the headquarters of Organization XIII.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\n===Characters===\n{{further|Characters of Kingdom Hearts}}\nThe three [[protagonist]]s of the game are [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], a 15-year-old boy chosen as a wielder of the Keyblade, a mystical key-shaped weapon that can combat darkness; [[Donald Duck]], the court magician of Disney Castle; and [[Goofy]], the captain of the Disney Castle guards.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/> Both Donald and Goofy are under orders from their missing king, [[Mickey Mouse]], to accompany Sora and his Keyblade.<ref name=\"MickeyNote\"/> which refers to Sora and his Keyblade. Other original characters include [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]] and [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]], Sora's friends from his home world of [[Universe of Kingdom Hearts#Original worlds|Destiny Islands]]; [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]], a boy who can also wield the Keyblade and is playable in the game's beginning sequence; [[Namin\u00e9]], a girl with the power to manipulate memories; and [[DiZ]], a man in red robes with a vendetta against [[Organization XIII]], who is later revealed to be Ansem the Wise, the mentor of [[Xehanort]].\n\nAs in the previous games, there are numerous appearances of characters from both Disney and Square Enix works. While some make a return from ''Kingdom Hearts'', new characters from Disney fiction are also introduced, such as [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] from ''The Lion King'' and [[Scrooge McDuck]]. [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] appears as a persistent enemy who works with the resurrected [[Maleficent (Disney)|Maleficent]]. Nearly twenty characters from ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games appear, notably [[\u0100ron|Auron]] of ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'', [[Tifa Lockhart|Tifa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', and the return of [[Squall Leonhart]], [[Cloud Strife|Cloud]], and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]]. It was stated that although the first game strictly stuck to characters [[Tetsuya Nomura]] designed, this time around they were going to \"take some risks\", implying that characters not directly designed by Nomura might make an appearance.<ref>{{cite web| first = Bryan| last = Boulette| url = http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| publisher = RPGamer| title = Nomura Divulges Kingdom Hearts II Details| accessdate = May 29, 2007| date = November 27, 2005| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030420/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| archivedate = September 30, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Other new characters to series are [[Vivi (Final Fantasy)|Vivi]] of ''[[Final Fantasy IX]]'', [[Seifer Almasy]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]''  and [[Setzer Gabbiani|Setzer]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]''.\n\nThe various worlds that Sora explores often have an optional party character from the film on which the world is based. Such party members include [[Fa Mulan]], the woman who passes as a man in order to take her ailing father's place in the army; [[Jack Sparrow]], a pirate who seeks to reclaim his ship, the [[Black Pearl]]; [[Simba]], the self-exiled lion who is the rightful king of the Pride Land; and ''[[Tron (franchise)|Tron]]'', a security program in Hollow Bastion's computer network who seeks to end the dictatorship of the Master Control Program.<ref name=\"KHII-StrategyGuide\"/>\n\nOrganization XIII, a group of powerful Nobodies\u2014the \"empty shells\" left over when a strong-hearted person becomes a Heartless\u2014introduced in ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories|Chain of Memories]]'', is established as the primary group of antagonists early on. [[Characters of Kingdom Hearts#Xemnas|Xemnas]], the leader of Organization XIII, serves as the main antagonist and [[Boss (video gaming)#Final boss|final boss]] of the game. Villains unique to the worlds are still prevalent, and are often presented as challenges that Sora's group must overcome.\n\n===Story===\nSora, Donald, and Goofy have been in [[suspended animation]] for the past year to regain their lost memories. Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town created by DiZ to merge him with his original self to restore Sora's power.<ref name=\"half of one\"/> DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town to extract Roxas. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merge with Sora.<ref name=over /> Sora, Donald, and Goofy awaken in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and [[Yen Sid]], who send them on another journey; their goal is to find Riku and uncover the Organization's plans. Afterward, Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power.<ref name=\"riku?\"/>\n\nSora travels to familiar and unfamiliar worlds, where he resolves several problems caused by Organization XIII, the Heartless, and various local villains. During a visit to Hollow Bastion, they reunite with Mickey, who explains that the Heartless \"Ansem\" they defeated is an imposter named Xehanort, whose Nobody, Xemnas, is the Organization's leader.<ref name=revelation1 /> The Organization also reveal that they seek the power of Kingdom Hearts, creating one from the hearts Sora has released from the Heartless with his Keyblade, to regain their lost hearts;<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kingdom Hearts II|developer=[[Square Enix]]|publisher=Square Enix, [[Buena Vista Games]]|date=March 28, 2006|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|version=|scene=|level=Hollow Bastion|isolang=|quote='''Sa\u00efx''': Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts.

Sora revisits the worlds to solve lingering problems and new complications while seeking a path to Organization XIII's base of operations in the World That Never Was. Throughout his endeavors, Sora is secretly aided by a hooded figure whom Sora believes to be Riku.<ref name=\"riku?\" />\n\nFollowing a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a passageway to the World That Never Was through Twilight Town, where Axel sacrifices himself to give them safe passage. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has been changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless as a result of capturing Roxas. Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor.<ref name=revelation3 /> Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. Atop of the Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to fight them. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two become trapped in the realm of darkness, where they discover a portal to the realm of light in a bottled letter sent by Kairi, allowing them to return to the Destiny Islands and reunite with their friends. In a [[post-credits scene]], Sora, Kairi, and Riku receive and reading a letter from Mickey, the contents of which are hidden from the player.<ref name=\"riku?\" />\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment plans for ''Kingdom Hearts II'' began around the completion of ''[[Kingdom Hearts Final Mix]]'', but specific details were undecided until July 2003.<ref name=\"GS-NI-Dengeki\">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/kingdomhearts2/news.html?sid=6076646| author = GameSpot Staff| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| date = October 10, 2003| title = Kingdom Hearts II's Tetsuya Nomura Q & A |accessdate=June 15, 2007}}</ref> Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel.

New voice actors included [[K\u014dki Uchiyama]] and [[Jesse McCartney]] as Roxas, Iku Nakahara and [[Brittany Snow]] as Namin\u00e9, and [[Genz\u014d Wakayama]] and [[Christopher Lee]] as DiZ.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/><ref name=\"1upvoice\">{{cite web |title=Kingdom Hearts II Voices Announced |url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3147824 |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |work=[[1UP.com]] |author=Pinckard, Jane |date=February 8, 2006 |accessdate=June 29, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016050549/http://www.1up.com/news/kingdom-hearts-voices-announced |archivedate=October 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in ''Kingdom Hearts II''. Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game, including [[Ming-Na Wen]] as Mulan, [[James Woods]] as Hades, [[Bruce Boxleitner]] as Tron, [[Chris Sarandon]] as Jack Skellington and [[Zach Braff]] as Chicken Little.<ref name=\"IGN-KHII-VoiceCast\"/> Some voice actors from the related television series or [[direct-to-video]] sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable, such as [[Robert Costanzo]] as Philoctetes rather than [[Danny DeVito]] or [[Cam Clarke]] as Simba instead of [[Matthew Broderick]]. Some characters were given new voice actors in the English version; Ansem, Aerith, Leon, Sephiroth and Hercules, who were originally voiced by [[Billy Zane]], [[Mandy Moore]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Lance Bass]], and [[Sean Astin]] respectively in the first game, were voiced by [[Richard Epcar]], [[Mena Suvari]], [[Doug Erholtz]], [[George Newbern]], and [[Tate Donovan]] (Hercules' original voice actor), and newcomer Tifa was voiced by [[Rachael Leigh Cook]].<ref name=\"1upvoice\"/>\n\n===Content editing===\n[[File:Xigbar gun comparison.png|thumb|left|200px|Xigbar's [[telescopic sight]] view and his weapons were altered from the Japanese version (top) to the English version (bottom).]]\nBesides English translation and [[language localisation|localization]], the international version of ''Kingdom Hearts II'' differs from the original Japanese version in the content of gameplay and several scenes. The [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]] boss in the ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]''-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, [[Daisy Duck]] pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.\n\n[[Organization XIII#Xigbar|Xigbar]]'s [[telescopic sight]] was changed from a [[crosshair]] and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, which is used to shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun.  The death of Organization XIII member [[Organization XIII#Axel|Axel]] was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.\n\nPort Royal, based on ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', contains the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to remove some of the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film.<ref name=\"KHII-MobyGames\"/> Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/698/698488p1.html| title = Nomura Discusses Kingdom Hearts and Future Titles| publisher = IGN| first=Anoop|last=Gantayat|date=March 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 11, 2007}}</ref> though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.\n\n===Promotion===\nAn unlockable trailer in ''Kingdom Hearts'' and ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' hinted at the possibility of a sequel.

We will strengthen the status of elected officials in the face of the un-elected bureaucracy.\n#'''Social responsibility:''' We will enact economic and medical protection for the disabled and the elderly, while integrating people with disabilities in education, society and the labor market.\n#'''Galilee and the Negev:''' We will strengthen [[the Galilee]] and [[the Negev]] with additional employment opportunities, housing, health care, tourism, culture, and transport. We will encourage capital investment and private initiatives that will strengthen human capital and allow families to settle and remain in the Galilee and the Negev.

The negotiations initially stalled, as URWP leader [[Rafi Peretz]] was unwilling to concede leadership of the list to Shaked, and disagreements arose over how many spots each of the three involved parties would receive on the list. Another subject that arose in the negotiations was whether the radical former URWP member [[Otzma Yehudit]] should be included in the new joint list.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/extremist-otzma-yehudit-still-seeking-merger-with-united-right-as-deadline-nears/|title=Extremist Otzma Yehudit still seeking merger with United Right as deadline nears|website=Times of Israel|language=en|access-date=5 August 2019|date=1 August 2019|author=Raoul Wootliff}}</ref>\n\n[[Sara Netanyahu]] (the wife of the prime minister) was recorded speaking with Rafi Peretz' wife, Michal Peretz, in an attempt to convince Peretz to retain his number one slot on the list; she was unsuccessful.

He was the first U.S. agent in South America, a member of the South Carolina legislature and the [[United States House of Representatives]], the first [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|United States Minister to Mexico]], a Unionist leader in South Carolina during the [[Nullification Crisis]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] under [[Martin Van Buren]], and a co-founder of the [[National Institute for the Promotion of Science|National Institute for the Promotion of Science and the Useful Arts]] (a predecessor of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]).\n\n==Early travels==\nJoel Roberts Poinsett was born in 1779 in Charleston, South Carolina, to a wealthy [[physician]], Elisha Poinsett, and his wife Katherine Ann Roberts. He was educated in [[Connecticut]] and Europe, gaining expertise in languages, the law, and military affairs.<ref>The standard biography is J. Fred Rippy, ''Joel R. Poinsett: Versatile American'' (Durham: Duke University Press, 1935).</ref>\n\n===Touring in Europe===\nIn 1800 Poinsett returned to Charleston hoping to pursue a military career.  His father did not want his son to be a soldier.  Hoping to entice his son to settle into the Charleston aristocracy, Poinsett had his son study law under [[Henry William DeSaussure]], a prominent lawyer of Charleston.  Poinsett was not interested in becoming a lawyer, and convinced his parents to allow him to go on an extended tour of Europe in 1801.  DeSaussure sent with him a list of law books including [[William Blackstone|Blackstone's]] ''Commentaries'' and Burn's ''Ecclesiastical Law'', just in case young Poinsett changed his mind regarding the practice of law.\n\nBeginning in 1801, Poinsett traveled the European continent.  In the spring of 1802, Poinsett left France for Italy traveling through the Alps and Switzerland.  He visited the cities of Naples and hiked up [[Mount Etna]] on the island of Sicily.  In the spring of 1803 he arrived in Switzerland and stayed at the home of [[Jacques Necker]] and his daughter, [[Madame de Stael]].  Necker, French Finance Minister from 1776 to 1781 under [[Louis XVI]], had been driven into exile by [[Napoleon I]].\n\nOn one occasion, [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], the United States minister to France, was invited for a visit while he was touring Savoy, France, and Switzerland.  Poinsett was compelled to assume the role of interpreter between the deaf Livingston and the aged Necker, whose lack of teeth made his speech almost incomprehensible.  Fortunately, Madame de Stael tactfully assumed the duty of translation for her elderly father.\n\nIn October 1803, Poinsett left Switzerland for [[Vienna, Austria]], and from there journeyed to Munich.  In December he received word that his father was dead, and that his sister, Susan, was seriously ill.  He immediately secured passage back to Charleston.  Poinsett arrived in Charleston early in 1804, months after his father had been laid to rest.  Hoping to save his sister's life, Poinsett took her on a voyage to New York, remembering how his earlier voyage to Lisbon had intensified his recovery.  Yet, upon arriving in New York City, Susan Poinsett died.   As the sole remaining heir, Poinsett inherited a small fortune in town houses and lots, plantations, bank stock, and \"English funds.\"  The entire Poinsett estate was valued at a hundred thousand dollars or more.\n\n===Travel in Russia===\n[[File:Tartaria D Europa ouro Piccola Tartaria.jpg|thumb|Map of the Russian, Tartar and Persian areas through which Joel Poinsett traveled while in Europe.]]\nPoinsett arrived in the Russian capital of [[St. Petersburg]] in November 1806.  Levett Harris, consul of the United States at St. Petersburg, and the highest American official in the country, hoped to introduce Poinsett at court to [[Alexander I of Russia|Czar Alexander]].  Learning that Poinsett was from South Carolina, the Empress asked him if he would inspect the cotton factories under her patronage.  Poinsett and Consul Harris traveled by sleigh to [[Cronstadt]] to see the factories.  Poinsett made some suggestions on improvement, which the [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)|Dowager Empress]] accepted.  Poinsett did not believe the cotton industry could be successful in Russia because of the necessity of employing [[serfs]] who received no compensation and therefore could have no interest in its prosperity.  Furthermore, he believed that the institution of serfdom made it difficult for Russia to have a merchant marine or become industrialized.\n\nIn January 1807, Czar Alexander and Poinsett dined at the Palace.  Czar Alexander attempted to entice Poinsett into the Russian civil or military service.  Poinsett was hesitant, which prompted Alexander to advise him to \"see the Empire, acquire the language, study the people\", and then decide.  Always interested in travel, Poinsett accepted the invitation and left St. Petersburg in March 1807 on a journey through southern Russia.  He was accompanied by his English friend Lord Royston and eight others.\n\nWith letters recommending them to the special care of all Russian officials, Poinsett and Royston made their way to Moscow.  They were among the last westerners to see Moscow before its burning in October 1812 by Napoleon's forces.  From Moscow they traveled to the [[Volga River]], and then by boat to [[Astrakhan]], situated at the mouth of the river.  Poinsett's company now entered the Caucasus, containing a very diverse population, and only recently acquired by Russia through conquests by Czars [[Peter the Great]] and [[Catherine the Great]].  Because of ethnic conflict, the area was extremely dangerous.  They were provided with a [[Cossack]] escort as they traveled between Tarki and Derbent, but when a Tartar dignitary claimed that this would only provoke danger, the escort was bypassed for the security of the Tartar chiefs.  This new security increased the numbers in Poinsett's company, which they believed made it less vulnerable to attack as it passed out of Russia proper.  Thus, they were joined by a Persian merchant, who was transporting young girls he had acquired in [[Circassia]] to Baku and harems in Turkey.  With a strong Persian and Kopak guard, the party left Derbent and entered the realm of the Khan of [[Kuban]].\n[[File:Russia, 1813 (part 1) (NYPL b14896507-441132).tiff|thumb|Armed Tartars on horses in 1813.]]\nWhile traveling through the Khanate, a tribal chief stole some of the horses in Poinsett's party.  Poinsett boldly decided to go out of his way to the court of the Khan in the town of Kuban to demand their return.  As there were normally never any foreigners in this place, the Khan was surprised.  Of course, he had never heard of the United States, and Poinsett did the best he could to answer all the questions the Khan had.  In order to convey the greatness of the U.S., Poinsett spoke at length on its geography.  The Khan referred to President [[Thomas Jefferson]] as the Shah of America.  Finally, Poinsett stated that the theft of his horses would reflect badly on the fair name of the Khanate.  The Khan was impressed and told Poinsett that the head of the guilty chief was his for the asking, yet since the thief had made it possible for him to accept such a distinguished visitor, perhaps a pardon might be in order.\n\nPoinsett's company traveled to [[Baku]] on the Caspian Sea.  He noted that because of the petroleum pits in the region, it had long been a spot of pilgrimage for fire-worshipers.  He became one of the earliest U.S. travelers to the Middle East, where, in 1806, the Persian khan showed him a pool of [[petroleum]], which he speculated might someday be used for fuel.<ref>Oren, M. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy--America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present'', page 49, Norton, 2007</ref>\n\nAttracted by the military movements in the Caucasus Mountains, Poinsett visited [[Erivan]], which was then besieged by the Russian Army.  After a time with the troops, Poinsett and company journeyed through the mountains of Armenia to the Black Sea.  Avoiding Constantinople because of conflict between Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the party proceeded to the Crimea, then through Ukraine, reaching Moscow late in 1807.  The trip had been hazardous and Poinsett's health was much impaired. Furthermore, of the nine who had set out on the journey the previous March, Poinsett and two others were the only survivors.\n\nUpon his return to Moscow, Czar Alexander's discussed the details of Poinsett's trip with him and offered him a position as colonel in the Russian Army.  However, news had reached Russia of the attack of the ''H.M.S. Leopard'' upon the ''Chesapeake'', and war between the United States and Great Britain seemed certain. Poinsett eagerly sought to return to his homeland.\n\nBefore leaving Russia, Poinsett met one last time with Czar Alexander, who expressed his approval of the energetic measures by the Congress of the United States to resist the maritime pretensions of Britain.  The Czar declared that Russia and the United States should maintain the same policy of respect. Poinsett again met with Foreign Minister Count [[Nikolay Rumyantsev|Romanzoff]] where the Russian disclosed to Poinsett that the Czar ardently desired to have a minister from the United States at the Russian Court.\n\n==Chile and Argentina==\n[[File:Frigate-essex-1799.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Essex (1799)|United States Frigate ''Essex'']] arrived in Valpara\u00edso, Chile in September 1813 at which time Poinsett received the first official news of the [[War of 1812]]]]\nHe served as a \"special agent\" to two South American countries from 1810 to 1814, Chile and Argentina.  President [[James Madison]]  appointed him in 1809 as Consul in General.  Poinsett was to investigate the prospects of the revolutionists, in their struggle for independence from Spain. On December 29, 1811, he reached Santiago.  The Larrain and Carrera families were jockeying for power in Chile.  By the time Poinsett arrived, the Carreras gained control under their leader, [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]].  Carrera's government was split on how to receive Poinsett.  The Tribunal del Consulado, the organization with jurisdiction over commercial matters opposed his reception on the grounds that his nomination had not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Moreover, many of the members of this group were royalists, hoping for closer relations with Spain or Britain.  Nevertheless, Poinsett received recognition as a majority wanted to establish trade relations with the U.S.\n\nThe official reception finally occurred on February 24, 1812.  Poinsett was the first accredited agent of a foreign government to reach Chile.  Poinsett's main adversary in Chile was the junta of Peru.  The Colonial Viceroy of Peru resented the Chileans' disregard for Spanish authority.  He declared the laws of the new Chilean government relative to free commerce null and void and sent privateers to enforce the old colonial system.  Seizure of ships and confiscation of cargoes followed, to the dismay of foreign traders, especially Americans. Poinsett learned of the seizure of an American whaler searching for supplies from an intercepted letter from the governor of San Carlos de Chiloe to the viceroy of Lima.  Furthermore, he received intelligence that ten other American vessels were seized at [[Talcahuano]] in the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n.   With little guidance from the Madison administration, Poinsett decided that something had to be done to halt violations of American neutral rights.\n\nPoinsett urged Chile to close its ports to Peru, but the authorities in Santiago did not feel they were strong enough to take such a step.  Instead they urged Poinsett to aid them in obtaining arms and supplies from the United States.  Although Poinsett furnished the names of certain dealers, many of them were already too involved with the conflict between the U.S. and Britain to give any attention to the Chileans.  During this time Poinsett also urged the Chileans to create a national constitution.  A commission consisting of [[Camilo Henr\u00edquez]] and six others was named for the purpose of drawing up a constitution.  The first meeting of the group was held at Poinsett's residence on July 11, 1812.\n\nThe seizure of American ships by royalist Peru continued.  Poinsett's commission stated that he was to protect all American property and provide for American citizens.  After a consultation with Carrera, Poinsett accepted a commission into the Chilean army to fight against the Spanish Royalists based in Peru.  Poinsett was later given the rank of general in Carrera's army.  He led a charge at the head of the Chilean cavalry in the [[Battle of San Carlos (1813)|Battle of San Carlos]] and secured a victory for Chile.  From there, he went with a battery of flying artillery to the Bay of Conception, where ten American vessels had been seized.  He arrived at dark near the seaport of Talcahuano, and began firing on the town.  At dawn he sent an emissary to demand the surrender of the bay to the Junta of Chile.  The Peruvian royalists surrendered on May 29, 1813.\n\nIn early September 1813, the [[USS Essex (1799)|United States Frigate ''Essex'']] arrived in Chilean waters and cleared them of English whalers and cruisers.  When Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] of the U.S.S. ''Essex'' arrived in Santiago, Poinsett received the first authoritative news of the [[War of 1812]].  He now desired more than ever to return to his home.  However, this could not happen until Commodore Porter completed his cruise of the Pacific.  Finally, as the ''Essex'' set out with Poinsett aboard, the British warships ''Phoebe'' and ''Cherub'' were spotted in the port of Valparaiso.  Commodore Porter returned to Santiago to utilize the guns of the fort there.  He also hoped the neutrality of the bay would discourage any British attack.  Captain [[James Hillyar]] of the ''Phoebe'' attacked nonetheless, and Commodore Porter was defeated.  The British decided to send their American prisoners back to the U.S. in a cartel. Poinsett was forced to stay behind in Chile.\n\nWhen Poinsett returned to Buenos Aires, he found a Junta that was very well established with a strong British influence.  He managed to negotiate a commercial agreement with the Junta by which American articles of general consumption were admitted free of duty.  As American shipping had been driven from the South Atlantic, it took some time to find passage back to the United States.  Poinsett finally secured passage aboard a vessel going to the [[Bahia]], a state in the northeastern part of Brazil.  From there he transferred to another ship bound for the [[Madeira Island]]s, located 535 miles from mainland Europe.  Poinsett finally reached Charleston on May 28, 1815.\n\n==Return to the U.S.==\nReturning to Charleston in 1815, Poinsett spent the first few months putting his personal affairs in order.  From then until 1825 Poinsett stayed in South Carolina seeking to build a reputation in his home state, and hold office.  Yet, he came to be respected as an authority on Latin American affairs.  In 1816 Poinsett received a letter from his old friend General Jose Miguel Carrera.\n\nSince Poinsett's departure, the Chilean Royalists had consolidated their hold on Chile, and after spending a year in exile in the provinces of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], Carrera came to the United States in January 1816 to stimulate interest for a revolution in Chile. Poinsett wrote Carrera back stating that he intended to urge the U.S. government to develop decisive policy regarding the Spanish colonies.  President James Madison received General Carrera warmly, but never offered him any official encouragement because he worried that seriously entertaining Carrera might jeopardize gaining [[Florida]] that was under Spanish rule.  Carrera's only hope of help came from his former comrade.\n\nIn July 1816, Poinsett traveled to New York to meet Carrera.  While there, Poinsett attempted to interest [[John Jacob Astor]], the wealthy owner of the American Fur Company, in supplying Carrera's Chilean revolutionists with weapons; however, Astor declined to get involved.  In August 1816, Poinsett was able to arrange some conferences in Philadelphia between the Chilean leader and some of Napoleon's former officers.  Among them were Marshal Emanuel Grouchy, who had commanded Napoleon's body guards during the Russian Campaign.  Poinsett also arranged a meeting between Carrera and General [[Bertrand Clausel|Bertrand Count Clausel]].  Clausel had distinguished himself in the Napoleonic Wars and was given the distinction of Peer of France by Napoleon in 1815.  Although Carrera's movement never benefited from the experience of these French officers, Poinsett did succeed in obtaining contracts with the firm D'Arcy and Didier of Philadelphia to supply arms for the expedition which Carrera was planning.\n\nOn August 29, 1816, Poinsett set out on a tour of the U.S. along with four men and one slave from Charleston, set out from Philadelphia on a tour of the West.  They made stops in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, before stopping in Lexington, Kentucky.  While in Lexington, the group stayed with Congressman [[Henry Clay]].  It is possible that in relating his experiences in Chile, Poinsett may have made quite an impression on Clay, who would distinguish himself as the biggest American supporter for [[Spanish American independence]] in the next few years.  From Lexington, the travelers made their way to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and then on to Nashville, Tennessee.  While in Nashville, Poinsett and his companions had breakfast with [[Andrew Jackson]].  Poinsett, after traversing more than two thousand miles, finally returned to Charleston in early November 1816.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:JoelPoinsettStatue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Joel Poinsett by Zan Wells (2001), Greenville, South Carolina.|upright=.6]]\nPoinsett was aware that his friends had nominated him to represent Charleston, South Carolina, in the state legislature.  In Greenville on his way back home, he learned that he had won the nomination and had a seat in the State House of Representatives. As he was beginning his first term in April 1817, the rumored position of American envoy to South America became reality. On April 25, 1817, acting Secretary of State [[Robert Rush]] offered Poinsett the position of special commissioner to South America stating, \"No one has better qualifications for this trust than yourself.\" Rush also added that he would be personally gratified by Poinsett's acceptance.\n\nNevertheless, Poinsett declined the honor.  In May, Poinsett explained to President [[James Monroe]] that he had recently accepted a seat in the legislature of South Carolina and could not resign it \"without some more important motive than this commission presents.\"   Poinsett perceived that the mission would not lead to any substantial decision for recognition and was unwilling to give up his seat in the House.  In the same letter, Poinsett offered his knowledge of South America to the service of whomever the Monroe administration appointed.\n\nPoinsett's political values mirrored those of others at the time who considered themselves [[Jeffersonian Republicans]].   One of the most important measures supported by Jeffersonian Republicans following the War of 1812 was that of federally funded [[internal improvements]].  As a member of the state legislature, this was one of Poinsett's passions.  After being re-elected to the South Carolina House in 1818, he became a member of the Committee on Internal Improvements and Waterways.\n\nPoinsett also served on the South Carolina Board of Public Works as President.  One of the main plans of this board was to link the interior of the state with the seaboard.    Another important project was the construction of a highway from Charleston through Columbia, to the northwestern border of South Carolina.  It was designed to promote interstate commerce as well as to draw commerce from eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina to Charleston.   Poinsett, a seasoned traveler, knew better than anyone the importance of good roadways.  Through his journeys in New England in 1804 and especially to the west in 1816, Poinsett understood that his country could benefit from transportation facilities.\n\n===Election to Congress===\nIn 1820, Poinsett won a seat in the United States House of Representatives for the Charleston district.  As a congressman, Poinsett continued to call for internal improvements, but he also advocated the maintenance of a strong army and navy.  In December 1823, Poinsett submitted a resolution calling upon the Committee on Naval Affairs to inquire into the expediency of authorizing the construction of ten additional sloops of war.  As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Poinsett took strong views on developments in South America.  Poinsett's political views were aligned with such nationalists as Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] and Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]].  Poinsett, like many opponents of Clay's American system, opposed the [[Tariff of 1824]].\n\n===First Minister to Mexico===\n[[File:Poinsettia MBG.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican \"flor de la noche buena,\" called in the U.S. the [[poinsettia]].|upright]]\n\nPoinsett simultaneously served as a special envoy to Mexico from 1822 to 1823, when the government of [[James Monroe]] became concerned about the stability of newly independent Mexico. Poinsett, a supporter of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], was convinced that [[republicanism]] was the only guarantee of a peaceful, free form of government for North American countries, and tried to influence the government of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], which was beginning to show signs of weakness and divisiveness.\n\nOn January 12, 1828, in Mexico City, Poinsett signed the first treaty between the United States and Mexico, the [[Treaty of Limits (Mexico\u2013United States)|Treaty of Limits]], a treaty that recognized the U.S.-Mexico border established by the 1819 [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] between Spain and the U.S.\n\nBecause some U.S. political leaders were dissatisfied with the Treaty of Limits and the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, Poinsett was sent to negotiate acquisition of new territories for the United States, including [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Upper California]], as well as parts of [[Lower California]], [[Sonora]], [[Coahuila]], and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]; but Poinsett's offer to purchase these areas was rejected by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs headed by Juan Francisco de Azc\u00e1rate.<ref>Timothy J.

He was the first U.S. agent in South America, a member of the South Carolina legislature and the [[United States House of Representatives]], the first [[United States Ambassador to Mexico|United States Minister to Mexico]], a Unionist leader in South Carolina during the [[Nullification Crisis]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] under [[Martin Van Buren]], and a co-founder of the [[National Institute for the Promotion of Science|National Institute for the Promotion of Science and the Useful Arts]] (a predecessor of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]).\n\n==Early travels==\nJoel Roberts Poinsett was born in 1779 in Charleston, South Carolina, to a wealthy [[physician]], Elisha Poinsett, and his wife Katherine Ann Roberts. He was educated in [[Connecticut]] and Europe, gaining expertise in languages, the law, and military affairs.<ref>The standard biography is J. Fred Rippy, ''Joel R. Poinsett: Versatile American'' (Durham: Duke University Press, 1935).</ref>\n\n===Touring in Europe===\nIn 1800 Poinsett returned to Charleston hoping to pursue a military career.  His father did not want his son to be a soldier.  Hoping to entice his son to settle into the Charleston aristocracy, Poinsett had his son study law under [[Henry William DeSaussure]], a prominent lawyer of Charleston.  Poinsett was not interested in becoming a lawyer, and convinced his parents to allow him to go on an extended tour of Europe in 1801.  DeSaussure sent with him a list of law books including [[William Blackstone|Blackstone's]] ''Commentaries'' and Burn's ''Ecclesiastical Law'', just in case young Poinsett changed his mind regarding the practice of law.\n\nBeginning in 1801, Poinsett traveled the European continent.  In the spring of 1802, Poinsett left France for Italy traveling through the Alps and Switzerland.  He visited the cities of Naples and hiked up [[Mount Etna]] on the island of Sicily.  In the spring of 1803 he arrived in Switzerland and stayed at the home of [[Jacques Necker]] and his daughter, [[Madame de Stael]].  Necker, French Finance Minister from 1776 to 1781 under [[Louis XVI]], had been driven into exile by [[Napoleon I]].\n\nOn one occasion, [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], the United States minister to France, was invited for a visit while he was touring Savoy, France, and Switzerland.  Poinsett was compelled to assume the role of interpreter between the deaf Livingston and the aged Necker, whose lack of teeth made his speech almost incomprehensible.  Fortunately, Madame de Stael tactfully assumed the duty of translation for her elderly father.\n\nIn October 1803, Poinsett left Switzerland for [[Vienna, Austria]], and from there journeyed to Munich.  In December he received word that his father was dead, and that his sister, Susan, was seriously ill.  He immediately secured passage back to Charleston.  Poinsett arrived in Charleston early in 1804, months after his father had been laid to rest.  Hoping to save his sister's life, Poinsett took her on a voyage to New York, remembering how his earlier voyage to Lisbon had intensified his recovery.  Yet, upon arriving in New York City, Susan Poinsett died.   As the sole remaining heir, Poinsett inherited a small fortune in town houses and lots, plantations, bank stock, and \"English funds.\"  The entire Poinsett estate was valued at a hundred thousand dollars or more.\n\n===Travel in Russia===\n[[File:Tartaria D Europa ouro Piccola Tartaria.jpg|thumb|Map of the Russian, Tartar and Persian areas through which Joel Poinsett traveled while in Europe.]]\nPoinsett arrived in the Russian capital of [[St. Petersburg]] in November 1806.  Levett Harris, consul of the United States at St. Petersburg, and the highest American official in the country, hoped to introduce Poinsett at court to [[Alexander I of Russia|Czar Alexander]].  Learning that Poinsett was from South Carolina, the Empress asked him if he would inspect the cotton factories under her patronage.  Poinsett and Consul Harris traveled by sleigh to [[Cronstadt]] to see the factories.  Poinsett made some suggestions on improvement, which the [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W\u00fcrttemberg)|Dowager Empress]] accepted.  Poinsett did not believe the cotton industry could be successful in Russia because of the necessity of employing [[serfs]] who received no compensation and therefore could have no interest in its prosperity.  Furthermore, he believed that the institution of serfdom made it difficult for Russia to have a merchant marine or become industrialized.\n\nIn January 1807, Czar Alexander and Poinsett dined at the Palace.  Czar Alexander attempted to entice Poinsett into the Russian civil or military service.  Poinsett was hesitant, which prompted Alexander to advise him to \"see the Empire, acquire the language, study the people\", and then decide.  Always interested in travel, Poinsett accepted the invitation and left St. Petersburg in March 1807 on a journey through southern Russia.  He was accompanied by his English friend Lord Royston and eight others.\n\nWith letters recommending them to the special care of all Russian officials, Poinsett and Royston made their way to Moscow.  They were among the last westerners to see Moscow before its burning in October 1812 by Napoleon's forces.  From Moscow they traveled to the [[Volga River]], and then by boat to [[Astrakhan]], situated at the mouth of the river.  Poinsett's company now entered the Caucasus, containing a very diverse population, and only recently acquired by Russia through conquests by Czars [[Peter the Great]] and [[Catherine the Great]].  Because of ethnic conflict, the area was extremely dangerous.  They were provided with a [[Cossack]] escort as they traveled between Tarki and Derbent, but when a Tartar dignitary claimed that this would only provoke danger, the escort was bypassed for the security of the Tartar chiefs.  This new security increased the numbers in Poinsett's company, which they believed made it less vulnerable to attack as it passed out of Russia proper.  Thus, they were joined by a Persian merchant, who was transporting young girls he had acquired in [[Circassia]] to Baku and harems in Turkey.  With a strong Persian and Kopak guard, the party left Derbent and entered the realm of the Khan of [[Kuban]].\n[[File:Russia, 1813 (part 1) (NYPL b14896507-441132).tiff|thumb|Armed Tartars on horses in 1813.]]\nWhile traveling through the Khanate, a tribal chief stole some of the horses in Poinsett's party.  Poinsett boldly decided to go out of his way to the court of the Khan in the town of Kuban to demand their return.  As there were normally never any foreigners in this place, the Khan was surprised.  Of course, he had never heard of the United States, and Poinsett did the best he could to answer all the questions the Khan had.  In order to convey the greatness of the U.S., Poinsett spoke at length on its geography.  The Khan referred to President [[Thomas Jefferson]] as the Shah of America.  Finally, Poinsett stated that the theft of his horses would reflect badly on the fair name of the Khanate.  The Khan was impressed and told Poinsett that the head of the guilty chief was his for the asking, yet since the thief had made it possible for him to accept such a distinguished visitor, perhaps a pardon might be in order.\n\nPoinsett's company traveled to [[Baku]] on the Caspian Sea.  He noted that because of the petroleum pits in the region, it had long been a spot of pilgrimage for fire-worshipers.  He became one of the earliest U.S. travelers to the Middle East, where, in 1806, the Persian khan showed him a pool of [[petroleum]], which he speculated might someday be used for fuel.<ref>Oren, M. ''Power, Faith, and Fantasy--America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present'', page 49, Norton, 2007</ref>\n\nAttracted by the military movements in the Caucasus Mountains, Poinsett visited [[Erivan]], which was then besieged by the Russian Army.  After a time with the troops, Poinsett and company journeyed through the mountains of Armenia to the Black Sea.  Avoiding Constantinople because of conflict between Russia and the [[Ottoman Empire]], the party proceeded to the Crimea, then through Ukraine, reaching Moscow late in 1807.  The trip had been hazardous and Poinsett's health was much impaired. Furthermore, of the nine who had set out on the journey the previous March, Poinsett and two others were the only survivors.\n\nUpon his return to Moscow, Czar Alexander's discussed the details of Poinsett's trip with him and offered him a position as colonel in the Russian Army.  However, news had reached Russia of the attack of the ''H.M.S. Leopard'' upon the ''Chesapeake'', and war between the United States and Great Britain seemed certain. Poinsett eagerly sought to return to his homeland.\n\nBefore leaving Russia, Poinsett met one last time with Czar Alexander, who expressed his approval of the energetic measures by the Congress of the United States to resist the maritime pretensions of Britain.  The Czar declared that Russia and the United States should maintain the same policy of respect. Poinsett again met with Foreign Minister Count [[Nikolay Rumyantsev|Romanzoff]] where the Russian disclosed to Poinsett that the Czar ardently desired to have a minister from the United States at the Russian Court.\n\n==Chile and Argentina==\n[[File:Frigate-essex-1799.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Essex (1799)|United States Frigate ''Essex'']] arrived in Santiago, Chile in September 1813 at which time Poinsett received the first official news of the [[War of 1812]]]]\nHe served as a \"special agent\" to two South American countries from 1810 to 1814, Chile and Argentina.  President [[James Madison]]  appointed him in 1809 as Consul in General.  Poinsett was to investigate the prospects of the revolutionists, in their struggle for independence from Spain. On December 29, 1811, he reached Santiago.  The Larrain and Carrera families were jockeying for power in Chile.  By the time Poinsett arrived, the Carreras gained control under their leader, [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]].  Carrera's government was split on how to receive Poinsett.  The Tribunal del Consulado, the organization with jurisdiction over commercial matters opposed his reception on the grounds that his nomination had not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  Moreover, many of the members of this group were royalists, hoping for closer relations with Spain or Britain.  Nevertheless, Poinsett received recognition as a majority wanted to establish trade relations with the U.S.\n\nThe official reception finally occurred on February 24, 1812.  Poinsett was the first accredited agent of a foreign government to reach Chile.  Poinsett's main adversary in Chile was the junta of Peru.  The Colonial Viceroy of Peru resented the Chileans' disregard for Spanish authority.  He declared the laws of the new Chilean government relative to free commerce null and void and sent privateers to enforce the old colonial system.  Seizure of ships and confiscation of cargoes followed, to the dismay of foreign traders, especially Americans. Poinsett learned of the seizure of an American whaler searching for supplies from an intercepted letter from the governor of San Carlos de Chiloe to the viceroy of Lima.  Furthermore, he received intelligence that ten other American vessels were seized at [[Talcahuano]] in the Bay of Concepci\u00f3n.   With little guidance from the Madison administration, Poinsett decided that something had to be done to halt violations of American neutral rights.\n\nPoinsett urged Chile to close its ports to Peru, but the authorities in Santiago did not feel they were strong enough to take such a step.  Instead they urged Poinsett to aid them in obtaining arms and supplies from the United States.  Although Poinsett furnished the names of certain dealers, many of them were already too involved with the conflict between the U.S. and Britain to give any attention to the Chileans.  During this time Poinsett also urged the Chileans to create a national constitution.  A commission consisting of [[Camilo Henr\u00edquez]] and six others was named for the purpose of drawing up a constitution.  The first meeting of the group was held at Poinsett's residence on July 11, 1812.\n\nThe seizure of American ships by royalist Peru continued.  Poinsett's commission stated that he was to protect all American property and provide for American citizens.  After a consultation with Carrera, Poinsett accepted a commission into the Chilean army to fight against the Spanish Royalists based in Peru.  Poinsett was later given the rank of general in Carrera's army.  He led a charge at the head of the Chilean cavalry in the [[Battle of San Carlos (1813)|Battle of San Carlos]] and secured a victory for Chile.  From there, he went with a battery of flying artillery to the Bay of Conception, where ten American vessels had been seized.  He arrived at dark near the seaport of Talcahuano, and began firing on the town.  At dawn he sent an emissary to demand the surrender of the bay to the Junta of Chile.  The Peruvian royalists surrendered on May 29, 1813.\n\nIn early September 1813, the [[USS Essex (1799)|United States Frigate ''Essex'']] arrived in Chilean waters and cleared them of English whalers and cruisers.  When Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] of the U.S.S. ''Essex'' arrived in Santiago, Poinsett received the first authoritative news of the [[War of 1812]].  He now desired more than ever to return to his home.  However, this could not happen until Commodore Porter completed his cruise of the Pacific.  Finally, as the ''Essex'' set out with Poinsett aboard, the British warships ''Phoebe'' and ''Cherub'' were spotted in the port of Valparaiso.  Commodore Porter returned to Santiago to utilize the guns of the fort there.  He also hoped the neutrality of the bay would discourage any British attack.  Captain [[James Hillyar]] of the ''Phoebe'' attacked nonetheless, and Commodore Porter was defeated.  The British decided to send their American prisoners back to the U.S. in a cartel. Poinsett was forced to stay behind in Chile.\n\nWhen Poinsett returned to Buenos Aires, he found a Junta that was very well established with a strong British influence.  He managed to negotiate a commercial agreement with the Junta by which American articles of general consumption were admitted free of duty.  As American shipping had been driven from the South Atlantic, it took some time to find passage back to the United States.  Poinsett finally secured passage aboard a vessel going to the [[Bahia]], a state in the northeastern part of Brazil.  From there he transferred to another ship bound for the [[Madeira Island]]s, located 535 miles from mainland Europe.  Poinsett finally reached Charleston on May 28, 1815.\n\n==Return to the U.S.==\nReturning to Charleston in 1815, Poinsett spent the first few months putting his personal affairs in order.  From then until 1825 Poinsett stayed in South Carolina seeking to build a reputation in his home state, and hold office.  Yet, he came to be respected as an authority on Latin American affairs.  In 1816 Poinsett received a letter from his old friend General Jose Miguel Carrera.\n\nSince Poinsett's departure, the Chilean Royalists had consolidated their hold on Chile, and after spending a year in exile in the provinces of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], Carrera came to the United States in January 1816 to stimulate interest for a revolution in Chile. Poinsett wrote Carrera back stating that he intended to urge the U.S. government to develop decisive policy regarding the Spanish colonies.  President James Madison received General Carrera warmly, but never offered him any official encouragement because he worried that seriously entertaining Carrera might jeopardize gaining [[Florida]] that was under Spanish rule.  Carrera's only hope of help came from his former comrade.\n\nIn July 1816, Poinsett traveled to New York to meet Carrera.  While there, Poinsett attempted to interest [[John Jacob Astor]], the wealthy owner of the American Fur Company, in supplying Carrera's Chilean revolutionists with weapons; however, Astor declined to get involved.  In August 1816, Poinsett was able to arrange some conferences in Philadelphia between the Chilean leader and some of Napoleon's former officers.  Among them were Marshal Emanuel Grouchy, who had commanded Napoleon's body guards during the Russian Campaign.  Poinsett also arranged a meeting between Carrera and General [[Bertrand Clausel|Bertrand Count Clausel]].  Clausel had distinguished himself in the Napoleonic Wars and was given the distinction of Peer of France by Napoleon in 1815.  Although Carrera's movement never benefited from the experience of these French officers, Poinsett did succeed in obtaining contracts with the firm D'Arcy and Didier of Philadelphia to supply arms for the expedition which Carrera was planning.\n\nOn August 29, 1816, Poinsett set out on a tour of the U.S. along with four men and one slave from Charleston, set out from Philadelphia on a tour of the West.  They made stops in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, before stopping in Lexington, Kentucky.  While in Lexington, the group stayed with Congressman [[Henry Clay]].  It is possible that in relating his experiences in Chile, Poinsett may have made quite an impression on Clay, who would distinguish himself as the biggest American supporter for [[Spanish American independence]] in the next few years.  From Lexington, the travelers made their way to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and then on to Nashville, Tennessee.  While in Nashville, Poinsett and his companions had breakfast with [[Andrew Jackson]].  Poinsett, after traversing more than two thousand miles, finally returned to Charleston in early November 1816.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:JoelPoinsettStatue.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Joel Poinsett by Zan Wells (2001), Greenville, South Carolina.|upright=.6]]\nPoinsett was aware that his friends had nominated him to represent Charleston, South Carolina, in the state legislature.  In Greenville on his way back home, he learned that he had won the nomination and had a seat in the State House of Representatives. As he was beginning his first term in April 1817, the rumored position of American envoy to South America became reality. On April 25, 1817, acting Secretary of State [[Robert Rush]] offered Poinsett the position of special commissioner to South America stating, \"No one has better qualifications for this trust than yourself.\" Rush also added that he would be personally gratified by Poinsett's acceptance.\n\nNevertheless, Poinsett declined the honor.  In May, Poinsett explained to President [[James Monroe]] that he had recently accepted a seat in the legislature of South Carolina and could not resign it \"without some more important motive than this commission presents.\"   Poinsett perceived that the mission would not lead to any substantial decision for recognition and was unwilling to give up his seat in the House.  In the same letter, Poinsett offered his knowledge of South America to the service of whomever the Monroe administration appointed.\n\nPoinsett's political values mirrored those of others at the time who considered themselves [[Jeffersonian Republicans]].   One of the most important measures supported by Jeffersonian Republicans following the War of 1812 was that of federally funded [[internal improvements]].  As a member of the state legislature, this was one of Poinsett's passions.  After being re-elected to the South Carolina House in 1818, he became a member of the Committee on Internal Improvements and Waterways.\n\nPoinsett also served on the South Carolina Board of Public Works as President.  One of the main plans of this board was to link the interior of the state with the seaboard.    Another important project was the construction of a highway from Charleston through Columbia, to the northwestern border of South Carolina.  It was designed to promote interstate commerce as well as to draw commerce from eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina to Charleston.   Poinsett, a seasoned traveler, knew better than anyone the importance of good roadways.  Through his journeys in New England in 1804 and especially to the west in 1816, Poinsett understood that his country could benefit from transportation facilities.\n\n===Election to Congress===\nIn 1820, Poinsett won a seat in the United States House of Representatives for the Charleston district.  As a congressman, Poinsett continued to call for internal improvements, but he also advocated the maintenance of a strong army and navy.  In December 1823, Poinsett submitted a resolution calling upon the Committee on Naval Affairs to inquire into the expediency of authorizing the construction of ten additional sloops of war.  As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Poinsett took strong views on developments in South America.  Poinsett's political views were aligned with such nationalists as Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] and Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]].  Poinsett, like many opponents of Clay's American system, opposed the [[Tariff of 1824]].\n\n===First Minister to Mexico===\n[[File:Poinsettia MBG.jpg|thumb|right|Mexican \"flor de la noche buena,\" called in the U.S. the [[poinsettia]].|upright]]\n\nPoinsett simultaneously served as a special envoy to Mexico from 1822 to 1823, when the government of [[James Monroe]] became concerned about the stability of newly independent Mexico. Poinsett, a supporter of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], was convinced that [[republicanism]] was the only guarantee of a peaceful, free form of government for North American countries, and tried to influence the government of [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], which was beginning to show signs of weakness and divisiveness.\n\nOn January 12, 1828, in Mexico City, Poinsett signed the first treaty between the United States and Mexico, the [[Treaty of Limits (Mexico\u2013United States)|Treaty of Limits]], a treaty that recognized the U.S.-Mexico border established by the 1819 [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] between Spain and the U.S.\n\nBecause some U.S. political leaders were dissatisfied with the Treaty of Limits and the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, Poinsett was sent to negotiate acquisition of new territories for the United States, including [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Upper California]], as well as parts of [[Lower California]], [[Sonora]], [[Coahuila]], and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]; but Poinsett's offer to purchase these areas was rejected by the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs headed by Juan Francisco de Azc\u00e1rate.<ref>Timothy J.

If the grounding considerations in this paper are valid, then this expectation is hopelessly modular and there is really only one viable route from sense to symbols: from the ground up. A free-floating symbolic level like the software level of a computer will never be reached by this route (or vice versa) \u2013 nor is it clear why we should even try to reach such a level, since it looks as if getting there would just amount to uprooting our symbols from their intrinsic meanings (thereby merely reducing ourselves to the functional equivalent of a programmable computer).\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harnad | first1 = S | year = 1990 | title = The Symbol Grounding Problem | journal = Physica D | volume = 42 | issue = 1\u20133| pages = 335\u2013346 | doi=10.1016/0167-2789(90)90087-6| bibcode = 1990PhyD...42..335H | arxiv = cs/9906002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Modern artificial general intelligence research===\nArtificial general intelligence{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} (AGI) describes research that aims to create machines capable of general intelligent action.

The first university course was given in 2010 and 2011 at Plovdiv University, Bulgaria by Todor Arnaudov. MIT presented a course in AGI in 2018, organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers. However, as yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''<ref name=\"K\">{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630032301/http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html |date=30 June 2011 }} where he defines strong AI as \"machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence.\"</ref> (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nHowever, most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body).

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers in emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?'

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]]. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that \"I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way.\" [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet

The first summer school in AGI was organized in Xiamen, China in 2009 by the Xiamen university's Artificial Brain Laboratory and OpenCog. The first university course was given in 2010 and 2011 at Plovdiv University, Bulgaria by Todor Arnaudov. MIT presented a course in AGI in 2018, organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers. However, as yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]]. The research is extremely diverse and often pioneering in nature. In the introduction to his book,{{sfn|Goertzel|Pennachin|2006}} Goertzel says that estimates of the time needed before a truly flexible AGI is built vary from 10 years to over a century, but the consensus in the AGI research community seems to be that the timeline discussed by [[Ray Kurzweil]] in ''[[The Singularity is Near]]''<ref name=\"K\">{{Harv|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} or see [http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html Advanced Human Intelligence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630032301/http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2005/08/advanced_human_.html |date=30 June 2011 }} where he defines strong AI as \"machine intelligence with the full range of human intelligence.\"</ref> (i.e. between 2015 and 2045) is plausible.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nHowever, most mainstream AI researchers doubt that progress will be this rapid.{{citation_needed|date=January 2017}} Organizations explicitly pursuing AGI include the Swiss AI lab [[IDSIA]],{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nnaisense,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Markoff|first1=John|title=When A.I.

A low-level brain model is built by [[brain scanning|scanning]] and [[Brain mapping|mapping]] a biological brain in detail and copying its state into a computer system or another computational device. The computer runs a [[computer simulation|simulation]] model so faithful to the original that it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain, or for all practical purposes, indistinguishably.<ref name=Roadmap>\n{{Harvnb|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}. \"The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.\"</ref> Whole brain emulation is discussed in [[computational neuroscience]] and [[neuroinformatics]], in the context of [[brain simulation]] for medical research purposes. It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.\n\nThe actual complexity of modeling biological neurons has been explored in [[OpenWorm|OpenWorm project]] that was aimed on complete simulation of a worm that has only 302 neurons in its neural network (among about 1000 cells in total). The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body). Goertzel{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} proposes virtual embodiment (like in ''[[Second Life]]''), but it is not yet known whether this would be sufficient.\n\nDesktop computers using microprocessors capable of more than 10<sup>9</sup> cps (Kurzweil's non-standard unit \"computations per second\", see above) have been available since 2005.

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain in computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously, people can then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right? Wrong. If a superior alien civilisation sent us a message saying, 'We'll arrive in a few decades,' would we just reply, 'OK, call us when you get here{{endash}}we'll leave the lights on?'

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]]. [[Gordon Moore]], the original proponent of [[Moore's Law]], declares that \"I am a skeptic. I don't believe (a technological singularity) is likely to happen, at least for a long time. And I don't know why I feel that way.\" [[Baidu]] Vice President [[Andrew Ng]] states AI existential risk is \"like worrying about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the planet

Cr\u00eapes are usually of two types: ''sweet cr\u00eapes'' (''cr\u00eapes sucr\u00e9es'') and ''savoury [[galette]]s'' (''cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es''). Cr\u00eapes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to [[flamb\u00e9]]ed [[Cr\u00eape Suzette|cr\u00eapes Suzette]] or elaborate savoury [[galette]]s. While cr\u00eapes are often associated with [[Brittany]], a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and many parts of Europe, North Africa, [[Lebanon]], Brazil and Nepal.\n\n==Etymology==\nCr\u00eapes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"frying pan\", which, in English, is literally translated to Pancakes.<ref>[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3]</ref>  The French term \"cr\u00eape\" derives from the Latin ''crispa'', meaning with \"creases\".  The name \"galette\" came from the French word ''galet'' (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\n==Traditions==\nIn France and Belgium, cr\u00eapes are traditionally served on [[Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur''), February 2nd. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Cr\u00eapes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Cr\u00eapes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Cr\u00eape Day\", \"National Cr\u00eape Day\", or \"day of the Cr\u00eape\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr\u00eapes. The belief was that catching the cr\u00eape with a [[frying pan]] after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Clay\n | first = Xanthe\n | title = With a flame in your art\n | work = The Daily Telegraph\n | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2007/02/17/nosplit/edxanthe117.xml\n | date = 17 February 2007\n | access-date = 25 April 2008\n| location=London}}\n</ref><ref name=\"redmond\">Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012).

Academic Search Complete.</ref>\n\n== Types of cr\u00eape ==\nSweet cr\u00eapes are generally made with [[wheat flour]] (''farine de froment''). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of [[breakfast]] or as a [[dessert]]. Common fillings include [[Nutella]] spread, [[preserves]], sugar (granulated or powdered), [[maple syrup]], [[golden syrup]], [[lemon juice]], [[whipped cream]], [[fruit spread]]s, [[custard]], and sliced soft fruits or [[confiture]].\n\nSavory cr\u00eapes are made with non-wheat flours such as [[buckwheat]]. A normal savoury cr\u00eape recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alfaro |first1=Danilo |title=Sweet or Savory Basic Crepe Recipe |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-crepe-recipe-sweet-or-savory-995317 |website=The Spruce Eats |publisher=Dotdash |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Batter made from buckwheat flour is [[gluten]]-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or [[Food intolerance|intolerance]] to eat this type of cr\u00eape. Common savoury fillings for cr\u00eapes served for [[lunch]] or [[dinner]] are cheese, ham, and eggs, [[ratatouille]], mushrooms, [[artichoke]] (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\n[[Batter (cooking)|Batter]]s can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.<ref>\"Wrap it up in a cr\u00eape; Thin pancakes work in savoury or sweet dishes.\" Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia). (24 April 2013 Wednesday) LexisNexis Academic.</ref>  Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the cr\u00eape and served with the edges partially folded over the centre.\nAn Indian variety of the cr\u00eape uses a multi-grain flour called \"bhajanee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalipeeth |website=Wikipedia |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, eggs, [[Curd|curd]], and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called  [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n==Making batter==\nIn order to make an evenly thin cr\u00eape, it is crucial to have a batter without lumps. After whisking the batter, it is best to let it rest for half an hour, or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comsol.nl/blogs/finding-the-best-way-to-make-crepes-with-fluid-dynamics-research/|title=Finding the Best Way to Make Cr\u00eapes with Fluid Dynamics Research|date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eaperies==\n[[File:Picswiss BS-55-89.jpg|thumb|A small cr\u00eaperie]]\n[[File:Creperie du Ciel \u00e0 M\u00fcnster.JPG|thumb|Cr\u00eaperie in Germany]]\n\nA '''cr\u00eaperie''' may be a [[Take-out|takeaway]] restaurant or stall, serving cr\u00eapes as a form of fast food or [[street food]], or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf\u00e9.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Creperie Cafe|url=http://www.lacreperiecafe.net/|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCr\u00eaperies are typical in France, especially in [[Brittany]]; however, cr\u00eaperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a cr\u00eape may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr\u00eaperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as [[baguette]]s.

(1984), ''Larousse gastronomique'' (French edition), Paris: Librairie Larousse.</ref>\n\nEnglish pancakes are similar to wheat flour cr\u00eapes and are served with golden syrup or lemon juice and sugar. [[Swedish pancake]]s, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to French cr\u00eapes. In some of the Nordic countries, cr\u00eapes are served with jam or fruit, especially [[Vaccinium_vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and r\u00e4isk\u00e4le in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] which resemble the French cr\u00eapes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup. The Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl\u00e4ttar/lettu, which resemble tiny English pancakes, are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but are baked in the oven and include fried pork in the batter (fl\u00e4skpannkaka). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r\u00e5rakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is the saffron pancake from [[Gotland]] which is made with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron|saffron]] and rice and baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special Swedish pancake is the ''[[\u00e4ggakaka]]'' (eggcake), also called ''[[\u00c4ggakaka|sk\u00e5nsk \u00e4ggakaka]]'' (Scanian eggcake)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sk\u00e5nsk egg cake |url=http://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-main-courses/447-egg-cake |website=Swedish Food.com |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is much thicker and more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1\u00bd to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically [[bilberry]] jam) or sugar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:49ers flapjack OHP.jpg|thumb|right|A plate of 49er flapjacks]]\nThe '''49er flapjack''' is a [[sourdough]] cr\u00eape which is popular in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-16/news/ol-43368_1_original-pancake-house |title=Why They Sell Like Hot Cakes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 March 1995 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the [[California Gold Rush]]. Because it is similar to a Swedish pancake, the 49er is sometimes served with [[lingonberry]] sauce, although most often it is rolled up with butter and powdered sugar, or served open-faced and topped with maple syrup.\n\nCherry Kijafa Cr\u00eapes are also common in the United States and are made with a traditional cr\u00eape base, but filled with cherries simmered in a [[Kijafa]] wine sauce.<ref>Pancake House (2007). \"Cherry Kijafa Crepes\"; retrieved from http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/phm_crepes2.html.</ref>\n\n''Cr\u00eape dentelle'' is a crispy biscuit made with a very thin layer of cr\u00eape folded in a cigar shape and then baked.

This is a kind of cr\u00eape made in Asturias, Spain.]]\n\nIn [[norwegian language|Norwegian]], cr\u00eapes are called ''pannekake'', in most [[German language|German]] regions ''Pfannkuchen''. In [[swedish language|Swedish]], a cr\u00eape is called ''pannkaka'' in southern regions while being called ''pl\u00e4ttar'' in the north, in [[danish language|Danish]], ''pandekager'' (\"pancakes\"), in Icelandic it is called ''p\u00f6nnukaka'', in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] a cr\u00eape is called either ''ohukainen'' or ''lettu'' or ''r\u00e4isk\u00e4le'', in [[Greek language|Greek]] it is krepa (\u039a\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1), in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is a ''[[pannenkoek]]'' or ''flensje'', and in [[Afrikaans]] a ''pannekoek'', which is usually served with [[cinnamon]] and sugar. In the Spanish regions of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]], they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called ''filloas'', and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called ''fayueles'' or ''frixuelos'', and in [[Turkey]], ''ak\u0131tma.''\n\nIn areas of [[central Europe]], formerly belonging to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr\u00eape that in [[Austro-Bavarian]] is called ''[[Palatschinken]]''; in {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}; and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}; in {{lang-sk|palacinka}}. In the Balkan countries, ''pala\u010dinka'' or ''palla\u00e7inka'' may be eaten with fruit jam, [[quark cheese]], sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream [[Nutella]], while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in pala\u010dinci are called \"Pala\u010dinkara\" in the region. In [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the [[Blini|blintz]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians ''[[palacsinta]]'', which it derives from the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'', which comes in turn from classical Latin ''placenta'' (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'' is more similar to a pie, and the cr\u00eapes are actually called ''cl\u0103tit\u0103''.\n\nCr\u00eapes have also long been popular in [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr\u00eaperies. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], they are called ''panqueques'' and are often eaten with [[dulce de leche]]. Various other French foods such as cr\u00eapes, [[Souffl\u00e9|souffl\u00e9s]], and [[quiche]] have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.<ref>Benenson, R. (1984). Dining in America. Editorial research reports 1984 (Vol. I). Washington, DC: CQ Press.</ref> Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making cr\u00eapes but they have also put their own spin on the cr\u00eape with new types such as the hamburger and pizza cr\u00eape.  In Mexico, cr\u00eapes are known as ''crepas'', and were introduced during the 19th century by the French <ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-del-Villar, Miguel Angel and Ruiz-Naufal,  V\u00edctor M., ''Mesa Mexicana'' (1993), Fundaci\u00f3n Cultural Bancomer, {{ISBN|9789686084948}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hursh |first=Karen |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2139-the-french-influence-on-mexican-cooking-la-comida-afrancescada |title=The French Influence On Mexican Cooking |work=Mexconnect.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> and are typically served either as a sweet dessert when filled with ''[[cajeta]]'' (similar to [[dulce de leche]]), or as a savoury dish when filled with ''Huitlacoche'' ([[corn smut]]), which is considered a delicacy.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], a unique native cr\u00eape recipe is the ''[[Daral (food)|daral]]'' which is made from ground [[glutinous rice]] and [[coconut milk]] batter (''[[galapong]]'').

Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, cr\u00eapes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the [[Orthodox church]]. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of cr\u00eapes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for [[kefir]]. Furthermore, different oils can be added or substituted.  Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with [[caviar]], cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \n<ref>{{cite web|last=Nesterova |first=Maria |url=http://eurokulture.missouri.edu/buttery-crepes-of-deliciousness-and-other-stuff/ |title=Maslenitsa, another Russian festival you\u2019ve probably never heard of |work=Eurokulture.missouri.edu |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cr\u00eaperies and cr\u00eape franchises, some cr\u00eape manufacturers use modern equipment to produce cr\u00eapes in bulk.\n\n[[File:Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape served in cr\u00eaperie near the Pantheon in Paris, France]]\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr\u00eape made of fermented [[rice]] [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is called a [[dosa]], which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a cr\u00eape made of [[gram flour]] is called \"Pudlaa\" or \"Poodla\", with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called \"patibola\" and is sweet in taste due to milk, [[jaggery]], or sugar.

Cr\u00eapes are usually of two types: ''sweet cr\u00eapes'' (''cr\u00eapes sucr\u00e9es'') and ''savoury [[galette]]s'' (''cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es''). Cr\u00eapes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to [[flamb\u00e9]]ed [[Cr\u00eape Suzette|cr\u00eapes Suzette]] or elaborate savoury [[galette]]s. While cr\u00eapes are often associated with [[Brittany]], a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and many parts of Europe, North Africa, [[Lebanon]], Brazil and Argentina.\n\n==Etymology==\nCr\u00eapes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"frying pan\", which, in English, is literally translated to Pancakes.<ref>[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3]</ref>  The French term \"cr\u00eape\" derives from the Latin ''crispa'', meaning with \"creases\".  The name \"galette\" came from the French word ''galet'' (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\n==Traditions==\nIn France and Belgium, cr\u00eapes are traditionally served on [[Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur''), February 2nd. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Cr\u00eapes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Cr\u00eapes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Cr\u00eape Day\", \"National Cr\u00eape Day\", or \"day of the Cr\u00eape\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr\u00eapes. The belief was that catching the cr\u00eape with a [[frying pan]] after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Clay\n | first = Xanthe\n | title = With a flame in your art\n | work = The Daily Telegraph\n | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2007/02/17/nosplit/edxanthe117.xml\n | date = 17 February 2007\n | access-date = 25 April 2008\n| location=London}}\n</ref><ref name=\"redmond\">Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012).

Academic Search Complete.</ref>\n\n== Types of cr\u00eape ==\nSweet cr\u00eapes are generally made with [[wheat flour]] (''farine de froment''). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of [[breakfast]] or as a [[dessert]]. Common fillings include [[Nutella]] spread, [[preserves]], sugar (granulated or powdered), [[maple syrup]], [[golden syrup]], [[lemon juice]], [[whipped cream]], [[fruit spread]]s, [[custard]], and sliced soft fruits or [[confiture]].\n\nSavory cr\u00eapes are made with non-wheat flours such as [[buckwheat]]. A normal savoury cr\u00eape recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alfaro |first1=Danilo |title=Sweet or Savory Basic Crepe Recipe |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-crepe-recipe-sweet-or-savory-995317 |website=The Spruce Eats |publisher=Dotdash |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Batter made from buckwheat flour is [[gluten]]-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or [[Food intolerance|intolerance]] to eat this type of cr\u00eape. Common savoury fillings for cr\u00eapes served for [[lunch]] or [[dinner]] are cheese, ham, and eggs, [[ratatouille]], mushrooms, [[artichoke]] (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\n[[Batter (cooking)|Batter]]s can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.<ref>\"Wrap it up in a cr\u00eape; Thin pancakes work in savoury or sweet dishes.\" Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia). (24 April 2013 Wednesday) LexisNexis Academic.</ref>  Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the cr\u00eape and served with the edges partially folded over the centre.\nAn Indian variety of the cr\u00eape uses a multi-grain flour called \"bhajanee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalipeeth |website=Wikipedia |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, eggs, [[Curd|curd]], and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called  [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n==Making batter==\nIn order to make an evenly thin cr\u00eape, it is crucial to have a batter without lumps. After whisking the batter, it is best to let it rest for half an hour, or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comsol.nl/blogs/finding-the-best-way-to-make-crepes-with-fluid-dynamics-research/|title=Finding the Best Way to Make Cr\u00eapes with Fluid Dynamics Research|date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eaperies==\n[[File:Picswiss BS-55-89.jpg|thumb|A small cr\u00eaperie]]\n[[File:Creperie du Ciel \u00e0 M\u00fcnster.JPG|thumb|Cr\u00eaperie in Germany]]\n\nA '''cr\u00eaperie''' may be a [[Take-out|takeaway]] restaurant or stall, serving cr\u00eapes as a form of fast food or [[street food]], or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf\u00e9.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Creperie Cafe|url=http://www.lacreperiecafe.net/|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCr\u00eaperies are typical in France, especially in [[Brittany]]; however, cr\u00eaperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a cr\u00eape may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr\u00eaperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as [[baguette]]s.

(1984), ''Larousse gastronomique'' (French edition), Paris: Librairie Larousse.</ref>\n\nEnglish pancakes are similar to wheat flour cr\u00eapes and are served with golden syrup or lemon juice and sugar. [[Swedish pancake]]s, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to French cr\u00eapes. In some of the Nordic countries, cr\u00eapes are served with jam or fruit, especially [[Vaccinium_vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and r\u00e4isk\u00e4le in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] which resemble the French cr\u00eapes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup. The Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl\u00e4ttar/lettu, which resemble tiny English pancakes, are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but are baked in the oven and include fried pork in the batter (fl\u00e4skpannkaka). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r\u00e5rakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is the saffron pancake from [[Gotland]] which is made with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron|saffron]] and rice and baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special Swedish pancake is the ''[[\u00e4ggakaka]]'' (eggcake), also called ''[[\u00c4ggakaka|sk\u00e5nsk \u00e4ggakaka]]'' (Scanian eggcake)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sk\u00e5nsk egg cake |url=http://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-main-courses/447-egg-cake |website=Swedish Food.com |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is much thicker and more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1\u00bd to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically [[bilberry]] jam) or sugar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:49ers flapjack OHP.jpg|thumb|right|A plate of 49er flapjacks]]\nThe '''49er flapjack''' is a [[sourdough]] cr\u00eape which is popular in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-16/news/ol-43368_1_original-pancake-house |title=Why They Sell Like Hot Cakes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 March 1995 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the [[California Gold Rush]]. Because it is similar to a Swedish pancake, the 49er is sometimes served with [[lingonberry]] sauce, although most often it is rolled up with butter and powdered sugar, or served open-faced and topped with maple syrup.\n\nCherry Kijafa Cr\u00eapes are also common in the United States and are made with a traditional cr\u00eape base, but filled with cherries simmered in a [[Kijafa]] wine sauce.<ref>Pancake House (2007). \"Cherry Kijafa Crepes\"; retrieved from http://www.originalpancakehouse.com/phm_crepes2.html.</ref>\n\n''Cr\u00eape dentelle'' is a crispy biscuit made with a very thin layer of cr\u00eape folded in a cigar shape and then baked.

This is a kind of cr\u00eape made in Asturias, Spain.]]\n\nIn [[norwegian language|Norwegian]], cr\u00eapes are called ''pannekake'', in most [[German language|German]] regions ''Pfannkuchen''. In [[swedish language|Swedish]], a cr\u00eape is called ''pannkaka'' in southern regions while being called ''pl\u00e4ttar'' in the north, in [[danish language|Danish]], ''pandekager'' (\"pancakes\"), in Icelandic it is called ''p\u00f6nnukaka'', in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] a cr\u00eape is called either ''ohukainen'' or ''lettu'' or ''r\u00e4isk\u00e4le'', in [[Greek language|Greek]] it is krepa (\u039a\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1), in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is a ''[[pannenkoek]]'' or ''flensje'', and in [[Afrikaans]] a ''pannekoek'', which is usually served with [[cinnamon]] and sugar. In the Spanish regions of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]], they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called ''filloas'', and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called ''fayueles'' or ''frixuelos'', and in [[Turkey]], ''ak\u0131tma.''\n\nIn areas of [[central Europe]], formerly belonging to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr\u00eape that in [[Austro-Bavarian]] is called ''[[Palatschinken]]''; in {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}; and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}; in {{lang-sk|palacinka}}. In the Balkan countries, ''pala\u010dinka'' or ''palla\u00e7inka'' may be eaten with fruit jam, [[quark cheese]], sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream [[Nutella]], while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in pala\u010dinci are called \"Pala\u010dinkara\" in the region. In [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the [[Blini|blintz]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians ''[[palacsinta]]'', which it derives from the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'', which comes in turn from classical Latin ''placenta'' (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'' is more similar to a pie, and the cr\u00eapes are actually called ''cl\u0103tit\u0103''.\n\nCr\u00eapes have also long been popular in [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr\u00eaperies. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], they are called ''panqueques'' and are often eaten with [[dulce de leche]]. Various other French foods such as cr\u00eapes, [[Souffl\u00e9|souffl\u00e9s]], and [[quiche]] have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.<ref>Benenson, R. (1984). Dining in America. Editorial research reports 1984 (Vol. I). Washington, DC: CQ Press.</ref> Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making cr\u00eapes but they have also put their own spin on the cr\u00eape with new types such as the hamburger and pizza cr\u00eape.  In Mexico, cr\u00eapes are known as ''crepas'', and were introduced during the 19th century by the French <ref>Fern\u00e1ndez-del-Villar, Miguel Angel and Ruiz-Naufal,  V\u00edctor M., ''Mesa Mexicana'' (1993), Fundaci\u00f3n Cultural Bancomer, {{ISBN|9789686084948}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hursh |first=Karen |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2139-the-french-influence-on-mexican-cooking-la-comida-afrancescada |title=The French Influence On Mexican Cooking |work=Mexconnect.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> and are typically served either as a sweet dessert when filled with ''[[cajeta]]'' (similar to [[dulce de leche]]), or as a savoury dish when filled with ''Huitlacoche'' ([[corn smut]]), which is considered a delicacy.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], a unique native cr\u00eape recipe is the ''[[Daral (food)|daral]]'' which is made from ground [[glutinous rice]] and [[coconut milk]] batter (''[[galapong]]'').

Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, cr\u00eapes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the [[Orthodox church]]. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of cr\u00eapes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for [[kefir]]. Furthermore, different oils can be added or substituted.  Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with [[caviar]], cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \n<ref>{{cite web|last=Nesterova |first=Maria |url=http://eurokulture.missouri.edu/buttery-crepes-of-deliciousness-and-other-stuff/ |title=Maslenitsa, another Russian festival you\u2019ve probably never heard of |work=Eurokulture.missouri.edu |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cr\u00eaperies and cr\u00eape franchises, some cr\u00eape manufacturers use modern equipment to produce cr\u00eapes in bulk.\n\n[[File:Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape served in cr\u00eaperie near the Pantheon in Paris, France]]\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr\u00eape made of fermented [[rice]] [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is called a [[dosa]], which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a cr\u00eape made of [[gram flour]] is called \"Pudlaa\" or \"Poodla\", with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called \"patibola\" and is sweet in taste due to milk, [[jaggery]], or sugar.

Leucos calls himself or herself a boy, but the other characters either don't believe or are confused about whether to use he or she when addressing them. It is sometimes used as a source of humor and is further obscured by descriptions on armaments made for Leucos. It is eventually revealed that Leucos was raised as a boy because their father wanted it, so it is unclear whether that is the only factor in Leucos being transgender.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n| [[Role-playing video game|Role-playing]]\n| Paon, Studio Saizensen\n| Japan\n|-\n| 2008-2019\n|''[[Moshi Monsters]]''\n| Sweet Tooth\n| Non-binary\n| Sweet Tooth is an antagonist who doesn't take kindly to being questioned what pronouns they use or their gender, as the last monster who asked is \"Still in the Moshipital wearing a Gobstopper.\" They also refer to \"They/Their/Them\" pronouns.

The word 'Viking' did not come into general use in the English language until the middle of the nineteenth Century - at about the same time that it was introduced into serious academic literature in Scandinavia - and has since then changed its meaning and been much abused. It must, however, be accepted that the term is today used throughout the world as a descriptor of the peoples of Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth Century until the mid-eleventh Century. To the general public, however, it has apparently two meanings; both are respectable and hallowed in the English language by two centuries of usage. The first is in the sense of 'raider' or 'pirate', the second in the sense of the activities of the Scandinavians outside their own country in that period. It is the latter meaning that has given rise to the useful term 'the Viking Age'. Disregarding the ultimate philology of the word and the history of its use over the centuries, which has been much discussed, it is now in such everyday use by both specialists and non-specialists - however improperly - to describe the Scandinavians of the Viking Age, that it almost impossible to avoid its use in this generic sense. Although it is often appropriate and necessary to use such terms as 'Scandinavian' or 'Norse', as I have done in this book, it is often simpler and less confusing to label something as 'Viking' rather than deal in scholastic circumlocution to placate purists, however justified they may be in their arguments.\" |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2010 |orig-year= |chapter=Vikings |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195334036.001.0001/acref-9780195334036-e-0957?rskey=8P9rGR&result=3 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Clifford J. |editor1-link=Clifford J.

Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]], who wrote: \"Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared\".<ref>[[#Jones|Jones]], p. 195. Simeon of Durham recorded the raid in these terms:\n<blockquote>And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea.\"</blockquote>\nMagnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nVikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \"wolves among sheep\".\n\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torf\u00e6us]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more \"rational\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to historical scholarship.\n\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\n\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]''.

They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.\n\nTheir [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\n\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\n\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\n\n== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==\n{{Norse people sidebar}}\n{{Main|Viking expansion}}\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).<ref>\"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land\u2014especially in mountainous Norway\u2014and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50\u201360 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 \"The Vikings&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101335/http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 |date=18 May 2015 }} (3 July 2000).

Leiden: Brill, 2000.</ref> The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier \"urban\" centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.\n\n;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800\u20131300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250\u20131850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal \"Push\" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.<ref>Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age? Antiquity 82.317 (2008): 671\u201385 [678\u201379]</ref>\n\n;Technological model: This model suggests that the Viking Age occurred as a result of technological innovations that allowed the Vikings to go on their raids in the first place.<ref>Ferguson, Robert.

From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|C\u00e9li D\u00e9]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|upright=1.45|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]].

Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].\n\nThe [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means \"new city\") on the [[Volkhov River]].

This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].\n\nOther Norse people continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]].

In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo\u2013Saxon England]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century. Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[viking age]].  \n\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]].

The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840\u2013841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13</ref>\n\n[[File:England diocese map pre-925.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Anglo-Saxon [[diocese]]s before 925: Normal diocesan life was greatly disrupted in England during the Viking Age.]]\nThe following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the \"Great Summer Army\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.\n\n[[File:07Kbh Mus Drachenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fire-gilded [[European dragon|dragon's head]] from Ireland, found in a Viking grave at [[Stavanger]], Norway ([[Nationalmuseet]], Copenhagen)]]\nIn 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England.

The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\n\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\n\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\n\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\n\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nWhile  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\n\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eog\u00e1n mac \u00d3engusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\n\nIn 870, the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North]] around the [[Firth of Clyde]] came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop [[Alt Clut]] (\"Rock of the Clyde,\" the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] name for [[Dumbarton Rock]], which had become the [[metonym]] for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings [[Amla\u00edb]] and [[\u00cdmar]]. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king [[Arthgal ap Dyfnwal]], who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12 miles (20 km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of [[Govan]] and [[Partick]] (within present-day [[Glasgow]]), and became known as the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.\n\nThe land that now comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]], which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England.  The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the [[kingdom of Alba]], and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland. <ref>The Makers of Scotland: Picts, Romans, Gaels and Vikings, by Tim Clarkson, Birlinn Ltd, Edinburgh, 2013.\"</ref> The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years. \n\n==== Earldom of Orkney ====\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Nor\u00f0reyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Su\u00f0reyjar]]''\u2014this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\n\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\n\n==== Kings of the Isles ====\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson, [[Thorstein the Red]], and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.\n\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].\n\nIn eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes \"'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118120409/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes#fieldnotes |date=18 January 2009 }}. ''The Modern Antiquarian''</ref>\n\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].\n\nThe end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].\n\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the [[dowry]] of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]]. Although attempts were made during the 17th and 18th centuries to redeem Shetland, without success,<ref>[http://universitas.uio.no/Arkiv/1996/16okt96/norsk.htm \"Norsken som d\u00f8de\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185409/http://universitas.uio.no/Arkiv/1996/16okt96/norsk.htm |date=24 July 2011 }}.

The Vikings did, however, settle in the south around [[St. David]]'s, [[Haverfordwest]], and [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]], among other places. Place names such as Skokholm, Skomer, and Swansea remain as evidence of the Norse settlement.<ref>Williams, John Garnons.

While harsh, the land allowed for a pastoral farming life familiar to the Norse. According to the saga of [[Erik the Red]], when Erik was exiled from Iceland, he sailed west and pioneered Greenland.\n\n=== Greenland ===\n[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|The last written records of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders are from a 1408 marriage in the [[Church of Hvalsey]].]]\nThe Viking-Age settlements in Greenland were established in the sheltered [[fjord]]s of the southern and western coast. They settled in three separate areas along roughly {{convert|650|km|nmi smi|abbr=on|lk=out}} of the western coast. While harsh, the [[microclimate]]s along some fjords allowed for a pastoral lifestyle similar to that of Iceland, until the climate changed for the worse with the [[Little Ice Age#Dating|Little Ice Age]] around 1400.<ref>see also [[History of Greenland#Norse failure]].</ref>\n* The [[Eastern Settlement]]: The remains of about 450 farms have been found here.

It has been extensively excavated by archaeologists.\n\n=== Kvenland ===\n{{Main|Kvenland}}\nKvenland, known as Cwenland, K\u00e6nland, and similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in Scandinavia and [[Fennoscandia]]. A contemporary reference to Kvenland is provided in an [[Old English]] account written in the 9th century. It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]]. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.\n\nAll the remaining Nordic sources discussing Kvenland, using that or close to that spelling, date to the 12th and 13th centuries, but some of them\u2014in part at least\u2014are believed to be rewrites of older texts.

The era is seen to have been a period of rapid change. The Estonian peasant culture came into existence by the end of the Viking Age. The overall understanding of the Viking Age in Estonia is deemed to be fragmentary and superficial, because of the limited amount of surviving source material. The main sources for understanding the period are remains of the farms and fortresses of the era, cemeteries and a large amount of excavated objects.{{sfn|Tvauri|2012}}\n\nThe landscape of Ancient Estonia featured numerous hillforts, some later hillforts on [[Saaremaa]] heavily fortified during the Viking Age and on to the 12th century.{{sfn|M\u00e4gi|2015|pp=45\u201346}} There were a number of late prehistoric or medieval harbour sites on the coast of Saaremaa, but none have been found that are large enough to be international trade centres.{{sfn|M\u00e4gi|2015|pp=45\u201346}} The Estonian islands also have a number of graves from the Viking Age, both individual and collective, with weapons and jewellery.{{sfn|M\u00e4gi|2015|pp=45\u201346}} Weapons found in Estonian Viking Age graves are common to types found throughout Northern Europe and Scandinavia.{{sfn|Martens|2004|pp=132\u201335}}\n\n== Eastern Europe ==\nThe [[Varangians]] or Varyags ([[Russian language|Russian]], {{lang-uk|\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0438}}, ''varyagi''; {{lang-be|\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0456}}, ''varahi''; [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]: \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9, \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03b9, ''Varangoi'') sometimes referred to as Variagians were Scandinavians, often Swedes, who migrated eastwards and southwards through what is now Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine mainly in the 9th and 10th centuries.

The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.\n\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\"<ref>Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael.

Kindle Edition.</ref> The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.\n\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.<ref>Foote, P. and Wilson, D.M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-283-35499-2}}. pp. 282\u201385.</ref>\n\nTogether with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of ''[[leidang]]'' \u2014 a fleet mobilisation system, where every ''skipreide'' (ship community) had to maintain one ship and a crew \u2014 was discontinued as a purely military institution, as the duty to build and man a ship soon was converted into a tax. The Norwegian leidang was called under Haakon Haakonson for his 1263 expedition to Scotland during the Scottish\u2013Norwegian War, and the last recorded calling of it was in 1603. However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements--e.g., with the Hanseatic League.\n\nExactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite \"sunstones\"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking \"sky-polarimetric\" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.<ref>Horv\u00e0th, G. et al.

Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published at [[bioRxiv]] in July 2019 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. 442 ancient humans from across [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]] were surveyed, stretching from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Modern Period]]. It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered [[Denmark]] and eastern [[Sweden]], from which it spread into the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]]. These islands were probably important trade settlements. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times. The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Margaryan|2019}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n== Scandinavia ==\n{{Main|History_of_Scandinavia}}\nDuring, and as a result of the Viking Age, Scandinavia moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the three Nordic countries that still exist today. \n\n== Settlements outside Scandinavia ==\n;British Isles\n\nEngland\n* [[Danelaw]]\n* [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] ([[York]])\n* [[Cumbria]]\n\nIreland\n* [[Arklow]]\n* [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|Dyflin]] ([[Dublin]])\n* Hlymrekr ([[Limerick]])\n* [[History of Waterford|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r]] ([[Waterford]])\n* V\u00edkingr-l\u00f3 ([[Wicklow]])<ref>Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref>\n* Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r ([[Wexford]])\n\nIsle of Man\n* [[Isle of Man|Mann]]\n\nScotland\n* [[Caithness]]\n* [[Galloway]]\n* [[Kintyre]]\n* [[Nor\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]])\n* [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]]\n* [[Su\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Hebrides]])\n* [[Sutherland]]\n\n;Western Europe\n* [[Normandy]]\n\n;Eastern Europe\n* [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] (Russia)\n\n;Northern Europe\n* [[Grobi\u0146a|Seeburg]]\n\n;Atlantic\n* [[Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n* [[Greenland]]\n\n;North America\n* [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] (and possibly a larger area called [[Vinland]])\n\n== Old Norse influence on the English language ==\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.<ref name=\"Crystal\">Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning \"wind-eye\".<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''.

The word 'Viking' did not come into general use in the English language until the middle of the nineteenth Century - at about the same time that it was introduced into serious academic literature in Scandinavia - and has since then changed its meaning and been much abused. It must, however, be accepted that the term is today used throughout the world as a descriptor of the peoples of Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth Century until the mid-eleventh Century. To the general public, however, it has apparently two meanings; both are respectable and hallowed in the English language by two centuries of usage. The first is in the sense of 'raider' or 'pirate', the second in the sense of the activities of the Scandinavians outside their own country in that period. It is the latter meaning that has given rise to the useful term 'the Viking Age'. Disregarding the ultimate philology of the word and the history of its use over the centuries, which has been much discussed, it is now in such everyday use by both specialists and non-specialists - however improperly - to describe the Scandinavians of the Viking Age, that it almost impossible to avoid its use in this generic sense. Although it is often appropriate and necessary to use such terms as 'Scandinavian' or 'Norse', as I have done in this book, it is often simpler and less confusing to label something as 'Viking' rather than deal in scholastic circumlocution to placate purists, however justified they may be in their arguments.\" |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2010 |orig-year= |chapter=Vikings |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195334036.001.0001/acref-9780195334036-e-0957?rskey=8P9rGR&result=3 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Clifford J. |editor1-link=Clifford J.

Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]], who wrote: \"Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared\".<ref>[[#Jones|Jones]], p. 195. Simeon of Durham recorded the raid in these terms:\n<blockquote>And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea.\"</blockquote>\nMagnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nVikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \"wolves among sheep\".\n\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torf\u00e6us]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more \"rational\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to historical scholarship.\n\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\n\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]''.

They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.\n\nTheir [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\n\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\n\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\n\n== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==\n{{Norse people sidebar}}\n{{Main|Viking expansion}}\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).<ref>\"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land\u2014especially in mountainous Norway\u2014and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50\u201360 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 \"The Vikings&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101335/http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 |date=18 May 2015 }} (3 July 2000).

Wickham. ''The Long Eighth Century: Production, Distribution, and Demand.'' Leiden: Brill, 2000.</ref> The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier \"urban\" centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.\n\n;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800\u20131300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250\u20131850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal \"Push\" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.<ref>Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age?

From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|C\u00e9li D\u00e9]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|upright=1.45|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]]. [[Lower Normandy]], depicted as a \u2033Viking territory in 911\u2033, was not part of the lands granted by the king of the Franks to [[Rollo]] in 911, but [[Upper Normandy]].]]\n\nThe Kingdom of the [[Franks]] under Charlemagne was particularly devastated by these raiders, who could sail up the [[Seine]] with near impunity. Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].\n\nThe [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means \"new city\") on the [[Volkhov River]]. [[Rurik Dynasty|His successors]] moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] with the capital in [[Kiev]]. This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].\n\nOther Norse people continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]]. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings  reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The eastern connections of these \"[[Varangians]]\" brought [[Byzantine silk]], a [[cowrie shell]] from the Red Sea, and even coins from [[Samarkand]], to [[Jorvik|Viking York]].\n\nIn 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian]] army under Archbishop [[Rimbert]] of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from [[East Frisia]].\n\nIn 911, French King [[Charles the Simple]] was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.<ref>The material suggesting a Norwegian origin identifies him with [[Rollo|Hrolf the Ganger]], also known as \"Rolf the Walker\"</ref> Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted  his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo\u2013Saxon England]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century. Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[viking age]].  \n\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]]. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] between the 13th and the 15th centuries; the [[Western Isles]] and the [[Isle of Man]] remained under Scandinavian authority until 1266.

The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840\u2013841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13</ref>\n\n[[File:England diocese map pre-925.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Anglo-Saxon [[diocese]]s before 925: Normal diocesan life was greatly disrupted in England during the Viking Age.]]\nThe following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the \"Great Summer Army\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.\n\n[[File:07Kbh Mus Drachenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fire-gilded [[European dragon|dragon's head]] from Ireland, found in a Viking grave at [[Stavanger]], Norway ([[Nationalmuseet]], Copenhagen)]]\nIn 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England.

The death in the battle of King [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway ended any hope of reviving Cnut's [[North Sea Empire]]; it is because of this, rather than the Norman conquest, that 1066 is often taken as the end of the Viking Age.  Nineteen days later, the Normans, themselves descended from Norsemen, [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England]] and defeated the weakened English army at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\nIn 1152, [[Eystein II of Norway]] led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.<ref>[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 216</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{main|History of Ireland (800\u20131169)|Early Scandinavian Dublin|Norse-Gaels}}\n\nThe Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\n\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\n\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\n\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\n\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nWhile  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\n\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eog\u00e1n mac \u00d3engusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\n\nIn 870, the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North]] around the [[Firth of Clyde]] came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop [[Alt Clut]] (\"Rock of the Clyde,\" the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] name for [[Dumbarton Rock]], which had become the [[metonym]] for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings [[Amla\u00edb]] and [[\u00cdmar]]. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king [[Arthgal ap Dyfnwal]], who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12 miles (20 km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of [[Govan]] and [[Partick]] (within present-day [[Glasgow]]), and became known as the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.\n\nThe land that now comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]], which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England.  The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the [[kingdom of Alba]], and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland. <ref>The Makers of Scotland: Picts, Romans, Gaels and Vikings, by Tim Clarkson, Birlinn Ltd, Edinburgh, 2013.\"</ref> The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years. \n\n==== Earldom of Orkney ====\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Nor\u00f0reyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Su\u00f0reyjar]]''\u2014this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\n\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\n\n==== Kings of the Isles ====\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson, [[Thorstein the Red]], and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.\n\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].\n\nIn eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes \"'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118120409/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes#fieldnotes |date=18 January 2009 }}. ''The Modern Antiquarian''</ref>\n\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].\n\nThe end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].\n\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the [[dowry]] of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]].

It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]].

They were carried out primarily in the summer, as the Vikings wintered in Scandinavia. Several coastal areas were lost to [[Francia]] during the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814\u2013840). But the Vikings took advantage of the quarrels in the royal family caused after the death of Louis the Pious to settle their first colony in the south-west ([[Gascony]]) of the kingdom of Francia, which was more or less abandoned by the Frankish kings after their two defeats at [[Roncevaux]]. The incursions in 841 caused severe damage to [[Rouen]] and [[Jumi\u00e8ges]]. The Viking attackers sought to capture the treasures stored at [[Monastery|monasteries]], easy prey given the monks' lack of defensive capacity. In 845 an expedition up the Seine reached [[Paris]].

The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.\n\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\"<ref>Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael.

Kindle Edition.</ref> The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.\n\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.<ref>Foote, P. and Wilson, D.M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-283-35499-2}}. pp. 282\u201385.</ref>\n\nTogether with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of ''[[leidang]]'' \u2014 a fleet mobilisation system, where every ''skipreide'' (ship community) had to maintain one ship and a crew \u2014 was discontinued as a purely military institution, as the duty to build and man a ship soon was converted into a tax. The Norwegian leidang was called under Haakon Haakonson for his 1263 expedition to Scotland during the Scottish\u2013Norwegian War, and the last recorded calling of it was in 1603. However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements--e.g., with the Hanseatic League.\n\nExactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite \"sunstones\"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking \"sky-polarimetric\" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.<ref>Horv\u00e0th, G. et al.

This is a model of the town of ''Aros'' about 950. The town is now known as [[Aarhus]]]]\n[[File:Model of viking age Aarhus 05.JPG|alt=|thumb|The fortified Viking Age town of Aros]]\nSome of the most important trading ports founded by the Norse during the period include both existing and former cities such as [[Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Ribe]] (Denmark), Hedeby (Germany), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), [[Bj\u00f8rgvin]] (Norway), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Skiringssal]] (Norway), [[Birka]] (Sweden), [[Bordeaux]] (France), [[Jorvik|York]] (England), Dublin (Ireland) and [[Staraya Ladoga|Aldeigjuborg]] (Russia).\n\nOne important centre of trade was at [[Hedeby]]. Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published at [[bioRxiv]] in July 2019 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. 442 ancient humans from across [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]] were surveyed, stretching from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Modern Period]]. It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered [[Denmark]] and eastern [[Sweden]], from which it spread into the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]]. These islands were probably important trade settlements. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times. The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Margaryan|2019}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n== Scandinavia ==\n{{Main|History_of_Scandinavia}}\nDuring, and as a result of the Viking Age, Scandinavia moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the three Nordic countries that still exist today. \n\n== Settlements outside Scandinavia ==\n;British Isles\n\nEngland\n* [[Danelaw]]\n* [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] ([[York]])\n* [[Cumbria]]\n\nIreland\n* [[Arklow]]\n* [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|Dyflin]] ([[Dublin]])\n* Hlymrekr ([[Limerick]])\n* [[History of Waterford|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r]] ([[Waterford]])\n* V\u00edkingr-l\u00f3 ([[Wicklow]])<ref>Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref>\n* Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r ([[Wexford]])\n\nIsle of Man\n* [[Isle of Man|Mann]]\n\nScotland\n* [[Caithness]]\n* [[Galloway]]\n* [[Kintyre]]\n* [[Nor\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]])\n* [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]]\n* [[Su\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Hebrides]])\n* [[Sutherland]]\n\n;Western Europe\n* [[Normandy]]\n\n;Eastern Europe\n* [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] (Russia)\n\n;Northern Europe\n* [[Grobi\u0146a|Seeburg]]\n\n;Atlantic\n* [[Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n* [[Greenland]]\n\n;North America\n* [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] (and possibly a larger area called [[Vinland]])\n\n== Old Norse influence on the English language ==\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.<ref name=\"Crystal\">Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning \"wind-eye\".<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with ''they, them'' and ''their'' replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb ''to be''; the replacement of ''sindon'' by ''are'' is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending ''-s'' in the present tense of verbs.<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\nThere are more than 1,500 Scandinavian place names in England, mainly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (within the former boundaries of the ''Danelaw''): over 600 end in ''-by'', the Scandinavian word for \"village\"\u2014for example ''Grimsby, Naseby'' and ''Whitby'';<ref>\"The ''-by'' ending is almost entirely confined to the area of the Danelaw, supporting a theory of Scandinavian origin, despite the existence of the word ''by'' \"dwelling\" in Old English.\" Crystal, p 25.</ref> many others end in ''-thorpe'' (\"farm\"), ''-thwaite'' (\"clearing\"), and ''-toft'' (\"homestead\").<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\nThe distribution of family names showing Scandinavian influence is still, as an analysis of names ending in ''-son'' reveals, concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former Viking settlement.

Despite being divided over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the following year's general election]].\n\nUnder [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime ministers]] [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (1905\u20131908) and [[H. H. Asquith]] (1908\u20131916), the Liberal Party passed the [[Liberal welfare reforms|welfare reforms]] that created a basic British [[welfare state]]. Although Asquith was [[Leader of the Liberal Party (UK)|the party's leader]], its dominant figure was [[David Lloyd George]]. Asquith was overwhelmed by the [[World War I|wartime]] role of [[Asquith coalition ministry|coalition]] prime minister and Lloyd George replaced him as prime minister in late 1916, but Asquith remained as Liberal Party leader. The pair fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process.<ref>Michael Fry (1988). \"Political Change in Britain, August 1914 to December 1916: Lloyd George Replaces Asquith: The Issues Underlying the Drama\".

By the end of the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had replaced the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rival. The Liberal Party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general elections. Apart from notable [[by-election]] victories, its fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] with the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) in 1981. At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], the Alliance won over a quarter of the vote, but only 23 of the 650 seats it contested. At the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], its share of the vote fell below 23% and the Liberals and Social Democratic Party merged in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. A splinter group reconstituted the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] in 1989. \n\nProminent intellectuals associated with the Liberal Party include the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and social planner [[William Beveridge]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:palmerston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]]]]\nThe Liberal Party grew out of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who had their origins in an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] faction in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the early 19th century [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]]. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of the Crown and increasing the power of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of [[democracy]] for its own sake. The great figures of reformist [[Whiggism|Whiggery]] were [[Charles James Fox]] (died 1806) and his disciple and successor [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]. After decades in opposition, the Whigs returned to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] in 1832.\n\nThe Reform Act was the climax of Whiggism, but it also brought about the Whigs' demise. The admission of the [[middle class]]es to the franchise and to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] led eventually to the development of a systematic middle class liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey's retirement, the party was led first by [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], a fairly traditional Whig, and then by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a renegade Irish [[Tory]] and essentially a [[conservatism|conservative]], although capable of radical gestures.\n\nAs early as 1839, Russell had adopted the name of \"Liberals\", but in reality his party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the [[House of Lords]] and Radicals in the Commons. The leading Radicals were [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]], who represented the manufacturing towns which had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the [[Church of England]] (many Liberals were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]]), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business) and above all [[free trade]]. For a century, free trade remained the one cause which could unite all Liberals.\n\nIn 1841, the Liberals lost office to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] under [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], but their period in [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a free trade issue; and a faction known as the [[Peelite]]s (but not Peel himself, who died soon after) defected to the Liberal side. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston and the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. A leading Peelite was [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a reforming [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston's second government.\n\nHowever, the Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the \"Two Terrible Old Men\", Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston's death in 1865 and Russell's retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative government (during which the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]] was passed by agreement between the parties), Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the [[National Liberal Federation]] in 1877. The philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] was also a Liberal MP from 1865 to 1868.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/mill_john_stuart.shtml|title=John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Gladstonian era ===\n[[File:Acgladstone2.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Ewart Gladstone]]]]\nFor the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. [[William Ewart Gladstone]] served as prime minister four times (1868\u201374, 1880\u201385, 1886, and 1892\u201394). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', were suited to a developing capitalist society, but they could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the \"Grand Old Man\" later in life, Gladstone was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to the [[working class]] and to the lower middle class. Deeply religious, Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics, with his evangelical sensibility and his opposition to aristocracy.<ref>J. P. Parry, ''Democracy and Religion: Gladstone and the Liberal Party, 1867\u20131875'' (1989), p. 174.</ref> His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal Party.<ref>H. C. G. Matthew, \"Gladstone, William Ewart (1809\u20131898)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004).</ref><ref>J. L. Hammond and M. R. D. Foot, ''Gladstone and Liberalism'' (1952).</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements, but he did not resist the realities of imperialism. For example, he ordered the occupation of [[History of Egypt under the British|Egypt]] by British forces in 1882.<ref>R. C. Mowat, \"From Liberalism to Imperialism: The Case of Egypt 1875\u20131887\", ''Historical Journal'' 16#1 (1973), pp. 109\u2013124 focus on Lord Cromer as a Liberal imperialist. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637918 online].</ref> His goal was to create a European order based on co-operation rather than conflict and on mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the [[rule of law]] was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious [[Concert of Europe]] was opposed to and ultimately defeated by a [[Bismarckian]] system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, ''British foreign and imperial policy, 1865\u20131919'' (2000), p. 21.</ref>\n\nAs prime minister from 1868 to 1874, Gladstone headed a Liberal Party which was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs and Radicals. He was now a spokesman for \"peace, economy and reform\". One major achievement was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Elementary Education Act of 1870]], which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time. He also secured the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the army and of religious tests for admission to Oxford and Cambridge; the introduction of the secret ballot in elections; the legalization of trade unions; and the reorganization of the judiciary in the Judicature Act.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title=Access to History, Government and Reform: Britain 1815\u20131918|edition=2|pages=56\u201357|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nRegarding Ireland, the major Liberal achievements were land reform, where he [[Irish Land Acts|ended centuries of landlord oppression]], and the [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablishment]] of the (Anglican) [[Church of Ireland]] through the [[Irish Church Act 1869]].\n\nIn the [[1874 United Kingdom general election|1874 general election]] Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] during a sharp economic recession. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]], but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli's pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the [[Midlothian campaign]]. The Liberals won a large majority in the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.\n\n==== Ireland and Home Rule ====\nAmong the consequences of the [[Third Reform Act]] (1884) was the giving of the vote to many Catholics in Ireland. In the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]] the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power in the House of Commons, and demanded [[Irish Home Rule]] as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong [[Liberal Unionist]] faction led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it. The Irish Home Rule bill proposed to offer all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years' purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a costly rescue operation for the landed \u00e9lite.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639536|title = The Liberal Party and Gladstone's Land Purchase Bill of 1886|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 32|issue = 3|pages = 627\u2013641|last1 = Goodlad|first1 = Graham D.|year = 1989|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012450}}</ref> Further, Home Rule had not been promised in the Liberals' election manifesto, and so the impression was given that Gladstone was buying Irish support in a rather desperate manner to hold on to power.\n\nThe result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 election]] at the hands of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who was supported by the breakaway [[Liberal Unionist Party]]. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords.\n\n==== Newcastle Programme ====\n{{main|Newcastle Programme}}\nHistorically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. Following the Queen, High Society in London largely ostracized home rulers and Liberal clubs were badly split. [[Joseph Chamberlain]] took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party called Liberal Unionism on the Irish issue. It collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party.<ref>[[R. C. K. Ensor]], ''England 1870\u20131914'' (1936), pp. 206\u2013207.</ref><ref>Peter Fraser, \"The Liberal Unionist Alliance: Chamberlain, Hartington, and the Conservatives, 1886\u20131904.\" ''English Historical Review'' 77#302 (1962): 53\u201378.</ref> The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted [[The Newcastle Programme]] that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=A Short History of the Liberal Party: The Road Back to Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1p9DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=24\u201326|isbn=9781137056078}}</ref>\n\n==== Relations with trade unions ====\nA major long-term consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates, in the absence of any committed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) into single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received sponsorship and endorsement from [[trade union]]s. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard: in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer Whigs were selected as candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title=Access to History, Government and Reform: Britain 1815\u20131918|edition=2|page=74|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==== Reform policies ====\nA broad range of interventionist reforms were introduced by the 1892\u20131895 Liberal government. Amongst other measures, standards of accommodation and of teaching in schools were improved, factory inspection was made more stringent, and ministers used their powers to increase the wages and reduce the working hours of large numbers of male workers employed by the state.<ref>[[Kenneth O. Morgan]], ''The Age of Lloyd George: Liberal Party and British Politics, 1890\u20131929''.</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHistorian Walter L. Arnstein concludes:\n:Notable as the Gladstonian reforms had been, they had almost all remained within the nineteenth-century Liberal tradition of gradually removing the religious, economic, and political barriers that prevented men of varied creeds and classes from exercising their individual talents in order to improve themselves and their society. As the third quarter of the century drew to a close, the essential bastions of Victorianism still held firm: respectability; a government of aristocrats and gentlemen now influenced not only by middle-class merchants and manufacturers but also by industrious working people; a prosperity that seemed to rest largely on the tenets of laissez-faire economics; and a Britannia that ruled the waves and many a dominion beyond.<ref>Walter L. Arnstein, ''Britain Yesterday and Today: 1832 the Present'' (6th ed. 1992), p. 125.</ref>\n\n=== After Gladstone ===\nGladstone finally retired in 1894. Gladstone's support for Home Rule deeply divided the party, and it lost its upper and upper-middle-class base, while keeping support among Protestant nonconformists and the Celtic fringe. Historian [[R. C. K. Ensor]] reports that after 1886, the main Liberal Party was deserted by practically the entire whig peerage and the great majority of the upper-class and upper-middle-class members.

Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The [[People's Budget]] of 1909, championed by [[David Lloyd George]] and fellow Liberal [[Winston Churchill]], introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies.<ref>Geoffrey Lee \u2013 [http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf \"The People's Budget: An Edwardian Tragedy\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182535/http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf|date=5 March 2012}}</ref> It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public.

The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], former prime minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone's personal secretary, [[John Morley]]. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. Harcourt's resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal figures H. H. Asquith, Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's \"methods of barbarism\" in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, [[Arthur Balfour]], pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as the [[Education Act 1902]] and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs.\n\nCampbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the greatest election victory]] in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right.<ref>Goldman, Lawrence. \"Oxford DNB theme: The general election of 1906\" [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95348.html online].</ref><ref>A.

Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died soon after. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government's radicalism.

This included the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and welfare.\n\n[[File:Punch cartoon 28 April 1909.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Cartoonist [[John Bernard Partridge]] depicts Lloyd George as a giant with a cudgel labelled \"Budget\" in reference to his [[People's Budget]] while Asquith cowers beneath the table, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 28 April 1909]]\nA political battle erupted over the [[People's Budget]] and resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, being left once again dependent on the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalists]].\n\nAs a result, Asquith was forced to introduce a new [[Third Home Rule Act|third Home Rule bill]] in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, the Unionist's [[Ulster Volunteers]] led by Sir [[Edward Carson]], launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] and the threat of mass resignation of their commissions by army officers in Ireland in 1914 (''see [[Curragh Incident]]''). In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, [[Bonar Law]], was of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] descent. The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Historian [[George Dangerfield]] has argued that the multiplicity of crises in 1910 to 1914, before the war broke out, so weakened the Liberal coalition that it marked the ''[[Strange Death of Liberal England]]''.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England: 1910\u20131914'' (1935).</ref> However, most historians date the collapse to the crisis of the First World War.\n\n=== Decline ===\n{{further|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War|David Lloyd George}}\nThe Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for measures that the Party had long  rejected.  The result was the permanent destruction of the ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government.  Historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]] explains the dilemma:\n{{quote|[T]he Liberals were traditionally the party of freedom of speech, conscience and trade. They were against jingoism, heavy armaments and compulsion. [...] Liberals were neither wholehearted nor unanimous about conscription, censorship,  the [[Defence of the Realm Act]], severity toward aliens and pacifists, direction of labour and industry. The Conservatives [...] had no such misgivings.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Decline of Power: 1915\u20131964'' (1985), p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nBlake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of ''realpolitik'' and the balance of power.<ref>Blake, ''The Decline of Power'' (1985), p. 3.</ref> However, Lloyd George and Churchill were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-orientated Liberals out. \n\nAsquith was blamed for the poor British performance in the first year. Since the Liberals ran the war without consulting the Conservatives, there were heavy partisan attacks. However, even Liberal commentators were dismayed by the lack of energy at the top. At the time, public opinion was intensely hostile, both in the media and in the street, against any young man in civilian garb and labeled as a slacker. The leading Liberal newspaper, the ''Manchester Guardian'' complained:\n{{quote|The fact that the Government has not dared to challenge the nation to rise above itself, is one among many signs. [...] The war is, in fact, not being taken seriously. [...] How can any slacker be blamed when the Government itself is slack.<ref>''Manchester Guardian'' 1 May 1915, editorial, in {{cite book|author=Trevor Wilson|title=The Downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914\u20131935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PyvNxXVMg4C&pg=PT37|year=1966|page=51|isbn=9780571280223}}</ref>}}\n\nAsquith's Liberal government was brought down in {{Nowrap|May 1915}}, due in particular to a [[Shell Crisis of 1915|crisis in inadequate artillery shell production]] and the protest resignation of [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] over the disastrous  [[Gallipoli Campaign]] against Turkey. Reluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition government on 25 May, with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own Liberal party and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist (Conservative) party]], along with a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a half, and was the last time Liberals controlled the government.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1876582|title = Asquith's Predicament, 1914-1918|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 283\u2013303|last1 = McGill|first1 = Barry|year = 1967|doi = 10.1086/240083}}</ref> The analysis of historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] is that the British people were so deeply divided over numerous issues, But on all sides there was growing distrust of the Asquith government. There was no agreement whatsoever on wartime issues. The leaders of the two parties realized that embittered debates in Parliament would further undermine popular morale and so the House of Commons did not once discuss the war before May 1915. Taylor argues:<ref>{{cite book|author=A.J.P. Taylor|title=English History, 1914\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sb0RDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|year=1965|page=17|isbn=9780198217152}}</ref>\n{{quote|The Unionists, by and large, regarded Germany as a dangerous rival, and rejoiced at the chance to destroy her.

[...] Entering the war for idealistic motives, the Liberals wished to fight it by noble means and found it harder to abandon their principles than to endure defeat in the field.}}\n\nThe 1915 coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it instead to Lloyd George, who became prime minister at the head of a new coalition largely made up of Conservatives.<ref>Kenneth O.

He insisted on strong government controls over business as opposed to the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitudes of traditional Liberals. He insisted on conscription of young men into the Army, a position that deeply troubled his old colleagues. That brought him and a few like-minded Liberals into the new coalition on the ground long occupied by Conservatives. There was no more planning for world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfit with aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the party, says historian Trevor Wilson, was its repudiation by ideological Liberals, who decided sadly that it no longer represented their principles. Finally the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal performance.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914\u20131935'' (1966), pp. 23\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|David Lloyd George]]\nIn the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], Lloyd George, hailed as \"the Man Who Won the War\", led his coalition into a [[khaki election]]. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader [[Bonar Law]] wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates\u2014this \"[[The Coalition Coupon|coupon]]\", as it became known, was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. The coalition won a massive victory as the Asquithian Liberals and  Labour were decimated. Those remaining Liberal MPs who were opposed to the Coalition Government went into opposition under the parliamentary leadership of [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald MacLean]] who also became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Asquith, who had appointed MacLean, remained as overall Leader of the Liberal Party even though he lost his seat in 1918. Asquith returned to parliament in 1920 and resumed leadership. Between 1919\u20131923, the anti-Lloyd George  Liberals were called Asquithian Liberals, [[Wee Free]] Liberals<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beaverbrook|first1=Lord|title=The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George|date=1963|publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce|location=New York|pages=290\u2013291|edition=first|url=https://archive.org/stream/declineandfallof006894mbp#page/n319/mode/2up/search/wee|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> or [[Independent Liberal Party (UK, 1918)|Independent Liberals]].<ref>Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970''.</ref>\n\nLloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party who numerically dominated the coalition. In 1922, the Conservative backbenchers [[Carlton Club meeting|rebelled]] against the continuation of the coalition, citing, in particular, Lloyd George's plan for war with Turkey in the [[Chanak Crisis]], and his corrupt sale of honours. He resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by [[Bonar Law]].\n\nAt the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] and [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 elections]] the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922, Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] but made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour\u2014a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could obtain support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. However, instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense, but it was a fatal error.\n\n[[File:UK popular vote.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Share of the vote received by Conservatives (blue), Whigs/Liberals/Liberal Democrats (orange), Labour (red) and others (grey) in general elections since 1832<ref>Table 2.01 \"Summary Results of General Elections 1832\u20132005 (UK)\", ''British electoral facts, 1832\u20132006'', by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, 7th edition, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-2712-8}}, p. 59.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/|title=Election 2010 Results|work=BBC News}}</ref> shows that following success as the successor to the Whig party, the party's share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition Liberals]]\nLabour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left. [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was forced into a [[1924 United Kingdom general election|snap election in 1924]] and although his government was defeated he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished, and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labour. Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]], were the sons of Liberal MPs.\n\nAsquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', largely written for him by the Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed, the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast, most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the [[Celtic fringe]], where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members, holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]], but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice versa.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars, 1918\u20131940'' (1955).</ref>\n\nThe last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906. The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces. Other issues of the period included [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Irish Home Rule]] movement. After the carnage of 1914\u20131918, the democratic reforms of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] instantly tripled the number of people entitled to vote in Britain from seven to twenty-one million. The Labour Party benefited most from this huge change in the electorate, forming its [[First Labour Government (UK)|first minority government in 1924]].<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965).</ref>\n\n=== Splits over the National Government ===\n[[File:Gws samuel 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]]]\nIn 1931 MacDonald's government fell apart in response to the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and the Liberals agreed to join his [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], dominated by the Conservatives. Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join. Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|only a few MPs and candidates followed]]. Another group under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk \u2013 the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]] (officially the \"National Liberals\" after 1947) led by Simon, also known as \"Simonites\", and the \"Samuelites\" or \"official Liberals\", led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.\n\nThe official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to [[protectionism]]. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the [[Ottawa Conference|Ottawa Agreement]] on [[Imperial Preference]]. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|independent Liberals]]. Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as [[Clement Davies]], who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during [[World War II]] and who would lead it after the war.\n\n=== Near extinction ===\nSamuel had lost his seat in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 election]] and the leadership of the party fell to [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Sir Archibald Sinclair]]. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the [[appeasement]] foreign policy of the British government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party's weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the [[Midlothian Campaign]] and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.\n\nIn 1940, they joined Churchill's wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as [[Secretary of State for Air]], the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party's lack of importance that they were not included in the [[War Cabinet]]; some leading party members founded [[Radical Action]], a group which called for liberal candidates to break the [[war-time electoral pact]].<ref>Chris Cook, ''A Short History of the Liberal Party: 1900 \u2013 2001'', pp. 268\u2013269.</ref> At the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminster,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1945_over.stm|title=1945: Labour landslide buries Churchill|work=The election battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> but this was just the beginning of the decline.

The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.\n\n=== Liberal revival ===\n[[File:Jo Grimond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Jo Grimond]]]]\nThrough the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, [[Bolton]] and [[Huddersfield]], local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town's two seats. [[Jo Grimond]], for example, who became Liberal leader in 1956, was MP for the remote [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the [[1962 Orpington by-election|Orpington by-election]] of March 1962 which was won by [[Eric Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Eric Lubbock]]. There, the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.\n\nThe Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the [[European Economic Community]]. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.\n\nThe new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, [[Jeremy Thorpe]], the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote, but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although [[Emlyn Hooson]] held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon [[Clement Davies]] death in 1962, the party lost five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966, the [[Welsh Liberal Party]] formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.<ref>Russell Deacon (2011), History of the Welsh Liberal party, Welsh Academic Press.</ref>\n\nIn local elections, [[Liverpool]] remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the [[1973 United Kingdom local elections|elections]] to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jeffery|first=David|date=2017-08-01|title=The strange death of Tory Liverpool: Conservative electoral decline in Liverpool, 1945\u20131996|journal=British Politics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=386\u2013407|doi=10.1057/s41293-016-0032-6|issn=1746-918X}}</ref> In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats. The Conservatives were unable to form a government due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the [[Home Office]] if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing [[proportional representation]] and a change of prime minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead, a minority Labour government was formed under [[Harold Wilson]] but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]], the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.\n\nThorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations that he attempted to have his homosexual lover murdered by a hitman. The party's new leader, [[David Steel]], negotiated the [[Lib-Lab pact]] with Wilson's successor as prime minister, [[James Callaghan]]. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of [[proportional representation]] was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson [[John Pardoe]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], who were mutually antagonistic.\n\n=== Alliance, Liberal Democrats and reconstituted Liberal Party ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|upright=0.7|The symbol of the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats]] -->\n{{main|SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance|Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Party (UK, 1989)}}\nThe Conservative Party under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.\n\nIn 1981, defectors from a moderate faction of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]] and [[Shirley Williams]], founded the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). The new party and the Liberals quickly formed the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance, which for a while polled as high as 50% in the opinion polls and appeared capable of winning the next general election. Indeed, Steel was so confident of an Alliance victory that he told the 1981 Liberal conference, \"Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3185313.stm|work=BBC News|title=Conference season's greatest hits|date=10 September 2003|accessdate=7 April 2010|first=Ollie|last=Stone-Lee}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Alliance was overtaken in the polls by the Tories in the aftermath of the [[Falkland Islands War]] and at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] the Conservatives were re-elected by a landslide, with Labour once again forming the opposition. While the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes (a share of more than 25%), it only had 23 MPs compared to Labour's 209.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn and Christine F.

In the election's aftermath Steel proposed a merger of the two parties. Most SDP members voted in favour of the merger, but SDP leader [[David Owen]] objected and continued to lead a \"rump\" SDP.\n\nIn March 1988, the Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party merged to create the Social and Liberal Democrats, renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm|work=BBC News|title=SDP: Breaking the mould|date=25 January 2001}}</ref> Over two-thirds of Liberal members joined the merged party, along with all sitting MPs.

Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007, but the Liberal Party as reconstituted in 1989 [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989) election results|continues to hold council seats and field candidates in Westminster Parliamentary elections]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|A crowd waits outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 general elections]].]]\nDuring the 19th century, the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called [[classical liberalism]], supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies such as [[free trade]] and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed [[Gladstonian liberalism]] after the [[Victorian era]] Liberal prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of [[the Crown]] and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]]) and an extension of the electoral [[Suffrage|franchise]]. Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about [[liberalism]] in 1872: <blockquote>If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this\u2014that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world. [...] It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.<ref>''The Times'' (31 December 1872), p. 5.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe political terms of \"modern\", \"progressive\" or \"new\" Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.<ref>W. H. Greenleaf, ''The British Political Tradition. Volume II: The Ideological Heritage'' (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 143.</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, the Liberals stance began to shift towards \"New Liberalism\", what would today be called [[social liberalism]], namely a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of [[welfare]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/higher/history/liberal/impact1_rev.shtml|title=Education Scotland \u2013 Higher Bitesize Revision \u2013 History \u2013 Liberal \u2013 Impact: Revision 1|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of [[H.

Relatively few MPs were [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. However the Dissenters were a major voting bloc in many areas, such as the East Midlands.<ref>Henry Pelling, ''Social Geography of British Elections, 1885\u20131910'' (London, 1967), 89\u201390, 206.</ref> They were very well organised and highly motivated and largely won over the Whigs and Liberals to their cause. Down to the 1830s, Dissenters demanded removal of [[political and civil disabilities]] that applied to them (especially those in the [[Test and Corporation Acts]]). The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828. Numerous reforms of voting rights, especially that of 1832, increased the political power of Dissenters. They demanded an end to compulsory church rates, in which local taxes went only to Anglican churches. They finally achieved the end of religious tests for university degrees in 1905. Gladstone brought the majority of Dissenters around to support for Home Rule for Ireland, putting the dissenting Protestants in league with the Irish Roman Catholics in an otherwise unlikely alliance. The Dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement. The [[nonconformist conscience]], as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy.<ref>D. W. Bebbington, ''The Nonconformist Conscience: Chapel and Politics, 1870\u20131914'' (George Allen & Unwin, 1982).</ref> In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket. In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales.<ref>David L. Wykes, \"Introduction: Parliament and Dissent from the Restoration to the Twentieth Century\", ''Parliamentary History'' (2005) 24#1, pp. 1\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the 1820s, the different Nonconformists, including [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]], Baptists, Congregationalists and Unitarians, had formed the Committee of Dissenting Deputies and agitated for repeal of the highly restrictive Test and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation]] Acts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Angus Hawkins|title=Victorian Political Culture: 'Habits of Heart and Mind'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PcJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|year=2015|publisher=Oxford UP|page=84|isbn=9780191044144}}</ref> These Acts excluded Nonconformists from holding civil or military office or attending Oxford or Cambridge, compelling them to set up their own [[Dissenting Academies]] privately.<ref>Iain MacAllister et al., \"Yellow fever? The political geography of Liberal voting in Great Britain\", ''Political Geography'' (2002) 21#4, pp. 421\u2013447.</ref> The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] tended to be in favour of these Acts and so the Nonconformist cause was linked closely to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who advocated civil and religious liberty. After the Test and Corporation Acts were [[Sacramental Test Act 1828|repealed in 1828]], all the Nonconformists elected to Parliament were Liberals. Nonconformists were angered by the [[Education Act 1902]], which integrated Church of England denominational schools into the state system and provided for their support from taxes. [[John Clifford (minister)|John Clifford]] formed the National Passive Resistance Committee and by 1906 over 170 Nonconformists had gone to prison for refusing to pay school taxes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2011|p=66}}</ref> They included 60 [[Primitive Methodists]], 48 Baptists, 40 Congregationalists and 15 Wesleyan Methodists.\n\nThe political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularisation of British society in the 20th century. The rise of the Labour Party reduced the Liberal Party strongholds into the nonconformist and remote \"Celtic Fringe\", where the party survived by an emphasis on localism and historic religious identity, thereby neutralising much of the class pressure on behalf of the Labour movement.<ref>Iain MacAllister et al., \"Yellow fever? The political geography of Liberal voting in Great Britain\", ''Political Geography'' (2002) 21#4, pp. 421\u2013447.</ref> Meanwhile, the Anglican church was a bastion of strength for the Conservative party. On the Irish issue, the Anglicans strongly supported unionism. Increasingly after 1850, the Roman Catholic element in England and Scotland was composed of recent immigrants from Ireland.

By the end of the 19th century, it had formed four governments under [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]]. Despite being divided over the issue of [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the following year's general election]].\n\nUnder [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime ministers]] [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (1905\u20131908) and [[H. H. Asquith]] (1908\u20131916), the Liberal Party passed the [[Liberal welfare reforms|welfare reforms]] that created a basic British [[welfare state]]. Although Asquith was [[Leader of the Liberal Party (UK)|the party's leader]], its dominant figure was [[David Lloyd George]]. Asquith was overwhelmed by the [[World War I|wartime]] role of [[Asquith coalition ministry|coalition]] prime minister and Lloyd George replaced him as prime minister in late 1916, but Asquith remained as Liberal Party leader. The pair fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process.<ref>Michael Fry (1988). \"Political Change in Britain, August 1914 to December 1916: Lloyd George Replaces Asquith: The Issues Underlying the Drama\".

By the end of the 1920s, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had replaced the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rival. The Liberal Party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general elections. Apart from notable [[by-election]] victories, its fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the [[SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance]] with the newly formed [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) in 1981. At the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], the Alliance won over a quarter of the vote, but only 23 of the 650 seats it contested. At the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]], its share of the vote fell below 23% and the Liberals and Social Democratic Party merged in 1988 to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. A splinter group reconstituted the [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]] in 1989. \n\nProminent intellectuals associated with the Liberal Party include the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]], the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and social planner [[William Beveridge]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:palmerston.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Viscount Palmerston]]]]\nThe Liberal Party grew out of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who had their origins in an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] faction in the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the early 19th century [[Radicals (UK)|Radicals]]. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of the Crown and increasing the power of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of [[democracy]] for its own sake. The great figures of reformist [[Whiggism|Whiggery]] were [[Charles James Fox]] (died 1806) and his disciple and successor [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]]. After decades in opposition, the Whigs returned to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] in 1832.\n\nThe Reform Act was the climax of Whiggism, but it also brought about the Whigs' demise. The admission of the [[middle class]]es to the franchise and to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] led eventually to the development of a systematic middle class liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey's retirement, the party was led first by [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne|Lord Melbourne]], a fairly traditional Whig, and then by [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and by [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]], a renegade Irish [[Tory]] and essentially a [[conservatism|conservative]], although capable of radical gestures.\n\nAs early as 1839, Russell had adopted the name of \"Liberals\", but in reality his party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the [[House of Lords]] and Radicals in the Commons. The leading Radicals were [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]], who represented the manufacturing towns which had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the [[Church of England]] (many Liberals were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]]), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business) and above all [[free trade]]. For a century, free trade remained the one cause which could unite all Liberals.\n\nIn 1841, the Liberals lost office to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] under [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], but their period in [[Official Opposition (United Kingdom)|opposition]] was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]], a free trade issue; and a faction known as the [[Peelite]]s (but not Peel himself, who died soon after) defected to the Liberal side. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston and the Peelite [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. A leading Peelite was [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who was a reforming [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston's second government.\n\nHowever, the Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the \"Two Terrible Old Men\", Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston's death in 1865 and Russell's retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative government (during which the [[Reform Act 1867|Second Reform Act]] was passed by agreement between the parties), Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the [[National Liberal Federation]] in 1877. The philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] was also a Liberal MP from 1865 to 1868.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/mill_john_stuart.shtml|title=John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Gladstonian era ===\n[[File:Acgladstone2.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Ewart Gladstone]]]]\nFor the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. [[William Ewart Gladstone]] served as prime minister four times (1868\u201374, 1880\u201385, 1886, and 1892\u201394). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and ''[[laissez-faire]]'', were suited to a developing capitalist society, but they could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the \"Grand Old Man\" later in life, Gladstone was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to the [[working class]] and to the lower middle class. Deeply religious, Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics, with his evangelical sensibility and his opposition to aristocracy.<ref>J. P. Parry, ''Democracy and Religion: Gladstone and the Liberal Party, 1867\u20131875'' (1989), p. 174.</ref> His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal Party.<ref>H. C. G. Matthew, \"Gladstone, William Ewart (1809\u20131898)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004).</ref><ref>J. L. Hammond and M. R. D. Foot, ''Gladstone and Liberalism'' (1952).</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements, but he did not resist the realities of imperialism. For example, he ordered the occupation of [[History of Egypt under the British|Egypt]] by British forces in 1882.<ref>R. C. Mowat, \"From Liberalism to Imperialism: The Case of Egypt 1875\u20131887\", ''Historical Journal'' 16#1 (1973), pp. 109\u2013124 focus on Lord Cromer as a Liberal imperialist. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2637918 online].</ref> His goal was to create a European order based on co-operation rather than conflict and on mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the [[rule of law]] was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious [[Concert of Europe]] was opposed to and ultimately defeated by a [[Bismarckian]] system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.<ref>Graham D. Goodlad, ''British foreign and imperial policy, 1865\u20131919'' (2000), p. 21.</ref>\n\nAs prime minister from 1868 to 1874, Gladstone headed a Liberal Party which was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs and Radicals. He was now a spokesman for \"peace, economy and reform\". One major achievement was the [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Elementary Education Act of 1870]], which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time. He also secured the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the army and of religious tests for admission to Oxford and Cambridge; the introduction of the secret ballot in elections; the legalization of trade unions; and the reorganization of the judiciary in the Judicature Act.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title=Access to History, Government and Reform: Britain 1815\u20131918|edition=2|pages=56\u201357|publisher=[[Hodder & Stoughton]]|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nRegarding Ireland, the major Liberal achievements were land reform, where he [[Irish Land Acts|ended centuries of landlord oppression]], and the [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablishment]] of the (Anglican) [[Church of Ireland]] through the [[Irish Church Act 1869]].\n\nIn the [[1874 United Kingdom general election|1874 general election]] Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] during a sharp economic recession. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Marquess of Hartington]], but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli's pro-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the [[Midlothian campaign]]. The Liberals won a large majority in the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.\n\n==== Ireland and Home Rule ====\nAmong the consequences of the [[Third Reform Act]] (1884) was the giving of the vote to many Catholics in Ireland. In the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]] the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power in the House of Commons, and demanded [[Irish Home Rule]] as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong [[Liberal Unionist]] faction led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]], along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it. The Irish Home Rule bill proposed to offer all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years' purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a costly rescue operation for the landed \u00e9lite.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2639536|title = The Liberal Party and Gladstone's Land Purchase Bill of 1886|journal = The Historical Journal|volume = 32|issue = 3|pages = 627\u2013641|last1 = Goodlad|first1 = Graham D.|year = 1989|doi = 10.1017/S0018246X00012450}}</ref> Further, Home Rule had not been promised in the Liberals' election manifesto, and so the impression was given that Gladstone was buying Irish support in a rather desperate manner to hold on to power.\n\nThe result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the [[1886 United Kingdom general election|1886 election]] at the hands of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who was supported by the breakaway [[Liberal Unionist Party]]. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords.\n\n==== Newcastle Programme ====\n{{main|Newcastle Programme}}\nHistorically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. Following the Queen, High Society in London largely ostracized home rulers and Liberal clubs were badly split. [[Joseph Chamberlain]] took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party called Liberal Unionism on the Irish issue. It collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party.<ref>[[R. C. K. Ensor]], ''England 1870\u20131914'' (1936), pp. 206\u2013207.</ref><ref>Peter Fraser, \"The Liberal Unionist Alliance: Chamberlain, Hartington, and the Conservatives, 1886\u20131904.\" ''English Historical Review'' 77#302 (1962): 53\u201378.</ref> The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted [[The Newcastle Programme]] that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=A Short History of the Liberal Party: The Road Back to Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1p9DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=24\u201326|isbn=9781137056078}}</ref>\n\n==== Relations with trade unions ====\nA major long-term consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of [[Liberal-Labour (UK)|Lib-Lab]] candidates, in the absence of any committed [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) into single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received sponsorship and endorsement from [[trade union]]s. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard: in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer Whigs were selected as candidates.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearce|first=Robert and Stearn, Roger|title=Access to History, Government and Reform: Britain 1815\u20131918|edition=2|page=74|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|year=2000}}</ref>\n\n==== Reform policies ====\nA broad range of interventionist reforms were introduced by the 1892\u20131895 Liberal government. Amongst other measures, standards of accommodation and of teaching in schools were improved, factory inspection was made more stringent, and ministers used their powers to increase the wages and reduce the working hours of large numbers of male workers employed by the state.<ref>[[Kenneth O. Morgan]], ''The Age of Lloyd George: Liberal Party and British Politics, 1890\u20131929''.</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHistorian Walter L. Arnstein concludes:\n:Notable as the Gladstonian reforms had been, they had almost all remained within the nineteenth-century Liberal tradition of gradually removing the religious, economic, and political barriers that prevented men of varied creeds and classes from exercising their individual talents in order to improve themselves and their society. As the third quarter of the century drew to a close, the essential bastions of Victorianism still held firm: respectability; a government of aristocrats and gentlemen now influenced not only by middle-class merchants and manufacturers but also by industrious working people; a prosperity that seemed to rest largely on the tenets of laissez-faire economics; and a Britannia that ruled the waves and many a dominion beyond.<ref>Walter L. Arnstein, ''Britain Yesterday and Today: 1832 the Present'' (6th ed. 1992), p. 125.</ref>\n\n=== After Gladstone ===\nGladstone finally retired in 1894. Gladstone's support for Home Rule deeply divided the party, and it lost its upper and upper-middle-class base, while keeping support among Protestant nonconformists and the Celtic fringe. Historian [[R. C. K. Ensor]] reports that after 1886, the main Liberal Party was deserted by practically the entire whig peerage and the great majority of the upper-class and upper-middle-class members. High prestige London clubs that had a Liberal base were deeply split. Ensor notes that, \"London society, following the known views of the Queen, practically ostracized home rulers.\" <ref>R. C. K. Ensor, ''England 1870\u20131914'' (1936), p. 207.</ref>\n\nThe new Liberal leader was the ineffectual [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]].

Many Conservatives (including Winston Churchill) had recently protested against high tariff moves by the Conservatives by switching to the anti-tariff Liberal camp, but it was unclear how many old Conservative traits they brought along, especially on military and naval issues.<ref>{{cite book|author=F.

The working-class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging Labour Party. One uniting element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a device to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics. All Liberals were outraged when Conservatives used their majority in the House of Lords to block reform legislation.<ref>R. C. K.

The policies of the New Liberalism are now known as [[social liberalism]].<ref>[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).</ref>\n\n[[File:ChurchillGeorge0001.jpg|thumb|Liberal politicians [[David Lloyd George]] and [[Winston Churchill]] enacted the 1909 [[People's Budget]] which specifically aimed at the redistribution of wealth.]]\nThe New Liberals included intellectuals like [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse|L.

New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented, and interventionist state.<ref>''The Routledge encyclopaedia of philosophy'' (2016), p. 599 [https://www.rep.routledge.com/ online].</ref>\n\nAfter the historic 1906 victory, the Liberal Party introduced multiple reforms on range of issues, including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]]. Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The [[People's Budget]] of 1909, championed by [[David Lloyd George]] and fellow Liberal [[Winston Churchill]], introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies.<ref>Geoffrey Lee \u2013 [http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf \"The People's Budget: An Edwardian Tragedy\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305182535/http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/images/inside_image/The_People_Budget.pdf|date=5 March 2012}}</ref> It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public.

The new money was to be made available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships.

The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], former prime minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone's personal secretary, [[John Morley]]. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. Harcourt's resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal figures H. H. Asquith, Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's \"methods of barbarism\" in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, [[Arthur Balfour]], pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as the [[Education Act 1902]] and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs.\n\nCampbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to [[1906 United Kingdom general election|the greatest election victory]] in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right.<ref>Goldman, Lawrence. \"Oxford DNB theme: The general election of 1906\" [http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95348.html online].</ref><ref>A.

Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died soon after. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government's radicalism.

This included the regulation of working hours, [[National Insurance]] and welfare.\n\n[[File:Punch cartoon 28 April 1909.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Cartoonist [[John Bernard Partridge]] depicts Lloyd George as a giant with a cudgel labelled \"Budget\" in reference to his [[People's Budget]] while Asquith cowers beneath the table, ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 28 April 1909]]\nA political battle erupted over the [[People's Budget]] and resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the [[House of Lords]] to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, being left once again dependent on the [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Nationalists]].\n\nAs a result, Asquith was forced to introduce a new [[Third Home Rule Act|third Home Rule bill]] in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, the Unionist's [[Ulster Volunteers]] led by Sir [[Edward Carson]], launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in [[Northern Ireland|Ulster]] and the threat of mass resignation of their commissions by army officers in Ireland in 1914 (''see [[Curragh Incident]]''). In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, [[Bonar Law]], was of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] descent. The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when the [[World War I|First World War]] broke out in August 1914. Historian [[George Dangerfield]] has argued that the multiplicity of crises in 1910 to 1914, before the war broke out, so weakened the Liberal coalition that it marked the ''[[Strange Death of Liberal England]]''.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''The Strange Death of Liberal England: 1910\u20131914'' (1935).</ref> However, most historians date the collapse to the crisis of the First World War.\n\n=== Decline ===\n{{further|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War|David Lloyd George}}\nThe Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for measures that the Party had long  rejected.  The result was the permanent destruction of the ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government.  Historian [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]] explains the dilemma:\n{{quote|[T]he Liberals were traditionally the party of freedom of speech, conscience and trade. They were against jingoism, heavy armaments and compulsion. [...] Liberals were neither wholehearted nor unanimous about conscription, censorship,  the [[Defence of the Realm Act]], severity toward aliens and pacifists, direction of labour and industry. The Conservatives [...] had no such misgivings.<ref>Robert Blake, ''The Decline of Power: 1915\u20131964'' (1985), p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nBlake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of ''realpolitik'' and the balance of power.<ref>Blake, ''The Decline of Power'' (1985), p. 3.</ref> However, Lloyd George and Churchill were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-orientated Liberals out. \n\nAsquith was blamed for the poor British performance in the first year. Since the Liberals ran the war without consulting the Conservatives, there were heavy partisan attacks. However, even Liberal commentators were dismayed by the lack of energy at the top. At the time, public opinion was intensely hostile, both in the media and in the street, against any young man in civilian garb and labeled as a slacker. The leading Liberal newspaper, the ''Manchester Guardian'' complained:\n{{quote|The fact that the Government has not dared to challenge the nation to rise above itself, is one among many signs. [...] The war is, in fact, not being taken seriously. [...] How can any slacker be blamed when the Government itself is slack.<ref>''Manchester Guardian'' 1 May 1915, editorial, in {{cite book|author=Trevor Wilson|title=The Downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914\u20131935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PyvNxXVMg4C&pg=PT37|year=1966|page=51|isbn=9780571280223}}</ref>}}\n\nAsquith's Liberal government was brought down in {{Nowrap|May 1915}}, due in particular to a [[Shell Crisis of 1915|crisis in inadequate artillery shell production]] and the protest resignation of [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral Fisher]] over the disastrous  [[Gallipoli Campaign]] against Turkey. Reluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition government on 25 May, with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own Liberal party and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Unionist (Conservative) party]], along with a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a half, and was the last time Liberals controlled the government.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1876582|title = Asquith's Predicament, 1914-1918|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 283\u2013303|last1 = McGill|first1 = Barry|year = 1967|doi = 10.1086/240083}}</ref> The analysis of historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] is that the British people were so deeply divided over numerous issues, But on all sides there was growing distrust of the Asquith government. There was no agreement whatsoever on wartime issues. The leaders of the two parties realized that embittered debates in Parliament would further undermine popular morale and so the House of Commons did not once discuss the war before May 1915. Taylor argues:<ref>{{cite book|author=A.J.P.

[...] Entering the war for idealistic motives, the Liberals wished to fight it by noble means and found it harder to abandon their principles than to endure defeat in the field.}}\n\nThe 1915 coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it instead to Lloyd George, who became prime minister at the head of a new coalition largely made up of Conservatives.<ref>Kenneth O.

He insisted on strong government controls over business as opposed to the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' attitudes of traditional Liberals. He insisted on conscription of young men into the Army, a position that deeply troubled his old colleagues. That brought him and a few like-minded Liberals into the new coalition on the ground long occupied by Conservatives. There was no more planning for world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfit with aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the party, says historian Trevor Wilson, was its repudiation by ideological Liberals, who decided sadly that it no longer represented their principles. Finally the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal performance.<ref>Trevor Wilson, ''The Downfall of the Liberal Party: 1914\u20131935'' (1966), pp. 23\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|David Lloyd George]]\nIn the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]], Lloyd George, hailed as \"the Man Who Won the War\", led his coalition into a [[khaki election]]. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader [[Bonar Law]] wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates\u2014this \"[[The Coalition Coupon|coupon]]\", as it became known, was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. The coalition won a massive victory as the Asquithian Liberals and  Labour were decimated. Those remaining Liberal MPs who were opposed to the Coalition Government went into opposition under the parliamentary leadership of [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald MacLean]] who also became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Asquith, who had appointed MacLean, remained as overall Leader of the Liberal Party even though he lost his seat in 1918. Asquith returned to parliament in 1920 and resumed leadership. Between 1919\u20131923, the anti-Lloyd George  Liberals were called Asquithian Liberals, [[Wee Free]] Liberals<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beaverbrook|first1=Lord|title=The Decline and Fall of Lloyd George|date=1963|publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce|location=New York|pages=290\u2013291|edition=first|url=https://archive.org/stream/declineandfallof006894mbp#page/n319/mode/2up/search/wee|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> or [[Independent Liberal Party (UK, 1918)|Independent Liberals]].<ref>Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970''.</ref>\n\nLloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party who numerically dominated the coalition. In 1922, the Conservative backbenchers [[Carlton Club meeting|rebelled]] against the continuation of the coalition, citing, in particular, Lloyd George's plan for war with Turkey in the [[Chanak Crisis]], and his corrupt sale of honours. He resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by [[Bonar Law]].\n\nAt the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] and [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 elections]] the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922, Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative prime minister Stanley Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] but made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour\u2014a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could obtain support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. However, instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense, but it was a fatal error.\n\n[[File:UK popular vote.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Share of the vote received by Conservatives (blue), Whigs/Liberals/Liberal Democrats (orange), Labour (red) and others (grey) in general elections since 1832<ref>Table 2.01 \"Summary Results of General Elections 1832\u20132005 (UK)\", ''British electoral facts, 1832\u20132006'', by Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, 7th edition, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-2712-8}}, p. 59.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/|title=Election 2010 Results|work=BBC News}}</ref> shows that following success as the successor to the Whig party, the party's share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition Liberals]]\nLabour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left. [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was forced into a [[1924 United Kingdom general election|snap election in 1924]] and although his government was defeated he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished, and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labour. Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as [[Michael Foot]] and [[Tony Benn]], were the sons of Liberal MPs.\n\nAsquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called ''We Can Conquer Unemployment!'', largely written for him by the Liberal economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed, the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast, most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the [[Celtic fringe]], where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members, holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the [[Instant-runoff voting|alternative vote]], but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice versa.<ref>[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars, 1918\u20131940'' (1955).</ref>\n\nThe last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906. The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces. Other issues of the period included [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Irish Home Rule]] movement. After the carnage of 1914\u20131918, the democratic reforms of the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] instantly tripled the number of people entitled to vote in Britain from seven to twenty-one million. The Labour Party benefited most from this huge change in the electorate, forming its [[First Labour Government (UK)|first minority government in 1924]].<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965).</ref>\n\n=== Splits over the National Government ===\n[[File:Gws samuel 01.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]]]]\nIn 1931 MacDonald's government fell apart in response to the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], and the Liberals agreed to join his [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]], dominated by the Conservatives. Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join. Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|only a few MPs and candidates followed]]. Another group under [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]] pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk \u2013 the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal Nationals]] (officially the \"National Liberals\" after 1947) led by Simon, also known as \"Simonites\", and the \"Samuelites\" or \"official Liberals\", led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.\n\nThe official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to [[protectionism]]. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of [[Cabinet collective responsibility|collective responsibility]] to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the [[Ottawa Conference|Ottawa Agreement]] on [[Imperial Preference]]. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as [[Independent Liberals (UK, 1931)|independent Liberals]]. Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as [[Clement Davies]], who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during [[World War II]] and who would lead it after the war.\n\n=== Near extinction ===\nSamuel had lost his seat in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 election]] and the leadership of the party fell to [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Sir Archibald Sinclair]]. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the [[appeasement]] foreign policy of the British government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party's weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the [[Midlothian Campaign]] and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.\n\nIn 1940, they joined Churchill's wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as [[Secretary of State for Air]], the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party's lack of importance that they were not included in the [[War Cabinet]]; some leading party members founded [[Radical Action]], a group which called for liberal candidates to break the [[war-time electoral pact]].<ref>Chris Cook, ''A Short History of the Liberal Party: 1900 \u2013 2001'', pp. 268\u2013269.</ref> At the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminster,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1945_over.stm|title=1945: Labour landslide buries Churchill|work=The election battles 1945\u20131997|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> but this was just the beginning of the decline.

The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.\n\n=== Liberal revival ===\n[[File:Jo Grimond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Jo Grimond]]]]\nThrough the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, [[Bolton]] and [[Huddersfield]], local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town's two seats. [[Jo Grimond]], for example, who became Liberal leader in 1956, was MP for the remote [[Orkney and Shetland (UK Parliament constituency)|Orkney and Shetland]] islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the [[1962 Orpington by-election|Orpington by-election]] of March 1962 which was won by [[Eric Lubbock, 4th Baron Avebury|Eric Lubbock]]. There, the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.\n\nThe Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the [[European Economic Community]]. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.\n\nThe new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, [[Jeremy Thorpe]], the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote, but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although [[Emlyn Hooson]] held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon [[Clement Davies]] death in 1962, the party lost five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966, the [[Welsh Liberal Party]] formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.<ref>Russell Deacon (2011), History of the Welsh Liberal party, Welsh Academic Press.</ref>\n\nIn local elections, [[Liverpool]] remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the [[1973 United Kingdom local elections|elections]] to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jeffery|first=David|date=2017-08-01|title=The strange death of Tory Liverpool: Conservative electoral decline in Liverpool, 1945\u20131996|journal=British Politics|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=386\u2013407|doi=10.1057/s41293-016-0032-6|issn=1746-918X}}</ref> In the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats. The Conservatives were unable to form a government due to the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionist]] MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the [[Home Office]] if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing [[proportional representation]] and a change of prime minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead, a minority Labour government was formed under [[Harold Wilson]] but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]], the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.\n\nThorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations that he attempted to have his homosexual lover murdered by a hitman. The party's new leader, [[David Steel]], negotiated the [[Lib-Lab pact]] with Wilson's successor as prime minister, [[James Callaghan]]. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of [[proportional representation]] was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson [[John Pardoe]] and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], who were mutually antagonistic.\n\n=== Alliance, Liberal Democrats and reconstituted Liberal Party ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|upright=0.7|The symbol of the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats]] -->\n{{main|SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance|Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Party (UK, 1989)}}\nThe Conservative Party under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]] won the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.\n\nIn 1981, defectors from a moderate faction of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]] and [[Shirley Williams]], founded the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP). The new party and the Liberals quickly formed the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance, which for a while polled as high as 50% in the opinion polls and appeared capable of winning the next general election. Indeed, Steel was so confident of an Alliance victory that he told the 1981 Liberal conference, \"Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3185313.stm|work=BBC News|title=Conference season's greatest hits|date=10 September 2003|accessdate=7 April 2010|first=Ollie|last=Stone-Lee}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Alliance was overtaken in the polls by the Tories in the aftermath of the [[Falkland Islands War]] and at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] the Conservatives were re-elected by a landslide, with Labour once again forming the opposition. While the SDP\u2013Liberal Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes (a share of more than 25%), it only had 23 MPs compared to Labour's 209.<ref>{{cite book|author=Keith Laybourn and Christine F.

In the election's aftermath Steel proposed a merger of the two parties. Most SDP members voted in favour of the merger, but SDP leader [[David Owen]] objected and continued to lead a \"rump\" SDP.\n\nIn March 1988, the Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party merged to create the Social and Liberal Democrats, renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm|work=BBC News|title=SDP: Breaking the mould|date=25 January 2001}}</ref> Over two-thirds of Liberal members joined the merged party, along with all sitting MPs.

Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007, but the Liberal Party as reconstituted in 1989 [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989) election results|continues to hold council seats and field candidates in Westminster Parliamentary elections]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Leeds Town Hall, General Election results.jpg|thumb|A crowd waits outside [[Leeds Town Hall]] to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 general elections]].]]\nDuring the 19th century, the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called [[classical liberalism]], supporting ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policies such as [[free trade]] and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed [[Gladstonian liberalism]] after the [[Victorian era]] Liberal prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of [[the Crown]] and the [[Church of England]] (many of them were [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]]) and an extension of the electoral [[Suffrage|franchise]]. Sir [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]], a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about [[liberalism]] in 1872: <blockquote>If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this\u2014that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world. [...] It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.<ref>''The Times'' (31 December 1872), p. 5.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe political terms of \"modern\", \"progressive\" or \"new\" Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.<ref>W. H. Greenleaf, ''The British Political Tradition. Volume II: The Ideological Heritage'' (London: Methuen, 1983), p. 143.</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, the Liberals stance began to shift towards \"New Liberalism\", what would today be called [[social liberalism]], namely a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of [[welfare]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/higher/history/liberal/impact1_rev.shtml|title=Education Scotland \u2013 Higher Bitesize Revision \u2013 History \u2013 Liberal \u2013 Impact: Revision 1|work=BBC News|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of [[H.

The Liberals as expressed in the ''[[Liberal Yellow Book]]'' now regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] extremists.<ref>Liberal Industrial Inquiry, ''Britain's Industrial Future'' (London: Ernest Benn, 1928), p. 453.</ref>\n\nAfter nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and the 1950s, the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of [[Jo Grimond]] in the 1960s by positioning itself as a [[Radical center (politics)|radical centrist]], non-[[Socialism|socialist]] alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdemmanifesto.com/1964/1964-liberal-manifesto.shtml|title=1964 Liberal Party Election Manifesto|publisher=Liberal / SDP / Libdem Manifestos|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious alignment ===\nSince 1660, [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] Protestants have played a major role in English politics. Relatively few MPs were [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. However the Dissenters were a major voting bloc in many areas, such as the East Midlands.<ref>Henry Pelling, ''Social Geography of British Elections, 1885\u20131910'' (London, 1967), 89\u201390, 206.</ref> They were very well organised and highly motivated and largely won over the Whigs and Liberals to their cause. Down to the 1830s, Dissenters demanded removal of [[political and civil disabilities]] that applied to them (especially those in the [[Test and Corporation Acts]]). The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828. Numerous reforms of voting rights, especially that of 1832, increased the political power of Dissenters. They demanded an end to compulsory church rates, in which local taxes went only to Anglican churches. They finally achieved the end of religious tests for university degrees in 1905. Gladstone brought the majority of Dissenters around to support for Home Rule for Ireland, putting the dissenting Protestants in league with the Irish Roman Catholics in an otherwise unlikely alliance. The Dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement. The [[nonconformist conscience]], as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy.<ref>D. W. Bebbington, ''The Nonconformist Conscience: Chapel and Politics, 1870\u20131914'' (George Allen & Unwin, 1982).</ref> In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket. In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales.<ref>David L. Wykes, \"Introduction: Parliament and Dissent from the Restoration to the Twentieth Century\", ''Parliamentary History'' (2005) 24#1, pp. 1\u201326.</ref>\n\nBy the 1820s, the different Nonconformists, including [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Methodists]], Baptists, Congregationalists and Unitarians, had formed the Committee of Dissenting Deputies and agitated for repeal of the highly restrictive Test and [[Corporation Act 1661|Corporation]] Acts.<ref>{{cite book|author=Angus Hawkins|title=Victorian Political Culture: 'Habits of Heart and Mind'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PcJCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA84|year=2015|publisher=Oxford UP|page=84|isbn=9780191044144}}</ref> These Acts excluded Nonconformists from holding civil or military office or attending Oxford or Cambridge, compelling them to set up their own [[Dissenting Academies]] privately.<ref>Iain MacAllister et al., \"Yellow fever? The political geography of Liberal voting in Great Britain\", ''Political Geography'' (2002) 21#4, pp. 421\u2013447.</ref> The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] tended to be in favour of these Acts and so the Nonconformist cause was linked closely to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], who advocated civil and religious liberty. After the Test and Corporation Acts were [[Sacramental Test Act 1828|repealed in 1828]], all the Nonconformists elected to Parliament were Liberals. Nonconformists were angered by the [[Education Act 1902]], which integrated Church of England denominational schools into the state system and provided for their support from taxes. [[John Clifford (minister)|John Clifford]] formed the National Passive Resistance Committee and by 1906 over 170 Nonconformists had gone to prison for refusing to pay school taxes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mitchell|2011|p=66}}</ref> They included 60 [[Primitive Methodists]], 48 Baptists, 40 Congregationalists and 15 Wesleyan Methodists.\n\nThe political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularisation of British society in the 20th century. The rise of the Labour Party reduced the Liberal Party strongholds into the nonconformist and remote \"Celtic Fringe\", where the party survived by an emphasis on localism and historic religious identity, thereby neutralising much of the class pressure on behalf of the Labour movement.<ref>Iain MacAllister et al., \"Yellow fever? The political geography of Liberal voting in Great Britain\", ''Political Geography'' (2002) 21#4, pp. 421\u2013447.</ref> Meanwhile, the Anglican church was a bastion of strength for the Conservative party. On the Irish issue, the Anglicans strongly supported unionism. Increasingly after 1850, the Roman Catholic element in England and Scotland was composed of recent immigrants from Ireland. They voted largely for the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] until its collapse in 1918.\n\n== Liberal leaders ==\n=== Liberal Leaders in the House of Lords ===\n* [[Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville]] (1859\u20131865)\n* [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]] (1865\u20131868)\n* [[Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville]] (1868\u20131891)\n* [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley]] (1891\u20131894)\n* [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]] (1894\u20131896)\n* [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley]] (1896\u20131902)\n* [[John Spencer, 5th Earl Spencer]] (1902\u20131905)\n* [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon]] (1905\u20131908)\n* [[Robert Offley Ashburton Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe]] (1908\u20131923)\n* [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]] (1923\u20131924)\n* [[William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp]] (1924\u20131931)\n* [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading]] (1931\u20131936)\n* [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe]] (1936\u20131944)\n* [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel]] (1944\u20131955)\n* [[Philip Rea, 2nd Baron Rea]] (1955\u20131967)\n* [[Frank Byers, Baron Byers]] (1967\u20131984)\n* [[Nancy Seear, Baroness Seear]] (1984\u20131989)\n\n=== Liberal Leaders in the House of Commons ===\n* [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]] (1859\u20131865)\n* [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (1865\u20131875)\n* [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Spencer Compton Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington]] (1875\u20131880)\n* [[William Ewart Gladstone]] (1880\u20131894)\n* [[William Harcourt (politician)|Sir William Harcourt]] (1894\u20131898)\n* [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] (1899\u20131908)\n* [[H.
