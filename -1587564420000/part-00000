The network is highly dynamic and totally decentralized. It also takes care of other nodes learning about your node existing, for without peers using your node, there would be no traffic to blend yours with.

To escape the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other instabilities, a Nomad leader called Nikola Quercus (known as god Nicholas Quirke by the time of the book) installed huge engines and wheels on London, and enabled it to dismantle (or eat) other cities for resources. The technology rapidly spread, and evolved into what is known as \"Municipal Darwinism\". Although the planet has since become stable, Municipal Darwinism has spread to most of the world except for some parts of Asia and Africa. Because scientific progress has almost completely halted and much technological and scientific knowledge was lost during the war, \"Old Tech\" is highly prized and recovered by scavengers and archaeologists. Europe, some of Asia, North Africa, [[Antarctica]], and the [[Arctic]] are dominated by Traction Cities, whereas North America was so ravaged by the war that it is often identified as \"the dead continent\", and the rest of the world is the stronghold of the Anti-Traction League, which seeks to keep cities from moving and thus stop the intense consumption of the planet's remaining resources.\n\n[[London]] is the principal Traction City in the novel, which has returned to a Victorian-era society. London's society is divided into four major and a number of minor [[Guild]]s. The Engineers are responsible for maintaining the machines necessary for the survival of London, many of which are found by the Guild of Historians. The Historians are in charge of collecting and preserving highly prized, often dangerous artefacts. The Navigators are responsible for steering and plotting the course of London. The Merchants are in charge of running London's economy. London is officially ruled by an elected [[Mayor of London|Mayor]]. The [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] is Magnus Crome, who is also the head of the Guild of Engineers. Like most Traction Cities, London is built on a series of tiers. This encourages the system of [[social classes]], with the wealthier nobles at the top of the city and the lower classes further down, closer to the noise and pollution of the city's massive engines. Atop the whole of London sits [[St Paul's Cathedral]]: the only building known to have survived the Sixty Minute War.\n\n===Plot===\nThe book starts with the traction city of London chasing and catching a small mining town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy, a teenage Apprentice Historian, is sent to the \"Gut\" of London, where towns are stripped for resources, after he skips a chore. Tom incidentally meets the Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine, along with his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook's residents, teenager Hester Shaw, attempts to assassinate Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a disfiguring scar on her face and claims Valentine caused it, before escaping the London police through a chute. When Tom informs Valentine of her name, Valentine pushes him down into the chute. Tom and Hester recover outside of London within the Hunting Ground, and after an argument start following the city's tracks to reboard it.\n\nThe pair eventually boards a small town called Speedwell, where the owner Orme Wreyland drugs them and plans to sell the pair as slaves for profit at a trading cluster. Tom and Hester escape from Wreyland, meeting a friendly airship pilot called Anna Fang, who takes them in her airship the ''Jenny Haniver'' to the neutral flying city of Airhaven where they can find passage to London. At Airhaven, they are then attacked by a [[cyborg]] \"Stalker\" called Shrike, who was sent after them by the London Mayor Magnus Crome to kill them and bring their bodies to him.\n\nTom and Hester escape by stealing a hot-air balloon and drift over the Hunting Ground. Hester reveals that when she was a child, her parents were killed by Valentine as they would not give up an Ancient machine. Valentine then injured her and believed that she was dead. Hester escaped, and Shrike took care of her for most of her childhood. Despite the fact that Shrike was not supposed to have feelings, he developed a fatherlike bond with her. Wanting to avenge her parents, Hester left Shrike despite his pleas for her to stay and travelled to London. Shrike followed her, reaching London first, but was captured by Crome and used to create more Stalkers for London.\n\nHester sees that a London-built scoutship is following them and lowers the balloon onto the Hunting Ground. The scoutship, with Shrike on board, finds the pair and the Stalker confronts them. Before he can explain why he wants Hester to die, two chasing towns run over him, and Tom and Hester manage to board the second of these, a pirate town called Tunbridge Wheels. The mayor, Chrysler Peavy, who knows Hester from her days with Shrike, frees Tom as he is a resident of London and Peavy wishes to learn etiquette worthy of a Londoner gentleman. Tom convinces him to free Hester, and Peavy informs them that he plans to consume the downed Airhaven. While charging at it over shallow water, Tunbridge Wheels beaches on a coral reef, sinking it whilst the survivors escape inland with Tom and Hester. Whilst attempting to feebly retake Airhaven, Peavy gets stuck in a bog and his pirate subordinates shoot him, then attempt to execute Tom and Hester, but Shrike intervenes and kills the remaining pirates. Shrike explains to Hester that Crome had agreed to resurrect her as a Stalker similar to him after he brings back her body. She agrees to this, but Tom intervenes by stabbing Shrike in the eye, shutting him down and saving her life.\n\nValentine is sent away by Crome on a \"secret mission\", much to Katherine's dismay. Suspicious of her father, Katherine begins investigating events in London with the help of Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod, whom she befriends after discovering he witnessed Tom chasing Hester. They discover that Valentine salvaged a monstrous ancient weapon called MEDUSA for London, and that the Guild of Engineers have reassembled it inside [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The Cathedral's dome splits open to reveal MEDUSA, which is then used to destroy a much larger city pursuing London.\n\nTom and Hester are rescued by Fang, who is revealed to be an Anti-Traction League agent, and takes them to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa which protects the nation-state of the League. Fang suspects that the weapon that London has reassembled will be used to destroy the Shield Wall, and warns League Governor Khan of MEDUSA. Khan is skeptical that London will attack, but Fang insists that they should bomb London to destroy the weapon. Convinced that the League will kill innocent people and angry at the idea of destroying his home, Tom storms out and discovers Valentine has infiltrated Batmunkh Gompa as a monk. Tom raises the alarm, but Valentine successfully cripples the League's northern fleet of airships. Valentine duels and kills Fang by stabbing her in the neck, before escaping in his own airship the ''13th Floor Elevator''. Tom and Hester take the ''Jenny Haniver'' and fly it back to London in the hope of stopping Valentine and MEDUSA themselves.\n\nWith MEDUSA finally launched, Crome begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League's base behind the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa in order to destroy their defenses and devour all of their settlements. After Valentine returns, Katherine learns that MEDUSA was originally found by Hester's mother Pandora, and that he had killed her to steal it for London. He also admits that Katherine was likely Hester's half sister. Disillusioned, and horrified by the destructive power of the weapon, Katherine and Bevis conspire to plant a bomb to destroy MEDUSA, but are caught in their attempt.\n\nThe Guild of Historians, led by Tom's boss Chudleigh Pomeroy, come to their aid, and battle with the Engineers. Katherine travels up to the Top Tier to Saint Paul's Cathedral, with Bevis disguised as her captor. Tom and Hester arrive, and Hester attempts to fight her way to Valentine to avenge her parents. Tom is attacked by the ''13th Floor Elevator'' above London and shoots it down. Bevis is killed when the airship crushes him, but Katherine is able to reach Saint Paul's Cathedral. Inside, she sees Hester brought before Valentine. When he attempts to kill her, Katherine jumps in her father's way and is fatally wounded. She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly putting aside their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can reach him.\n\nHester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city and killing Valentine. Hester tries to comfort a grief-stricken Tom as they fly away in the ''Jenny Haniver'', apparently the only survivors of the incident, and make their way to the Bird Roads.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page 2.

To escape the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other instabilities, a Nomad leader called Nikola Quercus (known as god Nicholas Quirke by the time of the book) installed huge engines and wheels on London, and enabled it to dismantle (or eat) other cities for resources. The technology rapidly spread, and evolved into what is known as \"Municipal Darwinism\". Although the planet has since become stable, Municipal Darwinism has spread to most of the world except for some parts of Asia and Africa. Because scientific progress has almost completely halted and much technological and scientific knowledge was lost during the war, \"Old Tech\" is highly prized and recovered by scavengers and archaeologists. Europe, some of Asia, North Africa, [[Antarctica]], and the [[Arctic]] are dominated by Traction Cities, whereas North America was so ravaged by the war that it is often identified as \"the dead continent\", and the rest of the world is the stronghold of the Anti-Traction League, which seeks to keep cities from moving and thus stop the intense consumption of the planet's remaining resources.\n\n[[London]] is the principal Traction City in the novel, which has returned to a Victorian-era society. London's society is divided into four major and a number of minor [[Guild]]s. The Engineers are responsible for maintaining the machines necessary for the survival of London, many of which are found by the Guild of Historians. The Historians are in charge of collecting and preserving highly prized, often dangerous artefacts. The Navigators are responsible for steering and plotting the course of London. The Merchants are in charge of running London's economy. London is officially ruled by an elected [[Mayor of London|Mayor]]. The [[Lord Mayor of London|Lord Mayor]] is Magnus Crome, who is also the head of the Guild of Engineers. Like most Traction Cities, London is built on a series of tiers. This encourages the system of [[social classes]], with the wealthier nobles at the top of the city and the lower classes further down, closer to the noise and pollution of the city's massive engines. Atop the whole of London sits [[St Paul's Cathedral]]: the only building known to have survived the Sixty Minute War.\n\n===Plot===\nThe book starts with the traction city of London chasing and catching a small mining town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy, a teenage Apprentice Historian, is sent to the \"Gut\" of London, where towns are stripped for resources, after he skips a chore. Tom incidentally meets the Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine, along with his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook's residents, teenager Hester Shaw, attempts to assassinate Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a disfiguring scar on her face and claims Valentine caused it, before escaping the London police through a chute. When Tom informs Valentine of her name, Valentine pushes him down into the chute. Tom and Hester recover outside of London within the Hunting Ground, and after an argument start following the city's tracks to reboard it.\n\nThe pair eventually boards a small town called Speedwell, where the owner Orme Wreyland drugs them and plans to sell the pair as slaves for profit at a trading cluster. Tom and Hester escape from Wreyland, meeting a friendly airship pilot called Anna Fang, who takes them in her airship the ''Jenny Haniver'' to the neutral flying city of Airhaven where they can find passage to London. At Airhaven, they are then attacked by a [[cyborg]] \"Stalker\" called Shrike, who was sent after them by the London Mayor Magnus Crome to kill them and bring their bodies to him.\n\nTom and Hester escape by stealing a hot-air balloon and drift over the Hunting Ground. Hester reveals that when she was a child, her parents were killed by Valentine as they would not give up an Ancient machine. Valentine then injured her and believed that she was dead. Hester escaped, and Shrike took care of her for most of her childhood. Despite the fact that Shrike was not supposed to have feelings, he developed a fatherlike bond with her. Wanting to avenge her parents, Hester left Shrike despite his pleas for her to stay and travelled to London. Shrike followed her, reaching London first, but was captured by Crome and used to create more Stalkers for London.\n\nHester sees that a London-built scoutship is following them and lowers the balloon onto the Hunting Ground. The scoutship, with Shrike on board, finds the pair and the Stalker confronts them. Before he can explain why he wants Hester to die, two chasing towns run over him, and Tom and Hester manage to board the second of these, a pirate town called Tunbridge Wheels. The mayor, Chrysler Peavy, who knows Hester from her days with Shrike, frees Tom as he is a resident of London and Peavy wishes to learn etiquette worthy of a Londoner gentleman. Tom convinces him to free Hester, and Peavy informs them that he plans to consume the downed Airhaven. While charging at it over shallow water, Tunbridge Wheels beaches on a coral reef, sinking it whilst the survivors escape inland with Tom and Hester. Whilst attempting to feebly retake Airhaven, Peavy gets stuck in a bog and his pirate subordinates shoot him, then attempt to execute Tom and Hester, but Shrike intervenes and kills the remaining pirates. Shrike explains to Hester that Crome had agreed to resurrect her as a Stalker similar to him after he brings back her body. She agrees to this, but Tom intervenes by stabbing Shrike in the eye, shutting him down and saving her life.\n\nValentine is sent away by Crome on a \"secret mission\", much to Katherine's dismay. Suspicious of her father, Katherine begins investigating events in London with the help of Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod, whom she befriends after discovering he witnessed Tom chasing Hester. They discover that Valentine salvaged a monstrous ancient weapon called MEDUSA for London, and that the Guild of Engineers have reassembled it inside [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The Cathedral's dome splits open to reveal MEDUSA, which is then used to destroy a much larger city pursuing London.\n\nTom and Hester are rescued by Fang, who is revealed to be an Anti-Traction League agent, and takes them to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa which protects the nation-state of the League. Fang suspects that the weapon that London has reassembled will be used to destroy the Shield Wall, and warns League Governor Khan of MEDUSA. Khan is skeptical that London will attack, but Fang insists that they should bomb London to destroy the weapon. Convinced that the League will kill innocent people and angry at the idea of destroying his home, Tom storms out and discovers Valentine has infiltrated Batmunkh Gompa as a monk. Tom raises the alarm, but Valentine successfully cripples the League's northern fleet of airships. Valentine duels and kills Fang by stabbing her in the neck, before escaping in his own airship the ''13th Floor Elevator''. Tom and Hester take the ''Jenny Haniver'' and fly it back to London in the hope of stopping Valentine and MEDUSA themselves.\n\nWith MEDUSA finally launched, Crome begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League's base behind the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa in order to destroy their defenses and devour all of their settlements. After Valentine returns, Katherine learns that MEDUSA was originally found by Hester's mother Pandora, and that he had killed her to steal it for London. He also admits that Katherine was likely Hester's half sister. Disillusioned, and horrified by the destructive power of the weapon, Katherine and Bevis conspire to plant a bomb to destroy MEDUSA, but are caught in their attempt.\n\nThe Guild of Historians, led by Tom's boss Chudleigh Pomeroy, come to their aid, and battle with the Engineers. Katherine travels up to the Top Tier to Saint Paul's Cathedral, with Bevis disguised as her captor. Tom and Hester arrive, and Hester attempts to fight her way to Valentine to avenge her parents. Tom is attacked by the ''13th Floor Elevator'' above London and shoots it down. Bevis is killed when the airship crushes him, but Katherine is able to reach Saint Paul's Cathedral. Inside, she sees Hester brought before Valentine. When he attempts to kill her, Katherine jumps in her father's way and is fatally wounded. She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly putting aside their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can reach him.\n\nHester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city and killing Valentine. Hester tries to comfort a grief-stricken Tom as they fly away in the ''Jenny Haniver'', apparently the only survivors of the incident, and make their way to the Bird Roads.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main HDM page 2.

A kiteboarder harnesses the [[wind power|power of the wind]] with a large controllable [[power kite]] to be propelled across the water, land, or snow.\n\nCompared to the other sailing sports, kiteboarding is both among the less expensive (including equipment) and the more convenient. It is also unique in that it harvests the wind energy from a much larger atmosphere volume, comparing to sail size.\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nIn the 1800s, George Pocock used [[kite]]s of increased size to propel carts on land and ships on the water, using a four-line control system\u2014the same system in common use today. Both carts and boats were able to turn and sail upwind. The kites could be flown for sustained periods.<ref name=\"Jelling\">Jakob Jelling [http://www.kitesurfingnow.com/kitesurfing-facts/history-of-kitesurfing.shtml History of kitesurfing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129054908/http://www.kitesurfingnow.com/kitesurfing-facts/history-of-kitesurfing.shtml |date=29 November 2006 }} Kitesurfingnow</ref> The intention was to establish kitepower as an alternative to horsepower, partly to avoid the hated \"horse tax\" that was levied at that time.<ref name=\"Lynn1\">Peter Lynn [http://www.aquilandiafestival.com/inter2-surf1.htm A brief history of kitesurfing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819073552/http://www.aquilandiafestival.com/inter2-surf1.htm |date=19 August 2006 }}, Aquilandia.com, 2006</ref> In 1903, aviation pioneer [[Samuel Cody]] developed \"[[man-lifting kite]]s\" and succeeded in crossing the [[English Channel]] in a small collapsible canvas boat powered by a kite<ref>[http://www.design-technology.org/military.htm Samuel Franklin Cody and his man-lifting kite], www.design-technology.org, 2005</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\n[[File:US4708078 fig 10.png|thumb|1984 patent of the Legaignoux brothers<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |number= 4708078 |title= Propulsive wing with inflatable armature |pridate= Nov 16, 1984 |inventor= Bruno T.

In 1978, Ian Day's \"FlexiFoil\" kite-powered Tornado [[catamaran]] exceeded 40&nbsp;km/h.\n\nIn October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent<ref>[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=NL&NR=7603691&KC=&FT=E], Patent NL7603691  (A) \u2015 11 October 1977</ref> for KiteSurfing. The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surf board type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze type belt. Although this patent did not result in any commercial interest, Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise could be considered as the originator of KiteSurfing.\n\nOn 28 August 1982 Greg Locke and Simon Carter, from [[Brighton]] UK, set the world record for kite traction at sea, travelling nearly 26 miles under wind power alone along the English channel.<ref>[http://www.kitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kite-Lines-v4-3.pdf], Kitelines Vol 4, No. 3, p60</ref> This followed a successful crossing of the English Channel from Sussex to France by Locke & Carter the previous year.\n\nThrough the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, [[ice skate]]s, snow skis,<ref name=Harris1>Mark Harris [http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html Sea kayaking and kites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703034411/http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html |date=3 July 2006 }}, July 2002</ref> [[water ski]]s and [[roller skates]].\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from [[Germany]] developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kite-skiing system using self-made [[paraglider]]s and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skywing.de|title=Dieter Strasilla|publisher=}}</ref> Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn used this invention also in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies and self-made buggies.<ref>{{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ZzPXzK6wg |title= History of paragliding: Andrea with surfboard and skywing |date= 1987 |author=  Dieter Strasilla}}</ref> One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing.<ref>Patent DE2933050</ref>\n\nTwo brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of [[France]], developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1984, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products.\n\nIn 1990, practical [[kite buggy]]ing was pioneered by [[Peter Lynn]] at Argyle Park in [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]. Lynn coupled a three-wheeled buggy with a forerunner of the modern [[parafoil]] kite. Kite buggying proved to be popular worldwide, with over 14,000 buggies sold up to 1999.\n\nThe development of modern-day kitesurfing by the Roeselers in the [[United States]] and the Legaignoux in [[France]] carried on in parallel to buggying. Bill Roeseler, a [[Boeing]] [[aerodynamicist]], and his son Cory Roeseler patented the \"KiteSki\" system which consisted of water skis powered by a two-line delta style kite controlled via a bar mounted combined winch/brake. The KiteSki was commercially available in 1994. The kite had a rudimentary water launch capability and could go upwind. In 1995, Cory Roeseler visited [[Peter Lynn]] at New Zealand's Lake Clearwater in the Ashburton Alpine Lakes area, demonstrating speed, balance and upwind angle on his 'ski'. In the late 1990s, Cory's ski evolved to a single board similar to a surfboard.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kirklandreporter.com/news/inventors-of-kiteboarding-inducted-into-kirkland-plaza-of-champions/ |date= 28 May 2015 |title= Inventors of kiteboarding inducted into Kirkland Plaza of Champions |publisher= Kirkland Reporter}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Laird Hamilton2.jpg|thumb|[[Laird Hamilton]] demonstrated kitesurfing in 1996]]\n\nIn 1996, [[Laird Hamilton]] and [[Manu Bertin]] were instrumental in demonstrating and popularising kitesurfing off the [[Hawaii]] a coast of [[Maui]] while in Florida Rapha\u00ebl Baruch changed the name of the sport from flysurfing to kitesurfing by starting and promoting the first commercial brand of the industry \"Kitesurf\".\n\nIn 1997, the Legaignoux brothers developed and sold the breakthrough \"Wipika\" kite design which had a structure of preformed inflatable tubes and a simple bridle system to the wingtips, both of which greatly assisted water re-launch. Bruno Legaignoux has continued to improve kite designs, including developing the [[bow kite]] design, which has been licensed to many kite manufacturers.\n\nIn 1997, specialized kiteboards were developed by Rapha\u00ebl Salles and Laurent Ness.  By the end of 1998 kitesurfing had become an extreme sport, distributed and taught through a handful group of shops and schools worldwide. The first competition was held on [[Maui]] in September 1998 and won by Flash Austin.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/>\n\nStarting in 1999, kitesurfing became a mainstream sport with the entry of key windsurfing manufacturers namely [[Robby Naish]] and [[Neil Pryde]]. Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of kiteboard.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Action Sport 2 (2).png|thumb|evolution of extreme sports]]\n\nIn 2000, a new freestyle competition, sponsored by [[Red Bull]] was launched in [[Maui]]. The competition, named [[Red Bull King of the Air]], judged riders on height, versatility, and style. The competition is still held annually in Cape Town, South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Red Bull King of the Air: Learn more about the history and legends |url=https://www.redbull.com/za-en/history%20and%20legends%20%20of%20red%20bull%20king%20of%20the%20air}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2001 onwards, twin-tip bi-directional boards became more popular for most flat water riders, with directional boards still in use for surf conditions.\n\nIn May 2012, the course racing style of kitesurfing was announced as a sport for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sailing.org/27425.php |date= 5 May 2012 |title= ISAF Selects Kiteboarding For Rio 2016 |publisher= [[International Sailing Federation]]}}</ref> replacing [[windsurf]]ing.

Style<br />!! Description !! Similar sports\n|-\n| '''Freeride'''|| Freeride is anything that you want it to be and the most popular kitesurfing style. Most boards sold today are designed for freeride.  It's about having fun and learning new techniques.  Twintip boards and kites with good relaunch and a wide wind range are commonly used.|| \n|-\n| '''Freestyle'''|| The kite and board are used to get big air (jumps) so that various tricks can be done while airborne.  This style also used for competitive events and is free-format and \"go anywhere\". Smaller twintip boards and kites with good boost and hangtime are used.|| \n|-\n| '''Wave-riding'''|| Wave riding (kitesurfing) in waves is a style that combines kiteboarding with surfing. Locations with a [[Surf break|wave break]] are required. Most kitesurfers use a directional board (either with or without foot straps) that has enough flotation and sufficient turning characteristics to surf the wave. Many kiters use a surfboard that can also be used for regular surfing (with the foot straps removed). The kitesurfer follows the kite when riding the wave, so the pull of the kite is reduced. This style is popular with [[surfers]] since it resembles [[tow-in surfing]]. Some riders ride waves unhooked, and without foot straps. Foot straps dictate the kitesurfer's foot position and how weight and pressure is applied to the board.  Surfers (other than tow-in surfers) do not wear straps and are therefore free to move their feet and position their weight over a greater area of the board to match what is needed to flow with the wave.  Kitesurfing using a board without foot straps is referred to as \"riding strapless\". This allows the kitesurfer's feet to move around the board for optimal performance.  Kitesurfers using foot straps often use the power of the kite to position themselves on a wave and to control their board. That is, they rely on the kite for propulsion rather than the power of the wave to surf.||[[Surfing]], [[tow-in surfing]]\n|-\n| '''Wakestyle'''|| Tricks and aerials, using a wake-style board with bindings.  May also include tricks and jumps involving ramps. Crossover from [[wakeboarding]]. Flat water is perfect for this style, and the use of big twintip boards with high rocker and wake booties is common. This style is commonly practiced by younger riders.|| [[Wakeboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Jumping''' or '''Airstyle'''|| Jumping, arguably a subset of Freeride, consists of jumping high to optionally perform tricks, sometimes also using kiteloops to get extra hang-time. Often shorter lines and smaller kites are used in stronger wind. C-kites and twintip boards are commonly used. An extension of this style is '''Big Air''' as pioneered by [[Ruben Lenten]] where riders go out in gale force conditions and perform high risk moves like kiteloops or more exactly '''megaloops''' || \u2014\n|-\n| '''Wakeskate'''|| Wakeskaters use a strapless twintip board, similar to [[skateboard]]. Flat water and other conditions similar to Wakestyle.|| [[Skateboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Course racing''' || These are racing events - like a yacht race along a course, that involve both speed and tactics.  Special purpose directional race boards with long fins are used. Some raceboards resemble [[windsurfing]] boards. [[Foilboard]]<nowiki/>s are also now used. The goal is to outperform other kiters and come first in the race. || [[Windsurfing]]\n|-\n| '''Speed racing''' || Speed racing is a style practiced at either formal race events or informally, usually with GPS units. Special purpose directional speed boards, or raceboards with long fins are used.  The goal is travel at the maximum possible speed over 500 meters.||\n|-\n|'''Park Riding'''\n|Park riding resembles wakestyle. Riders use wakeboarding obstacles to perform tricks on them. Difficulty, execution and style\n|-\n| '''Foiling'''|| Foiling involves the attachment of a hydrofoil (foil) and mast to the base a board.  The foil allows the board to completely exit the water frees the rider from impact of surface conditions.  The extreme efficiency of a foil allows it's rider to propel themselves with significantly less wind than those riding the on water's surface while greatly increasing upwind ability and speed.  Different sizes and shapes of the wings on the foil allow one to optimize their boards for speed, stability, or waves. \n|}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zanzibar island Copia (22).jpg|Unhooked freestyle\nFile:Board Off - panoramio.jpg|Board Off hooked-in freestyle\nFile:Jesse Richman by MakenaStockMedia 3.jpg|[[Foilboard|Foiling]] with a kite\nFile:Jesse Richman - Pierre Bouras 1.jpg|Wave-riding\nFile:MINI KTE France 2012 (10798352846).jpg|Course racing\nFile:Luderitz Speed Canal.jpg|The [[L\u00fcderitz Speed Challenge]] had set records\n</gallery>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nKiteboarding can pose hazards to surfers, beachgoers, bystanders and others on the water. Many problems and dangers that may be encountered while learning kiting can be avoided or minimized by taking professional instruction through lesson centers. Kitesurfing schools provide courses and lessons to teach entry-level skills and more advanced ones, including:\n* Kite, lines and bar handling and maintenance\n* True and relative wind concepts, including basic kite navigation in the wind window\n* Landing and launching the kite\n* Kite assisted swimming, known as 'body dragging'\n* Water start\n* Relaunch and self-rescue techniques\n* Navigation rules and best practices regarding safety\n* Up-wind and down-wind navigation\n* Basic turning or jibing up to \"heel turn jibe\"\n* Dealing with surf and waves\n* Pop and controlled jumping and flying\n* Board grabs, tricks performed while a rider is jumping or has gained air from popping by grabbing the board in a number of positions with either hand. Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand grabs it. The names generally originate from other board sports like [[Grabs (skateboarding)|skateboarding]] and [[snowboarding]]\n<gallery>\nFile:Kitesurf jump aerial.jpg|Jumping\nFile:Kitesurfer1.jpg|Big Air\nFile:Kitedge.jpg|Kiteboarder edging his board\n</gallery>\n\n==The wind==\n[[File:Windvenster.jpg|thumb|The [[wind]] window]]\n\n===Wind strength and kite sizes===\nKitesurfers change kite size and/or line length depending on wind strength \u2014 stronger winds call for a smaller kite to prevent overpower situations. Kitesurfers will determine the wind strength using either an [[anemometer]] or, more typically, visual clues as shown in the [[Beaufort scale]]. Modern kites dedicated to kitesurfing provide a \"depower\" option to reduce the power in the kite. By using depower, the kite's angle of attack to the wind is reduced, thereby catching less wind in the kite and reducing the pull.\n\n[[Bow kite]]s have a wider wind range than C-kites, so two kite sizes (such as 7 m\u00b2 and 12 m\u00b2) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75&nbsp;kg (165&nbsp;lb) rider.<ref>[http://www.kitesurfbarcelona.com/nkb_mnl12_rebel_en.pdf North Rebel Manual 2012North Sails kitesurfbarcelona.com] 1 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Wind direction and speed===\nCross-shore and cross-onshore winds are the best for unassisted kiteboarding. Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land or stuck in shallows. Direct offshore winds pose the danger of being blown away from the shore in the event of equipment failure or loss of control. However offshore winds can be quite suitable in confined waters, like in a lake or estuary, or when a safety boat is assisting.\n\nThe kiter must maintain a clear perception of the wind direction but also of the wind speed. The Beaufort scale<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html|title=Beaufort Wind Scale|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> is of great assistance in helping users assess the situation. A range of wind up to 33 knots covers the conditions for a safe practice for an experienced rider. A less experienced one should avoid riding with more than 15 knots. Most twintip boards and inflatable kites would be barely rideable below 11 knots, therefore for most cases a user should focus on the winds classified as moderate up to strong.\n\n=== Apparent wind ===\nEven if there is no wind blowing, a kiter can act on the kite lines and force it to move, and then, like with a row, it generates some force resulting from the incidence of the air into the kite's surface. In a gentle breeze, if the user action increases the air speed around the kite 10 times, the generated force increases 100 times, since the wind force acting on a kite is proportional to the square of the wind speed acting on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html|title=The Lift Equation|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> Thus the relevant notion of ''apparent'' wind, which is the actual wind acting on the moving kite, sail or wing.\n\nThe apparent wind is measured taking the moving kite as the reference frame, therefore its other name as ''relative wind''. By opposition, the wind measured relatively to the ground is called ''true wind''.\n\nWhile the other wind sports can generate considerable apparent wind, their wind forces are limited by the movement of the user platform, since it is attached more or less rigidly to the wing or sail. In this aspect, kiteboarding seems unique among other wind sports, since it allows the user to generate apparent wind independently of the movement of the user platform, the board. For instance, in the initiating kiteboard technic called ''waterstart'', while the user prepares to start in the water, the kite is sent aggressively, generating a propulsive impulse. Then the resulting movement of the board increases tension on the kite lines, which the user controls to manage the riding speed and to navigate at will. The composition of the movements of both the kite and the board, offer the user a great deal of navigation flexibility and creativity, including the possibility to jump significantly, making this a true 3-dimensional sport.\n\n=== Wind power, control lines and kite paths ===\nIn some way all wind sports harvest the energy of the wind. The greater the volume of the atmosphere available to be harvested by the sails, the bigger the available energy to propel the users. As a taller sailing ship harvests more energy from the wind, so does a kiteboarder with longer lines. Compared to a kiteboarder, a windsurfer can extract a higher ratio of wind energy from the available atmosphere volume, but since such volume is much smaller, the resulting energy could be much less than in kiteboarding.\n\nTo increase the power, the kiteboarder typically navigates the kite along an S-shape path, increasing the harvesting of energy since it is traversing most of the atmosphere volume around him. This S-shaped movement is most common when the kiters need a moderate improvement of power. If the user needs an intense improvement of power, it loops the kite. Such loops are stronger when the loop radius is large, and traverses a larger atmosphere volume. The kite loop is an advanced practice, and its power can be quite dangerous. With most modern kites and control bars, to end a kite loop the user just pushes away or releases the bar.\n\nRegarding the length of the lines connecting the kite to the user, longer lines allow the user to harvest wind energy in a larger volume.  Due to the boundary layer effect<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/boundlay.html|title=Boundary Layer|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref> longer lines also allow to harvest stronger winds higher up in the atmosphere. But longer lines make the kite slower to respond to the user actions on the control bar, since the lines form a more pronounced spring-like catenary. Therefore, kitesurfers, who need to react fast to incoming waves, tend to use shorter lines than the other kiters. For safety reasons the newcomers to the sport are usually trained with short lines, limiting the power build up.\n\n=== Wind window ===\nThe ''wind window'' is the 180 degree arc of the sky downwind of the rider in which the kite can be flown - roughly one fourth of a sphere's surface, which radius is the length of the lines. It is the atmosphere volume in which the kiter can navigate the kite to harvest wind energy.\n\nIf the rider is facing downwind on a surface, like the ocean, the wind window covers roughly all the area the rider can see, from the rider's peripheral vision on one side, along the horizon to the other side, and then directly overhead back to the first side. If the rider somehow puts the kite out of the window \u2014 for example, by riding downwind too quickly and sending the kite directly overhead and behind, the kite will stall and often fall out of the sky.\n\nThe eventual inefficiency of the kite can obviate for it to reach the edge of the wind window. In such cases the magnitude of the wind window can be reduced to as little as a 120 degree arc, instead of the expected 180 degree.\n\nThe wind window is centered in the user location. Since the user is carried by the board, the wind window is affected by the movement of the board. Therefore, the wind window rotates as the board moves and generates apparent wind into itself. For instance, when the kiter navigates perpendicular to the true wind at a speed equal to the true wind's, the apparent wind felt on the board increases 42% compared to the true wind, but rotates 45\u00ba against the movement. With such rotation, even if the user keeps the kite at the very edge of the wind window for trying to keep it pulling in the travelling direction, the kite lines would be at an angle of 45\u00ba downwind of the board path, forcing the kiter to edge the board to oppose its tendency to slip downwind. Such board edging is an indispensable technique for navigating upwind, and can be made at a much more extreme angle to the kite lines, almost up to 90\u00ba.\n\nThe wind window rotation degrades the performance when riding fast in a path upwind. To minimize the wind window rotation and sail upwind as much as possible, the kiter should keep the slowest board speed without sinking the board by lack of hydrodynamic lift. High flotation boards like surfboards are preferable in such cases. Also, keeping the kite high in window, pulling up the user and the board, is quite efficient in coping both with the reduced hydrodynamic lift of the board and with the intended reduction of the board speed.\n\n=== Arbitrary atmosphere volume swept by the kite ===\nThe kite is a peculiar sail because it can be swept arbitrarily through the atmosphere, usually in specific patterns, so the user can harvest a significant amount of wind energy, much larger than with an equivalent sail fixed to a mast.\n[[File:SweptVolumes.png|thumb|The peculiar travel pattern of a kite, compared to a sail fixed to a mast as in windsurf]]\nThe kite and the lines are light, in the range between 2 and 4&nbsp;kg, but the aerodynamic drag can be significant since the kite can travel much faster than a windsurf sail. Therefore, part of the energy harvested is spent in the movement of the kite itself, but the remainder propels the user and the board.\n\nFor instance, a user riding towards the beach rises the kite to slow it down and convert traction into lift. Then, instead of speed he feels an increase of the force upwards, necessary to keep himself above the breaking waves.\n\nAnother specific advantage of the kite being able to be swept at will, is that the user can take advantage of the atmosphere boundary layer, either rising the kite to harvest the stronger winds blowing in the higher zone of the wind window, or during overpowering gusts he can drive the kite low, skimming the water near the edge of the wind window.\n\n=== Air temperature and humidity ===\nSeasoned kiteboarders frequently attribute to moist and hotter air a notable reduction in kite performance. In fact the [[coefficient of lift|lift force]] of a kite is proportional to the air density. Since both the temperature and the relative humidity are important detrimental factors in the air density, the kiters subjective valuation is correct.\n\nIn the range between 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C a kite loses approximately 0.4% of lift per degree Celsius. It means that a kiter practicing one given day in the Baltic, and then travelling to the Mediterranean, could experience 10% less pull using the very same kite at the very same wind speed.\n\n==Locations==\n\nAny location with consistent, steady side-onshore winds (10 to 35+ knots), large open bodies of water and good launch areas is suitable for kitesurfing. Most kitesurfing takes place along ocean shores, usually off beaches, but it can also be practiced on large lakes and inlets and occasionally on rivers. Since kiteboarding relies heavily on favorable, consistent wind conditions, certain locations tend to become popular and sought out by kiteboarders.\n\n; Boracay, Philippines\n: [[Boracay]] offers constant side onshore winds during the November to April main season in a turquoise shallow water lagoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whenwherekite.com/Bulabog-beach-Boracay-Philippines.html|title=Wind statistics Bulabog beach}}</ref>\n\n; Cumbuco, Brazil\n: [[Cumbuco]] has strong side shore wind every day and wide sandy beach lagoon, the best season is from August to December, although January and February can be good as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go-kite.com/index.php/kite-brazil-cumbuco/kitesurf|title=Go Kite - Cumbuco, Brazil}}</ref>\n\n; Maui, Hawaii, US\n: in [[Maui]], the tropical Kite Beach has warm waters, steady winds and gentle waves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionsportsmaui.com/kite-beach/|title=Action Sports Maui - Kite Beach}}</ref>\n\n; Nabq Bay, Egypt\n: [[Sharm El Sheikh]] is a beach town with shallow and flat waters, the wind blows at least 20 knots on most days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripping.com/explore/the-10-best-places-for-kiteboarding-in-the-world|title=Tripping - Nabq Bay, Egypt}}</ref>\n\n; Tarifa, Spain\n: [[Tarifa]] is a 10&nbsp;km long bay with a wide, sandy beach.

Moreover, the sport is convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than most surf and [[paddling]] boards.\n\nEquipment depreciation can cost between \u00a3270 per year for second hand gear, to \u00a31360 per year for brand new, not discounted kites and accessories.<!--ref name=iksurfmagDec2019/-->\nIn 2017, 150,000 kites were sold globally, compared to 400,000 surfboards sold each year.<ref name=iksurfmagDec2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.iksurfmag.com/issue78/?page=51 |title= How Much Does It Cost To Kitesurf? |magazine= iksurfmag |issue= 78 |author= Rou Chater |date= December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Power kites===\n[[File:Lei-bow-foil-kites.svg|thumb|upright|A '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|LEI]]'''(R), '''[[Bow kite|Bow]]'''(L) and '''[[Foil kite|Foil]]'''(T) [[Power kite]]s]]\nA [[power kite]] is available in two major forms: '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|leading edge inflatables]]''' and '''[[foil kite]]s'''.\n\n====Leading edge inflatables====\n[[File:PowerSail detail.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s''', known also as '''inflatables''', '''LEI kites''', are typically made from ripstop polyester with an inflatable plastic bladder that spans the front edge of the kite with separate smaller bladders that are perpendicular to the main bladder to form the chord or foil of the kite.<ref>[http://www.kiteboardingreview.com LEIs], Kiteboarding Review, 27 June 2011</ref> The inflated bladders give the kite its shape and also keep the kite floating once dropped in the water. LEIs are the most popular choice among kitesurfers thanks to their quicker and more direct response to the rider's inputs, easy relaunchability if crashed into the water and resilient nature. If an LEI kite hits the water or ground too hard or is subjected to substantial wave activity, bladders can burst or it can be torn apart.\n\nIn 2005, '''[[Bow kite]]s''' (also known as '''flat LEI kites''') were developed with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and a distinctive bridle with multiple attachment points along the leading edge. These features allow the kite's angle of attack to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs. These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature. They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite. The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the water. Bow kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels. Most [[LEI kite]] manufacturers developed a variation of the bow kite by 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kitesurfingmag.com/north-kiteboarding-signs-up-for-kite-patent/|title=North signs up for Best Kiteboarding patent - Kitesurfing Magazine|publisher=}}</ref>  Bow kites with a straight trailing edge are named \u00b4delta\u00b4 kites, given their triangular outline.\n\nEarly bow kites had some disadvantages compared to classic LEI kites:\n\n* They can become inverted and then not fly properly\n* They can be twitchy and not as stable\n* Heavier bar pressure makes them more tiring to fly\n* Lack of \"sled boosting\" effect when jumping<ref>[http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm Flat Inflatable Kites, Bow Kites, Flat LEIs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223649/http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm |date=1 June 2007 }}, Kitesufingschool.org, 27 June 2006</ref>\n\nIn 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed which combine near total depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, no performance penalties and reduced bar pressure. Called '''Hybrid or SLE kites''' (Supported Leading Edge), these kites are suitable for both beginners and experts.\n\nIn 2008, Naish introduced another kite design, with their \"Sigma Series\" of kites. These kites are a SLE design and feature a unique \"bird in flight\" shape with the center of the kite swept back to put much of the sail area behind the tow point, which Naish claims has multiple benefits.\n\nIn 2009, the performance revolution shows no sign of slowing. Bridled designs feel more like C kites, and five-line hybrids have better depower capability than ever before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|title=2009 Kiteboarding Buyers'Guide|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404021939/http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|archivedate=4 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are more than thirty companies manufacturing [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s. The '''delta-kites''' are growing in popularity since 2008 with around 12 companies offering '''delta-kites''' since 2008/2009.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013 kite technology has continued to grow.  Kites have become lighter, more durable, much easier to launch and safer.  Manufacturers have continued to add new safety features.  This has resulted in a growing number of new riders, both younger and older.  In 2013, there are at least 20 \"major\" kite manufacturers, each with multiple models available.  Many of the manufacturers are on their third or fourth generation of kites.<ref>kiteboardingreview.com</ref>\n\n====Foil kites====\n[[File:LEIpowerKite.jpg|thumb|A [[Foil kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Foil kite]]s''' are also mostly fabric ([[ripstop nylon]]) with air pockets (air cells) to provide it with lift and a fixed bridle to maintain the kite's arc-shape, similar to a [[paraglider]]. Foil kites have the advantage of not needing to have bladders manually inflated, a process which, with an LEI, can take up to ten minutes.\nFoil kites are designed with either an open or closed cell configuration.\n\n; Open Cell\n: Open cell foils rely on a constant airflow against the inlet valves to stay inflated, but are generally impossible to relaunch if they hit the water, because they have no means of avoiding deflation, and quickly become soaked.\n\n; Closed Cell\n: Closed cell foils are almost identical to open cell foils except they are equipped with inlet valves to hold air in the chambers, thus keeping the kite inflated (or, at least, making the deflation extremely slow) even once in the water. Water relaunches with closed cell foil kites are simpler; a steady tug on the power lines typically allows them to take off again. An example for a closed cell kite is the [[Arc Kite]].\n\n====Kite sizes====\nKites come in sizes ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, the larger the surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also directly linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size\u2014wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots. Kites come in a variety of designs. Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the kite's flying characteristics. 'Aspect ratio' is the ratio of span to length. High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds.\n\nSeasoned kiteboarders will likely have three or more kite sizes which are needed to accommodate various wind levels, although bow kites may change this, as they present an enormous wind range; some advanced kiters use only one bow kite. Smaller kites are used by light riders, or in strong wind conditions; larger kites are used by heavier riders or in light wind conditions. Larger and smaller kiteboards have the same effect: with more available power a given rider can ride a smaller board. In general, however, most kiteboarders only need one board and one to three kites (7-12 sq m in size).\n\n===Other equipment===\n[[File:Happy-students-3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|A kitesurfer uses a bar with lines to control the kite, attached to a [[Windsurfing harness|harness]], and can wear a [[wetsuit]]]]\n\n* '''Flying lines''' are made of a strong material such as [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]], to handle the dynamic load in unpredictable wind while maintaining a small cross-sectional profile to minimize drag. They come in lengths generally between seven and thirty-three meters. Experimentation with line lengths is common in kiteboarding. The lines attach the rider's control bar to the kite using attachment cords on the kite edges or its bridle. Most power kites use a [[Kite control systems#5-Line Bars|3, 4 or 5-line]] configuration. Most control bars have 4 lines, 2 for most of the propulsive power and 2 for steering and for control of the angle of attack. The 5th line is used to aid in re-launching or to further adjustment of the kite's angle of attack, mostly in C-kites.\n* The '''control bar''' is a solid metal or composite bar which attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this bar and controls the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a ''chicken loop'' from the control bar is attached to a latch or hook on a spreader bar on the rider's harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite's minimum [[angle of attack]]. Kite control bars, while lightweight and strong, are usually heavier than water; \"bar floats\" made of foam may be fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water. Control bars can be specific to a particular kite type and size and not suitable for use with different [[kite types]].\n* A '''kite harness''' comes in seat (with leg loops), waist, or vest types. The harness together with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. The harness reduces the strain of the kite's pull from the rider's arms, spreading it across part of the rider's body. This allows the rider to perform jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist harnesses are the most popular harnesses among advanced riders, although seat harnesses make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider, and vest harnesses provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite harnesses resemble windsurfing harnesses, but with different construction; a windsurfing harness is likely to fail when used for kiteboarding.\n[[File:Kite-board.jpg|thumb|right|Twin tip kiteboard]]\n* '''Kiteboard''', a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now several types of kiteboards: directional surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and are by far the most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.\n[[File:DrySuits.jpg|thumb|right|Kitesurfers wearing [[dry suit]]s on [[Long Island]] in winter when the air and water temperatures are near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F)]]\n* A '''wetsuit''' is often worn by kitesurfers, except in warmer conditions with light winds. When kitesurfing in strong winds, body heat loss is reduced by wearing a [[wetsuit]]. A \"shortie\" is worn to protect the torso only, and a full suit is used for protection against cool conditions, from marine life such as [[jellyfish]], and also from abrasions if the rider is dragged by the kite. Neoprene boots are required if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks. [[Dry suit]]s are also used to kitesurf in cold conditions in winter.\n* A '''safety hook knife''' is considered required equipment. The corrosion resistant [[stainless steel]] blade is partially protected by a curved plastic hook. It can be used to cut entangled or snagged [[kite line]]s, or to release the kite if the safety release system fails. Some kitesurfing harnesses are equipped with a small pocket for the knife.\n* A '''helmet''' is often worn by kitesurfers to protect the head from [[blunt trauma]]. [[Helmet]]s prevent head [[lacerations]], and can also reduce the severity of impact injuries to the head, as well as compression injuries to the neck and spine.\n* A '''personal flotation device''' or [[Personal flotation device|PFD]] may be required if the kitesurfer is using a boat or [[personal water craft]] for support. It is also recommended for kitesurfing in deep water in case the kitesurfer becomes disabled and must wait for rescue.\n* An '''impact vest''' provides some protection against impacts to the torso area. They also provide some flotation and preclude the harness to climb the chest and hurt the ribs, during high power maneuvers.\n* A '''[[Surfboard leash|board leash]]''' that attaches the board to the kitesurfer's leg or harness is used by some riders. However, many kitesurfing schools discourage the use of board leashes due to the risk of recoil, where the leash can yank the board to impact the rider, which can result in serious injury or even death. Generally, kitesurfers that use a board leash will also wear a helmet to help protect against this.\n* '''Signaling devices''' are useful if the kitesurfer needs to be rescued. This may be as simple as a whistle attached to the knife, or [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] tape applied to the helmet. Some kitesurfers carry a [[mobile phone]] or [[two-way radio]] in a waterproof pouch to use in an emergency. A small [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]] (EPIRB) can be carried and activated to send out a distress signal.\n* A '''buddy''' is important to help with launching and retrieving the kite, and to assist in an emergency.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/faq FAQ], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n* A '''[[GPS]]''' can be used to measure distance travelled, tracks and speed during a session.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/gear/gps-for-kitesurfing GPS for kitesurfing], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n\n== Physical practice ==\n\nKiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2\u20133 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mpora.com/windsurfing-kitesurfing/77-year-old-surf-1|title=Meet David: The 77 Year Old Kite Surfer Showing The Rest Of Us How It's Done - Mpora|work=Mpora|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref> It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Power kite]]s are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in [[wakeboarding]] and to lift their users to [[Diving (sport)|diving]] heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in difficult environments. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (\"collard\").\n\nIt is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (\"kitemare\", a [[portmanteau]] of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding [[training]], careful development of [[experience]] and consistent use of good judgement and [[safety gear]] should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding.\n\n=== Weather ===\n\n[[Weather forecasting]] and awareness is the principal factor to safe kiteboarding. Lack of weather awareness and understanding the figures is frequent, but avoiding weather problems is possible.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=9528|title= Kiteboarding weather planning and monitoring|author= Rick Iossi|publisher= Florida KiteSurfing Association Forum}}</ref> Choice of inappropriate locations for kiteboarding where the wind passes over land creating wind shadow, rotor with pronounced gusts and lulls has also factored in many accidents.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=7879|title= Shadow Blasted ...

Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects can be hazardous. [[Collision]]s with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations.\n\nSolo kiteboarding has been a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends and keep an eye on one another. A kitesurfer can get farther from [[shore]] than an easy [[Human swimming|swim]], which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged. Marine hazards include [[sharks]], [[jellyfish]], [[sea otters]], [[dolphins]], and even [[crocodile]]s, depending on the location. [[Drowning]] has been a factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate flotation aid or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills.\n\n=== Safety equipment ===\n\nSome kite designs from late 2005 and onwards have included immediate and almost full depower integrated with the control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, both of which are making the sport much safer. However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites.<br />Another important part of the safety equipment is the impact vest, which doubles as an improved floatation device. It reduces the severity of eventual impacts, but also improves the user endurance in the long procedures of self-rescue in deep waters, which almost every freeriding kiter experiences sooner or later. It is also important and overlooked as a complement to the harness, precluding it to climb along the chest during powerful kite loops, which otherwise would hurt the ribs.<br />The other important pieces of a reasonable safety kit are the safety hook knife to cut tangled lines, the helmet in a high visibility colour, a wet suit of reasonable thickness, depending on the water temperature, and possibly neoprene boots if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks.\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n[[Accidents]] can generate serious injuries or even be deadly. 105 accidents were reported in the Kiteboarding Safety Information Database between 2000 and September 2003, with 14 [[Death|fatalities]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kitesurfingschool.org/safety.htm |title= Kitesurfing Safety |date= 7 May 2007 |publisher= KitesurfingSchool }}</ref> In South Africa between October 2003 and April 2004, 83% of [[search & rescue]] missions involving kitesurf were in offshore winds with the kite still attached to the harness, uncontrolled in strong winds or impossible to relaunch in weak winds. On 30 missions, there was no fatalities but five injuries : two had [[bone fracture]]s after being hit by their boards, two others were suffering from critical [[hypothermia]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and the fifth was exhausted and [[laceration|lacerated]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/39/5/e26.full |title= The kick with the kite: an analysis of kite surfing related off shore rescue missions in Cape Town, South Africa |date= 21 December 2004 |publisher= [[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in hybrid and [[bow kite]] designs leads to a better ability to control the power that they provide and effective safety release systems.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kiteboardingevolution.com/kite-advantages.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090828024415/http://www.kiteboardingevolution.com/kite-advantages.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2009-08-28 |publisher= KiteboardingEvolution |title= Kite Advantages and Disadvantages \u2013 How do Bow, C, and Hybrid Kites Compare to Each Other? }}</ref> In 2003, fatality ratings for the U.S. stated that 6 to 12 kiteboarders died for 100'000 participants.

Kiteboarding lends itself to a rather frequent practice, much like a gym program, arguably more frequent than other risky sports like scuba diving. Therefore, further data is required to properly evaluate the risk associated with kiteboarding.\n\n==== Reports of casualties ====\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/kitesurfer-70-killed-at-remote-beach-20120206-1r0oi.html |title= Kitesurfer, 70, killed at remote beach |date= 6 February 2012 |publisher= [[WA Today]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/kite-surfer-killedat-redcliffe-20120306-1ui3g.html#ixzz1uiyfm54z |title= Kite surfer killed at Redcliffe |date= 6 March 2012 |publisher= [[Brisbane Times]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2012/03/dante_torres_malibu_kite_surfer_dies_kelp.php |title= Dante Torres, Malibu Kite Surfer Dies in Tragic Kelp Accident |publisher= [[LA Weekly]] Blogs |date= 13 March 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phuket-beach-toll-rises-kitesurfing-American-dies |title= Phuket beach toll rises as kitesurfing American dies |publisher= [[Phuket Gazette]] |date= 31 May 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |title= Kiteboarder killed at Cheney Lake identified |date= 6 August 2012 |publisher= [[KWCH-TV]] |access-date= 14 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120810040308/http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |archive-date= 10 August 2012 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-33415791 |title= Sean Sands: Hunstanton kite surfing death 'accidental' |date= 6 July 2015 |publisher= [[BBC]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/14294364.Southend_kitesurfer_killed_in_accident/ |title= Mark Paxton: Southend kitesurfer has died in a freak accident at Ray Creek, Point Clear, Clacton |date= 21 February 2016|publisher= [[Clacton Gazette]]}}\n\n===Kitesurfing safety rules===\nWhile some countries have specific regulations on flying kites that may also apply to kitesurfing,<ref>[http://www.kiteman.co.uk/Kite%20Safty.html \"Kite Safety\"] www.kiteman.co.uk</ref> most don't. However a kitesurfer should comply to the sailing rules regulating water crafts in many countries, like the U.S. Coast Guard regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=rightOfWay|title=Right Of Way|website=www.navcen.uscg.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> Developed from such generic rules a set of kitesurf specific rules or recommendations has been taking form since the beginning of the sport.\n\n{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}\nThe first such rule is '''the prudential rule''': with so many people just discovering water sports, a kiter shouldn't assume others adequate knowledge, training or even proper attitude, and be prepared to observe self-preserving distances and always let the others perceive clearly its intentions and its intended path.\n\n'''Waterstarters have priority''': the rider going out from the beach has always priority over the riders coming in.\n\n'''Kite High Rule''' - A kiter who is upwind (closest to the wind) must keep their kite high to avoid their lines crossing those of downwind kiters. Similarly, the downwind kiter must keep their kite low to avoid their lines crossing upwind kites. This applies regardless of whether kiters are on the same, or opposing courses.\n\n'''Clearance Rule''' - A kiter while jumping must have a clear safety zone of at least 50m downwind because they will move downwind during the jump. A rider must also have a clear safety zone of 30m upwind to jump as his lines could touch the kite or the lines of another rider kiteboarding close by (see Kite High rule). It's important to also consider potential hazards downwind and crosswind of the rider such as people, buildings, trees and other fixed obstacles. Because of the clearance rule a jumper never has the right of way.\n\nKiters are also considered as sailing vessels \u2013 so all the standard sailing rules apply such as:\n\n'''Starboard Rule''' When kiters approach from opposite directions the kiter who has the wind on the starboard (right side, right leg/arm leads in direction of travel) has right of way. The kiter who has the wind on the port side (left side, left leg/arm are leads in direction of travel) shall keep out of the way of the other. In simple terms, this means \"keep right\" with the kiter coming in the opposite direction passing on the left.\n\nIn sailing terms, a sailor or kiter with right of way is entitled to \"insist\" on exercising that right (warning opposing kiters) by shouting \"starboard\" clearly and in good time.\n\nMany of the sailing rules of right of way are different expressions that the most maneuverable craft should give way to the less maneuverable one. Therefore, kiters should give way to fishing vessels, but not to a jet ski. Other '''boating rules''' such as no-go zones, distance from shore and swimmers also apply.<ref>[http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm Are you kiting Safely?? Are you aware of the Rules??] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326020626/http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm |date=26 March 2009 }}, kbv.org.au</ref> Also '''surfing rules''' do apply, so for instance, the rider to catch a wave closer to the crest has the right of way even if not on a starboard tack, freeriders included.\n\n== Terminology and jargon ==\n* '''Air time''': the amount of time spent in the air while jumping. This can be remarkably long; the record is [[Jesse Richman|Jesse Richman's]] 22 second long jump. Five to ten seconds is not unusual.\n* '''Apparent wind''': the kite's speed relative to the surrounding air. When kitesurfing in a straight line, the kite's apparent wind is a combination of the wind speed and the speed of the kite over the surface, but since the kite is highly steerable the apparent wind can vary widely depending on how the kite is being flown. Most ways of increasing power from the kite involve giving it a higher apparent wind somehow, i.e. diving the kite, riding faster, or riding at a greater angle into the wind. Any of these raises the kite's apparent wind speed.\n* '''Back stall''': A condition in which the kite ceases to move forward through the air and becomes difficult to control, often resulting in the kite flying backwards and crashing.  Back stall is often caused by lack of wind or by flying the kite with too great of an angle of attack. \n* '''Big air''': performing a high jump utilizing the lift of the kite. The jump is often assisted in its initial stage by the rider being catapulted off the lip of a wave.\n* '''Body dragging''': being pulled through the water without standing on a board. This is an early step in the learning process, and is essential before trying the board after flying a trainer kite.\n* '''Boost''': to suddenly become airborne\n* '''Brain fart''': to forget what trick you intended to perform mid air and end up crashing or landing on the water.\n* '''Charlie browner''': same as kiteboarder or kitesurfer.\n* '''Chicken loop''': a hard rubber loop attached to the middle line which has been fed through the control bar. It is used to attach the control bar to the harness so the kitesurfer can produce tension in the lines using their entire bodyweight instead of using purely arm strength.\n* '''Chicken bone/chicken finger/donkey dick / Donkey tail''': a hard rubber \"tongue\" attached to the chicken loop which the rider feeds through the spreader bar hook to prevent the rider from becoming \"unhooked\".\n* '''De-power''': to reduce the kite's power (pull), generally by adjusting the angle of attack of the kite. Most kites and control bars now allow a rider to rig a kite for a number of different power levels before launching, in addition to powering the kite up and down \"on the fly\" by moving the bar up and down. Depowerability makes a kite safer and easier to handle. Some new kite models, especially \"bow\" kites, can be de-powered to practically zero power, giving them an enormous wind range.\n* '''DP''': dawn patrol; an early morning session.\n* '''Downwind''': the direction the wind is blowing towards; to leeward. When a rider is facing '''downwind''' the wind is at their back.\n* '''Downwinder''': a kitesurfing \"trip\" (could actually be as short as a few minutes) where the rider starts at one point and ends up at another point downwind of their original position.\n* '''Edge''': tilting the board with its edge into the water. Used to control the direction of travel. Learning to edge properly is critical for learning to tack upwind. Edging is one of the fundamental skills of kitesurfing and is one of the ways kitesurfing is different from windsurfing or wakeboarding. While windsurf boards have daggerboards and/or skegs to steer the board upwind while lift and planing is provided by the board itself, generally kiteboards actually combine both functions and the bottom of the board lifts the rider and steers simultaneously. Kiteboard fins are generally much smaller and are for keeping the board in the water (see \"'''tea-bagging'''\"), but are not essential. Because kite boards have a small rocker, a deep edge can allow the board to act as a large low drag fin. Edging in wakeboarding is used for steering the board; whereas in kite boarding not only does edging steer the kite board, it is essential for kite control and controlling board speed. Riding downwind towards the kite subtracts massively from the kite's power and helps control board speed as well.\n* '''Facial''': total loss of flying kite control while on the beach, resulting in the harnessed rider being dragged face first downwind across rocks and sand.\n* '''Freeride''': kiteboarding style. Plain kiteboarding that does not involve tricks or jumping. The main goal is keeping a good edge and ability to traverse upwind. This would normally require a board with little rocker.\n* '''Freestyle''': kiteboarding style. Freestyle involves tricks (or combinations of tricks) where the rider is jumping off the water and experiencing enhanced elevation using lift generated from the kite. Freestyle is, weather-wise, a multi-condition concept and is to some degree equipment-specific. \"Big air\" is commonly associated with freestyle.\n* '''Goofy''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the right foot leading.\n* '''Guinea pig''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Wind-dummy'''.\n* '''Heel side''': the side of a board on the edge where a rider's heels are (opposite of toe side). \"Riding heel side\" is riding with heels down.\n* '''Hindenburg''': (a reference to the Hindenburg Airship disaster of 1937) a kite falling out of the air due to the loss of tension in the control lines, and therefore the loss of kite control. Hindenburging can be caused either by lack of wind or by the kite advancing to a position upwind of the kitesurfer in the wind window, also called \"overflying the kite\".\n* '''Handlepass''': while unhooked, passing the control bar behind a riders back while in the air.\n* '''Hot launch''': recovering and launching the kite from a position deep inside the wind window so the kite is immediately under maximum power (potentially dangerous). \n* '''Kiter''': the person driving the kite. \n* '''Kiteloop''': is a powered group of tricks where a rider loops the kite through the power zone.\n* '''Kitemare''': a kiteboardsurfing accident or dangerous mishap. Kitemares can be deadly.\n* '''Launch''': getting the kite in the air. The kite may be launched assisted or unassisted. An assisted launch is generally safer than an unassisted launch.\n* '''Lofted''': to get lifted vertically into the air by the kite due to a strong gust of wind. Being lofted has resulted in fatalities when kiters on or near land were dragged into obstacles. The danger can be avoided by minimizing time on land with the kite flying directly overhead, and by not kiting in overpowered situations.\n* '''Luff''' : when the air flow stalls around the kite. It may then stall and fall out of the sky. Like sails, a luffing kite has rippling and flapping panels. When launching the kite, if the kite is luffing, the rider should move farther upwind, or the person holding the kite should move downwind.\n* '''Mobe''': this term has two meanings: either a class of wakestyle tricks involving an invert with a 360-degree spin or a specific trick involving a back roll with a frontside 360 handlepass (while keeping the kite below 45 degrees).  The former meaning stems from the latter, which was the first type of mobe to ever be landed. Other types of mobes include: mobe 540, mobe 720, slim chance, KGB, crow mobe, moby dick, Pete Rose, blind pete, crow mobe 540, etc.\n* '''Nuking''': wind blowing at great speeds (30-40 knots). These extreme conditions are dangerous for most riders.\n* '''Offshore''': wind blowing at the water from the shore. Never ride in offshore winds without some means of recovery, i.e. a chase boat. This is somewhat less important in smaller bodies of water, of course.\n* '''Onshore''': wind blowing perpendicular to and directly at the shore from the water. A challenging condition for beginners, especially if waves are present.\n* '''Dookie dive''': loss of power during air time resulting in a crash into the water.\n* '''O-Shit loop''': two loops on either ends of the bar that are attached to the kite lines and run through rings attached to the bar. A standard leash attachment point.\n* '''Overhead waves''': waves {{convert|2|m|ft||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger from trough to crest;\n* '''Overpowered''': the condition of having too much power from the kite. Can be a result of an increase in wind, incorrect kite choice (too large for the conditions), incorrect adjustment, simply going too fast, etc. Experienced riders who are overpowered can switch to a smaller board to compensate, to a degree, although it's common to have just one board.\n* '''Pop''': height gained above the water using only the board and tension in the lines to get lift, with the kite usually positioned at 45 degrees. Lower kite angles are possible for more experienced riders. Used as a basis for many tricks and regarded as an essential skill for progressing.\n* '''[[Port]]''' the left side of a vehicle, as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Power up''': when the kite's power increases (suddenly), because of wind gusts or the kite's movement.\n* '''Power zone''': is the area in the sky where the kite generates the most lift (pull), this is generally between 0 and 60 degrees arc from the center of the downwind direction.\n* '''Raley''': a trick where the rider unhooks and then pops in order to fully extend his body into a \"superman\" position, before landing. This is a power move that's often performed relatively low to the water and forms the basis of more advanced tricks.\n* '''Regular''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the left foot leading.\n* '''Re-launch''': a general term for getting the kite back up in the air after crashing it (on land or water). A relaunch is unassisted and requires the rider to follow a kite-specific procedure (check the manual). As years of development have gone by, the more recent kites are easier to relaunch.\n* '''Rider''': kiteboarder.\n* '''S-Bend''': when the rider unhooks and performs a raley followed by a front roll. \n* '''Self rescue''': a maneuver by which a rider with a downed kite manipulates the kite in the water to assist them in swimming back to shore.  The rider generally wraps up their lines until they reach their kite, then positions their kite so that it is on its back as it would be carried on land but with the wing-tip closer to shore catching the wind.  This wing tip acts as a sail and helps pull the rider to shore.  This is considered an important manoeuvre to learn.\n* '''Send it''': to move the kite aggressively up through the power zone.\n* '''Schlogging''': this is riding extremely underpowered. A rider has no power to plane and definitely not enough to jump. A rider and their board bounce from planing on the surface to being dragged in the water.\n* '''Shit hot''': the art of stylish smooth moves.\n* '''SLE''': Supported Leading Edge. A C shaped kite with an inflatable leading edge, currently the most advanced kite design available allowing massive de-power.\n* '''Side offshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle away from the shore.\n* '''Side onshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle towards the shore.\n* '''side shore''': winds blowing parallel to the shore. Usually the most desirable direction for kitesurfing.\n* '''Spreader bar''': a stainless steel bar that attaches to the rider's harness. It has a hook that holds the \"chicken loop\" when riding hooked in.\n* '''[[Starboard]]''' the right side of a vehicle as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Stomp''': to successfully perform a trick.\n* '''Surfstyle:''' Wave riding using surfboards. Ideal conditions are cross shore to cross offshore with the wind blowing in the same direction that the wave is breaking. Boards can be ridden with or without foot straps.\n* '''Tack''': the direction which is being sailed, normally either starboard tack or port tack. In a starboard tack the wind is coming in from the rider's starboard (right-hand) side, similar to sailing a boat. In normal riding, the kitesurfer takes a heading which is as close to into the wind as possible, and in any event leads at some angle slightly upwind, sometimes as much as 45 degrees; jumping or wave riding usually results in traveling downwind, so the net result is to maintain relative position. Alternatively, see \"'''downwinder'''\".\n* '''Tea-bagging''': popping out of and falling back into the water intermittently due to light or gusty wind, poor flying skills, twisted lines etc.\n* '''Toe side''': the side of a board on the edge where a riders toes are (opposite of heel side). \"Riding toe side\" is riding with toes down.\n* '''Underpowered''': the condition of having insufficient power from the kite. Can be a result of insufficient wind, choosing a kite that is too small for the wind, rigging incorrectly, board too small, water current in the same direction as the wind, not riding fast enough, etc. A rider who is continuously diving the kite and sending it back up in a sine-wave pattern is usually underpowered.\n* '''Unhooked''' is when a kitesurfer is riding while the chicken loop is not attached to the rider's harness.\n* '''Upwind''': the direction from which the wind is blowing; windward; into the wind.\n* '''VaS conditions''': [[Victory at Sea]]; rough sea conditions characterized by overhead wind waves causing severe shore break.\n* '''Wakestyle''': A style of kiteboarding in which the rider usually uses wakeboarding (or kiteboarding) \"boots\" for their kiteboard (as opposed to straps and pads), ensuring their feet remain firmly attached at all times (hense the term \"Wakestyle\").  This style is also associated with performing powered tricks with the kite as low to the water as possible (something generally perceived by kiteboarders to be more difficult and stylish).\n* '''Walk of shame''' is the act of beach walking back upwind to the location where the kite was originally launched. It could mean that the kiter wasn't able to sail upwind.\n* '''Wind-dummy''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Guinea pig'''.\n* '''Zenith''' the location in the wind window directly over the kiter's head. This is the neutral position where kitesurfers can place the kite to stop moving or prior to movement. This places the kite in a more vulnerable to \"Hindenburgs\" position than any other.\n\n== Market data ==\n{{As of|2012|alt=In 2012}}, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] and [[International Kiteboarding Association|IKA]] at 1.5 million persons worldwide<ref name=\":3\" /> (pending review). The global market for kite gear sales is worth US$250 million.<ref name=\":4\" /> The markets related to kiteboarding keep developing at a very interesting pace, as seen in these statistics from 2012:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiteforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=2387270|title=Kite sales statistics - 2014 - Kiteforum.com|website=www.kiteforum.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n\n* 60,000 new kiters annually \n* 180,000 kites sold annually \n* 75,000 boards sold annually \n* 14 board builders \n* 19 kite builders\n\nEvolution of kite sales, worldwide:\n\n* 1999:  29,000\n* 2006: 114,465\n* 2008: 140,000\n* 2012: 180,000\n\nKeep in mind that a kiteboarding quiver for a single user could typically include 2-4 kites and 2-3 boards. With the innovation associated with foil boards and foil kites these numbers will increase. With the exception of foil kites, these equipment pieces are quite rugged and would last from 3 up to 10 years of active use, and be repaired and resold several times. This aftermarket further improves the market development, removing cost barriers for newbies which improves the popularity of the sport, and eventually could bring up new products and services based on a much larger market scale. In locations like Portugal in 2018, a newcomer to kiteboarding typically buys a proper hands-on tutorial and then buys a basic set of used equipment for an overall total below \u20ac1000.\n\nThe sport is utterly convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than surf and paddling boards. Compared to other sailing sports, kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient. Moreover, nearby most metropolitan areas, it can be practised almost all year long, since it just requires some wind and a reasonably flat surface, like an estuary, a lake, a sandy strip, or a snow flat.\n\nDespite the image of a youth radical sport, many newcomers are middle age, older than the typical wakeboard or snowboard practitioners. Such trends are quite conspicuous, not so much in the trendy summer holiday locations, but in the low season in metropolitan areas around the globe, where kiteboarding is becoming a regular practice for people of middle income, living in apartments not so close to the waterfront, for a short evasion and substituting for the gym.\n\n==Compared to windsurfing==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!   !!

Upwind riders adopt a similar stance to kite fliers onshore, who slide their feet forward in the beach sand to brake the kite. The kite board's center line is way off the track line, dramatically reducing speed.|| About 45\u00b0 from wind direction depending on the skills of the rider. The sail board's center line runs virtually parallel to the track line, as most lateral forces are encountered by the tail fin and little edging is required. Because of this, upwind courses are fairly fast.  Fastest speeds are achieved at [[Points of sail|broad reach]].\n|-\n| '''Theory''' || The faster the kite moves the more force it develops. Standing still and actively steering the kite up and down (pumping) one can almost immediately create a lot of force. It is almost always possible to have the kite travel faster (much) than the board. The dynamic nature of the kiter/kite system is why kites have so much range (wind range). || The sail and board move at the same speed. With pumping one can sometimes push oneself onto a plane or maintain planing in marginal conditions. But sail and board travel at basically the same speed. This is the main reason why windsurfing requires a lot of equipment. The equipment must match the wind conditions much closer than kiting.\n|-\n| '''Physical Strain on Rider''' || The traction force of the kite is solely transferred to the rider via the harness loop attached to the harness hook when hooked in. When \"hooked in\" the rider uses muscle strength (thumb and index finger suffice) to steer the kite and control the kite power by pushing the bar in and out (depending on setup one might actually notice a slight effort). When \"unhooked\" the rider steers the kite using their arms with no depower, which can be strenuous. Generally, kitesurfing is more of a light cardio training. || Windsurfing without a harness requires a lot of physical effort, especially in strong wind. With a harness, recovering from a fall or when maneuvering (jibing, tacking, ...) the rider needs to detach the harness completely from the sail, which means that both traction and steering forces are to be countered solely by the rider's muscle. For jibing maneuvers, muscle effort diminishes as the rider becomes more skilled in maintaining board speed in the jibe. In race conditions it can get quite physical as well, planing \"over the top\" of wave sets keeping the board absolutely level and the sail well powered. In the strongest winds it can get physical as well due to the sheer force of the wind, but that is attributed to poor choice of equipment or lack of skill.\n|-\n| '''Fall Recovery''' || The kite is fairly easy to keep flying during a fall, with 'Hindenburgs' being rather exceptional. The rider can be pulled out of the water by the force of the moving kite. The kite power can be regulated by changing the [[angle of attack]] of the kite. In light winds the kite may fall into the water and stay there. || In light winds (non planing conditions), the rider needs to get on the board and pull the sail out of the water. However, in stronger winds (planing conditions (depending of equipment/weight/experience approx. from 9 knots on)), water starting is a better option.  This means positioning the board-sail combination through aligning the sail into the right wind angle, allowing the wind to pull the body out of the water onto the board using the sail, and then easily hooking back in and stepping into foot straps. This maneuver actually requires slightly less than planing conditions. \n|-\n| '''[[Glossary of nautical terms|Tacking and Jibing]]''' || Twin tip kiteboards (the majority of kiteboards) are designed to be bidirectional. If the rider wants to start the next tack only the kite's sailing direction must be reversed. The \"stern\" of the board now becomes the \"bow\", so the feet can be kept in the footstraps. Since the windward edge of the board doesn't change sides, the terms \"jibing\" or \"tacking\" are somewhat of a misnomer. Falling into the water is not a major problem, as even beginning riders can quickly and fairly effortlessly execute a water start using the kite to pull them out of the water. Nower days many kiters use directionals as well (all wave, racing as well as foils). These need to be jibed or tacked. This actually requires practice. Full planing race jibes are almost as difficult as in windsurfing. || The rider has the choice between tacking or jibing. In both cases the windward edge changes sides, so the rider will need to change footstraps. At high winds the only option to change tacks while maintaining speed is to carve jibe, which is a maneuver that requires many practise hours for it to be performed with a reasonably low risk of falling. . \n|-\n| '''Jumping''' || Kitesurfers can use their kite to \"jump\" (actually using it as a [[Paragliding|paraglider]]), without the need for a launch wave. Jumping is relatively easy but can be hazardous. Being launched (jumping) can also happen unintended, even to beginners, especially in shifting winds or fast kite movements, where the rider can get pulled into the air as the kite reverses direction. || The rider needs considerable forward speed and ideally a \"ramp wave\" to get airborne. When the wave is not large enough, the riders must initiate the jump by kicking down the tail of the board. Unintended jumps rarely occur (unless bouncing over waves, ...), as jumping requires active rider input. Jumping requires skill and can generally only be executed by advanced riders.\n|-\n| '''Aerobatics''' || Most aerobatics and tricks (tail grab, [[barrel roll]] etc.) can be executed without the airfoil's position in the air having to change. Therefore, executing \"aerobatics\" is only marginally different from executing them on shore suspended by the harness from some fixed point. Beginners with a lot of caution may start attempting some basic tricks after the first few weeks or even days. This part of kiting can actually be physical. || With most aerobatics the airfoil's position in the air changes dramatically. Each figure has its own ideal airfoil movement. With some aerobatics like the barrel roll, the rider needs to jump sufficiently high to allow the full length of the mast to rotate forward underneath. Often the risks to the rider of having fast moving and relatively heavy (board + mast + sail) gear so close by are substantial. As aerobatics are considerably more complicated than jumping, they are the done by the most experienced of riders, commanding huge respect within the sail boarding community.\n|-\n| '''Clearance''' || Clearance of at least 50 meters upwind (from any object) and 30 meters downwind (from another kitesurfer) is required. The risk of being blown into an airborne situation by a strong wind gust is real, effectively turning the kite boarder into an uncontrolled [[Paragliding|para-glider]] in risk of hitting any object downwind. || Since there are no kite lines, no upwind or downwind clearance is required from any object other than a kite surfer or fishing lines, which means that windsurfers do not need to worry about 'rotor' or strong wind gusts. Also, they can emergency stop almost immediately. Experienced riders will do this by 'crashing' while beginning riders (who typically do not wear a harness) can depower the sail instantly by releasing the back hand or letting the mast fall on water. The risk of hitting hard objects or other water-goers is therefore minimal.\n|-\n| '''Learning Curve''' || Kiteboarding has a different learning curve from windsurfing.  At the beginning the handling the kite can be largely taught on shore, as kite boarding evolved from beach [[Kite|kiting]]. However once on the water you need to be safely guided by an instructor until you learn the basics.  After you have the basics and are independent you will progress much faster than in windsurfing.\nRecovery from falling is relatively easy (the kites, especially the newest models, stay normally aloft to pull the rider out of the water, with little effort) as is changing tacks, even in strong wind. Staying upwind is regarded as an advanced technique. Light wind kiting (<9 knots) is also an advanced technique: traveling much faster than the wind any mistake can lead to loss of apparent wind -> kite falls into the drink and stays there. \n|| The learning curve for windsurfing is gradual, and rewarding as the rider progresses through each stage of learning, and one can engage in solo practice. Initially handling of the airfoil (sail) can be learned on the water or on land. Once on the water it takes much of practice to improve.\n\nRecovery from falling takes more effort than kiting. The rider needs to either up haul the sail standing on the board or water start, which both take some balance. Up hauling large sails can be a bit of work. Falling into the water is part of the overall experience.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Safety''' || In case of material failure or accidents, normal kitesurfing equipment offers limited rescue possibilities. Kitesurfers can perform a self rescue and use their kite to sail back to shore. The last option for the rider is to abandon the kite and kiteboard and swim to shore. || Any sail board will allow the rider to keep the body sufficiently out of the water to postpone or avoid [[hypothermia]]. Smaller boards may require that the mast be detached, to avoid sinking. Thus, as a rule, a rider should never abandon the board. Windsurfing equipment is inherently safe in high winds against tea bagging or collisions due to loss of control: In case of too strong wind, the rider can depower the sail instantly by letting go with the back hand or letting the sail drop on water. Doing so (or falling) means that the board stops almost immediately as the sail will act as a floating anchor in water.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Transport''' || A kite and kiteboard will fit in most vehicles. An average rider may need two to three kites and one board to ride in a wide range of wind strength. || The sail board and sail mast (even telescopic) do not fit in most vehicles, and need to be transported on a roof rack or trailer. If they do, they will often exclude passengers from the vehicle. Several different sails and boards (and often masts and booms) are necessary to cover the full range of rideable conditions.\n|}\n\n== World Champions ==\n[[File:Aaron Hadlow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aaron Hadlow]] dominated Freestyle from 2004 to 2008]] \n[[File:Gisela Pulido Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|{{ill|Gisela Pulido|es|vertical-align=sup}} is ten times Freestyle Champion]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Freestyle PKRA/VKWC/WKL/GKA Sanctioned Tours\n!

In 1978, Ian Day's \"FlexiFoil\" kite-powered Tornado [[catamaran]] exceeded 40&nbsp;km/h.\n\nIn October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent<ref>[http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=NL&NR=7603691&KC=&FT=E], Patent NL7603691  (A) \u2015 11 October 1977</ref> for KiteSurfing. The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surf board type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze type belt. Although this patent did not result in any commercial interest, Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise could be considered as the originator of KiteSurfing.\n\nOn 28 August 1982 Greg Locke and Simon Carter, from [[Brighton]] UK, set the world record for kite traction at sea, travelling nearly 26 miles under wind power alone along the English channel.<ref>[http://www.kitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Kite-Lines-v4-3.pdf], Kitelines Vol 4, No. 3, p60</ref> This followed a successful crossing of the English Channel from Sussex to France by Locke & Carter the previous year.\n\nThrough the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, [[ice skate]]s, snow skis,<ref name=Harris1>Mark Harris [http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html Sea kayaking and kites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703034411/http://alpha2.bmc.uu.se/mark/kayak/kayak_kite.html |date=3 July 2006 }}, July 2002</ref> [[water ski]]s and [[roller skates]].\n\nThroughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from [[Germany]] developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kite-skiing system using self-made [[paraglider]]s and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skywing.de|title=Dieter Strasilla|publisher=}}</ref> Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn used this invention also in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies and self-made buggies.<ref>{{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ZzPXzK6wg |title= History of paragliding: Andrea with surfboard and skywing |date= 1987 |author=  Dieter Strasilla}}</ref> One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing.<ref>Patent DE2933050</ref>\n\nTwo brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of [[France]], developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1984, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products.\n\nIn 1990, practical [[kite buggy]]ing was pioneered by [[Peter Lynn]] at Argyle Park in [[Ashburton, New Zealand]]. Lynn coupled a three-wheeled buggy with a forerunner of the modern [[parafoil]] kite. Kite buggying proved to be popular worldwide, with over 14,000 buggies sold up to 1999.\n\nThe development of modern-day kitesurfing by the Roeselers in the [[United States]] and the Legaignoux in [[France]] carried on in parallel to buggying. Bill Roeseler, a [[Boeing]] [[aerodynamicist]], and his son Cory Roeseler patented the \"KiteSki\" system which consisted of water skis powered by a two-line delta style kite controlled via a bar mounted combined winch/brake. The KiteSki was commercially available in 1994. The kite had a rudimentary water launch capability and could go upwind. In 1995, Cory Roeseler visited [[Peter Lynn]] at New Zealand's Lake Clearwater in the Ashburton Alpine Lakes area, demonstrating speed, balance and upwind angle on his 'ski'. In the late 1990s, Cory's ski evolved to a single board similar to a surfboard.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kirklandreporter.com/news/inventors-of-kiteboarding-inducted-into-kirkland-plaza-of-champions/ |date= 28 May 2015 |title= Inventors of kiteboarding inducted into Kirkland Plaza of Champions |publisher= Kirkland Reporter}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Laird Hamilton2.jpg|thumb|[[Laird Hamilton]] demonstrated kitesurfing in 1996]]\n\nIn 1996, [[Laird Hamilton]] and [[Manu Bertin]] were instrumental in demonstrating and popularising kitesurfing off the [[Hawaii]] a coast of [[Maui]] while in Florida Rapha\u00ebl Baruch changed the name of the sport from flysurfing to kitesurfing by starting and promoting the first commercial brand of the industry \"Kitesurf\".\n\nIn 1997, the Legaignoux brothers developed and sold the breakthrough \"Wipika\" kite design which had a structure of preformed inflatable tubes and a simple bridle system to the wingtips, both of which greatly assisted water re-launch. Bruno Legaignoux has continued to improve kite designs, including developing the [[bow kite]] design, which has been licensed to many kite manufacturers.\n\nIn 1997, specialized kiteboards were developed by Rapha\u00ebl Salles and Laurent Ness.  By the end of 1998 kitesurfing had become an extreme sport, distributed and taught through a handful group of shops and schools worldwide. The first competition was held on [[Maui]] in September 1998 and won by Flash Austin.<ref name=\"Lynn1\"/>\n\nStarting in 1999, kitesurfing became a mainstream sport with the entry of key windsurfing manufacturers namely [[Robby Naish]] and [[Neil Pryde]]. Single direction boards derived from windsurfing and surfing designs became the dominant form of kiteboard.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Action Sport 2 (2).png|thumb|evolution of extreme sports]]\n\nIn 2000, a new freestyle competition, sponsored by [[Red Bull]] was launched in [[Maui]]. The competition, named [[Red Bull King of the Air]], judged riders on height, versatility, and style. The competition is still held annually in Cape Town, South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Red Bull King of the Air: Learn more about the history and legends |url=https://www.redbull.com/za-en/history%20and%20legends%20%20of%20red%20bull%20king%20of%20the%20air}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2001 onwards, twin-tip bi-directional boards became more popular for most flat water riders, with directional boards still in use for surf conditions.\n\nIn May 2012, the course racing style of kitesurfing was announced as a sport for the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio Olympics]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sailing.org/27425.php |date= 5 May 2012 |title= ISAF Selects Kiteboarding For Rio 2016 |publisher= [[International Sailing Federation]]}}</ref> replacing [[windsurf]]ing.

IKA repeatedly threatened to ban riders which take part in competitions without its endorsement.\n\nIn 2015 PKRA was sold to a group of investors becoming Virgin Kitesurfing World Championships (VKWC).\n\nThe WS itself has split the governance of its own events between the GKA for the expression disciplines and the IKA for the racing disciplines. The GKA has then split the expression disciplines, choosing to run the Wave and Strapless Tour themselves, while ceding to the World Kiteboarding League to run the freestyle events and the Kite Park League to run the park events. The freestyle events where then handed to the Kiteboarding Riders United (KRU).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/kiteboarding/world-kiteboarding-league-is-no-longer-sanctioned-by-world-sailing|title=World Kiteboarding League is no longer sanctioned by World Sailing|last=SurferToday.com|first=Editor at|website=Surfertoday|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Styles==\n{{Tone|section|date=August 2017}}\nSeveral different kitesurfing styles are evolving, some of which cross over.<ref name=\"Kitesurfing styles\"/>\n\nStyles of kiteboarding, include freestyle, freeride, speed, course racing, wakestyle, big air, park, and surfing.<ref name=\"Kitesurfing styles\">[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/kitesurfing-styles Kitesurfing styles], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Style<br />!! Description !! Similar sports\n|-\n| '''Freeride'''|| Freeride is anything that you want it to be and the most popular kitesurfing style. Most boards sold today are designed for freeride.  It's about having fun and learning new techniques.  Twintip boards and kites with good relaunch and a wide wind range are commonly used.|| \n|-\n| '''Freestyle'''|| The kite and board are used to get big air (jumps) so that various tricks can be done while airborne.  This style also used for competitive events and is free-format and \"go anywhere\". Smaller twintip boards and kites with good boost and hangtime are used.|| \n|-\n| '''Wave-riding'''|| Wave riding (kitesurfing) in waves is a style that combines kiteboarding with surfing. Locations with a [[Surf break|wave break]] are required. Most kitesurfers use a directional board (either with or without foot straps) that has enough flotation and sufficient turning characteristics to surf the wave. Many kiters use a surfboard that can also be used for regular surfing (with the foot straps removed). The kitesurfer follows the kite when riding the wave, so the pull of the kite is reduced. This style is popular with [[surfers]] since it resembles [[tow-in surfing]]. Some riders ride waves unhooked, and without foot straps. Foot straps dictate the kitesurfer's foot position and how weight and pressure is applied to the board.  Surfers (other than tow-in surfers) do not wear straps and are therefore free to move their feet and position their weight over a greater area of the board to match what is needed to flow with the wave.  Kitesurfing using a board without foot straps is referred to as \"riding strapless\". This allows the kitesurfer's feet to move around the board for optimal performance.  Kitesurfers using foot straps often use the power of the kite to position themselves on a wave and to control their board. That is, they rely on the kite for propulsion rather than the power of the wave to surf.||[[Surfing]], [[tow-in surfing]]\n|-\n| '''Wakestyle'''|| Tricks and aerials, using a wake-style board with bindings.  May also include tricks and jumps involving ramps. Crossover from [[wakeboarding]]. Flat water is perfect for this style, and the use of big twintip boards with high rocker and wake booties is common. This style is commonly practiced by younger riders.|| [[Wakeboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Jumping''' or '''Airstyle'''|| Jumping, arguably a subset of Freeride, consists of jumping high to optionally perform tricks, sometimes also using kiteloops to get extra hang-time. Often shorter lines and smaller kites are used in stronger wind. C-kites and twintip boards are commonly used. An extension of this style is '''Big Air''' as pioneered by [[Ruben Lenten]] where riders go out in gale force conditions and perform high risk moves like kiteloops or more exactly '''megaloops''' || \u2014\n|-\n| '''Wakeskate'''|| Wakeskaters use a strapless twintip board, similar to [[skateboard]]. Flat water and other conditions similar to Wakestyle.|| [[Skateboarding]]\n|-\n| '''Course racing''' || These are racing events - like a yacht race along a course, that involve both speed and tactics.  Special purpose directional race boards with long fins are used. Some raceboards resemble [[windsurfing]] boards. [[Foilboard]]<nowiki/>s are also now used. The goal is to outperform other kiters and come first in the race. || [[Windsurfing]]\n|-\n| '''Speed racing''' || Speed racing is a style practiced at either formal race events or informally, usually with GPS units. Special purpose directional speed boards, or raceboards with long fins are used.  The goal is travel at the maximum possible speed over 500 meters.||\n|-\n|'''Park Riding'''\n|Park riding resembles wakestyle. Riders use wakeboarding obstacles to perform tricks on them. Difficulty, execution and style\n|-\n| '''Foiling'''|| Foiling involves the attachment of a hydrofoil (foil) and mast to the base a board.  The foil allows the board to completely exit the water frees the rider from impact of surface conditions.  The extreme efficiency of a foil allows it's rider to propel themselves with significantly less wind than those riding the on water's surface while greatly increasing upwind ability and speed.  Different sizes and shapes of the wings on the foil allow one to optimize their boards for speed, stability, or waves. \n|}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Zanzibar island Copia (22).jpg|Unhooked freestyle\nFile:Board Off - panoramio.jpg|Board Off hooked-in freestyle\nFile:Jesse Richman by MakenaStockMedia 3.jpg|[[Foilboard|Foiling]] with a kite\nFile:Jesse Richman - Pierre Bouras 1.jpg|Wave-riding\nFile:MINI KTE France 2012 (10798352846).jpg|Course racing\nFile:Luderitz Speed Canal.jpg|The [[L\u00fcderitz Speed Challenge]] had set records\n</gallery>\n\n==Techniques==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nKiteboarding can pose hazards to surfers, beachgoers, bystanders and others on the water. Many problems and dangers that may be encountered while learning kiting can be avoided or minimized by taking professional instruction through lesson centers. Kitesurfing schools provide courses and lessons to teach skills including kite launching, flying, landing, usage of the bar, lines and safety devices. Basic skills include:\n* Turning, particularly the \"heel turn jibe\"\n* Controlled flying and jumping, the primary attractions of the sport\n* Board grabs, tricks performed while a rider is jumping or has gained air from popping by grabbing the board in a number of positions with either hand. Each grab has a different name dependent on which part of the board is grabbed and with which hand grabs it. The names generally originate from other board sports like [[Grabs (skateboarding)|skateboarding]] and [[snowboarding]]\n<gallery>\nFile:Kitesurf jump aerial.jpg|Jumping\nFile:Kitesurfer1.jpg|Big Air\nFile:Kitedge.jpg|Kiteboarder edging his board\n</gallery>\n\n==The wind==\n[[File:Windvenster.jpg|thumb|The [[wind]] window]]\n\n===Wind strength and kite sizes===\nKitesurfers change kite size and/or line length depending on wind strength \u2014 stronger winds call for a smaller kite to prevent overpower situations. Kitesurfers will determine the wind strength using either an [[anemometer]] or, more typically, visual clues as shown in the [[Beaufort scale]]. Modern kites dedicated to kitesurfing provide a \"depower\" option to reduce the power in the kite. By using depower, the kite's angle of attack to the wind is reduced, thereby catching less wind in the kite and reducing the pull.\n\n[[Bow kite]]s have a wider wind range than C-kites, so two kite sizes (such as 7 m\u00b2 and 12 m\u00b2) could form an effective quiver for winds ranging from 10 to 30+ knots for a 75&nbsp;kg (165&nbsp;lb) rider.<ref>[http://www.kitesurfbarcelona.com/nkb_mnl12_rebel_en.pdf North Rebel Manual 2012North Sails kitesurfbarcelona.com] 1 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Wind direction and speed===\nCross-shore and cross-onshore winds are the best for unassisted kiteboarding. Direct onshore winds carry the risk of being thrown onto land or stuck in shallows. Direct offshore winds pose the danger of being blown away from the shore in the event of equipment failure or loss of control. However offshore winds can be quite suitable in confined waters, like in a lake or estuary, or when a safety boat is assisting.\n\nThe kiter must maintain a clear perception of the wind direction but also of the wind speed. The Beaufort scale<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/beaufort.html|title=Beaufort Wind Scale|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> is of great assistance in helping users assess the situation. A range of wind up to 33 knots covers the conditions for a safe practice for an experienced rider. A less experienced one should avoid riding with more than 15 knots. Most twintip boards and inflatable kites would be barely rideable below 11 knots, therefore for most cases a user should focus on the winds classified as moderate up to strong.\n\n=== Apparent wind ===\nEven if there is no wind blowing, a kiter can act on the kite lines and force it to move, and then, like with a row, it generates some force resulting from the incidence of the air into the kite's surface. In a gentle breeze, if the user action increases the air speed around the kite 10 times, the generated force increases 100 times, since the wind force acting on a kite is proportional to the square of the wind speed acting on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html|title=The Lift Equation|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> Thus the relevant notion of ''apparent'' wind, which is the actual wind acting on the moving kite, sail or wing.\n\nThe apparent wind is measured taking the moving kite as the reference frame, therefore its other name as ''relative wind''. By opposition, the wind measured relatively to the ground is called ''true wind''.\n\nWhile the other wind sports can generate considerable apparent wind, their wind forces are limited by the movement of the user platform, since it is attached more or less rigidly to the wing or sail. In this aspect, kiteboarding seems unique among other wind sports, since it allows the user to generate apparent wind independently of the movement of the user platform, the board. For instance, in the initiating kiteboard technic called ''waterstart'', while the user prepares to start in the water, the kite is sent aggressively, generating a propulsive impulse. Then the resulting movement of the board increases tension on the kite lines, which the user controls to manage the riding speed and to navigate at will. The composition of the movements of both the kite and the board, offer the user a great deal of navigation flexibility and creativity, including the possibility to jump significantly, making this a true 3-dimensional sport.\n\n=== Wind power, control lines and kite paths ===\nIn some way all wind sports harvest the energy of the wind. The greater the volume of the atmosphere available to be harvested by the sails, the bigger the available energy to propel the users. As a taller sailing ship harvests more energy from the wind, so does a kiteboarder with longer lines. Compared to a kiteboarder, a windsurfer can extract a higher ratio of wind energy from the available atmosphere volume, but since such volume is much smaller, the resulting energy could be much less than in kiteboarding.\n\nTo increase the power, the kiteboarder typically navigates the kite along an S-shape path, increasing the harvesting of energy since it is traversing most of the atmosphere volume around him. This S-shaped movement is most common when the kiters need a moderate improvement of power. If the user needs an intense improvement of power, it loops the kite. Such loops are stronger when the loop radius is large, and traverses a larger atmosphere volume. The kite loop is an advanced practice, and its power can be quite dangerous. With most modern kites and control bars, to end a kite loop the user just pushes away or releases the bar.\n\nRegarding the length of the lines connecting the kite to the user, longer lines allow the user to harvest wind energy in a larger volume.  Due to the boundary layer effect<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/boundlay.html|title=Boundary Layer|website=www.grc.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref> longer lines also allow to harvest stronger winds higher up in the atmosphere. But longer lines make the kite slower to respond to the user actions on the control bar, since the lines form a more pronounced spring-like catenary. Therefore, kitesurfers, who need to react fast to incoming waves, tend to use shorter lines than the other kiters. For safety reasons the newcomers to the sport are usually trained with short lines, limiting the power build up.\n\n=== Wind window ===\nThe ''wind window'' is the 180 degree arc of the sky downwind of the rider in which the kite can be flown - roughly one fourth of a sphere's surface, which radius is the length of the lines. It is the atmosphere volume in which the kiter can navigate the kite to harvest wind energy.\n\nIf the rider is facing downwind on a surface, like the ocean, the wind window covers roughly all the area the rider can see, from the rider's peripheral vision on one side, along the horizon to the other side, and then directly overhead back to the first side. If the rider somehow puts the kite out of the window \u2014 for example, by riding downwind too quickly and sending the kite directly overhead and behind, the kite will stall and often fall out of the sky.\n\nThe eventual inefficiency of the kite can obviate for it to reach the edge of the wind window. In such cases the magnitude of the wind window can be reduced to as little as a 120 degree arc, instead of the expected 180 degree.\n\nThe wind window is centered in the user location. Since the user is carried by the board, the wind window is affected by the movement of the board. Therefore, the wind window rotates as the board moves and generates apparent wind into itself. For instance, when the kiter navigates perpendicular to the true wind at a speed equal to the true wind's, the apparent wind felt on the board increases 42% compared to the true wind, but rotates 45\u00ba against the movement. With such rotation, even if the user keeps the kite at the very edge of the wind window for trying to keep it pulling in the travelling direction, the kite lines would be at an angle of 45\u00ba downwind of the board path, forcing the kiter to edge the board to oppose its tendency to slip downwind. Such board edging is an indispensable technique for navigating upwind, and can be made at a much more extreme angle to the kite lines, almost up to 90\u00ba.\n\nThe wind window rotation degrades the performance when riding fast in a path upwind. To minimize the wind window rotation and sail upwind as much as possible, the kiter should keep the slowest board speed without sinking the board by lack of hydrodynamic lift. High flotation boards like surfboards are preferable in such cases. Also, keeping the kite high in window, pulling up the user and the board, is quite efficient in coping both with the reduced hydrodynamic lift of the board and with the intended reduction of the board speed.\n\n=== Arbitrary atmosphere volume swept by the kite ===\nThe kite is a peculiar sail because it can be swept arbitrarily through the atmosphere, usually in specific patterns, so the user can harvest a significant amount of wind energy, much larger than with an equivalent sail fixed to a mast.\n[[File:SweptVolumes.png|thumb|The peculiar travel pattern of a kite, compared to a sail fixed to a mast as in windsurf]]\nThe kite and the lines are light, in the range between 2 and 4&nbsp;kg, but the aerodynamic drag can be significant since the kite can travel much faster than a windsurf sail. Therefore, part of the energy harvested is spent in the movement of the kite itself, but the remainder propels the user and the board.\n\nFor instance, a user riding towards the beach rises the kite to slow it down and convert traction into lift. Then, instead of speed he feels an increase of the force upwards, necessary to keep himself above the breaking waves.\n\nAnother specific advantage of the kite being able to be swept at will, is that the user can take advantage of the atmosphere boundary layer, either rising the kite to harvest the stronger winds blowing in the higher zone of the wind window, or during overpowering gusts he can drive the kite low, skimming the water near the edge of the wind window.\n\n=== Air temperature and humidity ===\nSeasoned kiteboarders frequently attribute to moist and hotter air a notable reduction in kite performance. In fact the [[coefficient of lift|lift force]] of a kite is proportional to the air density. Since both the temperature and the relative humidity are important detrimental factors in the air density, the kiters subjective valuation is correct.\n\nIn the range between 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C a kite loses approximately 0.4% of lift per degree Celsius. It means that a kiter practicing one given day in the Baltic, and then travelling to the Mediterranean, could experience 10% less pull using the very same kite at the very same wind speed.\n\n==Locations==\n\nAny location with consistent, steady side-onshore winds (10 to 35+ knots), large open bodies of water and good launch areas is suitable for kitesurfing. Most kitesurfing takes place along ocean shores, usually off beaches, but it can also be practiced on large lakes and inlets and occasionally on rivers. Since kiteboarding relies heavily on favorable, consistent wind conditions, certain locations tend to become popular and sought out by kiteboarders.\n\n; Boracay, Philippines\n: [[Boracay]] offers constant side onshore winds during the November to April main season in a turquoise shallow water lagoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whenwherekite.com/Bulabog-beach-Boracay-Philippines.html|title=Wind statistics Bulabog beach}}</ref>\n\n; Cumbuco, Brazil\n: [[Cumbuco]] has strong side shore wind every day and wide sandy beach lagoon, the best season is from August to December, although January and February can be good as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go-kite.com/index.php/kite-brazil-cumbuco/kitesurf|title=Go Kite - Cumbuco, Brazil}}</ref>\n\n; Maui, Hawaii, US\n: in [[Maui]], the tropical Kite Beach has warm waters, steady winds and gentle waves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.actionsportsmaui.com/kite-beach/|title=Action Sports Maui - Kite Beach}}</ref>\n\n; Nabq Bay, Egypt\n: [[Sharm El Sheikh]] is a beach town with shallow and flat waters, the wind blows at least 20 knots on most days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripping.com/explore/the-10-best-places-for-kiteboarding-in-the-world|title=Tripping - Nabq Bay, Egypt}}</ref>\n\n; Tarifa, Spain\n: [[Tarifa]] is a 10&nbsp;km long bay with a wide, sandy beach.

Moreover, the sport is convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than most surf and [[paddling]] boards.\n\nEquipment depreciation can cost between \u00a3270 per year for second hand gear, to \u00a31360 per year for brand new, not discounted kites and accessories.<!--ref name=iksurfmagDec2019/-->\nIn 2017, 150,000 kites were sold globally, compared to 400,000 surfboards sold each year.<ref name=iksurfmagDec2019>{{cite news |url= https://www.iksurfmag.com/issue78/?page=51 |title= How Much Does It Cost To Kitesurf? |magazine= iksurfmag |issue= 78 |author= Rou Chater |date= December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Power kites===\n[[File:Lei-bow-foil-kites.svg|thumb|upright|A '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|LEI]]'''(R), '''[[Bow kite|Bow]]'''(L) and '''[[Foil kite|Foil]]'''(T) [[Power kite]]s]]\nA [[power kite]] is available in two major forms: '''[[Leading edge inflatable kite|leading edge inflatables]]''' and '''[[foil kite]]s'''.\n\n====Leading edge inflatables====\n[[File:PowerSail detail.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s''', known also as '''inflatables''', '''LEI kites''', are typically made from ripstop polyester with an inflatable plastic bladder that spans the front edge of the kite with separate smaller bladders that are perpendicular to the main bladder to form the chord or foil of the kite.<ref>[http://www.kiteboardingreview.com LEIs], Kiteboarding Review, 27 June 2011</ref> The inflated bladders give the kite its shape and also keep the kite floating once dropped in the water. LEIs are the most popular choice among kitesurfers thanks to their quicker and more direct response to the rider's inputs, easy relaunchability if crashed into the water and resilient nature. If an LEI kite hits the water or ground too hard or is subjected to substantial wave activity, bladders can burst or it can be torn apart.\n\nIn 2005, '''[[Bow kite]]s''' (also known as '''flat LEI kites''') were developed with features including a concave trailing edge, a shallower arc in planform, and a distinctive bridle with multiple attachment points along the leading edge. These features allow the kite's angle of attack to be altered more and thus adjust the amount of power being generated to a much greater degree than previous LEIs. These kites can be fully depowered, which is a significant safety feature. They can also cover a wider wind range than a comparable C-shaped kite. The ability to adjust the angle of attack also makes them easier to re-launch when lying front first on the water. Bow kites are popular with riders from beginner to advanced levels. Most [[LEI kite]] manufacturers developed a variation of the bow kite by 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kitesurfingmag.com/north-kiteboarding-signs-up-for-kite-patent/|title=North signs up for Best Kiteboarding patent - Kitesurfing Magazine|publisher=}}</ref>  Bow kites with a straight trailing edge are named \u00b4delta\u00b4 kites, given their triangular outline.\n\nEarly bow kites had some disadvantages compared to classic LEI kites:\n\n* They can become inverted and then not fly properly\n* They can be twitchy and not as stable\n* Heavier bar pressure makes them more tiring to fly\n* Lack of \"sled boosting\" effect when jumping<ref>[http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm Flat Inflatable Kites, Bow Kites, Flat LEIs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223649/http://kitesurfingschool.org/Flat%20LEI.htm |date=1 June 2007 }}, Kitesufingschool.org, 27 June 2006</ref>\n\nIn 2006, second generation flat LEI kites were developed which combine near total depower and easy, safe relaunch with higher performance, no performance penalties and reduced bar pressure. Called '''Hybrid or SLE kites''' (Supported Leading Edge), these kites are suitable for both beginners and experts.\n\nIn 2008, Naish introduced another kite design, with their \"Sigma Series\" of kites. These kites are a SLE design and feature a unique \"bird in flight\" shape with the center of the kite swept back to put much of the sail area behind the tow point, which Naish claims has multiple benefits.\n\nIn 2009, the performance revolution shows no sign of slowing. Bridled designs feel more like C kites, and five-line hybrids have better depower capability than ever before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|title=2009 Kiteboarding Buyers'Guide|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404021939/http://www.sbckiteboard.com/kitesurfing_photos?news_id=807&uniqid=479|archivedate=4 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are more than thirty companies manufacturing [[Leading edge inflatable kite]]s. The '''delta-kites''' are growing in popularity since 2008 with around 12 companies offering '''delta-kites''' since 2008/2009.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013 kite technology has continued to grow.  Kites have become lighter, more durable, much easier to launch and safer.  Manufacturers have continued to add new safety features.  This has resulted in a growing number of new riders, both younger and older.  In 2013, there are at least 20 \"major\" kite manufacturers, each with multiple models available.  Many of the manufacturers are on their third or fourth generation of kites.<ref>kiteboardingreview.com</ref>\n\n====Foil kites====\n[[File:LEIpowerKite.jpg|thumb|A [[Foil kite]]]]\n\n'''[[Foil kite]]s''' are also mostly fabric ([[ripstop nylon]]) with air pockets (air cells) to provide it with lift and a fixed bridle to maintain the kite's arc-shape, similar to a [[paraglider]]. Foil kites have the advantage of not needing to have bladders manually inflated, a process which, with an LEI, can take up to ten minutes.\nFoil kites are designed with either an open or closed cell configuration.\n\n; Open Cell\n: Open cell foils rely on a constant airflow against the inlet valves to stay inflated, but are generally impossible to relaunch if they hit the water, because they have no means of avoiding deflation, and quickly become soaked.\n\n; Closed Cell\n: Closed cell foils are almost identical to open cell foils except they are equipped with inlet valves to hold air in the chambers, thus keeping the kite inflated (or, at least, making the deflation extremely slow) even once in the water. Water relaunches with closed cell foil kites are simpler; a steady tug on the power lines typically allows them to take off again. An example for a closed cell kite is the [[Arc Kite]].\n\n====Kite sizes====\nKites come in sizes ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, the larger the surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also directly linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size\u2014wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots. Kites come in a variety of designs. Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the kite's flying characteristics. 'Aspect ratio' is the ratio of span to length. High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds.\n\nSeasoned kiteboarders will likely have three or more kite sizes which are needed to accommodate various wind levels, although bow kites may change this, as they present an enormous wind range; some advanced kiters use only one bow kite. Smaller kites are used by light riders, or in strong wind conditions; larger kites are used by heavier riders or in light wind conditions. Larger and smaller kiteboards have the same effect: with more available power a given rider can ride a smaller board. In general, however, most kiteboarders only need one board and one to three kites (7-12 sq m in size).\n\n===Other equipment===\n[[File:Happy-students-3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|A kitesurfer uses a bar with lines to control the kite, attached to a [[Windsurfing harness|harness]], and can wear a [[wetsuit]]]]\n\n* '''Flying lines''' are made of a strong material such as [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]], to handle the dynamic load in unpredictable wind while maintaining a small cross-sectional profile to minimize drag. They come in lengths generally between seven and thirty-three meters. Experimentation with line lengths is common in kiteboarding. The lines attach the rider's control bar to the kite using attachment cords on the kite edges or its bridle. Most power kites use a [[Kite control systems#5-Line Bars|3, 4 or 5-line]] configuration. Most control bars have 4 lines, 2 for most of the propulsive power and 2 for steering and for control of the angle of attack. The 5th line is used to aid in re-launching or to further adjustment of the kite's angle of attack, mostly in C-kites.\n* The '''control bar''' is a solid metal or composite bar which attaches to the kite via the lines. The rider holds on to this bar and controls the kite by pulling at its ends, causing the kite to rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise like a bicycle. Typically a ''chicken loop'' from the control bar is attached to a latch or hook on a spreader bar on the rider's harness. Most bars also provide a quick-release safety-system and a control strap to adjust the kite's minimum [[angle of attack]]. Kite control bars, while lightweight and strong, are usually heavier than water; \"bar floats\" made of foam may be fixed to the lines right above the harness to keep the bar from sinking if lost in the water. Control bars can be specific to a particular kite type and size and not suitable for use with different [[kite types]].\n* A '''kite harness''' comes in seat (with leg loops), waist, or vest types. The harness together with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. The harness reduces the strain of the kite's pull from the rider's arms, spreading it across part of the rider's body. This allows the rider to perform jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist harnesses are the most popular harnesses among advanced riders, although seat harnesses make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider, and vest harnesses provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite harnesses resemble windsurfing harnesses, but with different construction; a windsurfing harness is likely to fail when used for kiteboarding.\n[[File:Kite-board.jpg|thumb|right|Twin tip kiteboard]]\n* '''Kiteboard''', a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now several types of kiteboards: directional surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and are by far the most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.\n[[File:DrySuits.jpg|thumb|right|Kitesurfers wearing [[dry suit]]s on [[Long Island]] in winter when the air and water temperatures are near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C (32&nbsp;\u00b0F)]]\n* A '''wetsuit''' is often worn by kitesurfers, except in warmer conditions with light winds. When kitesurfing in strong winds, body heat loss is reduced by wearing a [[wetsuit]]. A \"shortie\" is worn to protect the torso only, and a full suit is used for protection against cool conditions, from marine life such as [[jellyfish]], and also from abrasions if the rider is dragged by the kite. Neoprene boots are required if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks. [[Dry suit]]s are also used to kitesurf in cold conditions in winter.\n* A '''safety hook knife''' is considered required equipment. The corrosion resistant [[stainless steel]] blade is partially protected by a curved plastic hook. It can be used to cut entangled or snagged [[kite line]]s, or to release the kite if the safety release system fails. Some kitesurfing harnesses are equipped with a small pocket for the knife.\n* A '''helmet''' is often worn by kitesurfers to protect the head from [[blunt trauma]]. [[Helmet]]s prevent head [[lacerations]], and can also reduce the severity of impact injuries to the head, as well as compression injuries to the neck and spine.\n* A '''personal flotation device''' or [[Personal flotation device|PFD]] may be required if the kitesurfer is using a boat or [[personal water craft]] for support. It is also recommended for kitesurfing in deep water in case the kitesurfer becomes disabled and must wait for rescue.\n* An '''impact vest''' provides some protection against impacts to the torso area. They also provide some flotation and preclude the harness to climb the chest and hurt the ribs, during high power maneuvers.\n* A '''[[Surfboard leash|board leash]]''' that attaches the board to the kitesurfer's leg or harness is used by some riders. However, many kitesurfing schools discourage the use of board leashes due to the risk of recoil, where the leash can yank the board to impact the rider, which can result in serious injury or even death. Generally, kitesurfers that use a board leash will also wear a helmet to help protect against this.\n* '''Signaling devices''' are useful if the kitesurfer needs to be rescued. This may be as simple as a whistle attached to the knife, or [[Retroreflector|retro-reflective]] tape applied to the helmet. Some kitesurfers carry a [[mobile phone]] or [[two-way radio]] in a waterproof pouch to use in an emergency. A small [[Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon]] (EPIRB) can be carried and activated to send out a distress signal.\n* A '''buddy''' is important to help with launching and retrieving the kite, and to assist in an emergency.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/faq FAQ], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n* A '''[[GPS]]''' can be used to measure distance travelled, tracks and speed during a session.<ref>[http://kitesurfing-handbook.peterskiteboarding.com/gear/gps-for-kitesurfing GPS for kitesurfing], Kitesurfing Handbook</ref>\n\n== Physical practice ==\n\nKiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2\u20133 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mpora.com/windsurfing-kitesurfing/77-year-old-surf-1|title=Meet David: The 77 Year Old Kite Surfer Showing The Rest Of Us How It's Done - Mpora|work=Mpora|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en-US}}</ref> It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Power kite]]s are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in [[wakeboarding]] and to lift their users to [[Diving (sport)|diving]] heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in difficult environments. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (\"collard\").\n\nIt is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (\"kitemare\", a [[portmanteau]] of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding [[training]], careful development of [[experience]] and consistent use of good judgement and [[safety gear]] should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding.\n\n=== Weather ===\n\n[[Weather forecasting]] and awareness is the principal factor to safe kiteboarding. Lack of weather awareness and understanding the figures is frequent, but avoiding weather problems is possible.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=9528|title= Kiteboarding weather planning and monitoring|author= Rick Iossi|publisher= Florida KiteSurfing Association Forum}}</ref> Choice of inappropriate locations for kiteboarding where the wind passes over land creating wind shadow, rotor with pronounced gusts and lulls has also factored in many accidents.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://fksa.org/showthread.php?t=7879|title= Shadow Blasted ...

Jumping and being airborne at inappropriate places such as shallow water or near fixed or floating objects can be hazardous. [[Collision]]s with wind surfers, other kite boarders or water craft are hazards, particularly at busy locations.\n\nSolo kiteboarding has been a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends and keep an eye on one another. A kitesurfer can get farther from [[shore]] than an easy [[Human swimming|swim]], which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged. Marine hazards include [[sharks]], [[jellyfish]], [[sea otters]], [[dolphins]], and even [[crocodile]]s, depending on the location. [[Drowning]] has been a factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate flotation aid or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills.\n\n=== Safety equipment ===\n\nSome kite designs from late 2005 and onwards have included immediate and almost full depower integrated with the control bar and improved quick release mechanisms, both of which are making the sport much safer. However, lack of sufficient practice of emergency depowering the kite and going out in excessively strong or unstable weather can reduce the benefit of high depower kites.<br />Another important part of the safety equipment is the impact vest, which doubles as an improved floatation device. It reduces the severity of eventual impacts, but also improves the user endurance in the long procedures of self-rescue in deep waters, which almost every freeriding kiter experiences sooner or later. It is also important and overlooked as a complement to the harness, precluding it to climb along the chest during powerful kite loops, which otherwise would hurt the ribs.<br />The other important pieces of a reasonable safety kit are the safety hook knife to cut tangled lines, the helmet in a high visibility colour, a wet suit of reasonable thickness, depending on the water temperature, and possibly neoprene boots if the beach has much shellfish or hard rocks.\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\n[[Accidents]] can generate serious injuries or even be deadly. 105 accidents were reported in the Kiteboarding Safety Information Database between 2000 and September 2003, with 14 [[Death|fatalities]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://kitesurfingschool.org/safety.htm |title= Kitesurfing Safety |date= 7 May 2007 |publisher= KitesurfingSchool }}</ref> In South Africa between October 2003 and April 2004, 83% of [[search & rescue]] missions involving kitesurf were in offshore winds with the kite still attached to the harness, uncontrolled in strong winds or impossible to relaunch in weak winds. On 30 missions, there was no fatalities but five injuries : two had [[bone fracture]]s after being hit by their boards, two others were suffering from critical [[hypothermia]] and [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] and the fifth was exhausted and [[laceration|lacerated]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/39/5/e26.full |title= The kick with the kite: an analysis of kite surfing related off shore rescue missions in Cape Town, South Africa |date= 21 December 2004 |publisher= [[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in hybrid and [[bow kite]] designs leads to a better ability to control the power that they provide and effective safety release systems.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kiteboardingevolution.com/kite-advantages.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090828024415/http://www.kiteboardingevolution.com/kite-advantages.html |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2009-08-28 |publisher= KiteboardingEvolution |title= Kite Advantages and Disadvantages \u2013 How do Bow, C, and Hybrid Kites Compare to Each Other? }}</ref> In 2003, fatality ratings for the U.S. stated that 6 to 12 kiteboarders died for 100'000 participants.

Kiteboarding lends itself to a rather frequent practice, much like a gym program, arguably more frequent than other risky sports like scuba diving. Therefore, further data is required to properly evaluate the risk associated with kiteboarding.\n\n==== Reports of casualties ====\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/kitesurfer-70-killed-at-remote-beach-20120206-1r0oi.html |title= Kitesurfer, 70, killed at remote beach |date= 6 February 2012 |publisher= [[WA Today]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/kite-surfer-killedat-redcliffe-20120306-1ui3g.html#ixzz1uiyfm54z |title= Kite surfer killed at Redcliffe |date= 6 March 2012 |publisher= [[Brisbane Times]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2012/03/dante_torres_malibu_kite_surfer_dies_kelp.php |title= Dante Torres, Malibu Kite Surfer Dies in Tragic Kelp Accident |publisher= [[LA Weekly]] Blogs |date= 13 March 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Phuket-beach-toll-rises-kitesurfing-American-dies |title= Phuket beach toll rises as kitesurfing American dies |publisher= [[Phuket Gazette]] |date= 31 May 2012}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |title= Kiteboarder killed at Cheney Lake identified |date= 6 August 2012 |publisher= [[KWCH-TV]] |access-date= 14 November 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120810040308/http://articles.kwch.com/2012-08-06/kiteboarder_33039325 |archive-date= 10 August 2012 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}\n* {{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-33415791 |title= Sean Sands: Hunstanton kite surfing death 'accidental' |date= 6 July 2015 |publisher= [[BBC]]}}\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/south_essex_news/14294364.Southend_kitesurfer_killed_in_accident/ |title= Mark Paxton: Southend kitesurfer has died in a freak accident at Ray Creek, Point Clear, Clacton |date= 21 February 2016|publisher= [[Clacton Gazette]]}}\n\n===Kitesurfing safety rules===\nWhile some countries have specific regulations on flying kites that may also apply to kitesurfing,<ref>[http://www.kiteman.co.uk/Kite%20Safty.html \"Kite Safety\"] www.kiteman.co.uk</ref> most don't. However a kitesurfer should comply to the sailing rules regulating water crafts in many countries, like the U.S. Coast Guard regulations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=rightOfWay|title=Right Of Way|website=www.navcen.uscg.gov|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref> Developed from such generic rules a set of kitesurf specific rules or recommendations has been taking form since the beginning of the sport.\n\n{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}\nThe first such rule is '''the prudential rule''': with so many people just discovering water sports, a kiter shouldn't assume others adequate knowledge, training or even proper attitude, and be prepared to observe self-preserving distances and always let the others perceive clearly its intentions and its intended path.\n\n'''Waterstarters have priority''': the rider going out from the beach has always priority over the riders coming in.\n\n'''Kite High Rule''' - A kiter who is upwind (closest to the wind) must keep their kite high to avoid their lines crossing those of downwind kiters. Similarly, the downwind kiter must keep their kite low to avoid their lines crossing upwind kites. This applies regardless of whether kiters are on the same, or opposing courses.\n\n'''Clearance Rule''' - A kiter while jumping must have a clear safety zone of at least 50m downwind because they will move downwind during the jump. A rider must also have a clear safety zone of 30m upwind to jump as his lines could touch the kite or the lines of another rider kiteboarding close by (see Kite High rule). It's important to also consider potential hazards downwind and crosswind of the rider such as people, buildings, trees and other fixed obstacles. Because of the clearance rule a jumper never has the right of way.\n\nKiters are also considered as sailing vessels \u2013 so all the standard sailing rules apply such as:\n\n'''Starboard Rule''' When kiters approach from opposite directions the kiter who has the wind on the starboard (right side, right leg/arm leads in direction of travel) has right of way. The kiter who has the wind on the port side (left side, left leg/arm are leads in direction of travel) shall keep out of the way of the other. In simple terms, this means \"keep right\" with the kiter coming in the opposite direction passing on the left.\n\nIn sailing terms, a sailor or kiter with right of way is entitled to \"insist\" on exercising that right (warning opposing kiters) by shouting \"starboard\" clearly and in good time.\n\nMany of the sailing rules of right of way are different expressions that the most maneuverable craft should give way to the less maneuverable one. Therefore, kiters should give way to fishing vessels, but not to a jet ski. Other '''boating rules''' such as no-go zones, distance from shore and swimmers also apply.<ref>[http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm Are you kiting Safely?? Are you aware of the Rules??] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326020626/http://www.kbv.org.au/kbvmain/pop-safekite01.htm |date=26 March 2009 }}, kbv.org.au</ref> Also '''surfing rules''' do apply, so for instance, the rider to catch a wave closer to the crest has the right of way even if not on a starboard tack, freeriders included.\n\n== Terminology and jargon ==\n* '''Air time''': the amount of time spent in the air while jumping. This can be remarkably long; the record is [[Jesse Richman|Jesse Richman's]] 22 second long jump. Five to ten seconds is not unusual.\n* '''Apparent wind''': the kite's speed relative to the surrounding air. When kitesurfing in a straight line, the kite's apparent wind is a combination of the wind speed and the speed of the kite over the surface, but since the kite is highly steerable the apparent wind can vary widely depending on how the kite is being flown. Most ways of increasing power from the kite involve giving it a higher apparent wind somehow, i.e. diving the kite, riding faster, or riding at a greater angle into the wind. Any of these raises the kite's apparent wind speed.\n* '''Back stall''': A condition in which the kite ceases to move forward through the air and becomes difficult to control, often resulting in the kite flying backwards and crashing.  Back stall is often caused by lack of wind or by flying the kite with too great of an angle of attack. \n* '''Big air''': performing a high jump utilizing the lift of the kite. The jump is often assisted in its initial stage by the rider being catapulted off the lip of a wave.\n* '''Body dragging''': being pulled through the water without standing on a board. This is an early step in the learning process, and is essential before trying the board after flying a trainer kite.\n* '''Boost''': to suddenly become airborne\n* '''Brain fart''': to forget what trick you intended to perform mid air and end up crashing or landing on the water.\n* '''Charlie browner''': same as kiteboarder or kitesurfer.\n* '''Chicken loop''': a hard rubber loop attached to the middle line which has been fed through the control bar. It is used to attach the control bar to the harness so the kitesurfer can produce tension in the lines using their entire bodyweight instead of using purely arm strength.\n* '''Chicken bone/chicken finger/donkey dick / Donkey tail''': a hard rubber \"tongue\" attached to the chicken loop which the rider feeds through the spreader bar hook to prevent the rider from becoming \"unhooked\".\n* '''De-power''': to reduce the kite's power (pull), generally by adjusting the angle of attack of the kite. Most kites and control bars now allow a rider to rig a kite for a number of different power levels before launching, in addition to powering the kite up and down \"on the fly\" by moving the bar up and down. Depowerability makes a kite safer and easier to handle. Some new kite models, especially \"bow\" kites, can be de-powered to practically zero power, giving them an enormous wind range.\n* '''DP''': dawn patrol; an early morning session.\n* '''Downwind''': the direction the wind is blowing towards; to leeward. When a rider is facing '''downwind''' the wind is at their back.\n* '''Downwinder''': a kitesurfing \"trip\" (could actually be as short as a few minutes) where the rider starts at one point and ends up at another point downwind of their original position.\n* '''Edge''': tilting the board with its edge into the water. Used to control the direction of travel. Learning to edge properly is critical for learning to tack upwind. Edging is one of the fundamental skills of kitesurfing and is one of the ways kitesurfing is different from windsurfing or wakeboarding. While windsurf boards have daggerboards and/or skegs to steer the board upwind while lift and planing is provided by the board itself, generally kiteboards actually combine both functions and the bottom of the board lifts the rider and steers simultaneously. Kiteboard fins are generally much smaller and are for keeping the board in the water (see \"'''tea-bagging'''\"), but are not essential. Because kite boards have a small rocker, a deep edge can allow the board to act as a large low drag fin. Edging in wakeboarding is used for steering the board; whereas in kite boarding not only does edging steer the kite board, it is essential for kite control and controlling board speed. Riding downwind towards the kite subtracts massively from the kite's power and helps control board speed as well.\n* '''Facial''': total loss of flying kite control while on the beach, resulting in the harnessed rider being dragged face first downwind across rocks and sand.\n* '''Freeride''': kiteboarding style. Plain kiteboarding that does not involve tricks or jumping. The main goal is keeping a good edge and ability to traverse upwind. This would normally require a board with little rocker.\n* '''Freestyle''': kiteboarding style. Freestyle involves tricks (or combinations of tricks) where the rider is jumping off the water and experiencing enhanced elevation using lift generated from the kite. Freestyle is, weather-wise, a multi-condition concept and is to some degree equipment-specific. \"Big air\" is commonly associated with freestyle.\n* '''Goofy''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the right foot leading.\n* '''Guinea pig''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Wind-dummy'''.\n* '''Heel side''': the side of a board on the edge where a rider's heels are (opposite of toe side). \"Riding heel side\" is riding with heels down.\n* '''Hindenburg''': (a reference to the Hindenburg Airship disaster of 1937) a kite falling out of the air due to the loss of tension in the control lines, and therefore the loss of kite control. Hindenburging can be caused either by lack of wind or by the kite advancing to a position upwind of the kitesurfer in the wind window, also called \"overflying the kite\".\n* '''Handlepass''': while unhooked, passing the control bar behind a riders back while in the air.\n* '''Hot launch''': recovering and launching the kite from a position deep inside the wind window so the kite is immediately under maximum power (potentially dangerous). \n* '''Kiter''': the person driving the kite. \n* '''Kiteloop''': is a powered group of tricks where a rider loops the kite through the power zone.\n* '''Kitemare''': a kiteboardsurfing accident or dangerous mishap. Kitemares can be deadly.\n* '''Launch''': getting the kite in the air. The kite may be launched assisted or unassisted. An assisted launch is generally safer than an unassisted launch.\n* '''Lofted''': to get lifted vertically into the air by the kite due to a strong gust of wind. Being lofted has resulted in fatalities when kiters on or near land were dragged into obstacles. The danger can be avoided by minimizing time on land with the kite flying directly overhead, and by not kiting in overpowered situations.\n* '''Luff''' : when the air flow stalls around the kite. It may then stall and fall out of the sky. Like sails, a luffing kite has rippling and flapping panels. When launching the kite, if the kite is luffing, the rider should move farther upwind, or the person holding the kite should move downwind.\n* '''Mobe''': this term has two meanings: either a class of wakestyle tricks involving an invert with a 360-degree spin or a specific trick involving a back roll with a frontside 360 handlepass (while keeping the kite below 45 degrees).  The former meaning stems from the latter, which was the first type of mobe to ever be landed. Other types of mobes include: mobe 540, mobe 720, slim chance, KGB, crow mobe, moby dick, Pete Rose, blind pete, crow mobe 540, etc.\n* '''Nuking''': wind blowing at great speeds (30-40 knots). These extreme conditions are dangerous for most riders.\n* '''Offshore''': wind blowing at the water from the shore. Never ride in offshore winds without some means of recovery, i.e. a chase boat. This is somewhat less important in smaller bodies of water, of course.\n* '''Onshore''': wind blowing perpendicular to and directly at the shore from the water. A challenging condition for beginners, especially if waves are present.\n* '''Dookie dive''': loss of power during air time resulting in a crash into the water.\n* '''O-Shit loop''': two loops on either ends of the bar that are attached to the kite lines and run through rings attached to the bar. A standard leash attachment point.\n* '''Overhead waves''': waves {{convert|2|m|ft||abbr=on|sigfig=1}} or larger from trough to crest;\n* '''Overpowered''': the condition of having too much power from the kite. Can be a result of an increase in wind, incorrect kite choice (too large for the conditions), incorrect adjustment, simply going too fast, etc. Experienced riders who are overpowered can switch to a smaller board to compensate, to a degree, although it's common to have just one board.\n* '''Pop''': height gained above the water using only the board and tension in the lines to get lift, with the kite usually positioned at 45 degrees. Lower kite angles are possible for more experienced riders. Used as a basis for many tricks and regarded as an essential skill for progressing.\n* '''[[Port]]''' the left side of a vehicle, as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Power up''': when the kite's power increases (suddenly), because of wind gusts or the kite's movement.\n* '''Power zone''': is the area in the sky where the kite generates the most lift (pull), this is generally between 0 and 60 degrees arc from the center of the downwind direction.\n* '''Raley''': a trick where the rider unhooks and then pops in order to fully extend his body into a \"superman\" position, before landing. This is a power move that's often performed relatively low to the water and forms the basis of more advanced tricks.\n* '''Regular''': the [[footedness]] of the rider, with the left foot leading.\n* '''Re-launch''': a general term for getting the kite back up in the air after crashing it (on land or water). A relaunch is unassisted and requires the rider to follow a kite-specific procedure (check the manual). As years of development have gone by, the more recent kites are easier to relaunch.\n* '''Rider''': kiteboarder.\n* '''S-Bend''': when the rider unhooks and performs a raley followed by a front roll. \n* '''Self rescue''': a maneuver by which a rider with a downed kite manipulates the kite in the water to assist them in swimming back to shore.  The rider generally wraps up their lines until they reach their kite, then positions their kite so that it is on its back as it would be carried on land but with the wing-tip closer to shore catching the wind.  This wing tip acts as a sail and helps pull the rider to shore.  This is considered an important manoeuvre to learn.\n* '''Send it''': to move the kite aggressively up through the power zone.\n* '''Schlogging''': this is riding extremely underpowered. A rider has no power to plane and definitely not enough to jump. A rider and their board bounce from planing on the surface to being dragged in the water.\n* '''Shit hot''': the art of stylish smooth moves.\n* '''SLE''': Supported Leading Edge. A C shaped kite with an inflatable leading edge, currently the most advanced kite design available allowing massive de-power.\n* '''Side offshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle away from the shore.\n* '''Side onshore''': wind blowing between sideshore and at a 45-degree angle towards the shore.\n* '''side shore''': winds blowing parallel to the shore. Usually the most desirable direction for kitesurfing.\n* '''Spreader bar''': a stainless steel bar that attaches to the rider's harness. It has a hook that holds the \"chicken loop\" when riding hooked in.\n* '''[[Starboard]]''' the right side of a vehicle as perceived by a person on board facing the bow (front).\n* '''Stomp''': to successfully perform a trick.\n* '''Surfstyle:''' Wave riding using surfboards. Ideal conditions are cross shore to cross offshore with the wind blowing in the same direction that the wave is breaking. Boards can be ridden with or without foot straps.\n* '''Tack''': the direction which is being sailed, normally either starboard tack or port tack. In a starboard tack the wind is coming in from the rider's starboard (right-hand) side, similar to sailing a boat. In normal riding, the kitesurfer takes a heading which is as close to into the wind as possible, and in any event leads at some angle slightly upwind, sometimes as much as 45 degrees; jumping or wave riding usually results in traveling downwind, so the net result is to maintain relative position. Alternatively, see \"'''downwinder'''\".\n* '''Tea-bagging''': popping out of and falling back into the water intermittently due to light or gusty wind, poor flying skills, twisted lines etc.\n* '''Toe side''': the side of a board on the edge where a riders toes are (opposite of heel side). \"Riding toe side\" is riding with toes down.\n* '''Underpowered''': the condition of having insufficient power from the kite. Can be a result of insufficient wind, choosing a kite that is too small for the wind, rigging incorrectly, board too small, water current in the same direction as the wind, not riding fast enough, etc. A rider who is continuously diving the kite and sending it back up in a sine-wave pattern is usually underpowered.\n* '''Unhooked''' is when a kitesurfer is riding while the chicken loop is not attached to the rider's harness.\n* '''Upwind''': the direction from which the wind is blowing; windward; into the wind.\n* '''VaS conditions''': [[Victory at Sea]]; rough sea conditions characterized by overhead wind waves causing severe shore break.\n* '''Wakestyle''': A style of kiteboarding in which the rider usually uses wakeboarding (or kiteboarding) \"boots\" for their kiteboard (as opposed to straps and pads), ensuring their feet remain firmly attached at all times (hense the term \"Wakestyle\").  This style is also associated with performing powered tricks with the kite as low to the water as possible (something generally perceived by kiteboarders to be more difficult and stylish).\n* '''Walk of shame''' is the act of beach walking back upwind to the location where the kite was originally launched. It could mean that the kiter wasn't able to sail upwind.\n* '''Wind-dummy''' a person who goes out to test if the wind is rideable or not. If it is, others start riding too. Also known as a '''Guinea pig'''.\n* '''Zenith''' the location in the wind window directly over the kiter's head. This is the neutral position where kitesurfers can place the kite to stop moving or prior to movement. This places the kite in a more vulnerable to \"Hindenburgs\" position than any other.\n\n== Market data ==\n{{As of|2012|alt=In 2012}}, the number of kitesurfers was estimated by the [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] and [[International Kiteboarding Association|IKA]] at 1.5 million persons worldwide<ref name=\":3\" /> (pending review). The global market for kite gear sales is worth US$250 million.<ref name=\":4\" /> The markets related to kiteboarding keep developing at a very interesting pace, as seen in these statistics from 2012:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kiteforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=2387270|title=Kite sales statistics - 2014 - Kiteforum.com|website=www.kiteforum.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-16}}</ref>\n\n* 60,000 new kiters annually \n* 180,000 kites sold annually \n* 75,000 boards sold annually \n* 14 board builders \n* 19 kite builders\n\nEvolution of kite sales, worldwide:\n\n* 1999:  29,000\n* 2006: 114,465\n* 2008: 140,000\n* 2012: 180,000\n\nKeep in mind that a kiteboarding quiver for a single user could typically include 2-4 kites and 2-3 boards. With the innovation associated with foil boards and foil kites these numbers will increase. With the exception of foil kites, these equipment pieces are quite rugged and would last from 3 up to 10 years of active use, and be repaired and resold several times. This aftermarket further improves the market development, removing cost barriers for newbies which improves the popularity of the sport, and eventually could bring up new products and services based on a much larger market scale. In locations like Portugal in 2018, a newcomer to kiteboarding typically buys a proper hands-on tutorial and then buys a basic set of used equipment for an overall total below \u20ac1000.\n\nThe sport is utterly convenient regarding transportation and storage, since the kites are foldable and the boards are smaller than surf and paddling boards. Compared to other sailing sports, kiteboarding is among the less expensive and more convenient. Moreover, nearby most metropolitan areas, it can be practised almost all year long, since it just requires some wind and a reasonably flat surface, like an estuary, a lake, a sandy strip, or a snow flat.\n\nDespite the image of a youth radical sport, many newcomers are middle age, older than the typical wakeboard or snowboard practitioners. Such trends are quite conspicuous, not so much in the trendy summer holiday locations, but in the low season in metropolitan areas around the globe, where kiteboarding is becoming a regular practice for people of middle income, living in apartments not so close to the waterfront, for a short evasion and substituting for the gym.\n\n==Compared to windsurfing==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!   !!

Windsurfing\n|-\n| '''Record Speed''' || 55.65 (WR) knots || 55.50 knots (Avg. 53.27 Windsurf WR, Antoine Albeau 2/11/15) \n|-\n| '''Upwind Capabilities''' || About 70\u00b0 from wind direction on a twin-tip board, or 42\u00b0 on the more efficient [[Foilboard|Hydrofoil]] board.<ref>{{Citation|last=HydroFoil Pro Tour|title=Nico Parlier - Winners Circle Interview - 2016 Mauritius|date=22 August 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul1Q-eb_Egg&t=412|accessdate=20 January 2017}}</ref> The more a kite board tracks upwind, the more its leeward side must edge into the water to resist lateral drag. Upwind riders adopt a similar stance to kite fliers onshore, who slide their feet forward in the beach sand to brake the kite. The kite board's center line is way off the track line, dramatically reducing speed.|| About 45\u00b0 from wind direction depending on the skills of the rider. The sail board's center line runs virtually parallel to the track line, as most lateral forces are encountered by the tail fin and little edging is required. Because of this, upwind courses are fairly fast.  Fastest speeds are achieved at [[Points of sail|broad reach]].\n|-\n| '''Theory''' || The faster the kite moves the more force it develops. Standing still and actively steering the kite up and down (pumping) one can almost immediately create a lot of force. It is almost always possible to have the kite travel faster (much) than the board. The dynamic nature of the kiter/kite system is why kites have so much range (wind range). || The sail and board move at the same speed. With pumping one can sometimes push oneself onto a plane or maintain planing in marginal conditions. But sail and board travel at basically the same speed. This is the main reason why windsurfing requires a lot of equipment. The equipment must match the wind conditions much closer than kiting.\n|-\n| '''Physical Strain on Rider''' || The traction force of the kite is solely transferred to the rider via the harness loop attached to the harness hook when hooked in. When \"hooked in\" the rider uses muscle strength (thumb and index finger suffice) to steer the kite and control the kite power by pushing the bar in and out (depending on setup one might actually notice a slight effort). When \"unhooked\" the rider steers the kite using their arms with no depower, which can be strenuous. Generally, kitesurfing is more of a light cardio training. || Windsurfing without a harness requires a lot of physical effort, especially in strong wind. With a harness, recovering from a fall or when maneuvering (jibing, tacking, ...) the rider needs to detach the harness completely from the sail, which means that both traction and steering forces are to be countered solely by the rider's muscle. For jibing maneuvers, muscle effort diminishes as the rider becomes more skilled in maintaining board speed in the jibe. In race conditions it can get quite physical as well, planing \"over the top\" of wave sets keeping the board absolutely level and the sail well powered. In the strongest winds it can get physical as well due to the sheer force of the wind, but that is attributed to poor choice of equipment or lack of skill.\n|-\n| '''Fall Recovery''' || The kite is fairly easy to keep flying during a fall, with 'Hindenburgs' being rather exceptional. The rider can be pulled out of the water by the force of the moving kite. The kite power can be regulated by changing the [[angle of attack]] of the kite. In light winds the kite may fall into the water and stay there. || In light winds (non planing conditions), the rider needs to get on the board and pull the sail out of the water. However, in stronger winds (planing conditions (depending of equipment/weight/experience approx. from 9 knots on)), water starting is a better option.  This means positioning the board-sail combination through aligning the sail into the right wind angle, allowing the wind to pull the body out of the water onto the board using the sail, and then easily hooking back in and stepping into foot straps. This maneuver actually requires slightly less than planing conditions. \n|-\n| '''[[Glossary of nautical terms|Tacking and Jibing]]''' || Twin tip kiteboards (the majority of kiteboards) are designed to be bidirectional. If the rider wants to start the next tack only the kite's sailing direction must be reversed. The \"stern\" of the board now becomes the \"bow\", so the feet can be kept in the footstraps. Since the windward edge of the board doesn't change sides, the terms \"jibing\" or \"tacking\" are somewhat of a misnomer. Falling into the water is not a major problem, as even beginning riders can quickly and fairly effortlessly execute a water start using the kite to pull them out of the water. Nower days many kiters use directionals as well (all wave, racing as well as foils). These need to be jibed or tacked. This actually requires practice. Full planing race jibes are almost as difficult as in windsurfing. || The rider has the choice between tacking or jibing. In both cases the windward edge changes sides, so the rider will need to change footstraps. At high winds the only option to change tacks while maintaining speed is to carve jibe, which is a maneuver that requires many practise hours for it to be performed with a reasonably low risk of falling. . \n|-\n| '''Jumping''' || Kitesurfers can use their kite to \"jump\" (actually using it as a [[Paragliding|paraglider]]), without the need for a launch wave. Jumping is relatively easy but can be hazardous. Being launched (jumping) can also happen unintended, even to beginners, especially in shifting winds or fast kite movements, where the rider can get pulled into the air as the kite reverses direction. || The rider needs considerable forward speed and ideally a \"ramp wave\" to get airborne. When the wave is not large enough, the riders must initiate the jump by kicking down the tail of the board. Unintended jumps rarely occur (unless bouncing over waves, ...), as jumping requires active rider input. Jumping requires skill and can generally only be executed by advanced riders.\n|-\n| '''Aerobatics''' || Most aerobatics and tricks (tail grab, [[barrel roll]] etc.) can be executed without the airfoil's position in the air having to change. Therefore, executing \"aerobatics\" is only marginally different from executing them on shore suspended by the harness from some fixed point. Beginners with a lot of caution may start attempting some basic tricks after the first few weeks or even days. This part of kiting can actually be physical. || With most aerobatics the airfoil's position in the air changes dramatically. Each figure has its own ideal airfoil movement. With some aerobatics like the barrel roll, the rider needs to jump sufficiently high to allow the full length of the mast to rotate forward underneath. Often the risks to the rider of having fast moving and relatively heavy (board + mast + sail) gear so close by are substantial. As aerobatics are considerably more complicated than jumping, they are the done by the most experienced of riders, commanding huge respect within the sail boarding community.\n|-\n| '''Clearance''' || Clearance of at least 50 meters upwind (from any object) and 30 meters downwind (from another kitesurfer) is required. The risk of being blown into an airborne situation by a strong wind gust is real, effectively turning the kite boarder into an uncontrolled [[Paragliding|para-glider]] in risk of hitting any object downwind. || Since there are no kite lines, no upwind or downwind clearance is required from any object other than a kite surfer or fishing lines, which means that windsurfers do not need to worry about 'rotor' or strong wind gusts. Also, they can emergency stop almost immediately. Experienced riders will do this by 'crashing' while beginning riders (who typically do not wear a harness) can depower the sail instantly by releasing the back hand or letting the mast fall on water. The risk of hitting hard objects or other water-goers is therefore minimal.\n|-\n| '''Learning Curve''' || Kiteboarding has a different learning curve from windsurfing.  At the beginning the handling the kite can be largely taught on shore, as kite boarding evolved from beach [[Kite|kiting]]. However once on the water you need to be safely guided by an instructor until you learn the basics.  After you have the basics and are independent you will progress much faster than in windsurfing.\nRecovery from falling is relatively easy (the kites, especially the newest models, stay normally aloft to pull the rider out of the water, with little effort) as is changing tacks, even in strong wind. Staying upwind is regarded as an advanced technique. Light wind kiting (<9 knots) is also an advanced technique: traveling much faster than the wind any mistake can lead to loss of apparent wind -> kite falls into the drink and stays there. \n|| The learning curve for windsurfing is gradual, and rewarding as the rider progresses through each stage of learning, and one can engage in solo practice. Initially handling of the airfoil (sail) can be learned on the water or on land. Once on the water it takes much of practice to improve.\n\nRecovery from falling takes more effort than kiting. The rider needs to either up haul the sail standing on the board or water start, which both take some balance. Up hauling large sails can be a bit of work. Falling into the water is part of the overall experience.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Safety''' || In case of material failure or accidents, normal kitesurfing equipment offers limited rescue possibilities. Kitesurfers can perform a self rescue and use their kite to sail back to shore. The last option for the rider is to abandon the kite and kiteboard and swim to shore. || Any sail board will allow the rider to keep the body sufficiently out of the water to postpone or avoid [[hypothermia]]. Smaller boards may require that the mast be detached, to avoid sinking. Thus, as a rule, a rider should never abandon the board. Windsurfing equipment is inherently safe in high winds against tea bagging or collisions due to loss of control: In case of too strong wind, the rider can depower the sail instantly by letting go with the back hand or letting the sail drop on water. Doing so (or falling) means that the board stops almost immediately as the sail will act as a floating anchor in water.\n|-\n| '''Equipment Transport''' || A kite and kiteboard will fit in most vehicles. An average rider may need two to three kites and one board to ride in a wide range of wind strength. || The sail board and sail mast (even telescopic) do not fit in most vehicles, and need to be transported on a roof rack or trailer. If they do, they will often exclude passengers from the vehicle. Several different sails and boards (and often masts and booms) are necessary to cover the full range of rideable conditions.\n|}\n\n== World Champions ==\n[[File:Aaron Hadlow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Aaron Hadlow]] dominated Freestyle from 2004 to 2008]] \n[[File:Gisela Pulido Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|{{ill|Gisela Pulido|es|vertical-align=sup}} is ten times Freestyle Champion]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Freestyle PKRA/VKWC/WKL/GKA Sanctioned Tours\n!

Also referenced is the need for pedestrians to keep their swords in the right hand and pass on the left as in LHT, for self-defence. It has been suggested that wagon-drivers whipped their horses with their right hand, and thus sat on the left hand side of the wagon, as in RHT.

Such borders are mostly located in Africa and southern Asia. The [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] regulates the use of foreign registered vehicles in the 78 countries that have ratified it.\n\nLHT Thailand has three RHT neighbours: Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.

Please do not change this spelling to curb.** -->\nIn RHT jurisdictions, vehicles are configured with LHD, with the steering wheel on the left side. In LHT jurisdictions, the reverse is true. The driver's side, the side closest to the centre of the road, is sometimes called the ''offside'', while the passenger side, the side closest to the side of the road, is sometimes called the ''nearside''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/nearside |title=Nearside (dictionary definition) |publisher=Dictionary.reverso.net |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref><!-- This article uses UK English. -->\n\nMost windscreen wipers are designed to clear the driver's side better and have a longer blade on the driver's side<ref>{{cite web |last1=Unrau |first1=Jason |title=Why Is One Wiper Blade Longer Than the Other? |url=https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/why-is-one-wiper-blade-longer-than-the-other |website=Your Mechanic |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> and wipe up from the passenger side to the driver's side. Thus on LHD configurations, they wipe up from right to left, viewed from inside the vehicle, and do the opposite on RHD vehicles.\n\nHistorically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic. Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD.<ref name=\"On The Right Side of the Road\"/> In 1908 [[Henry Ford]] standardised the [[Model T]] as LHD in RHT America,<ref name=\"On The Right Side of the Road\"/> arguing that with RHD and RHT, the passenger was obliged to \"get out on the street side and walk around the car\" and that with steering from the left, the driver \"is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wayne|title=Car Crazy: The Battle for Supremacy between Ford and Olds and the Dawn of the Automobile Age|date=2015|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395526|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgIrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR4&dq=car+crazy+wayne+miller|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford's lead, due to the popularity of the Model T.<ref name=\"On The Right Side of the Road\"/>\n\nIn specialised cases, the driver will sit on the nearside, or kerbside.

However, in many cases, railways were built using LHT British technology and, while road traffic switched to RHT, rail remained LHT. Examples include: Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Egypt, France, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Laos, Monaco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Yemen. In Indonesia it is the reverse (RHT for rails (even for LRT systems) and LHT for roads). France is mainly LHT for trains, except for the classic lines in [[Alsace-Lorraine]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Strasbourg to Paris Driver's eye view PREVIEW |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOJZ9imhq8 |via=YouTube |publisher=Video 125 |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> which belonged to Germany from 1870 to 1918, when the railways were built, along with most metro systems. China is basically LHT for long-distance trains and RHT for metro systems. Spain, which is RHT for railways has LHT for metros in Madrid and Bilbao. Metros and light rail sides of operation vary, and might not match railways or roads in their country. Trams generally operate at the same side as other road traffic because they frequently share roads.\n\n==Boat traffic==\n[[File:Riverine Patrol Boat Cockpit Console.jpg|thumb|]]\n\nBoats are traditionally piloted from [[starboard]] to facilitate [[priority to the right]]. \nAccording to the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]] (the right-hand side), and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. For aircraft the US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water, and in aircraft with side-by-side cockpit seating, the pilot-in-command (or more senior flight officer) traditionally occupies the left seat.<ref>[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/2EA99FD06D59A9BC852566CF00614DEA FAR Sec. 91.115](c): \"When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to the right to keep well clear.\"</ref>\n\n==Worldwide distribution by country==\n[[Image:Driving standards historic.png|thumb|Countries with left- and right-hand traffic, currently and formerly.

Conversely, many RHT countries were part of the [[French colonial empire]].\n\nIn LHT traffic keeps left, and cars have the steering wheel on the right, putting the driver on the side closest to the centre of the road. [[Roundabout]]s circulate clockwise. In RHT everything is reversed: traffic keeps right, the driver sits on the left side of the car, and roundabouts circulate counterclockwise.\n\nIn most countries rail traffic follows the handedness of the roads, although many of the countries that switched road traffic from LHT to RHT did not switch their trains. Boat traffic on rivers is effectively RHT. Boats are traditionally piloted from the [[starboard]] side to facilitate [[priority to the right]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\nHistorically, many places kept left, while many others kept right, often within the same country. There are many myths which attempt to explain why one or the other is preferred.<ref name=\"mcmanus\"/> About 90 percent of people are right handed,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Searing |first1=Linda |title=The Big Number: Lefties make up about 10 percent of the world |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/the-big-number-lefties-make-up-about-10-percent-of-the-world/2019/08/09/69978100-b9e2-11e9-bad6-609f75bfd97f_story.html |website=Washington Post |accessdate=27 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and many explanations reference this. Horses are traditionally mounted from the left, and led from the left, with the reins in the right hand. So people walking horses might use RHT, to keep the animals separated. Also referenced is the need for pedestrians to keep their swords in the right hand and pass on the left as in LHT, for self-defence. It has been suggested that wagon-drivers whipped their horses with their right hand, and thus sat on the left hand side of the wagon, as in RHT. It has been written that in the year 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] directed pilgrims to keep left, however it has also been written that he directed them to keep to the right, and there is no documentary evidence to back either claim.<ref name=\"mcmanus\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Danish motorcyclists about to cross the border between Sweden and Norway in 1934.png|thumb|right|Border between Sweden and Norway in 1934]]\n[[File:Kungsgatan 1967.jpg|thumb|Traffic moves from left to right in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 3 September 1967]]\n\nThe first reference in [[English law]] to LHT was in 1756, with regard to [[London Bridge]].<ref name=\"hamer\">{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=Mike|date=25 December 1986 \u2013 1 January 1987|title=Left is right on the road|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qfak8nsMNGIC&pg=PA16#v=onepage|journal=New Scientist|issue=20 December 1986/1 January 1987|pages=16\u201318|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nA frequently-heard story is that Napoleon changed the custom from LHT to RHT in France and the countries he conquered after the [[French Revolution]].

However, in many cases, railways were built using LHT British technology and, while road traffic switched to RHT, rail remained LHT. Examples include: Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Egypt, France, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Laos, Monaco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Yemen. In Indonesia it is the reverse (RHT for rails (even for LRT systems) and LHT for roads). France is mainly LHT for trains, except for the classic lines in [[Alsace-Lorraine]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Strasbourg to Paris Driver's eye view PREVIEW |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOJZ9imhq8 |via=YouTube |publisher=Video 125 |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> which belonged to Germany from 1870 to 1918, when the railways were built, along with most metro systems. China is basically LHT for long-distance trains and RHT for metro systems. Spain, which is RHT for railways has LHT for metros in Madrid and Bilbao. Metros and light rail sides of operation vary, and might not match railways or roads in their country. Trams generally operate at the same side as other road traffic because they frequently share roads.\n\n==Boat traffic==\n[[File:Riverine Patrol Boat Cockpit Console.jpg|thumb|]]\n\nBoats are traditionally piloted from [[starboard]] to facilitate [[priority to the right]]. \nAccording to the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]] (the right-hand side), and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. For aircraft the US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water, and in aircraft with side-by-side cockpit seating, the pilot-in-command (or more senior flight officer) traditionally occupies the left seat.<ref>[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/2EA99FD06D59A9BC852566CF00614DEA FAR Sec. 91.115](c): \"When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to the right to keep well clear.\"</ref>\n\n==Worldwide distribution by country==\n[[Image:Driving standards historic.png|thumb|Countries with left- and right-hand traffic, currently and formerly.

The original production of the play premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1936, and played for 838 performances.\n\nThe play won the 1937 [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]], and was adapted for the screen as ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].\n\nThe play is popular among theater programs of high school institutions, and has been one of the 10 most-produced school plays every year since amateur rights came available in 1939. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/09/29/427138970/the-most-popular-high-school-plays-and-musicals|title=The Most Popular High School Plays And Musicals|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Act One ===\n\nThe story takes place entirely in the large house of a slightly batty [[New York City]] family. Various characters in the lives of the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan are introduced in the first act.\n\nThe [[patriarch]] of the family, Grandpa Vanderhof, is an eccentric old man who keeps snakes and has never paid his [[income tax]]. Penelope \"Penny\" Vanderhof Sycamore is his daughter (a writer of adventure- and sex-filled [[melodrama]] plays), and is married to Paul Sycamore, a tinkerer who manufactures fireworks in the basement with the help of his assistant, Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna, who used to be the family's iceman. One of Paul and Penny's two daughters is Essie Sycamore Carmichael, a childish candymaker who dreams of being a [[ballerina]] (but in reality is terrible at dancing). Essie is married to Ed Carmichael, a [[xylophone]] player who lives with them and helps distribute Essie's candies. Ed is an amateur [[Printer (publisher)|printer]] who prints any phrase that sounds catchy. Paul and Penny's other daughter Alice Sycamore is quite obviously the only \"normal\" family member. She has an office job and is sometimes embarrassed by the eccentricities of her family, yet deep down, she still loves them. In addition, the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan employs a maid, Rheba, who is dating Donald, a handyman who performs odd jobs for the Sycamores.\n\nEssie tells Grandpa Vanderhof that some letters have arrived for him from the \"United States Government\", but that she misplaced them. Shortly afterwards, Alice comes home and announces that she has fallen in love with a young man with whom she works, Tony Kirby, the son of the company's [[Senior management|executive]]. Before going upstairs to change, Alice tells her family that he will be coming over shortly to take her on a date. The entire family is still joyfully discussing her boyfriend when the doorbell rings. Penny answers the door and greets the man standing there, thinking he must be Tony, but only after forcing the stranger to shake hands with the entire family do they realize that he is not Alice's boyfriend: He is a tax investigator.\n\nHis name is Wilbur C. Henderson, and he is investigating Grandpa for his evasion of [[income tax]]. When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, and that the government wouldn't know what to do with the money if he did pay it. Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa's answers to his questions. Henderson spots Grandpa's snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he will hear \u2013 one way or another \u2013 from the United States government.\n\nThe real Tony Kirby arrives, and Alice is nervous that her eccentric family will scare him away, so she attempts to leave with him on their date. As they attempt to leave, Mr.&nbsp;Boris Kolenkhov, Essie's extremely eccentric [[Russia]]n ballet instructor, arrives and makes chitchat with the family, complaining about the [[Bolshevik Revolution|Revolution]]. During this discussion, Alice and Tony make their escape.  Then the rest of the family sit down for dinner.\n\n=== Act Two ===\nThe second act takes place a few days later. Alice has invited Tony and his father and mother over for dinner the next evening, and it is the only thing on the entire family's mind. Alice runs around the house telling her family to try to act as normal as possible. Penny has brought [[actress]] Gay Wellington over to read over Penny's latest play, but Gay becomes very drunk, and passes out onto the living room couch after looking at the snakes.\n\nEd returns from distributing Essie's candies, worried that he is being followed by someone. When Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna looks out the window, he sees no one other than a man walking away. Ed is still sent out by Essie to deliver more candies. Paul and Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna are downstairs the whole time making fireworks. Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna comes up from the basement carrying a painting that Penny had started of him as a discus thrower. Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna asks if Penny would finish it and she agrees. She leaves to put on her painting gear and Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna leaves to put on his costume.\n\nAt the same time, Mr.&nbsp;Kolenkhov arrives and begins Essie's ballet lesson. Ed provides accompanying music on the xylophone. Rheba runs in and out of the kitchen cleaning. Grandpa takes this time to practice darts and feed the snakes. In the midst of all this hullabaloo, Tony appears in the doorway with Mr.&nbsp;Kirby and Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby. Before them is the entire eccentric spectacle. Apparently, Tony has forgotten for which night dinner was planned, and Alice is incredibly embarrassed.\n\nPenny tells Alice not to worry, and that they can manage a nice dinner easily. She gives a list of things to Donald and tells him to run down to the store. Grandpa tries desperately to keep the party normal and under control for the sake of his granddaughter. Mr.&nbsp;Kirby reveals himself to be a very straitlaced fat-cat, who raises [[orchids]] as a hobby. Mr.&nbsp;Kirby investigates a child's model and finds it is Paul's \"hobby\". Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby tells them that her true passion is [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualism]], which Penny derides as a \"fake\". During a discussion of hobbies, Mr.&nbsp;Kolenkhov brings up that the Romans' hobby was [[wrestling]], and demonstrates on Mr.&nbsp;Kirby by throwing him on the floor.\n\nTo pass the time after this awkward incident, Penny suggests they play a [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] game. Alice imagines what is coming and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but Penny shrugs her off and instructs everyone to write down \"the first thing that pops into their heads\" after she says certain words.\n\nPenny offers the words \"potato\", \"bathroom\", \"lust\", \"[[honeymoon]]\", and \"sex\". Penny reads Mr.&nbsp;Kirby's list first, with reactions of, respectively: \"steak\", \"toothpaste\", \"unlawful\", \"trip\", and \"male\". Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. \"Starch\" is her response to potatoes, which is not that bad, but her response for \"bathroom\" is \"Mr.&nbsp;Kirby\", and she covers it up with the fact that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby spends a lot of time in there \"bathing and shaving\". Her response to \"lust\" is \"human\", claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr.&nbsp;Kirby disagrees, saying \"it is depraved\". \"Honeymoon\"'s reply is \"dull\", as Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby explains that there was \"nothing to do at night\". The shocker comes when Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby says her reply to \"sex\" was \"[[Wall Street]]\". She at first claims she doesn't know what she meant by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr.&nbsp;Kirby \"You're always talking about Wall Street, even when&nbsp;...\" and then stops.\n\nWholly embarrassed and humiliated, Mr.&nbsp;Kirby and Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby order Tony home with them immediately but Tony refuses to go. Alice finally decides that their marriage will never work and ends their engagement, and also decides to resign her job at Kirby's company. Before the Kirbys can leave, [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] agents come through the door. The head agent tells them that Ed's pamphlets from the candy boxes, on which he has printed anything that \"sounds nice\", read \"DYNAMITE THE CAPITOL\", \"DYNAMITE THE WHITE HOUSE\", \"DYNAMITE THE SUPREME COURT\", and \"GOD IS THE STATE, THE STATE IS GOD\". Grandpa tries to explain to the head agent, but he informs them they are all under arrest.\n\nThe agents discover enormous amounts of [[gunpowder]] in the basement and think it is for dynamiting [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and one agent returns from the basement dragging Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna with him, who was in the basement the whole time. De&nbsp;Pinna desperately tries to explain to the agent that he had left his lit pipe downstairs and must go and get it, but the agent disregards him. Meanwhile, another agent brings down Gay Wellington from upstairs, singing drunkenly. At that point, the fireworks in the basement go off, lit by De&nbsp;Pinna's untended pipe, and everyone (aside from Grandpa and Wellington) panics, leaving the whole house in an uproar as Act&nbsp;II ends.\n\n=== Act Three ===\nThe next day, Donald and Rheba sit in the kitchen reading the paper, which focuses on the story of both families being arrested, with Mr.&nbsp;Kirby's presence causing the story to make headlines. Also, Paul and Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna's fireworks have been completely destroyed. Meanwhile, Alice has decided to leave for a prolonged trip to the [[Adirondack Mountains]] to think things over. When the family forgets to call for a cab, she finally shows her exasperation, angered that her family can't be \"normal\" at all. Tony then arrives and tries to reason with Alice, but she refuses, heading upstairs with Tony following.\n\nSoon, Mr.&nbsp;Kolenkhov appears with the Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, in all of her former glory. After discussing the sad fate of former Russian royalty now working menial jobs in New York, the Grand Duchess soon insists upon going into the kitchen to cook the dinner for the family.\n\nMr. Kirby arrives to pick up Tony and to settle his score with Grandpa. Soon, Mr.&nbsp;Kirby and Tony get into a heated argument, the pinnacle of which finds Tony admitting that he had purposely brought his family on the wrong night, the night before. He explains that he wanted each family to see each other as they really were, and that he sees the Sycamores as \"normal\", that they are a family that loves and understands one another, saying that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby never had time to understand Tony. Grandpa tells Mr.&nbsp;Kirby that he's happy with no longer working and getting to enjoy life every day, and that has made him happy ever since, though Mr.&nbsp;Kirby is not convinced, especially as Grandpa suspects that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby doesn't like his job. Tony affirms this by pointing out that he found letters that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby had written to his father, expressing desires to be a trapeze artist and later a saxophone player, and that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby still has a saxophone in his closet. Grandpa tells Mr.&nbsp;Kirby that he should get to enjoy his life and riches now while he can, pointing out, \"you can't take it with you\". Tony agrees with this, deciding to leave the family business to do something he wants to do, and Mr.&nbsp;Kirby finally gives in, giving his blessings to Alice and Tony getting back together, which they do.\n\nEssie then brings a letter to Grandpa that's from the government. Grandpa had lied to the government that he was actually Martin Vanderhof Jr., and that the Martin Vanderhof the government was looking for was his father. This is corroborated because the family had buried the deceased milkman (who had lived with them prior to De&nbsp;Pinna) using Grandpa's name, since they never knew the milkman's real name. Grandpa's trick works, as the government tells him that they now owe him a refund, instead of him owing them taxes.\n\nThe play comes to a conclusion as the family, along with Tony and Mr.&nbsp;Kirby, sit down to dinner with the Grand Duchess. Grandpa says a touching prayer, and then they dive into the food.\n\n== Characters ==\n; Penelope Sycamore: Usually goes by Penny, Penelope is the mother of Essie and Alice, wife of Paul, and daughter of Martin.

Various characters in the lives of the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan are introduced in the first act.\n\nThe [[patriarch]] of the family, Grandpa Vanderhof, is an eccentric old man who keeps snakes and has never paid his [[income tax]]. Penelope \"Penny\" Vanderhof Sycamore is his daughter (a writer of adventure- and sex-filled [[melodrama]] plays), and is married to Paul Sycamore, a tinkerer who manufactures fireworks in the basement with the help of his assistant, Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna, who used to be the family's iceman. One of Paul and Penny's two daughters is Essie Sycamore Carmichael, a childish candymaker who dreams of being a [[ballerina]] (but in reality is terrible at dancing). Essie is married to Ed Carmichael, a [[xylophone]] player who lives with them and helps distribute Essie's candies. Ed is an amateur [[Printer (publisher)|printer]] who prints any phrase that sounds catchy. Paul and Penny's other daughter Alice Sycamore is quite obviously the only \"normal\" family member. She has an office job and is sometimes embarrassed by the eccentricities of her family, yet deep down, she still loves them. In addition, the Vanderhof-Sycamore-Carmichael clan employs a maid, Rheba, who is dating Donald, a handyman who performs odd jobs for the Sycamores.\n\nEssie tells Grandpa Vanderhof that some letters have arrived for him from the \"United States Government\", but that she misplaced them. Shortly afterwards, Alice comes home and announces that she has fallen in love with a young man with whom she works, Tony Kirby, the son of the company's [[Senior management|executive]]. Before going upstairs to change, Alice tells her family that he will be coming over shortly to take her on a date. The entire family is still joyfully discussing her boyfriend when the doorbell rings. Penny answers the door and greets the man standing there, thinking he must be Tony, but only after forcing the stranger to shake hands with the entire family do they realize that he is not Alice's boyfriend: He is a tax investigator.\n\nHis name is Wilbur C. Henderson, and he is investigating Grandpa for his evasion of [[income tax]]. When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, and that the government wouldn't know what to do with the money if he did pay it. Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa's answers to his questions. Henderson spots Grandpa's snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he will hear \u2013 one way or another \u2013 from the United States government.\n\nThe real Tony Kirby arrives, and Alice is nervous that her eccentric family will scare him away, so she attempts to leave with him on their date. As they attempt to leave, Mr.&nbsp;Boris Kolenkhov, Essie's extremely eccentric [[Russia]]n ballet instructor, arrives and makes chitchat with the family, complaining about the [[Bolshevik Revolution|Revolution]]. During this discussion, Alice and Tony make their escape.  Then the rest of the family sit down for dinner.\n\n=== Act Two ===\nThe second act takes place a few days later. Alice has invited Tony and his father and mother over for dinner the next evening, and it is the only thing on the entire family's mind. Alice runs around the house telling her family to try to act as normal as possible. Penny has brought [[actress]] Gay Wellington over to read over Penny's latest play, but Gay becomes very drunk, and passes out onto the living room couch after looking at the snakes.\n\nEd returns from distributing Essie's candies, worried that he is being followed by someone. When Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna looks out the window, he sees no one other than a man walking away. Ed is still sent out by Essie to deliver more candies. Paul and Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna are downstairs the whole time making fireworks. Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna comes up from the basement carrying a painting that Penny had started of him as a discus thrower. Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna asks if Penny would finish it and she agrees. She leaves to put on her painting gear and Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna leaves to put on his costume.\n\nAt the same time, Mr.&nbsp;Kolenkhov arrives and begins Essie's ballet lesson. Ed provides accompanying music on the xylophone. Rheba runs in and out of the kitchen cleaning. Grandpa takes this time to practice darts and feed the snakes. In the midst of all this hullabaloo, Tony appears in the doorway with Mr.&nbsp;Kirby and Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby. Before them is the entire eccentric spectacle. Apparently, Tony has forgotten for which night dinner was planned, and Alice is incredibly embarrassed.\n\nPenny tells Alice not to worry, and that they can manage a nice dinner easily. She gives a list of things to Donald and tells him to run down to the store. Grandpa tries desperately to keep the party normal and under control for the sake of his granddaughter. Mr.&nbsp;Kirby reveals himself to be a very straitlaced fat-cat, who raises [[orchids]] as a hobby. Mr.&nbsp;Kirby investigates a child's model and finds it is Paul's \"hobby\". Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby tells them that her true passion is [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualism]], which Penny derides as a \"fake\". During a discussion of hobbies, Mr.&nbsp;Kolenkhov brings up that the Romans' hobby was [[wrestling]], and demonstrates on Mr.&nbsp;Kirby by throwing him on the floor.\n\nTo pass the time after this awkward incident, Penny suggests they play a [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] game. Alice imagines what is coming and immediately tries to quash the suggestions, but Penny shrugs her off and instructs everyone to write down \"the first thing that pops into their heads\" after she says certain words.\n\nPenny offers the words \"potato\", \"bathroom\", \"lust\", \"[[honeymoon]]\", and \"sex\". Penny reads Mr.&nbsp;Kirby's list first, with reactions of, respectively: \"steak\", \"toothpaste\", \"unlawful\", \"trip\", and \"male\". Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby's list, however, causes much controversy. \"Starch\" is her response to potatoes, which is not that bad, but her response for \"bathroom\" is \"Mr.&nbsp;Kirby\", and she covers it up with the fact that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby spends a lot of time in there \"bathing and shaving\". Her response to \"lust\" is \"human\", claiming it is a perfectly human emotion. Mr.&nbsp;Kirby disagrees, saying \"it is depraved\". \"Honeymoon\"'s reply is \"dull\", as Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby explains that there was \"nothing to do at night\". The shocker comes when Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby says her reply to \"sex\" was \"[[Wall Street]]\". She at first claims she doesn't know what she meant by it, but once provoked she yells at Mr.&nbsp;Kirby \"You're always talking about Wall Street, even when&nbsp;...\" and then stops.\n\nWholly embarrassed and humiliated, Mr.&nbsp;Kirby and Mrs.&nbsp;Kirby order Tony home with them immediately but Tony refuses to go. Alice finally decides that their marriage will never work and ends their engagement, and also decides to resign her job at Kirby's company. Before the Kirbys can leave, [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] agents come through the door. The head agent tells them that Ed's pamphlets from the candy boxes, on which he has printed anything that \"sounds nice\", read \"DYNAMITE THE CAPITOL\", \"DYNAMITE THE WHITE HOUSE\", \"DYNAMITE THE SUPREME COURT\", and \"GOD IS THE STATE, THE STATE IS GOD\". Grandpa tries to explain to the head agent, but he informs them they are all under arrest.\n\nThe agents discover enormous amounts of [[gunpowder]] in the basement and think it is for dynamiting [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], and one agent returns from the basement dragging Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna with him, who was in the basement the whole time. De&nbsp;Pinna desperately tries to explain to the agent that he had left his lit pipe downstairs and must go and get it, but the agent disregards him. Meanwhile, another agent brings down Gay Wellington from upstairs, singing drunkenly. At that point, the fireworks in the basement go off, lit by De&nbsp;Pinna's untended pipe, and everyone (aside from Grandpa and Wellington) panics, leaving the whole house in an uproar as Act&nbsp;II ends.\n\n=== Act Three ===\nThe next day, Donald and Rheba sit in the kitchen reading the paper, which focuses on the story of both families being arrested, with Mr.&nbsp;Kirby's presence causing the story to make headlines. Also, Paul and Mr.&nbsp;De&nbsp;Pinna's fireworks have been completely destroyed. Meanwhile, Alice has decided to leave for a prolonged trip to the [[Adirondack Mountains]] to think things over. When the family forgets to call for a cab, she finally shows her exasperation, angered that her family can't be \"normal\" at all. Tony then arrives and tries to reason with Alice, but she refuses, heading upstairs with Tony following.\n\nSoon, Mr.&nbsp;Kolenkhov appears with the Grand Duchess Olga Katrina, in all of her former glory. After discussing the sad fate of former Russian royalty now working menial jobs in New York, the Grand Duchess soon insists upon going into the kitchen to cook the dinner for the family.\n\nMr. Kirby arrives to pick up Tony and to settle his score with Grandpa. Soon, Mr.&nbsp;Kirby and Tony get into a heated argument, the pinnacle of which finds Tony admitting that he had purposely brought his family on the wrong night, the night before. He explains that he wanted each family to see each other as they really were, and that he sees the Sycamores as \"normal\", that they are a family that loves and understands one another, saying that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby never had time to understand Tony. Grandpa tells Mr.&nbsp;Kirby that he's happy with no longer working and getting to enjoy life every day, and that has made him happy ever since, though Mr.&nbsp;Kirby is not convinced, especially as Grandpa suspects that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby doesn't like his job. Tony affirms this by pointing out that he found letters that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby had written to his father, expressing desires to be a trapeze artist and later a saxophone player, and that Mr.&nbsp;Kirby still has a saxophone in his closet. Grandpa tells Mr.&nbsp;Kirby that he should get to enjoy his life and riches now while he can, pointing out, \"you can't take it with you\". Tony agrees with this, deciding to leave the family business to do something he wants to do, and Mr.&nbsp;Kirby finally gives in, giving his blessings to Alice and Tony getting back together, which they do.\n\nEssie then brings a letter to Grandpa that's from the government. Grandpa had lied to the government that he was actually Martin Vanderhof Jr., and that the Martin Vanderhof the government was looking for was his father. This is corroborated because the family had buried the deceased milkman (who had lived with them prior to De&nbsp;Pinna) using Grandpa's name, since they never knew the milkman's real name. Grandpa's trick works, as the government tells him that they now owe him a refund, instead of him owing them taxes.\n\nThe play comes to a conclusion as the family, along with Tony and Mr.&nbsp;Kirby, sit down to dinner with the Grand Duchess. Grandpa says a touching prayer, and then they dive into the food.\n\n== Characters ==\n; Penelope Sycamore: Usually goes by Penny, Penelope is the mother of Essie and Alice, wife of Paul, and daughter of Martin.

After a visit by King Chulalongkorn and [[Saovabha Phongsri|Queen Saovabha Phongsri]], the medical school was renamed as the '''Royal Medical College''' ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22}}). The medical school was merged with [[Chulalongkorn University]] organized by [[Vajiravudh]]'s decree on 6 April 1917 as the Faculty of Medicine of [[Chulalongkorn University]] (now the [[Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University]]).\n[[File:Prince Mahidol Adulyadej.jpeg|thumb|Prince [[Mahidol Adulyadej]], the namesake of Mahidol University]]\nHowever, the government of General [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] then separated the Faculty of Medicine (Siriraj Medical School), Departments of Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science from Chulalongkorn University and re-organized them into the '''University of Medical Sciences''' ({{lang-th|\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e22\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c}}). The university was officially founded on February 2, 1943, and new schools and departments have been established since then. In 1959, the Medical Science Preparatory School (now [[Faculty of Science, Mahidol University|Faculty of Science]]) was moved to [[Phaya Thai District|Phaya Thai]] area, thus beginning the Phaya Thai campus. During the 1960s the university focused its development on the Phaya Thai campus. In 1965, another medical school was established \u2013 the [[Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital|Faculty of Medicine of Ramathibodi Hospital]] at Phaya Thai. The first medical school outside Bangkok was also set up as [[Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University|Faculty of Medicine Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital]] in [[Chiang Mai Province]], until 1964 when it was transferred to [[Chiang Mai University]]. Before being transferred In 1968, the university established pharmacy and dentistry schools at a new campus apart from those received from Chulalongkorn University. On February 21, 1969, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] declared the name of the university to be changed to '''Mahidol University''' ({{lang-th|\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e25}}) in honor of his father [[Mahidol Adulyadej|Prince Mahidol of Songkla]]. The university bought a large suburban area known as Salaya in 1971 for its future developments. In the following years, the former faculties of Dentistry and Pharmacy were returned to Chulalongkorn University.\n\nKing Bhumibol expressed his will that Mahidol University should also expand to the Social Science fields, so the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities was founded in 1969. The construction of Salaya campus began in 1975 but was soon delayed due the political situation and financial shortage. On July 23, 1983, the Salaya campus was officially opened. All education for freshman-year students was transferred to Salaya. Later academic developments of the university tended to deviate from traditional Health Science area to facilitate academic demands of the country and later developments were centered on the Salaya campus. The first internship college in Thailand was founded in Mahidol in 1986. In 1999, the Ratchasuda College devoted solely to disabled persons was established.

After a visit by King Chulalongkorn and [[Saovabha Phongsri|Queen Saovabha Phongsri]], the medical school was renamed as the '''Royal Medical College''' ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22}}). The medical school was merged with [[Chulalongkorn University]] organized by [[Vajiravudh]]'s decree on 6 April 1917 as the Faculty of Medicine of [[Chulalongkorn University]] (now the [[Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University]]).\n[[File:Prince Mahidol Adulyadej.jpeg|thumb|Prince [[Mahidol Adulyadej]], the namesake of Mahidol University]]\nHowever, the government of General [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] then separated the Faculty of Medicine (Siriraj Medical School), Departments of Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Veterinary Science from Chulalongkorn University and re-organized them into the '''University of Medical Sciences''' ({{lang-th|\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e17\u0e22\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c}}). The university was officially founded on February 2, 1943, and new schools and departments have been established since then. In 1959, the Medical Science Preparatory School (now [[Faculty of Science, Mahidol University|Faculty of Science]]) was moved to [[Phaya Thai District|Phaya Thai]] area, thus beginning the Phaya Thai campus. During the 1960s the university focused its development on the Phaya Thai campus. In 1965, another medical school was established \u2013 the [[Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital|Faculty of Medicine of Ramathibodi Hospital]] at Phaya Thai. The first medical school outside Bangkok was also set up as [[Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University|Faculty of Medicine Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital]] in [[Chiang Mai Province]], until 1964 when it was transferred to [[Chiang Mai University]]. Before being transferred In 1968, the university established pharmacy and dentistry schools at a new campus apart from those received from Chulalongkorn University. On February 21, 1969, King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] declared the name of the university to be changed to '''Mahidol University''' ({{lang-th|\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e25}}) in honor of his father [[Mahidol Adulyadej|Prince Mahidol of Songkla]]. The university bought a large suburban area known as Salaya in 1971 for its future developments. In the following years, the former faculties of Dentistry and Pharmacy were returned to Chulalongkorn University.\n\nKing Bhumibol expressed his will that Mahidol University should also expand to the Social Science fields, so the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities was founded in 1969. The construction of Salaya campus began in 1975 but was soon delayed due the political situation and financial shortage. On July 23, 1983, the Salaya campus was officially opened. All education for freshman-year students was transferred to Salaya. Later academic developments of the university tended to deviate from traditional Health Science area to facilitate academic demands of the country and later developments were centered on the Salaya campus. The first internship college in Thailand was founded in Mahidol in 1986. In 1999, the Ratchasuda College devoted solely to disabled persons was established.
