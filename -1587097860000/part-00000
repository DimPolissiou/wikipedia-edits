Courtship displays have been observed in weebills, where males ruffle cheek and head feathers with outstretched wings to the female. It is thought that male and female weebills display to each other at the nest-site with tail-fanning, slight bowing and wing quivering.<ref name=HANZAB/>\n\nThe female usually lays two to four brown-speckled cream-colored [[Bird egg|eggs]]<ref name=HANZAB/> which are tapered-oval in shape. Only the female [[Egg incubation|incubates]] the eggs which hatch after 10\u201312 days, but both parents care for the chicks.<ref name=Backyard>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Smicrornis-brevirostris|title=Weebill {{!}} BIRDS in BACKYARDS|website=www.birdsinbackyards.net|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWeebill eggs in the nest are occasionally vulnerable to small [[brood parasite]]s such as the [[Horsfield's bronze cuckoo]], where the female cuckoo removes the weebill eggs and lays one or two eggs in the host nest for the weebill to raise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/horsfields-bronze-cuckoo|title=Horsfield's Bronze-Cuckoo {{!}} BirdLife Australia|last=http://www.carterdigital.com.au|first=Carter Digital-|website=www.birdlife.org.au|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\n== Threats and conservation ==\nWidespread and common in its habitat throughout its [[range (biology)|range]] on mainland Australia, the weebill is evaluated as Least Concern on the [[IUCN Red List]] of Threatened Species.<ref>[[BirdLife International]] ''(2012).'' \"''Smicrornis brevirostris''\"''.
