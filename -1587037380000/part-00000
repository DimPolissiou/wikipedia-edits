The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure.

They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432). Because stainless steel is a poor conductor of heat, it is often used as a thin surface cladding over a core of copper or aluminium, which conduct heat more readily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nCutlery is normally stainless steel,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QzJDRxLLxNIC&pg=PA240&dq=Cutlery+is+normally+stainless+steel#v=onepage&q=Cutlery%20is%20normally%20stainless%20steel&f=false|title=Stainless Steels for Design Engineers|last=McGuire|first=Michael F.|date=2008|publisher=ASM International|isbn=9781615030590|language=en}}</ref> for low corrosion, ease of cleaning, negligible toxicity, as well as not flavoring the food by<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catra.org/pages/products/sharpening/careof.htm|title=care of cutlery|website=www.catra.org|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> [[Standard electrode potential|electrolytic activity]].\n\n===Jewelry===\n\nStainless steel is used for jewelry and watches, with 316L being the type commonly used for such applications.

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The interest rate comes in as a way of  bringing expenses  made in different years to their present value (a method widely used by banks and insurance companies) so they can be added and compared fairly\n\n'''Application of LCC in materials selection'''\n\nStainless steel used in projects often results in lower LCC values compared to other materials, because the higher acquisition cost (AC) of stainless steel components are often offset by improvements in operating and maintenance costs, through reduced loss of production (LP) costs, and by the improved resale value of stainless steel components.{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n\nThe LCC calculations are usually limited to the project itself. However, there may be other costs that a community wants to consider as well:{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n* utilities, such as power plants, water supply & wastewater treatment, hospitals, \u2026 cannot be shut down.

As this is an average, countries that have low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in their electricity production (such as France with nuclear energy) will have lower figures.  Ferritics without Ni will have a lower CO<sub>2</sub> footprint than austenitics with 8% Ni or more.\n\nCarbon footprint must not be the only factor for deciding the choice of materials:\n* over any product life,  maintenance, repairs (when possible) or early end of life (planned obsolescence) can increase the overall footprint way beyond the difference between materials only.  In addition loss of service (typically for bridges) may induce large hidden costs (queues, wasted fuel, loss of man-hours;)\n* how much material is used to provide a given service varies with the performance, particularly the strength level, which allows lighter structures and components.\n\nStainless steel is 100% [[recyclable]].<ref>{{citation |author= Johnson, J., Reck, B.K., Wang, T., Graede, T.E. |title=The energy benefit of stainless steel recycling |year=2008 |journal=Energy Policy\n|volume=36 |pages=181\u2013192 |doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2007.08.028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingStainlessSteel.aspx|title=Recycling Stainless Steel|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/Sustainability/LifeCycleManagement/RecyclingofNickel/HowNickelIsRecycled/RecyclingofNickelcontainingalloys.aspx|title=Recycling of Nickel-containing Alloys|website=Nickel Instiitute}}</ref> An average stainless steel object is composed of about 60% recycled material of which approximately 40% originates from end-of-life products and about 60% comes from manufacturing processes.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127075255/http://www.worldstainless.org/ISSF/Files/Recycling08/Flash.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 27 January 2011\n |title      = The Recycling of Stainless Steel (\"Recycled Content\" and \"Input Composition\" slides)\n |accessdate = 19 November 2006\n |year       = 2006\n |format     = Flash\n |publisher  = International Stainless Steel Forum\n}}</ref> What prevents a higher recycling content is the availability of stainless steel scrap, in spite of a very high recycling rate. According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

The addition of 2% molybdenum provides greater resistance to acids and to localized corrosion caused by chloride ions. Low-carbon versions, for example, 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. The \"L\" means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%.\n\n===Ferritic stainless steels===\n{{main|Ferritic stainless steel}}\nFerritic stainless steels possess a ferrite microstructure like carbon steel, which is a [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure, and contain between 10.5% and 27% chromium with very little or no nickel. This microstructure is present at all temperatures, due to the chromium addition, and like austenitic stainless steels, these are not hardenable by heat treatment. They cannot be strengthened by cold work to the same degree as austenitic stainless steel. They are magnetic like carbon steel.\n\nAdditions of niobium (Nb), titanium (Ti), and zirconium (Zr) to grade 430 allow good weldability (see welding section below).\n\nAs they do not contain nickel, they cost less than austenitic grades and are now present in a wide range of industries.\n\nCommon grades are  409 and 409 Cb (Cb columbium is the US name for niobium) with about 10.5% chromium, the latter being used  mostly for automobile exhaust pipes in North America, while stabilized grades 439 and 441 are used in Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Santacreu|first=P-O|title=K4X: A new ferritic stainless steel grade with improved durability for high temperature exhaust manifolds|last2=Faivre|first2=L.|last3=Acher|first3=A.|last4=Leseux|first4=J.|publisher=Proceedings of 7th European Stainless Steel Science & Market (Como, Italy) Paper 25|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFerritics such as 430 (17% Cr) are used for architectural applications and structural applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cashell|first=K.

The austenite is a face centered cubic phase.\n# [[Quenching]]. The austenite is transformed into martensite, a hard [[body-centered tetragonal]] crystal structure. The as-quenched martensite is very hard and too brittle for most applications. Some residual austenite may remain.\n# Tempering,  i.e. heating to around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C, holding at temperature, then air cooling.  Increasing the tempering temperature decreases the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate tensile strength]] but increases the elongation and the impact resistance.\n\n====Nitrogen-alloyed martensitic stainless steels====\nReplacing some of the carbon in martensitic stainless steels by nitrogen is a fairly recent development. The limited solubility of nitrogen has been increased by the [[Electro-slag remelting|pressure electroslag refining]] (PESR) process in which melting is carried out under a high nitrogen pressure. Up to 0.4% nitrogen contents have been achieved leading to higher hardness/strength and higher corrosion resistance.  As the PESR is expensive, lower but significant nitrogen contents have been achieved using the standard [[argon oxygen decarburization]] (AOD) process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Leda H.|date=1995|title=Nitrogen in Martensitic stainless steels|url=|journal=Journal of Materials Processing Technology|volume=55|issue=1\u20132|pages=263\u2013272|doi=10.1016/0924-0136(95)01984-M}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamano S., Shimizu T., Noda Toshiharu|date=2007|editor-last=|title=Properties of Low Carbon High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=Materials Science Forum|volume=539\u2013543|pages=4975\u20134980|doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.539-543.4975|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/57f9373fef3b9e4a37121f8b4c8c93617ed0745b}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horowitz M.B., Benedetto Neto, Garbogini A., Tschiptschin A.P.|date=1996|title=Nitrogen-Bearing Martensitic Stainless Steels|journal=ISIJ International|volume=36|issue=7|pages=840\u2013845|doi=10.2355/isijinternational.36.840}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasokha N., Berns H.|date=2011|title=Study on nitrogen in martensitic stainless steels|journal=Journal of Heat Treatments and Materials|volume=66|issue=3|pages=150\u2013164|doi=10.3139/105.110099}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorodin D., Manes L., Monicault J-M|date=2002|title=Characterization of the XD15N High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel for Aerospace Bearing|url=|journal=4th International Conference on Launcher Technology \"Space Launcher Liquid Propulsion, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium|volume=|pages=|via=Centre National Etudes Spatiales}}</ref>\n\nThey are magnetic. They are not as corrosion resistant as the common ferritic and austenitic stainless steels due to their low chromium content.\n\n===Duplex stainless steel===\n{{main|Duplex stainless steel}}\nDuplex stainless steels have a mixed microstructure of austenite and ferrite, the aim usually being to produce a 50:50 mix, although in commercial alloys the ratio maybe 40:60. They are characterized by high chromium (19\u201332%) and molybdenum (up to 5%) and lower nickel contents than austenitic stainless steels. Duplex stainless steels have roughly twice the [[yield strength]] of austenitic stainless steel. Their mixed microstructure provides improved resistance to chloride stress corrosion cracking in comparison to austenitic stainless steel Types 304 and 316.\n\nDuplex grades are usually divided into three sub-groups based on their corrosion resistance:  lean duplex, standard duplex, and super duplex.\n\nThe properties of duplex stainless steels are achieved with an overall lower alloy content than similar-performing super-austenitic grades, making their use cost-effective for many applications. The pulp and paper industry was one of the first ones to use extensively duplex stainless steel. Today, the oil and gas industry is the largest user and has pushed for more corrosion resistant grades, leading to the development of super duplex and even so-called hyper duplex grades. More recently, the less expensive (and slightly less corrosion-resistant) lean duplex has been developed, chiefly for structural applications in building and construction (concrete reinforcing bars, plates for bridges, coastal works)  and for the water industry.\n\n===Precipitation hardening stainless steels===\n\n[[Precipitation hardening stainless steel]]s have corrosion resistance comparable to austenitic varieties, but can be [[Precipitation hardening|precipitation hardened]] to even higher strengths than the other martensitic grades.\n\nThere are based on three types:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Cooman|first=Bruno Charles|date=April 2016|others=Pohang University of Science and Technology Korea Graduate Institute of Ferrous Technology|title=Lecture on stainless steel_9|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301692427|journal=|volume=|pages=|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.1950.2488|via=}}</ref>\n\n- Martensitic [[17-4 stainless steel|17-4 PH]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.aksteel.com/our-products/stainless/precipitation-hardening-stainless-steels|title=AK Steel datasheets|website=www.aksteel.com}}</ref> (AISI 630  EN 1.4542) contains about 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 4% Cu, and 0.3% Nb.\n\nSolution treatment at about 1040&nbsp;\u00b0C followed by quenching results in a relatively ductile martensitic structure. Subsequent aging treatment at 475&nbsp;\u00b0C precipitates Nb and Cu-rich phases that increase the strength up to above 1000 MPa yield strength. This outstanding strength level finds uses in high tech applications such as aerospace (usually after remelting to eliminate non-metallic inclusions and thereby to increase fatigue life). Another major advantage of this steel is that aging, unlike tempering treatments, is carried out at a temperature that can be applied to (nearly) finished parts without distortion and discoloration.\n\n- Semi-austenitic 17-7PH<ref name=\":3\" /> (AISI 631 EN 1.4568) contains about 17% Cr, 7.2% Ni, and 1.2% Al.\n\nTypical heat treatment involves first solution treatment and quenching.

Martensitic transformation is then obtained either by a cryogenic treatment at \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0C or by severe cold work (over 70% deformation, usually by cold rolling or wire drawing). Aging at 510&nbsp;\u00b0C \u2013 which precipitates the Ni<sub>3</sub>Al intermetallic phase \u2013 is carried out as above on nearly finished parts.

Unprotected carbon steel [[rust]]s readily when exposed to the combination of air and moisture. The resulting [[iron oxide]] surface layer (the rust) is porous and fragile. Since iron oxide occupies a larger volume than the original steel this layer expands and tends to flake and fall away, exposing the underlying steel to further attack. In comparison, stainless steels contain sufficient chromium to undergo [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]], spontaneously forming a microscopically thin inert surface film of chromium oxide by reaction with the oxygen in the air and even the small amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. This passive film prevents further corrosion by blocking oxygen diffusion to the steel surface and thus prevents corrosion from spreading into the bulk of the metal.[[Stainless steel#cite note-3|<sup>[3]</sup>]] This film is self-repairing if it is scratched or temporarily disturbed by an upset condition in the environment that exceeds the inherent corrosion resistance of that grade.<ref>acom 2-2006 Passive Films on Stainless Steel \u2013 Recent Nano-Range Research, Claes-Olsson, Outokumpu, Avesta Research Center.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web |url=http://worldstainless.org/training/Architecture%20and%20Civil%20Engineering |title=Chapter 5 corrosion resistance of stainless steels |website=www.worldstainless.org}}</ref>\n\nThe resistance of this film to corrosion depends upon the chemical composition of the stainless steel, chiefly the chromium content.\n\nCorrosion of stainless steels can occur when the grade is not suited for the working environment.\n\nIt is customary to distinguish between four forms of corrosion: uniform, localized (pitting), galvanic and SCC (stress corrosion cracking).\n\n=== Uniform corrosion ===\nUniform corrosion takes place in very aggressive environments, typically chemical production or use, pulp, and paper industries, etc. The whole surface of the steel is attacked, and the corrosion is expressed as corrosion rate in mm/year (usually less than 0.1&nbsp;mm/year is acceptable for such cases). Corrosion tables provide guidelines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.materials.sandvik/fr/materials-center/corrosion-tables/ |title=Corrosion Tables |last=Sandvik}}</ref>\n\nThis is typically the case when stainless steels are exposed to acidic or basic solutions. Whether stainless steel corrodes depends on the kind and concentration of [[acid]] or [[Base (chemistry)|base]] and on the solution temperature. Uniform corrosion is typically easy to avoid because of extensive published corrosion data or easily performed laboratory corrosion testing.\n\nHowever, stainless steels are susceptible to localized corrosion under certain conditions, which need to be recognized and avoided. Such localized corrosion is problematic for stainless steels because it is unexpected and difficult to predict.\n[[File:Crevice corrosion of 316 SS tube and tube sheet in a desalination plant.png|thumb|Stainless steel is not completely immune to corrosion as shown in this [[desalination]] equipment.]]\n\n====Acids====\nAcidic solutions can be put into two general categories: reducing acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid]] and dilute [[sulfuric acid]], and [[oxidizing acid]]s, such as [[nitric acid]] and concentrated sulfuric acid. Increasing chromium and molybdenum content provides increased resistance to reducing acids while increasing chromium and silicon content provides increased resistance to oxidizing acids.\n\nSulfuric acid is one of the largest-tonnage industrial chemicals manufactured. At room temperature, [[SAE 304 stainless steel|Type 304]] stainless steel is only resistant to 3% acid, while [[SAE 316L stainless steel|Type 316]] SS is resistant to 3% acid up to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and 20% acid at room temperature. Thus Type 304 SS is rarely used in contact with sulfuric acid.

As the molecular weight of organic acids increases, their corrosivity decreases. [[Formic acid]] has the lowest molecular weight and is a weak acid. Type 304 SS can be used with formic acid, though it tends to discolor the solution. [[Acetic acid]] is probably the most commercially important of the organic acids, and Type 316 SS is commonly used for storing and handling acetic acid.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/SelectionandUseofStainlessSteelandNickel_BearingAlloysinOrganicAcids_10063_.ashx |title=Selection and Use of Stainless Steel and Nickel-Bearing Alloys in Organic Acids |last=C.

Type 316L is required for processing of [[urea]].<ref name=Davis1994/>{{page needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Localized corrosion===\n\nLocalized corrosion can occur in a number of ways, e.g. [[pitting corrosion]] and [[crevice corrosion]]. Such a localized attack is most common in the presence of [[Chloride|chloride ions]]. Increasing chloride levels require more highly alloyed stainless steels.\n\nLocalized corrosion can be difficult to predict because it is dependent on many factors, including:\n* Chloride ion concentration (however, even when the chloride solution concentration is known, it is still possible for chloride ions to concentrate, such as in crevices (e.g. under gaskets) or on surfaces in vapor spaces due to evaporation and condensation).\n* Increasing temperature increases susceptibility.\n* Increasing acidity increases susceptibility.\n* Stagnant conditions increase susceptibility.\n* The presence of oxidizing species, such as ferric and cupric ions.\n\n==== Pitting corrosion resistance ====\nThis is probably the most frequent form of corrosion. The corrosion resistance of stainless steels to pitting corrosion is often expressed by the PREN (pitting resistance equivalent number) obtained through the formula\n\n: PREN = %Cr + 3.3 %Mo + 16 %N,\n\nwhere the terms correspond to the contents proportion by mass of chromium, molybdenum, and nitrogen respectively in the steel.\n\nThe higher the PREN, the higher the pitting corrosion resistance.  Increasing chromium, molybdenum and nitrogen contents provide increasing resistance to pitting corrosion.\n\n==== Crevice corrosion ====\nWhile the PREN is a property of the stainless steel, crevice corrosion occurs when poor design has created confined areas (overlapping plates, washer-plate interfaces, etc.) and when the PREN is not high enough for the service conditions. Design and good fabrication techniques combined with correct alloy selection can prevent such corrosion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/Water/AlloySelection.aspx |title=Material Selection and Use in Water |last= |first= |date= |website=Nickel Institute |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress corrosion cracking ===\n[[Stress corrosion cracking]] (SCC) is a sudden cracking and failure of a component without deformation.\n\nIt may occur when three conditions are met:\n* The part is stressed (by an applied load or by residual stress).\n* The environment is aggressive (high chloride level, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, presence of H<sub>2</sub>S).\n* The stainless steel is not sufficiently SCC-resistant.\n\nThe SCC mechanism results from the following sequence of events:\n# Pitting occurs.\n# Cracks start from a pit initiation site.\n# Cracks then propagate through the metal in a transgranular or intergranular mode.\n# Failure occurs.\n\nWhereas pitting leads in most cases to unsightly surfaces and in the worst case to perforation of the stainless sheet, failure by SCC can lead to very damaging consequences. It is therefore considered as a special form of corrosion.\n\nAs SCC requires several conditions to be met, it is relatively easy to avoid it:\n* Reduce the stress level (the oil and gas specifications provide requirements for maximal stress level in H<sub>2</sub>S-containing environments).\n* Assess the aggressiveness of the environment (high chloride content, temperature above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C, etc.).\n* Select the right type of stainless steel: superaustenitics such as grade 904L or super-duplex ([[ferritic stainless steel]]s and [[duplex stainless steel]]s are very resistant to SCC).\n\n===Galvanic corrosion===\n\n[[File:P4150144 cable tyrolienne inox.jpg|thumb|Left [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] is not stainless and is [[rust]]y]]\n\nGalvanic corrosion<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstainless.org/Files/issf/non-image-files/PDF/Euro_Inox/Contact_with_Other_EN.pdf |title=Stainless steels in contact with other materials |last=A Euro Inox publication |date=2009}}</ref> (also called \"dissimilar-metal corrosion\") refers to corrosion damage induced when two dissimilar materials are coupled in a corrosive electrolyte. The most common electrolyte is water, ranging from freshwater to seawater. When a galvanic couple forms, one of the metals in the couple becomes the anode and corrodes faster than it would all by itself, while the other becomes the cathode and corrodes slower than it would alone. Stainless steel, due to its superior corrosion resistance relative to most other metals, including steel and aluminium, becomes the cathode, accelerating the corrosion of the anodic metal. An example is the corrosion of aluminium rivets fastening stainless steel sheets in contact with water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelinWatersGalvanicCorrosionandit%20PreventionAEBauer.ashx |title=Stainless Steels in Waters; Galvanic Corrosion and its Prevention |last=Bauer |first=Alfred E. |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref> \n\nThe relative surface areas of the anode and the cathode are important. In the above example, the surface of the rivets will be small compared to that of the stainless-steel sheet. However, if stainless-steel fasteners are used to assemble aluminium sheets, galvanic corrosion will be much slower because the galvanic current density on the aluminium surface will be order of magnitude smaller.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nA similar, but frequent mistake, is to assemble stainless-steel parts with carbon-steel fasteners; whereas using stainless steel to fasten carbon-steel plates is usually acceptable. Providing electrical insulation between the dissimilar metals, where possible, is effective at preventing this type of corrosion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===High-temperature corrosion (scaling)===\n\nAt elevated temperatures all metals react with hot gases. The most common high-temperature gaseous mixture is air, and oxygen is the most reactive component of air. Carbon steel is limited to approximately {{convert|900|F|C|sigfig=2}} in air. Chromium in stainless steel reacts with oxygen to form a chromium oxide scale, which reduces oxygen diffusion into the material. The minimum 10.5% chromium in stainless steels provides resistance to approximately {{convert|1300|F|C|sigfig=2}}, while 16% chromium provides resistance up to approximately {{convert|2200|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Type 304, the most common grade of stainless steel with 18% chromium, is resistant to approximately {{convert|1600|F|C|sigfig=2}}. Other gases such as [[sulfur dioxide]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[chlorine]], and others also attack stainless steel. Resistance to other gases is dependent on the type of gas, the temperature and the alloying content of the stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/High_TemperatureCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9004_.ashx |title=High Temperature Characteristics of Stainless Steel |last=American Iron and Steel Institute |date=April 1979 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/PracticalGuidetoHigh_TemperatureAlloys_10056_.ashx |title=Practical Guide to High Temperature Alloys |last=Elliott |first=Peter |date=August 1990 |website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nOxidation resistance increases with chromium, as well as silicon and aluminum, content.

It only absorbs a small amount of carbon because of its cubic crystalline structure, which consists of one iron in each corner and a central iron atom; the central atom is what gives it magnetic properties. \n\nGrades with low coercitive field Hc have been developed for electrovalves used in household appliances  and for injection systems in internal combustion engines\n\nAnnealed [[austenitic stainless steel|austenitic]] stainless steels are usually [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Values for some common materials|non-magnetic]].   \n\nSome applications require non-magnetic materials, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]]. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Magnetic permeability of some austenitic  stainless steel grades after annealing 2 hours at 1050{{nbsp}}\u00b0C<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fofanov|first=D.|url=|title=Magnetic properties of Stainless Steels: applications, opportunities and new developments|date=29 Nov 2011|work=Stainless steel World Conference|access-date=|last2=Riedner|first2=S.}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Sometimes if austenitic steel is bent or cut, it creates magnetism along the edge of the stainless steel because the crystal structure rearranges itself.\n\n===Galling===\n[[Galling]], sometimes called cold welding, is a form of severe adhesive wear, which can occur when two metal surfaces are in relative motion to each other and under heavy pressure. Austenitic stainless steel fasteners are particularly susceptible to thread galling, although it also occurs in other alloys that self-generate a protective oxide surface film, such as aluminum and titanium. Under high contact-force sliding, this oxide can be deformed, broken and removed from parts of the component, exposing the bare reactive metal. When the two surfaces are of the same material, these exposed surfaces can easily fuse together. Separation of the two surfaces can result in surface tearing and even complete seizure of metal components or fasteners.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/ReviewofWearandGallingCharacteristicsofStainlessSteel_9006_.ashx |title=Review of the Wear and Galling Characteristics of Stainless Steels |last=Committee of Stainless Steel Producers.

Additionally, threaded joints may be [[Lubrication|lubricated]] to provide a film between the two parts and prevent galling. Also, [[Nitronic]] 60, made by selective alloying with manganese, silicon, and nitrogen, has demonstrated a reduced tendency to gall.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Standard finishes==\n{{Main|Brushed metal}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

The molten metal is then poured into a ladle and transferred into the AOD\n* Argon oxygen secarburization (AOD) allows the removal of carbon in the molten steel and other composition adjustments to achieve the desired chemical composition of the steel\n* Continuous casting (CC) in which the molten metal is solidified into slabs (typical section is 20&nbsp;cm thick and 2{{nbsp}}m wide) for flat products or blooms (sections vary widely but {{nowrap|25 cm \u00d7 25 cm}} is about the average).\n* Hot rolling (HR): The slabs and blooms are reheated in a furnace and then hot rolled. Hot rolling reduces the thickness of the slabs to produce about 3-mm thick coils. Blooms, on the other hand, are hot rolled into bars (that are cut into lengths at the exit of the rolling mill) or wire rod which is coiled.\n* Cold finishing (CF): This is a very simplified overview.\n\nHot rolled coils are pickled in acid solutions to remove the oxide scale on the surface, then subsequently cold rolled (Sendzimir rolling mills), annealed in a protective atmosphere until the desired thickness and surface finish is obtained. Further operations such as slitting, tube forming, and others can be carried out in downstream facilities.\n\nHot rolled bars are straightened, then machined to the required tolerance and finish.\n\nWire rod coils are subsequently processed to produce cold finished bars on drawing benches, fasteners on boltmaking machines and wire on single or multipass drawing machines.\n\n=== Production figures ===\nWorld stainless steel production figures re published every year by ISSF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldstainless.org/statistics/publications_and_papers|title=ISSF Stainless steel in figures}}</ref>\n\nOverall stainless steel production (flat and long products):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|+ Stainless steel meltshop production in 1000 metric tons\n|-\n!

H. Tuthill|date=2002|website=Nickel Institute|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA wide range of stainless steels are used throughout the papermaking process. For example, duplex stainless steels are being used in [[Kraft process|digesters]] to convert wood chips into wood pulp. 6% Mo superaustenitics are used in the [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleach plant]] and Type 316 is used extensively in the [[paper machine]].\n\n===Chemical processing and petrochemical===\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in these industries for their corrosion resistance to both aqueous, gaseous and high temperature environments, their mechanical properties at all temperatures from cryogenic to the very high, and occasionally for other special physical properties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/~/media/Files/TechnicalLiterature/StainlessSteelsforChemicalProcessEquipment_14038_.ashx|title=Stainless Steels for Chemical Process Equipment|last=G.

Stainless steels do not affect the taste of the product, they are easily cleaned and sterilized to prevent bacterial contamination of the food, and they are durable.\n\nStainless steels are used extensively in cookware, commercial food processing, commercial kitchens, brewing beer, wine making, and meat processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickelinstitute.org/NickelUseInSociety/MaterialsSelectionAndUse/FoodAndBeverage/WhyStainless.aspx|title=Food & Beverage Industry|last=Nickel Institute|website=Nickel Institute}}</ref>\n\nAcidic foods with high salt additions, such as tomato sauce, and highly salted condiments, such as soya sauce may require higher alloyed stainless steels such as 6% Mo superaustenitics to prevent pitting corrosion by chloride.\n\n===Vehicles===\n\n;  Automobiles\n{{See also|Braided stainless steel brake lines}}\nThe [[Allegheny Technologies|Allegheny Ludlum Corporation]] worked with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] on various [[concept car]]s with stainless steel bodies from the 1930s through the 1970s to demonstrate the material's potential. The 1957 and 1958 [[Cadillac]] Eldorado Brougham had a stainless steel roof. In 1981 and 1982, the [[DMC DeLorean]] production automobile used Type 304 stainless steel body panels over a [[glass-reinforced plastic]] [[monocoque]]. Intercity buses made by [[Motor Coach Industries]] are partially made of stainless steel.\n\nThe largest use of stainless steel in cars is the exhaust line. Environment protection requirements of reducing pollution and noise for the whole life of cars led to the use of ferritic grades typically AISI409/409Cb in North America, EN 1.4511 and 1.4512 in Europe. They are used for collector, tubing, muffler, catalytic converter, tailpipe. Heat resisting grades typically EN1.4913 or 1.4923 are used in parts of turbochargers,  other heat resisting grades for EGR ([[Exhaust gas recirculation]]) and for inlet and exhaust valves.  In addition, common rail injection systems and particularly the injectors rely on stainless steels.\n\nStainless steel has proved to be the best choice for miscellaneous applications, such as stiffeners for windshield wiper blades, balls for seat belt operation device in case of accident, springs, fasteners, etc.\n\nThe aft body panel of the [[Porsche Cayman]] model (2-door coupe hatchback) is made of stainless steel.  It was discovered during early body prototyping that conventional steel could not be formed without cracking (due to the many curves and angles in that automobile).  Thus, [[Porsche]] was forced to use stainless steel on the Cayman.\n\nSome [[Automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] use stainless steel as decorative highlights in their vehicles.\n\n'''Light commuter trains (Tram links)'''\n\nStainless steel is now used as one of the materials for tramlinks, together with Aluminum alloys and Carbon steel. Duplex grades tend to be preferred thanks to their corrosion resistance and higher strength, allowing a reduction of weight and a long life in maritime environments <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadlerrail.com/media/pdf/tlemtu0816e.pdf|title=Tramlink low floor lightrail vehicle|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n; Passenger rail cars\nRail cars have commonly been manufactured using corrugated stainless steel panels (for additional structural strength). This was particularly popular during the 1960s and 1970s, but has since declined. One notable example was the early [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. Notable former manufacturers of stainless steel rolling stock included the [[Budd Company]] (USA), which has been licensed to Japan's [[Tokyu Car Corporation]], and the Portuguese company [[Sorefame]]. Many railcars in the United States are still manufactured with stainless steel. India is developing its rail infrastructure and has started to put new stainless steel coaches in service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railnews.in/stainless-steel-acts-as-the-value-maximizer-in-lhb-coaches-for-meeting-passenger-safety-norms/|title=Stainless Steel acts as the 'value maximizer' in LHB Coaches for meeting Passenger Safety norms \u2013 RailNews Media India Ltd}}</ref> South Africa is also commissioning stainless steel coaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sassda.co.za/columbus-produces-niche-products-for-export/|title=Columbus produces Niche Products for Export|date= 2015|website=sassda.co.za/|access-date= 28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Aircraft\nBudd also built two airplanes, the [[Budd BB-1 Pioneer]] and the [[Budd RB-1 Conestoga]], of stainless steel tube and sheet. The first, which had fabric wing coverings, is on display at the [[Franklin Institute]], being the longest continuous display of an aircraft ever, since 1934. The [[RB-2]] Was almost all stainless steel, save for the control surfaces. One survives at the [[Pima Air & Space Museum]], adjacent to [[Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base]].\n\nThe American [[Fleetwings Sea Bird]] [[amphibious aircraft]] of 1936 was also built using a spot-welded stainless steel hull.\n\nDue to its thermal stability, the Bristol Aeroplane Company built the all-stainless steel [[Bristol 188]] high-speed research aircraft, which first flew in 1963. However, the practical problems encountered meant that [[Concorde]] employed aluminium alloys.\nSimilarly the experimental mach 3 American bomber, the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|XB70 Valkyrie]], made extensive use of stainless steel in its external structure due to the extreme heat encountered at those high speeds.\n\nThe use of stainless steel in mainstream aircraft is hindered by its excessive weight compared to other materials, such as [[aluminium]].\n\n; Spacecraft\nStainless steel also has an application in spaceflight. The [[Atlas (rocket family)|early Atlas rockets]] have used stainless steel (this formed their fuel tanks). The outer cladding of the modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]] of the [[International Space Station]] use stainless steel alloys.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Components of the future [[Space Launch System]], and the structural shell of the [[SpaceX Starship]] will be the second and third rockets respectively to use stainless steel.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{more|Surgical stainless steel}}\nSurgical tools and medical equipment are usually made of stainless steel, because of its durability and ability to be sterilized in an [[autoclave]]. In addition, [[surgical implant]]s such as bone reinforcements and replacements (e.g. hip sockets and cranial plates) are made with special alloys formulated to resist corrosion, mechanical wear,<ref>[http://wp.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum08/su08_p31-34.pdf Metal Corrosion in the Human Body]</ref> and biological reactions ''[[in vivo]]''.\n\nStainless steel is used in a variety of applications in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles,<ref>[[Stanley Malamed|Malamed, Stanley]] (2004). ''Handbook of Local Anesthesia'', 5th Edition.

Conversely, stainless steel is used in fuel cells that do the opposite, react hydrogen with oxygen to produce water and electrical energy.\n\n===Culinary===\n\nStainless steel is often preferred for [[sink|kitchen sinks]] because of its ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, [[acoustic noise]] is controlled by applying [[Sound dampening|resilient undercoating]] to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as [[kitchen appliance|appliances]] and [[Kitchen|backsplashes]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[Cookware and bakeware]] may be clad in stainless steels, to enhance their cleanability and durability, and to permit their use in [[induction cooking]] (this requires a [[ferromagnetism|magnetic]] grade of stainless steel, such as 432).

Valadium is usually silver-toned, but can be electro-plated to give it a gold tone. The gold tone variety is known as Sun-lite Valadium.<ref>{{cite web | title = What is Valadium? | url = http://www.danielsjewelers.com/militaryringsfaq.aspx#valadium}}</ref>  Other \"Valadium\" types of alloy are trade-named differently, with such names as \"[[Siladium]]\" and \"White Lazon\".\n\n===Firearms===\n\nSome firearms incorporate stainless steel components as an alternative to [[Bluing (steel)|blued]] or [[parkerized]] steel. Some [[handgun]] models, such as the [[Smith & Wesson Model 60]] and the Colt [[M1911 pistol]], can be made entirely from stainless steel. This gives a high-luster finish similar in appearance to nickel plating. Unlike plating, the finish is not subject to flaking, peeling, wear-off from rubbing (as when repeatedly removed from a holster), or rust when scratched.\n\n===3D printing===\n\nSome [[3D printing]] providers have developed proprietary stainless steel [[sintering]] blends for use in rapid prototyping. One of the more popular stainless steel grades used in 3D printing is 316L stainless steel. Due to the high temperature gradient and fast rate of solidification, stainless steel products manufactured via 3D printing tend to have a more refined microstructure; this, in turn, results in better mechanical properties. However, stainless steel is not used as much as materials like Ti<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>4</sub>V in the 3D printing industry; this is because manufacturing stainless steel products via traditional methods are currently much more economically competitive.\n\n== Life cycle cost==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2020}}\n<!--EVERY PURPORTED FACTUAL STATEMENT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED BY AN INLINE CITATION THAT STATES THE SAME THING THAT WE SAY IN THE SENTENCE.

According to the [[International Resource Panel]]'s [[Metal Stocks in Society report]], the per capita stock of stainless steel in use in society is 80\u2013180&nbsp;kg in more developed countries and 15&nbsp;kg in less-developed countries. There is a secondary market that recycles usable scrap for many stainless steel markets. The product is mostly coil, sheet, and blanks. This material is purchased at a less-than-prime price and sold to commercial quality stampers and sheet metal houses. The material may have scratches, pits, and dents but is made to the current specifications.\n\n'''Stainless steel cycle'''\n\nThe stainless steel cycle starts with Carbon steel scrap, primary metals, and slag.\n\nThe next step is the production by steel mills of hot rolled and of cold finished steel products, with some scrap which is directly reused in the melting shop.\n\nManufacturing of components is the third step, with some scrap that enters the recycling loop. Assembly of final goods and their use does not generate any material loss.\n\nThe fourth step is the collection of stainless steel for recycling at the end of life of the goods (such as kitchenware, pulp and paper plants or automotive parts). This is where it is most difficult to get stainless steel to enter the recycling, as can be seen in the Table below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Estimates of collection for recycling by sector <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Global Stainless Steel Cycle exemplifies China's rise to metal dominance|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=10|last=Reck|first=Barbara|last2=Chambon|first2=Martine|date=2010|publisher=Environ.

They are based in the [[Cove Bay, Aberdeen|Cove Bay]] and are the biggest football team in [[Aberdeen]] and play their football at [[Balmoral Stadium]], having left their former home at [[Allan Park, Aberdeen|Allan Park]] in April 2015.\n\n==History==\nCove were formed in 1922 and played in the local amateur leagues until 1985, when they became a junior team. However, the club applied and were accepted to the [[association football|senior]] [[Highland Football League]] in [[1986\u201387 Highland Football League|1986]], where they played until winning promotion to Scottish Football League division 2 in May 2019, after beating Berwick Rangers 7\u20130 on aggregate in the pyramid playoff. They have also racked up a formidable reputation in the lower rounds of the [[Scottish Cup]], reaching the 3rd round three times. In 2001 they won their first Highland League championship&nbsp;\u2013 but even more impressively won the 'treble' of [[Highland Football League|Highland League]], [[Aberdeenshire Shield]] and [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]].\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Cove reached round four of the Scottish Cup for the first time, beating [[Brora Rangers]] away 5\u20130, [[Keith F.C.|Keith]] 3\u20130 and [[Edinburgh University F.C.|Edinburgh University]] 1\u20130 on the way, before losing 4\u20132 to [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]].\n\nHowever, the south [[Aberdeen]] side claimed their second ever [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] Championship with a 3\u20130 home win against [[Lossiemouth F.C.|Lossiemouth]] on 3 May 2008.\n\nCove Rangers were one of the clubs who prepared an application for entry into the [[Scottish Football League]] following [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] relinquishing their league status on 3 June 2008. The other clubs were [[Annan Athletic F.C.|Annan Athletic]], [[Preston Athletic F.C.|Preston Athletic]] and [[Spartans F.C.|Spartans]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gretna/7433470.stm Gretna relinquish league status], ''BBC Sports''. Retrieved on 3 June 2008</ref> Annan Athletic were eventually awarded the place, due to their superior facilities.\n\nIn [[2015\u201316 Highland Football League|2016]] the club regained their [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] crown in one of the greatest teams achievements in recent memory. Due to the introduction of the 'pyramid system', Cove were forced to say goodbye to their [[Allan Park, Aberdeen|Allan Park home]] due to the stadium not meeting [[Scottish Professional Football League|SPFL]] minimum stadia requirements. This in turn meant the club played all of their games at an away ground with [[Inverurie Loco Works F.C.|Inverurie Locos]], [[Formartine United F.C.|Formartine United]] and [[Banks O'Dee F.C.|Banks O'Dee]] offering the use of their facilities so the club could compete. Cove went on to win the league and advance to the first play-off game against the winner of the [[Lowland Football League|Lowland League]], [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]]. The tie was won by City 4\u20131 on aggregate who subsequently progressed to [[Scottish League Two]] after beating [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]] in the second playoff tie.\n\nOne of the club's most famous players is the young Scottish midfielder [[Paul Coutts]] who joined English [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] during the summer of 2008 for a nominal fee.

The proposed new stadium would maximise their chances of getting into the [[Scottish League Two|League Two]] after getting rejected on 3 June 2008 because they didn't have a compliant stadium. \n\nBy September 2011, Cove Rangers were planning to share in part of the [[New Aberdeen Stadium]] project with Aberdeen F.C.</ref> This scheme was thrown into doubt, however, when [[Aberdeen City Council]] rejected an application by the two clubs to build a new ground for Cove Rangers that Aberdeen would also have used as a training ground.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19396170|title=New Aberdeen FC stadium sites 'offered by landowners'|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19342785|title=New Aberdeen FC park 'killed off', says Stewart Milne|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, on 18 April 2015, Cove Rangers played their final game at Allan Park following progress being made with Aberdeen City Council in terms of planning permission.

Allan Park had been bought by housing developers for a figure believed to be around the \u00a33m mark. The sale also included a social club, also owned by the football club, which closed its doors the following day.\n\nCove then began construction of their revised new stadium. The new facility, known as '[[Balmoral Stadium]]' is located next to a new secondary school, with the merging of [[Kincorth Academy|Kincorth]] and [[Torry Academy|Torry Academies]] into one larger school. In a clause made by Aberdeen City Council, this new school will have access to the new stadium's artificial pitch. \n\nIn July 2018, Cove moved into the Balmoral Stadium, having played home games at [[Inverurie Loco Works F.C.|Inverurie Loco Works]]' ground in the intervening period.

Football Club''' are a senior [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Association football|football]] club currently playing in [[Scottish League Two]]. They are based in the [[Cove Bay, Aberdeen|Cove Bay]] area of [[Aberdeen]] and play their football at [[Balmoral Stadium]], having left their former home at [[Allan Park, Aberdeen|Allan Park]] in April 2015.\n\n==History==\nCove were formed in 1922 and played in the local amateur leagues until 1985, when they became a junior team. However, the club applied and were accepted to the [[association football|senior]] [[Highland Football League]] in [[1986\u201387 Highland Football League|1986]], where they played until winning promotion to Scottish Football League division 2 in May 2019, after beating Berwick Rangers 7\u20130 on aggregate in the pyramid playoff. They have also racked up a formidable reputation in the lower rounds of the [[Scottish Cup]], reaching the 3rd round three times. In 2001 they won their first Highland League championship&nbsp;\u2013 but even more impressively won the 'treble' of [[Highland Football League|Highland League]], [[Aberdeenshire Shield]] and [[Scottish Qualifying Cup]].\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, Cove reached round four of the Scottish Cup for the first time, beating [[Brora Rangers]] away 5\u20130, [[Keith F.C.|Keith]] 3\u20130 and [[Edinburgh University F.C.|Edinburgh University]] 1\u20130 on the way, before losing 4\u20132 to [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]].\n\nHowever, the south [[Aberdeen]] side claimed their second ever [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] Championship with a 3\u20130 home win against [[Lossiemouth F.C.|Lossiemouth]] on 3 May 2008.\n\nCove Rangers were one of the clubs who prepared an application for entry into the [[Scottish Football League]] following [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]] relinquishing their league status on 3 June 2008. The other clubs were [[Annan Athletic F.C.|Annan Athletic]], [[Preston Athletic F.C.|Preston Athletic]] and [[Spartans F.C.|Spartans]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/g/gretna/7433470.stm Gretna relinquish league status], ''BBC Sports''. Retrieved on 3 June 2008</ref> Annan Athletic were eventually awarded the place, due to their superior facilities.\n\nIn [[2015\u201316 Highland Football League|2016]] the club regained their [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] crown in one of the greatest teams achievements in recent memory. Due to the introduction of the 'pyramid system', Cove were forced to say goodbye to their [[Allan Park, Aberdeen|Allan Park home]] due to the stadium not meeting [[Scottish Professional Football League|SPFL]] minimum stadia requirements. This in turn meant the club played all of their games at an away ground with [[Inverurie Loco Works F.C.|Inverurie Locos]], [[Formartine United F.C.|Formartine United]] and [[Banks O'Dee F.C.|Banks O'Dee]] offering the use of their facilities so the club could compete. Cove went on to win the league and advance to the first play-off game against the winner of the [[Lowland Football League|Lowland League]], [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]]. The tie was won by City 4\u20131 on aggregate who subsequently progressed to [[Scottish League Two]] after beating [[East Stirlingshire F.C.|East Stirlingshire]] in the second playoff tie.\n\nOne of the club's most famous players is the young Scottish midfielder [[Paul Coutts]] who joined English [[Football League One|League One]] club [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] during the summer of 2008 for a nominal fee. Coutts won the clubs's ''Young Player of the Year'' award for the 2008\u201309 season<ref>\n[http://www.theposh.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10427~1442029,00.html Coutts wins Player of the Moth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106053128/http://www.theposh.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10427~1442029%2C00.html |date=6 November 2008 }}, ''Peterborough United FC''.

The proposed new stadium would maximise their chances of getting into the [[Scottish League Two|League Two]] after getting rejected on 3 June 2008 because they didn't have a compliant stadium. \n\nBy September 2011, Cove Rangers were planning to share in part of the [[New Aberdeen Stadium]] project with Aberdeen F.C.</ref> This scheme was thrown into doubt, however, when [[Aberdeen City Council]] rejected an application by the two clubs to build a new ground for Cove Rangers that Aberdeen would also have used as a training ground.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19396170|title=New Aberdeen FC stadium sites 'offered by landowners'|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19342785|title=New Aberdeen FC park 'killed off', says Stewart Milne|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref> Nevertheless, on 18 April 2015, Cove Rangers played their final game at Allan Park following progress being made with Aberdeen City Council in terms of planning permission. In this game Cove marked their departure with a 4\u20130 victory over [[Fort William F.C.|Fort William]].  Allan Park had been bought by housing developers for a figure believed to be around the \u00a33m mark. The sale also included a social club, also owned by the football club, which closed its doors the following day.\n\nCove then began construction of their revised new stadium. The new facility, known as '[[Balmoral Stadium]]' is located next to a new secondary school, with the merging of [[Kincorth Academy|Kincorth]] and [[Torry Academy|Torry Academies]] into one larger school. In a clause made by Aberdeen City Council, this new school will have access to the new stadium's artificial pitch. \n\nIn July 2018, Cove moved into the Balmoral Stadium, having played home games at [[Inverurie Loco Works F.C.|Inverurie Loco Works]]' ground in the intervening period.

According to the act, a  Board of Crown Property was set up, to be chaired ''ex officio'' by the finance minister, and served by at least four royally-appointed directors. The king names one of the board members as the director-general of the CPB. The Board of Crown Property is responsible for the overall supervision of the activities of the Crown Property Bureau. Duties and responsibilities of the director-general are prescribed by the Board of Crown Property.\n\nInitially, the CPB was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Treasury of the [[Bureau of the Royal Household|Royal Household Bureau]]. On 21 April 1935, the 1934 act to exempt royal assets from taxation took effect. The act categorised royal assets into two types:\n\n#Assets eligible for tax exemption\n#Assets eligible for tax payment\n\nOn 19 July 1937, the Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936 became effective. It separated the royal assets into \"His Majesty's personal assets\", \"crown property\", and \"public property\". \"His Majesty's personal assets\" would be managed by the finance ministry. The CPB was set up with a status equivalent to a division under the treasury department of the finance ministry. Some of the functions, responsibilities, and officials were transferred from the Office of the Privy Purse to the Crown Property Bureau which sought permission to locate its office on the premises of the Office of the Privy Purse on the grounds of the [[Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]].\n\nThe Royal Assets Structuring Act has been amended three times: the second amendment (1941) took effect on 7 October 1941, the third amendment (1948) was promulgated on 18 February 1948 when the CPB's status was then elevated to a juristic person responsible for supervising, preserving, and managing crown property. The CPB director-general is authorized to affix his signature on behalf of the bureau. In July 2017, under the new bill, King [[Vajiralongkorn]] will set up a board of directors to oversee his assets. The king is entitled to appoint the board members, as well as to remove them, at his discretion. The law prohibits the taking away of royal assets without the king's approval. Under King [[Bhumibol]], the board of directors for the royal assets answered to the finance minister.

The act categorised royal assets into two types:\n\n#Assets eligible for tax exemption\n#Assets eligible for tax payment\n\nOn 19 July 1937, the Royal Assets Structuring Act of 1936 became effective. It separated the royal assets into \"His Majesty's personal assets\", \"crown property\", and \"public property\". \"His Majesty's personal assets\" would be managed by the finance ministry. The CPB was set up with a status equivalent to a division under the treasury department of the finance ministry. Some of the functions, responsibilities, and officials were transferred from the Office of the Privy Purse to the Crown Property Bureau which sought permission to locate its office on the premises of the Office of the Privy Purse on the grounds of the [[Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]].\n\nThe Royal Assets Structuring Act has been amended three times: the second amendment (1941) took effect on 7 October 1941, the third amendment (1948) was promulgated on 18 February 1948 when the CPB's status was then elevated to a juristic person responsible for supervising, preserving, and managing crown property. The CPB director-general is authorized to affix his signature on behalf of the bureau. In July 2017, under the new bill, King [[Vajiralongkorn]] will set up a board of directors to oversee his assets. The king is entitled to appoint the board members, as well as to remove them, at his discretion. The law prohibits the taking away of royal assets without the king's approval. Under King [[Bhumibol]], the board of directors for the royal assets answered to the finance minister. Now it is independent of the government.<ref name=\"TJT-20170909\">{{cite news|last1=Chachavalpongpun|first1=Pavin|title=A very wealthy monarch grows wealthier|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/09/09/commentary/world-commentary/wealthy-monarch-grows-wealthier/|accessdate=9 September 2017|work=The Japan Times|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Crown Property Bureau has moved its office four times, with Ladawan Palace (commonly referred to as the \"Red Palace\") having been its home since 18 July 1946.

{"title_page": "List of benzodiazepines", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Benzos}}\nThe below tables contain a '''sample list of benzodiazepines''' and benzodiazepine [[Analog (chemistry)|analogs]] that are commonly prescribed, with their basic [[pharmacological]] characteristics, such as half-life and equivalent doses to other [[benzodiazepines]], also listed, along with their trade names and primary uses. The [[elimination half-life]] is how long it takes for half of the drug to be eliminated by the body. \"Time to peak\" refers to when maximum levels of the drug in the blood occur after a given dose. Benzodiazepines generally share the same pharmacological properties, such as [[anxiolytic]], [[sedative]], [[hypnotic]], [[skeletal muscle relaxant]], [[amnesic]], and [[anticonvulsant]] effects. Variation in potency of certain effects may exist amongst individual benzodiazepines. Some benzodiazepines produce [[active metabolites]]. Active metabolites are produced when a person's body metabolizes the drug into compounds that share a similar pharmacological profile to the parent compound and thus are relevant when calculating how long the pharmacological effects of a drug will last. Long-acting benzodiazepines with long-acting active metabolites, such as [[diazepam]] and [[chlordiazepoxide]], are often prescribed for benzodiazepine or [[alcohol withdrawal]] as well as for [[anxiety]] if constant dose levels are required throughout the day. Shorter-acting benzodiazepines are often preferred for [[insomnia]] due to their lesser hangover effect.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Golombok S, Lader M |title=The psychopharmacological effects of premazepam, diazepam and placebo in healthy human subjects |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=127\u201333 |date=August 1984 |pmid=6148956 |pmc=1463527 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2125.1984.tb02444.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Visser SJ, van der Post JP, de Waal PP, Cornet F, Cohen AF, van Gerven JM |title=Biomarkers for the effects of benzodiazepines in healthy volunteers |journal=Br J Clin Pharmacol |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201350 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12534639 |pmc=1884188 |doi= 10.1046/j.1365-2125.2002.t01-10-01714.x|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118882375/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 |format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.non-benzodiazepines.org.uk/benzodiazepine-names.html |title=Benzodiazepine Names |accessdate=2009-04-05 |publisher=non-benzodiazepines.org.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208054743/http://www.non-benzodiazepines.org.uk/benzodiazepine-names.html |archivedate=2008-12-08 }}</ref><ref name=\"Ashton 2007\">{{cite web |first1 = C.

Individuals with an impaired liver also metabolize benzodiazepines more slowly. Many doctors{{Who|date=March 2013}} make the mistake of not adjusting benzodiazepine dosage according to age in elderly patients. Thus, the approximate equivalent of doses below may need to be adjusted accordingly in individuals on short acting benzodiazepines who metabolize long-acting benzodiazepines more slowly and vice versa.

Variation in potency of certain effects may exist amongst individual benzodiazepines. Some benzodiazepines produce [[active metabolites]]. Active metabolites are produced when a person's body metabolizes the drug into compounds that share a similar pharmacological profile to the parent compound and thus are relevant when calculating how long the pharmacological effects of a drug will last.

Many doctors{{Who|date=March 2013}} make the mistake of not adjusting benzodiazepine dosage according to age in elderly patients. Thus, the approximate equivalent of doses below may need to be adjusted accordingly in individuals on short acting benzodiazepines who metabolize long-acting benzodiazepines more slowly and vice versa.

The heroic Yatterman duo make their entrance with Yatterwoof (Yamadera, voice), a sentient dog-shaped [[mecha]] and Toybotty (Takahashi, voice), their robot sidekick. After a series of slapstick combat scenes, the Doronbo trio flee back to their mecha to defeat Yatterwan. Cheering at their first victory, the villains accidentally hit the mecha's self-destruct button. When the chaos clears, a teenage girl emerges from the ruins with a blue object in her hands.\n\nThe Narrator (Yamadera) explains Gan Takada (a.k.a. Yatterman #1, Sakurai) and his girlfriend, Ai Kaminari (a.k.a. Yatterman #2, Fukuda), live a double life as crime-fighting heroes. They are based under Takada Toys, founded by Gan's father. Gan built Toybotty and Yatterwoof, the latter an abandoned plan from his father. The girl they found in the ruins was Shoko Kaieda (Okamoto), daughter of Dr. Kaieda (Abu), an [[archaeologist]]. The piece of blue stone Shoko carries is a part of the Skull Stone, a legendary object now split into four pieces. Dr Kaieda, who is on a quest to find them, is attacked in the forest of Narway by Skullobey (Takeguchi), a black-clad being with an oversized skull.\n\nThe Doronbo Trio is then introduced. The gang includes Doronjo, the sexy female boss; Boyacky (Namase), the clever but lecherous mecha genius; and Tonzra, the gluttonous, [[kansai-ben]]-speaking strongman. Skullobey sends them orders to find the Skull Stone pieces, and will punish them should they fail. The trio open a wedding store called \"Doro Merry\" to raise money to build a new mecha: the {{nihongo|Bridesmaidiot|\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|B\u0101jin R\u014dd\u0101|Virgin Roader}}, a very feminine-looking construction. A robot skull arrives to deliver Skullobey's message: another Stone is in Ogypt, and the Doronbo trio must find it without losing Shoko. The skull self-destructs. Unknown to the trio, Toybotty witnesses everything and reports back to Gan and Ai. The duo transform into Yatterman and set off for Ogypt. When the group discover the missing piece, the villains arrive on the scene. They again use their mecha to damage Yatterwoof. After consuming a Mechanade thrown by Gan, the dog robot releases a swarm of ant robots which destroy the Bridesmaidiot, dragging Yatterwoof with it.\n\nBack home, Gan tries to rebuild Yatterwoof while Ai, jealous of Shoko and Doronjo goes out for a walk. The trio receive another message that another piece of the Stone is in the Southern Halps. It is then revealed that Skullobey wants Doronjo for himself. Meanwhile, things around the world start to disappear, and before he can tell the truth behind the Skull Stone pieces, Toybotty, who has been analyzing the Stone, disappears, as well.  Ai discovers another scam by the villains, involving a sushi restaurant, to raise money for their new robot, a giant squid. She also overhears that the last piece is hidden in the Southern Halps. The Doronbo trio then set out in a Squid mecha.\n\nUpon returning to base, Gan reads the analysis made by Toybotty before it disappeared: the Skull pieces, put back together, will destroy the flow of time itself, causing the disappearance of all things. The only way to stop this is to destroy the Stone when the pieces are reunited. The Yatterman duo set out with Shoko riding Yatterking, an upgraded Yatterwoof. The trio find the final piece. When the heroes arrive, Skullobey encases them in a giant dome filled with [[clockworks]]. Doronjo zaps Ai to force the Yatterman duo apart, only to finally discover the true love between Gan and Ai.\n\nShoko realizes Skullobey has possessed her father and due to her pleas, Dr. Kaieda is able to free himself from Skullobey and reveal his true form. Fighting as a unit again, Yatterman #1 and #2 team up with a reformed Doronbo Gang defeat Skullobey to trap him in the other world. Later, Gan and Ai bid Shoko and her father farewell, who leave to explore the world some more while the Doronbo Gang goes their separate ways.  However, they will gather, because their paths are reassembled into a single road.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sh\u014d Sakurai]] as Gan \"Gan-chan\" Takada, a mechanic expert and son of a toy manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:09\u5e74\u6625\u300c\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u300d\u5b9f\u5199\u3067\u6620\u753b\u5316\uff01\u4e3b\u6f14\u306b\u5d50\u30fb\u6afb\u4e95\u7fd4 |url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/071126/tnr0711261002002-n1.htm |publisher=Sankei News |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117110422/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/071126/tnr0711261002002-n1.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-17}}</ref><ref name=\"beginfilm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200803/gt2008032807.html|script-title=ja:\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u9a5a\u304b\u305b\u3066\u3084\u308b\uff01\u5d50\u30fb\u6afb\u4e95\u304c\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u300d\u306b\u81ea\u4fe1|publisher=Sankei Sports|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27|language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235615/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200803/gt2008032807.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-31}}</ref>\n* [[Saki Fukuda]] as Ai \"Ai-chan\" Kaminari, Gan Takada's girlfriend and daughter of an electrician.<ref name=\"beginfilm\"/><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u5ff5\u9858\u306e\u7279\u64ae\u306b\u5927\u559c\u3073!\u798f\u7530\u6c99\u7d00\u3001\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f32\u53f7\u306b\u629c\u64e2 |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200712/gt2007121205.html |publisher=Sankai Sports |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113121404/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200712/gt2007121205.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-13}}</ref>\n* [[Chiaki Takahashi (actress)|Chiaki Takahashi]] as the voice of Toybotty, Gan Takada's robot.\n* [[Kyoko Fukada]] as Doronjo, the attractive and intelligent leader of the Dorombo Gang.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u6df1\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u30c9\u30ed\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u5f79\u306b\u6311\u6226 |url=http://www.asahi.com/culture/nikkan/NIK200801110008.html |accessdate=2008-02-11 |publisher=The Asahi Shinbun Company |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080208173249/http://www.asahi.com/culture/nikkan/NIK200801110008.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-08}}</ref><ref name=\"actors\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u306b\u5f37\u6575\u51fa\u73fe\uff013\u60aa\u5f79\u306b\u6df1\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u751f\u702c\u30fb\u30b1\u30f3\u30b3\u30d0 |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200801/gt2008011507.html |publisher=Sankei Sports |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080205082846/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200801/gt2008011507.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-05}}</ref>\n* Kendo Kobayashi as Tonzura, the short and muscular strongman of the Dorombo Gang<ref name=\"actors\"/>\n* [[Katsuhisa Namase]] as Boyacky, the tall and skinny but lecherous mechanic of the Dorombo Gang.<ref name=\"actors\"/>\n* [[Junpei Takiguchi]] as voice of Skullobey, the Dorombo Gang's boss.\n* [[Anri Okamoto]] as Shoko Kaieda, the daughter of Dr. Kaieda who has part of the Skull Stone.\n* [[Sadao Abe]] as Dr. Kaieda, an archaeologist and Shoko Kaieda's father who is searching for the pieces of the Skull Stone pieces.\n* [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] as Yatterwoof, Yatterking, Odate-Buta, the narrator, and an amusement park employee.\n* [[Noriko Ohara]], [[Kazuya Tatekabe]] and [[Hiroshi Sasagawa]] make appearances as customers of the restaurant run by the Dorombo Gang.\n\n==Reception==\nOn its release weekend it topped the Japanese box office with $4,626,729.

After consuming a Mechanade thrown by Gan, the dog robot releases a swarm of ant robots which destroy the Bridesmaidiot, dragging Yatterwoof with it.\n\nBack home, Gan tries to rebuild Yatterwoof while Ai, jealous of Shoko and Doronjo goes out for a walk. The trio receive another message that another piece of the Stone is in the Southern Halps. It is then revealed that Skullobey wants Doronjo for himself. Meanwhile, things around the world start to disappear, and before he can tell the truth behind the Skull Stone pieces, Toybotty, who has been analyzing the Stone, disappears, as well.  Ai discovers another scam by the villains, involving a sushi restaurant, to raise money for their new robot, a giant squid. She also overhears that the last piece is hidden in the Southern Halps. The Doronbo trio then set out in a Squid mecha.\n\nUpon returning to base, Gan reads the analysis made by Toybotty before it disappeared: the Skull pieces, put back together, will destroy the flow of time itself, causing the disappearance of all things. The only way to stop this is to destroy the Stone when the pieces are reunited. The Yatterman duo set out with Shoko riding Yatterking, an upgraded Yatterwoof. The trio find the final piece. When the heroes arrive, Skullobey encases them in a giant dome filled with [[clockworks]]. Doronjo zaps Ai to force the Yatterman duo apart, only to finally discover the true love between Gan and Ai.\n\nShoko realizes Skullobey has possessed her father and due to her pleas, Dr. Kaieda is able to free himself from Skullobey and reveal his true form. Fighting as a unit again, Yatterman #1 and #2 team up with a reformed Doronbo Gang defeat Skullobey to trap him in the other world. Later, Gan and Ai bid Shoko and her father farewell, who leave to explore the world some more while the Doronbo Gang goes their separate ways.  However, they will gather, because their paths are reassembled into a single road.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sh\u014d Sakurai]] as Gan \"Gan-chan\" Takada, a mechanic expert and son of a toy manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:09\u5e74\u6625\u300c\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u300d\u5b9f\u5199\u3067\u6620\u753b\u5316\uff01\u4e3b\u6f14\u306b\u5d50\u30fb\u6afb\u4e95\u7fd4 |url=http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/071126/tnr0711261002002-n1.htm |publisher=Sankei News |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117110422/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/entertainments/entertainers/071126/tnr0711261002002-n1.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-17}}</ref><ref name=\"beginfilm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200803/gt2008032807.html|script-title=ja:\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u9a5a\u304b\u305b\u3066\u3084\u308b\uff01\u5d50\u30fb\u6afb\u4e95\u304c\u6620\u753b\u300c\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u300d\u306b\u81ea\u4fe1|publisher=Sankei Sports|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-03-27|language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235615/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200803/gt2008032807.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-31}}</ref>\n* [[Saki Fukuda]] as Ai \"Ai-chan\" Kaminari, Gan Takada's girlfriend and daughter of an electrician.<ref name=\"beginfilm\"/><ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u5ff5\u9858\u306e\u7279\u64ae\u306b\u5927\u559c\u3073!\u798f\u7530\u6c99\u7d00\u3001\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f32\u53f7\u306b\u629c\u64e2 |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200712/gt2007121205.html |publisher=Sankai Sports |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113121404/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200712/gt2007121205.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-01-13}}</ref>\n* [[Chiaki Takahashi (actress)|Chiaki Takahashi]] as the voice of Toybotty, Gan Takada's robot.\n* [[Kyoko Fukada]] as Doronjo, the attractive and intelligent leader of the Dorombo Gang.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u6df1\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u30c9\u30ed\u30f3\u30b8\u30e7\u5f79\u306b\u6311\u6226 |url=http://www.asahi.com/culture/nikkan/NIK200801110008.html |accessdate=2008-02-11 |publisher=The Asahi Shinbun Company |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080208173249/http://www.asahi.com/culture/nikkan/NIK200801110008.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-08}}</ref><ref name=\"actors\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u30e4\u30c3\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u306b\u5f37\u6575\u51fa\u73fe\uff013\u60aa\u5f79\u306b\u6df1\u30ad\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u751f\u702c\u30fb\u30b1\u30f3\u30b3\u30d0 |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200801/gt2008011507.html |publisher=Sankei Sports |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=Japanese |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080205082846/http://www.sanspo.com/geino/top/gt200801/gt2008011507.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-05}}</ref>\n* Kendo Kobayashi as Tonzura, the short and muscular strongman of the Dorombo Gang<ref name=\"actors\"/>\n* [[Katsuhisa Namase]] as Boyacky, the tall and skinny but lecherous mechanic of the Dorombo Gang.<ref name=\"actors\"/>\n* [[Junpei Takiguchi]] as voice of Skullobey, the Dorombo Gang's boss.\n* [[Anri Okamoto]] as Shoko Kaieda, the daughter of Dr. Kaieda who has part of the Skull Stone.\n* [[Sadao Abe]] as Dr. Kaieda, an archaeologist and Shoko Kaieda's father who is searching for the pieces of the Skull Stone pieces.\n* [[K\u014dichi Yamadera]] as Yatterwoof, Yatterking, Odate-Buta, the narrator, and an amusement park employee.\n* [[Noriko Ohara]], [[Kazuya Tatekabe]] and [[Hiroshi Sasagawa]] make appearances as customers of the restaurant run by the Dorombo Gang.\n\n==Reception==\nOn its release weekend it topped the Japanese box office with $4,626,729.
