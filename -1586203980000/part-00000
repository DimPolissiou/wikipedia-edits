A cluster of four skyscrapers, the tallest of which became Manchester's tallest building and the 5th tallest building in the United Kingdom in November 2018 at 65 floors & 201 metres.]]\n[[File:Granada Studios Building and Beetham Tower in Manchester.jpg|right|thumb|[[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]]. The second tallest building in Greater Manchester and the second tallest outside London at 169 metres completed in 2006.]]\n\nThis '''list of the tallest buildings and structures in Greater Manchester''' ranks buildings in the ten boroughs of [[Greater Manchester Urban Area|Greater Manchester]] (including [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], and the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]]) by height.\n\nGreater Manchester currently has ten towers completed at a height of 100 metres or more and a further five towers above 100 metres under construction. This is by far the highest number of high rises in any metropolitan area in the United Kingdom outside [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London|Greater London]].\n\nThe first proposed skyscraper in [[Manchester City Centre|Central Manchester]] was the 110 metre (361&nbsp;ft) [[Quay Street|Quay Street Tower]]. Envisioned to be completed in 1948 it would have been the tallest tower in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=1200|title=Quay Street Tower, Manchester - Building #1200|website=www.skyscrapernews.com}}</ref> The proposal was rejected and said to be inconsiderate, as much of the city was still rebuilding after the [[Manchester Blitz]] of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe first tall building boom in Greater Manchester occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with notable buildings including the 123 metre (404&nbsp;ft) [[City Tower, Manchester|City Tower]] which became the tallest building in the United Kingdom when constructed and the 118 metre (387&nbsp;ft) [[CIS Tower]].\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s few significant proposals came to fruition. However, there has been a renewed interest in skyscrapers in Manchester in the 21st century with a number of proposals being brought forward. In 2006, the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom outside London and the first to reach a height of over 150 metres making it also the first official [[skyscraper]] outside London. In 2018, [[Deansgate Square|Deansgate Square South Tower]] became the only skyscraper in the United Kingdom outside London to reach a height of over 200 metres. [[Trinity Islands, Manchester|Trinity Tower X]], estimated for completion in 2024 is due to become Greater Manchester's tallest building at 213 metres.\n\nUnlike most major cities in the United Kingdom, there are no height restrictions and local planning officers generally adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises in Manchester. If all future proposals come to fruition, Greater Manchester could contain well over 250 buildings over 50 metres tall as well as 41 high rises above 100 metres and 11 skyscrapers above 150 metres, with two higher than 200 metres.\n\nCentral Manchester is the predominant location for tall proposals with 31 buildings over 100 metres either built, under construction or proposed, with a further 5 proposals earmarked for [[Salford Quays]], three miles west of Central Manchester.\n\nCastlefield (14), which contains the Trinity Islands and Deansgate Square skyscraper developments, and Greengate (8) are the two areas with the biggest collection of skyscrapers in Manchester either built, under construction or proposed over 100 metres tall. Both areas are part of wider masterplans to expand Central Manchester out southwards and westwards respectively with amenities such as new green areas and schools to enable urban living.\n\nHowever these areas are not the only new areas of Central Manchester undergoing significant development. The northern side of the city contains a number of office and residential developments either completed or currently under construction as part of the \u00a3800 million NOMA development. Significant completed projects within NOMA already delivered including the iconic [[One Angel Square]], a modern [[Zero-energy building|zero carbon emissions]] [[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus building]] and the 108 metre [[Angel Gardens]] residential tower. These buildings will be joined by the Angel Meadow development which will deliver three new residential towers including the 128 metre Angel Meadow Park and Angel Square office towers as well as the Victoria Residence development which will also deliver three new residential towers, the tallest of which will reach 111 metres.\n\nThe southern side of Central Manchester is being expanded into the [[Chorlton-on-Medlock|Chorlton-On-Medlock]] inner city suburb by the Circle Square development which will deliver a mix of office and residential towers as well as new green spaces. In 2020 1 Circle Square residential tower became the first tower to complete in the scheme with a number due to follow including the 116 metre Affinity Living Circle Square residential tower.  \n\nAside from the above developments, the biggest new future developments areas of Central Manchester through the 2020s will be the new area of [[St John's, Manchester|St John's]] in the western side of Central Manchester adjacent to [[Spinningfields]] and the \u00a31.2 billion Mayfield scheme around [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly station]] in the east side of Central Manchester. St John's will deliver new cultural, office and residential developments including The Factory, a new inner city theatre, a 108 metre Vita tower and the 101 metre Union Living office tower. \n\nOver the next 10 years the Mayfield masterplan will play a key role in further expanding Central Manchester out eastwards, delivering a large new central park area among a large number of new office and residential towers with a number expected to be over 150 metres in height. Initial proposals for Mayfield to go to planning approval are expected in 2020 with the 22 storey office development in Baring Street among the first.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Tallest buildings and structures==\nThis list ranks externally complete buildings and free-standing structures in Greater Manchester that stand at least {{convert|50|m|ft|0}}, based on standard height measurement.

A cluster of four skyscrapers, the tallest of which became Manchester's tallest building and the 5th tallest building in the United Kingdom in November 2018 at 65 floors & 201 metres.]]\n[[File:Granada Studios Building and Beetham Tower in Manchester.jpg|right|thumb|[[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]]. The second tallest building in Greater Manchester and the second tallest outside London at 169 metres completed in 2006.]]\n\nThis '''list of the tallest buildings and structures in Greater Manchester''' ranks buildings in the ten boroughs of [[Greater Manchester Urban Area|Greater Manchester]] (including [[Metropolitan Borough of Bolton|Bolton]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury|Bury]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Oldham|Oldham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport|Stockport]], [[Tameside]], [[Trafford]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Wigan|Wigan]], and the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[City of Salford|Salford]]) by height.\n\nGreater Manchester currently has ten towers completed at a height of 100 metres or more and a further five towers above 100 metres under construction. This is by far the highest number of high rises in any metropolitan area in the United Kingdom outside [[List of tallest buildings and structures in London|Greater London]].\n\nThe first proposed skyscraper in [[Manchester City Centre|Central Manchester]] was the 110 metre (361&nbsp;ft) [[Quay Street|Quay Street Tower]]. Envisioned to be completed in 1948 it would have been the tallest tower in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapernews.com/buildings.php?id=1200|title=Quay Street Tower, Manchester - Building #1200|website=www.skyscrapernews.com}}</ref> The proposal was rejected and said to be inconsiderate, as much of the city was still rebuilding after the [[Manchester Blitz]] of the [[Second World War]].\n\nThe first tall building boom in Greater Manchester occurred in the 1960s and 1970s with notable buildings including the 123 metre (404&nbsp;ft) [[City Tower, Manchester|City Tower]] which became the tallest building in the United Kingdom when constructed and the 118 metre (387&nbsp;ft) [[CIS Tower]].\n\nThrough the 1980s and 1990s few significant proposals came to fruition. However, there has been a renewed interest in skyscrapers in Manchester in the 21st century with a number of proposals being brought forward. In 2006, the [[Beetham Tower, Manchester|Beetham Tower]] became the tallest building in the United Kingdom outside London and the first to reach a height of over 150 metres making it also the first official [[skyscraper]] outside London. In 2018, [[Deansgate Square|Deansgate Square South Tower]] became the only skyscraper in the United Kingdom outside London to reach a height of over 200 metres. [[Trinity Islands, Manchester|Trinity Tower X]], estimated for completion in 2024 is due to become Greater Manchester's tallest building at 213 metres.\n\nUnlike most major cities in the United Kingdom, there are no height restrictions and local planning officers generally adopt a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises in Manchester. If all future proposals come to fruition, Greater Manchester could contain well over 250 buildings over 50 metres tall as well as 41 high rises above 100 metres and 11 skyscrapers above 150 metres, with two higher than 200 metres.\n\nCentral Manchester is the predominant location for tall proposals with 31 buildings over 100 metres either built, under construction or proposed, with a further 5 proposals earmarked for [[Salford Quays]], three miles west of Central Manchester.\n\nCastlefield (14), which contains the Trinity Islands and Deansgate Square skyscraper developments, and Greengate (8) are the two areas with the biggest collection of skyscrapers in Manchester either built, under construction or proposed over 100 metres tall. Both areas are part of wider masterplans to expand Central Manchester out southwards and westwards respectively with amenities such as new green areas and schools to enable urban living.\n\nHowever these areas are not the only new areas of Central Manchester undergoing significant development. The northern side of the city contains a number of office and residential developments either completed or currently under construction as part of the \u00a3800 million NOMA development. Significant completed projects within NOMA already delivered including the iconic [[One Angel Square]], a modern [[Zero-energy building|zero carbon emissions]] [[Energy-plus-house|energy-plus building]] and the 108 metre [[Angel Gardens]] residential tower. These buildings will be joined by the Angel Meadow development which will deliver three new residential towers including the 128 metre Angel Meadow Park and Angel Square office towers as well as the Victoria Residence development which will also deliver three new residential towers, the tallest of which will reach 111 metres.\n\nThe southern side of Central Manchester is being expanded into the [[Chorlton-on-Medlock|Chorlton-On-Medlock]] inner city suburb by the Circle Square development which will deliver a mix of office and residential towers as well as new green spaces. In 2020 1 Circle Square residential tower became the first tower to complete in the scheme with a number due to follow including the 116 metre Affinity Living Circle Square residential tower.  \n\nAside from the above developments, the biggest new future developments areas of Central Manchester through the 2020s will be the new area of [[St John's, Manchester|St John's]] in the western side of Central Manchester adjacent to [[Spinningfields]] and the \u00a31.2 billion Mayfield scheme around [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Piccadilly station]] in the east side of Central Manchester. St John's will deliver new cultural, office and residential developments including The Factory, a new inner city theatre, a 108 metre Vita tower and the 101 metre Union Living office tower. \n\nOver the next 10 years the Mayfield masterplan will play a key role in further expanding Central Manchester out eastwards, delivering a large new central park area among a large number of new office and residential towers with a number expected to be over 150 metres in height. Initial proposals for Mayfield to go to planning approval are expected in 2020 with the 22 storey office development in Baring Street among the first.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Tallest buildings and structures==\nThis list ranks externally complete buildings and free-standing structures in Greater Manchester that stand at least {{convert|50|m|ft|0}}, based on standard height measurement.
