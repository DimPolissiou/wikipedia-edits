He played 18 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player in 2018.\n\nAllen played college basketball for the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut Huskies]] for three seasons, gaining a reputation as an efficient long-range shooter. He entered the NBA in [[1996 NBA Draft|1996]] as the fifth overall selection. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], featuring alongside [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] and [[free throw]] shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. He remained with the franchise for five seasons, before departing in free agency to join the [[Miami Heat]] for two seasons. In Miami, Allen accepted a reserve role, emphasizing spot-up and clutch shooting, which allowed him to capture another championship in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. His clutch three-pointer to tie Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals with 5.2 seconds remaining is regarded as one of the most memorable plays in NBA history.\n\nAllen's list of individual accolades are extensive; he gained ten [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] designations, he won an [[gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] as a member of the [[USA men's national basketball team#2000 Olympics U.S. Men's Basketball Team|2000 United States men's basketball team]], and he also holds NBA records in career three-point field goals made in both the [[List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders|regular]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff 3-point scoring leaders|postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Royce |title=Ray Allen breaks all-time playoff 3-point record |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22139764/video-ray-allen-breaks-all-time-playoff-3-point-record |work=CBSSPORTS}}</ref> He is also considered one of the best shooters of all-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ft_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Free Throw Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for 3-Pt Field Goal Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref> In September 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nDuring his NBA career, Allen acted during some offseasons.

Although never completely fitting in with the other kids, Allen's natural athletic gifts, and his obsession with hard work, allowed him to excel in every sport he played.

July 20, 1975) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. He played 18 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player in 2018.\n\nAllen played college basketball for the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut Huskies]] for three seasons, gaining a reputation as an efficient long-range shooter. He entered the NBA in [[1996 NBA Draft|1996]] as the fifth overall selection. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], featuring alongside [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] and [[free throw]] shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. He remained with the franchise for five seasons, before departing in free agency to join the [[Miami Heat]] for two seasons. In Miami, Allen accepted a reserve role, emphasizing spot-up and clutch shooting, which allowed him to capture another championship in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. His clutch three-pointer to tie Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals with 5.2 seconds remaining is regarded as one of the most memorable plays in NBA history.\n\nAllen's list of individual accolades are extensive; he gained ten [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] designations, he won an [[gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] as a member of the [[USA men's national basketball team#2000 Olympics U.S. Men's Basketball Team|2000 United States men's basketball team]], and he also holds NBA records in career three-point field goals made in both the [[List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders|regular]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff 3-point scoring leaders|postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Royce |title=Ray Allen breaks all-time playoff 3-point record |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22139764/video-ray-allen-breaks-all-time-playoff-3-point-record |work=CBSSPORTS}}</ref> He is also considered one of the best shooters of all-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ft_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Free Throw Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for 3-Pt Field Goal Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref> In September 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nDuring his NBA career, Allen acted during some offseasons. He is best known for his role as basketball prodigy Jesus Shuttlesworth in ''[[He Got Game]]'' (1998). Allen's performance as Shuttlesworth was greatly praised by critics, and the name was borrowed as Allen's basketball nickname.<ref>{{cite news|first=Emanuel|last=Levy|url= https://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/he-got-game-1117477426/|title=He Got Game|work=Variety|date= 1998-04-27|accessdate=2020-02-26}}</ref> <ref name=\"suntimes1\">{{cite news|url= https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/he-got-game-1998|title=He Got Game|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com |date=May 1, 1998|accessdate=February 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Edelstein |first=David |url=https://slate.com/culture/1998/05/he-got-balls.html|title=He Got Balls |work=Slate|date=1998-05-03 |accessdate=2020-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125225131/http://slate.msn.com/id/3252 |archivedate=2009-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThe third of five children, Allen was born at [[Castle Air Force Base]] near [[Merced, California]], the son of Walter Sr. and Flora Allen.<ref name=jock>{{cite web |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Allen/Allen_bio.html |title=Ray Allen Biography |publisher=JockBio |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> A [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military child]], he spent time growing up in [[Saxmundham]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]], in [[Altus, Oklahoma]], at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]<ref name=jock /> in California, and in Germany.<ref name=rayroots>Marc J.

When he first arrived, the young Allen was often made the odd-man-out, whom kids often picked on, due to the accent acquired during his formative years in Britain. Although never completely fitting in with the other kids, Allen's natural athletic gifts, and his obsession with hard work, allowed him to excel in every sport he played. When a growth spurt left him with a natural advantage in basketball, he decided to dedicate his free time to becoming the best basketball player he possibly could.<ref name=\"theplayerstribune.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/ray-allen-letter-to-my-younger-self/|title=Letter to My Younger Self \u2013 By Ray Allen|website=The Players' Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Allen/Allen_bio.html|title=JockBio: Ray Allen Biography|website=www.jockbio.com}}</ref> Fueled by his desire to become the top player on the military base where he lived, Allen practiced at length daily, so long as it didn't interfere with his studies.<ref name=\"theplayerstribune.com\"/> By the age of fifteen, he was playing for Hillcrest High School's varsity team, and would eventually lead them to their first state championship game. In that game, Allen showed his NBA potential by posting an impressive 25 points, to go along with 12 rebounds, in a blowout victory for Hillcrest Wildcats.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one (typically no more than four) prestigious prizes are listed below.

Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes. These awards are listed below.\n\nWhile the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was not originally endowed by Alfred Nobel, it is sponsored and administered by the Nobel Foundation, and generally recognized as the \"Nobel Prize in Economics.\" Due to this recognition it is included in the list below.\n\n== Prizes sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nAlfred Nobel's last will of 1895 only included five prizes, covering outstanding achievements who confer the \"greatest benefit on mankind\" in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. The original Nobel prizes thus includes:\n* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]\n* [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]\n\nIn addition to the prizes listed above, the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] is sponsored by the Nobel Foundation. The foundation has trademarked the term \"Nobel Prize\" and this designation cannot be legally used to refer to any prizes other than the five original Nobels.<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/>\n\n== Prizes not sponsored by the Nobel Foundation ==\nSeveral prizes in fields of study and achievement not covered by the original Nobel Prizes have been established by various entities. These have been referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of\" that particular field, in the vast majority of cases without the approval of the Nobel Foundation. These prizes are generally the highest awards in their fields. For some fields, more than one (typically no more than four) prestigious prizes are listed below. Some most important prizes in the world are presented in bold.

The recipient must be a member of one of the two societies. In 1967, these two prizes were established at the same time. The initial contribution for the Birkhoff Prize came from the Birkhoff family and for the Wiener Prize from the Mathematics Department of the Massachusettes Institute of Technology. Each is to be awarded, every three years (initially every five years, which is why the two prizes were first awarded in 1968 and in 1970 respectively), for outstanding contributions to applied mathematics in the highest and broadest sense. In the early years, the Birkhoff Prize was awarded at an AMS meeting and the Wiener Prize at a SIAM meeting.

Similar prizes for young talent economists in the world include the ''[[Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Foundation#Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award|Yrj\u00f6 Jahnsson Award]]'' (1993), the European equivalent awarded to European economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Nakahara Prize]]'' (1995) awarded to Japanese economists under '''45''' years of age; the ''[[Gossen Prize]]'' (1997) awarded to German-speaking economists under '''45''' years of age;  the ''[[Prix du meilleur jeune \u00e9conomiste de France|Prix du Meilleur Jeune \u00c9conomiste de France]]'' (2000) awarded to French economists under '''40''' years of age; and the ''[[Assar Lindbeck Medal]]'' (2007) awarded to Swedish economists under '''45''' years of age. \n* 2: The John von Neumann Award, which honors professors with top contributions to economics and social sciences, is distinguished from other scientific awards on the basis that it is given by students. The students at the [[Rajk L\u00e1szl\u00f3 College for Advanced Studies]] ([[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]), which is a self governing community of about 100 selected students living together, elect the nominees and vote for the prize-winner in the Assembly of the College after a review and debate regarding the candidates every year. Recipients are invited to the college to receive the award, give an open lecture and hold a master class. ''It also needs to be noted that there are three other prizes named after Hungarian-American polymath [[John von Neumann]] in this prize list, the [[#Applied mathematics|SIAM John von Neumann Lecture]] (1960) for distinguished contributions to the field of applied mathematical sciences, the [[#Computer science|IEEE John von Neumann Medal]] (1992) for outstanding achievements in computer-related science and technology, and the [[#Operations research|INFORMS John von Neumann Theory Prize]] (1975) for fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.''\n}}</small>\n\n====Electrical engineering====\n* '''[[IEEE Medal of Honor]]''' (1917)<ref name=ee/><ref name=shanghairanking2017>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/subject-survey-2017/awards.html|title=ShanghaiRanking Academic Excellence Survey 2017|website=shanghairanking.com}}</ref>\n* [[IET Faraday Medal|Faraday Medal]] (1922)<ref name=ee/>\n* [[IEEE Edison Medal|Edison Medal]] (1909)<ref name=shanghairanking2017/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8290600|title=Origins of the IEEE Edison Medal| journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | volume = 106| issue = 2| pages = 319\u2013328| issn =0018-9219|doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2018.2790278|author=David P.
