According to this, the Scythians originally lived south of the [[Urals|Rhipaean mountains]], until they got into a conflict with a tribe called the [[Issedones]], pressed in their turn by the \"one-eyed [[Arimaspi]]ans\"; and so the Scythians decided to migrate westwards.\n\nAccounts by Herodotus of Scythian origins has been discounted recently; although his accounts of Scythian raiding activities contemporary to his writings have been deemed more reliable.<ref>{{harvnb|Drews|2004|p=92}} \"Ever since critical history began, scholars have recognized that much of what Herodotos gives us is silly.\"</ref>\n\n====Archaeological evidence====\n[[File:Scythian cultures.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Distribution of the [[Scythian cultures]], of which the Scythians were part]]\nModern interpretation of historical, archaeological, and anthropological evidence has proposed two broad hypotheses on Scythian origins.<ref name=\"M_51\"/>\n\nThe first hypothesis, formerly more espoused by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and then [[Russia]]n researchers, roughly followed Herodotus' (third) account, holding that the Scythians were an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]-speaking group who arrived from [[Inner Asia]], i.e. from the area of [[Turkestan]] and western Siberia.\n<ref name=\"M_51\">{{harvnb|Mallory|1991|pp=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe second hypothesis, according to [[Roman Ghirshman]] and others, proposes that the Scythian cultural complex emerged from local groups of the [[Srubna culture]] at the Black Sea coast,<ref name=\"M_51\"/> although this is also associated with the Cimmerians.

He classes the Cimmerians as a distinct [[autochthon (person)|autochthonous]] tribe, expelled by the Scythians from the northern Black Sea coast (''Hist.'' 4.11\u201312). Herodotus also states (4.6) that the Scythians consisted of the [[Auchatae]], [[Catiaroi]], [[Traspians]], and [[Paralatae]] or \"Royal Scythians\".\n\nIn the early 7th century BC, the Scythians and Cimmerians are recorded in Assyrian texts as having conquered [[Urartu]]. In the 670s, the Scythians under their king [[Bartatua]] raided the territories of the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrian king [[Esarhaddon]] managed to make peace with the Scythians by paying a large amount of tribute.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Bartatua was succeeded by his son [[Madius]] ca. 645 BC, after which they launched a great raid on [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Madius subsequently subjugated the [[Median Empire]]. During this time, Herodotus notes that the Scythians raided and exacted tribute from \"the whole of Asia\". In the 620s, [[Cyaxares]], leader of the [[Medes]], treacherously killed a large number of Scythian chieftains at a feast; the Scythians were subsequently driven back to the steppe. In 612 BC, the Medes and Scythians participated in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire with the [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Battle of Nineveh]]. During this period of influence in the Middle East, the Scythians became heavily influenced by the local civilizations.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nIn the 6th century BC, the [[Greeks]] had begun establishing settlements along the coasts and rivers of th Pontic steppe, coming in contact with the Scythians. Relations between the Greeks and the Scythians appear to have been peaceful, with the Scythians being substantially influenced by the Greeks, although the city of the [[Panticapaeum]] might have been destroyed by the Scythians in the mid century BC. During this time, the Scythian philosopher [[Anacharsis]] traveled to [[Athens]], where he made a great impression on the local people with his \"barbarian wisdom\".<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===War with Persia===\n[[File:Xerxes detail three types of Sakas cleaned up.jpg|thumb|350px|Reliefs depicting the soldiers of the [[Achaemenid army]], [[Xerxes I]] tomb, circa 480 BCE.

Planning an invasion of Greece, Darius first sought to secure his northern flank against Scythian inroads. Thus, Darius [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|declared war on the Scythians]].<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> At first, Darius sent his [[Cappadocia]]n satrap [[Ariamnes]] with a vast fleet (estimated at 600 ships by Herodotus) into Scythian territory, where several Scythian nobles were captured. He then built a bridge across the [[Bosporus]] and easily defeated the [[Thracians]], crossing the [[Danube]] into Scythian territory with a large army (700,000 men if one is to believe Herodotus) in 512 BC.<ref name=\"Cernenko_21\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=21\u201329}}</ref> At this time Scythians were separated into three major kingdoms, with the leader of the largest tribe, King [[Idanthyrsus]], being the supreme ruler, and his subordinate kings being [[Scopasis]] and [[Taxacis]].\n\nUnable to receive support from neighboring nomadic peoples against the Persians, the Scythians evacuated their civilians and livestock to the north and adopted a [[scorched earth]] strategy, while simultaneously harassing the extensive Persian supply lines. Suffering heavy losses, the Persians reached as far as the [[Sea of Azov]], until Darius was compelled to enter into negotiations with Idanthyrsus, which however broke down. Darius and his army eventually retreated across the Danube back into Persia, and the Scythians thereafter earned a reputation of invincibility among neighboring peoples.<ref name=\"Cernenko_21\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Golden Age===\nIn the aftermath of their defeat of the Persian invasion, Scythian power grew considerably, and they launched campaigns against their Thracian neighbors in the west.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\">{{harvnb|Cernenko|2012|pp=29\u201332}}</ref> In 496 BC, the Scythians launched an great expedition into Thrace, reaching as far as [[Chersonesos (Thrace)|Chersonesos]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> During this time they negotiated an alliance with the Achaemenid Empire against the [[Sparta]]n king [[Cleomenes I]]. A prominent king of the Scythians in the 5th century was [[Scyles]].<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\nThe Scythian offensive against the Thracians was checked by the [[Odrysian kingdom]]. The border between the Scythians and the Odrysian kingdom was thereafter set at the Danube, and relations between the two dynasties were good, with dynastic marriages frequently occurring.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> The Scythians also expanded towards the north-west, where they destroyed numerous fortified settlements and probably subjucated numerous settled populations. A similar fate was suffered by the Greek cities of the northwestern Black Sea coast and parts of the Crimea, over which the Scythians established political control.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Greek settlements along the [[Don River]] also came under the control of the Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nA division of responsibility developed, with the Scythians holding the political and military power, the urban population carrying out trade, and the local sedentary population carrying out manual labor.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their territories grew grain, and shipped wheat, flocks, and cheese to Greece. The Scythians apparently obtained much of their wealth from their control over the [[slave trade]] from the north to Greece through the Greek [[Black Sea]] [[apoikia|colonial ports]] of [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], and [[Gorgippia]].\n\nWhen Herodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the 5th century BC, Greeks distinguished [[Scythia Minor]], in present-day [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], from a [[Scythia|Greater Scythia]] that extended eastwards for a 20-day ride from the Danube River, across the [[steppe]]s of today's East Ukraine to the lower [[Don River, Russia|Don]] basin.\n\nScythian offensives against the Greek colonies of the northeastern Black Sea coast were largely unsuccessful, as the Greeks united under the leadership of the city of Panticapaeum and put up a vigorous defence. These Greek cities developed into the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. Meanwhile, several Greek colonies formerly under Scythian control began to reassert their independence. It is possible that the Scythians were suffering from internal troubles during this time.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the mid 4th century BC, the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to the east of the Scythians, began expanding into Scythian territory.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\n[[Image:Skiluros.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scythian king [[Skilurus]], relief from [[Scythian Neapolis]], Crimea, 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC]]\n\nThe 4th century BC was a flowering of Scythian culture. The Scythian king [[Ateas]] managed to unite under his power the Scythian tribes living between the [[Maeotian Swamp|Maeotian marshes]] and the Danube, while simultaneously enroaching upon the Thracians.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> He conquered territories along the Danube as far the [[Sava]] river and established a trade route from the Black Sea to the [[Adriatic]], which enabled a flourishing of trade in the Scythian kingdom. The westward expansion of Ateas brought him into conflict with [[Philip II of Macedon]] (reigned 359 to 336 BC), with whom he had previously been allied,<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> who took military action against the Scythians in 339 BC. Ateas died in battle, and his empire disintegrated.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], continued the conflict with the Scythians. In 331 BC, his general [[Zopyrion]] invaded Scythian territory with a force of 30,000 men, but was routed and killed by the Scythians near Olbia.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the aftermath of conflict between Macedon and the Scythians, the [[Celts]] seem to have displaced the Scythians from the [[Balkans]]; while in south Russia, a kindred tribe, the Sarmatians, gradually overwhelmed them. In 310-309 BC, as noted by [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Scythians, in alliance with the Bosporan Kingdom, defeated the [[Siraces]] in a [[Battle of the River Thatis|great battle]] at the river Thatis.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/>\n\nBy the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian culture of the Pontic steppe suddenly disappears. The reasons for this are controversial, but the expansion of the Sarmatians certainly played a role. The Scythians in turn shifted their focus towards the Greek cities of the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Roman Empire 125 (cropped).png|thumb|right|The territory of the Scythae Basilaei (\"Royal Scyths\") along the north shore of the [[Black Sea]] around 125 AD.]]\n\nBy ca. 200 BC, the Scythians had largely withdrawn into the [[Crimea]]. By the time of Strabo's account (the first decades AD), the Crimean Scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower Dnieper to the Crimea, centered at [[Scythian Neapolis]] near modern [[Simferopol]]. They had become more settled and were intermingling with the local populations, in particular the [[Tauri]], and were also subjected to [[Hellenization]]. They maintained close relations with the Bosporan Kingdom, with whose dynasty they were linked by marriage. A separate Scythian territory, known as Scythia Minor, existed in modern-day [[Dobruja]], but was of little significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, the Scythian kings [[Skilurus]] and [[Palakus]] sought to exent their control over the Greek cities of north of the Black Sea. The Greek cities of Chersonesus and Olbia in turn requested the aid [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], whose general [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]] defeated their armies in battle, took their capital and annexed their territory to the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/><ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> After this time, the Scythians practically disappeared from history.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> Scythia Minor was also defeated by Mithradates.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the years after the death of Mithradates, the Scythians had transitioned to a settled way of life and were assimilating into neighboring populations. They made a resurgence in the 1st century AD and laid siege to Chersonesos, who were obliged to seek help from the [[Roman Empire]]. The Scythians were in turn defeated by Roman commander [[Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the 2nd century AD, archaeological evidence show that the Scythians had been largely assimilated by the Sarmatians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their capital city, Scythian Neapolis, was destroyed by the invading [[Goths]] in the mid-3rd century AD.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Avar\u00e1rok.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Scythian defence line 339 BC reconstruction in [[Polg\u00e1r, Hungary]] ]]\nArchaeological remains of the Scythians include [[kurgans|kurgan]] tombs (ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate \"Royal kurgans\" containing the \"Scythian triad\" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild-animal art), [[gold]], [[silk]], and animal sacrifices, in places also with suspected [[human sacrifice]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1991|pp=64\u201365, 118}}</ref> [[Mummification]] techniques and [[permafrost]] have aided in the relative preservation of some remains.

The date of this transition is disputed among archaeologists. Dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 7th century BC have been proposed. A transition in the late 8th century has gained the most scholarly support. The origins of the Early Scythian culture is controversial. Many of its elements are of Central Asian origin, but the culture appears to have reached its ultimate form on the Pontic steppe, partially through the influence of [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] elements and to a smaller extent the influence of [[Near East]]ern elements.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe period in the 8th and 7th centuries BC when the Cimmerians and Scythians raided the Near East are ascribed to the later stages of the Early Scythian culture. Examples of Early Scythian burials in the Near East include those of [[:de:Nor\u015funtepe|Nor\u015funtepe]] and [[\u0130mirler, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhac\u0131k\u00f6y|\u0130mirler]]. Objects of Early Scythian type have been found in [[Urartu|Urartian]] fortresses such as [[Teishebaini]], [[Bastam Citadel|Bastam]], and Ayanis-kale. Near Eastern influences are probably explained through objects made by Near Eastern craftsmen on behalf of Scythian chieftains.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:throne arm.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|An arm from the throne of a Scythian king, 7th century BC. Found at the Kelermess [[kurgan]] (burial mound), [[Krasnodar Krai]] in 1905. On exhibit at the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]\n\nEarly Scythian culture is known primarily from its funerary sites, because the Scythians at this time were nomads without permanent settlements. The most important sites are located in the northwestern parts of Scythian territories in the forest steppes of the Dnieper, and the southeastern parts of Scythian territories in the North Caucasus. At this time it was common for the Scythians to be buried in the edges of their territories. Early Scythian sites are characterized by similar artifacts with minor local variations.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Kurgan]]s from the Early Scythian culture have been discovered in the North Caucasus. Some if these are characterized by great wealth, and probably belonged royals of aristocrats. They contain not only the deceased, but also horses and even chariots. The burial rituals carried out in these [[kurgan]]s correspond closely with those described by Herodotus. The greatest kurgans from the Early Scythian culture in the North Caucasus are found at [[:ru:\u041a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Kelermesskaya]], Novozavedennoe II ([[:ru:\u0423\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Ulsky Kurgans]]) and [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]]. One kurgan at Ulsky was found measured at 15 meters in height and contained more than 400 horses. Kurgans from the 7th century BC, when the Scythians were raiding the Near East, typically contain objects of Near Eastern origin. Kurgans from the late 7th century however, contain few Middle Eastern objects, but rather objects of Greek origin, pointing to increased contacts between the Scythians and Greek colonists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been found in the forest steppes of the Dnieper. The most important of these finds is the [[:uk:\u041c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Melgunov Kurgan]]. This kurgan contains several objects of Near Eastern origin so similar to those found at the kurgan in Kelermesskaya that they were probably made in the same workshop. Most of Early Scythian sites in this area are situated along the banks of the Dnieper and its tributiaries. The funerary rites of these sites are similar but not identical to those of the kurgans in the North Caucasus.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been discovered in the areas separating the North Caucasus and the forest steppes. These include the Krivorozhski\u012d kurgan on the eastern banks of the [[Donets]], and the Temir-gora kurgan in the Crimea. Both date to the 7th century BC and contain Greek imports. The Krivorozhski\u012d also display Near Eastern influences.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Placa en forma de c\u00e9rvol tombat, trobada al t\u00famul de Kostromskoy a Kuban, segle VII aC.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|The famous gold stag of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]], Russia]]\n\nApart from funerary sites, numerous settlements from the Early Scythian period have been discovered. Most of these settlements are located in the forest steppe zone and are non-fortified. The most important of these sites in the Dnieper area are [[Trakhtemyriv|Trakhtemirovo]], [[:uk:\u041c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Motroninskoe]], and Pastyrskoe. East of these, at the banks of the [[Vorskla River]], a tributiary of the Dnieper, lies the [[Bilsk, Kotelva Raion|Bilsk]] settlement. Occupying an area of 4,400 hectares with an outer rampart at over 30&nbsp;km, Bilsk is the largest settlement in the forest steppe zone.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> It has been tentatively identified by a team of archaeologists led by [[Boris Shramko]] as the site of [[Gelonus]], the purported capital of Scythia.\n\nAnother important large settlement can be found at [[Myriv]]. Dating from the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Myriv contains a significant amount of imported Greek objects, testifying to lively contacts with [[Borysthenes]], the first Greek colony established on the Pontic steppe (ca. 625 BC). Within the ramparts in these settlements there were areas without buildings, which where probably occupied by nomadic Scythians seasonally visiting the sites.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Early Scythian culture came to an end in the latter part of the 6th century BC.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Classical Scythian===\n[[File:Scythian capital and royal kurgans.png|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of Scythian kurgans and other sites along the [[Dnieper Rapids]] during the Classical Scythian period]]\nBy the end of the 6th century BC, a new period begins in the material culture of the Scythians. Certain scholars consider this a new stage in the Scythian culture, while others consider it an entirely new archaeological culture. It is possible that this new culture arose through the settlement of a new wave of nomads from the east, who intermingled with the local Scythians. The Classical Scythian period saw major changes in Scythian material culture, both with regards to weapons and art style. This was largely through Greek influence. Other elements had probably been brought from the east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nLike in Early Scythian culture, the Classical Scythian culture is primarily represented through funerary sites. The area of distribution of these sites has however changed. Most of them, including the richest, are located on the Pontic steppe, in particular the area around the [[Dnieper Rapids]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nAt the end of the 6th century BC, new funerary rites appeared, characterized by more complex kurgans. This new style was rapidly adopted throughout Scythian territory. Like before, elite burials usually contained horses. A buried king was usually accompanied with multiple people from his entourage.

Part of the population was probably composed of agriculturalists. It is likely that Kamenskoe also served as a political center in Scythia. A significant part of Kamenskoe was not built up, perhaps to set it aside for the Scythian king and his entourage during their seasonal visits to the city.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> [[J\u00e1nos Harmatta]] suggests that Kamenskoe served as a residence for the Scythian king Ateas.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nBy the 4th century it appears that some of the Scythians were adopting an agricultural way of life similar to the peoples of the forest steppes. As result, a number of fortified and non-fortified settlements spring up in the areas of the lower Dnieper.

This area was at the time mostly settled by Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nArchaeologically the Late Scythian culture has little in common with its predecessors. It represents a fusion of Scythian traditions with those of the Greek colonists and the [[Tauri]], who inhabited the mountains of the Crimea. The population of the Late Scythian culture was mainly settled, and were engaged in stockbreeding and agriculture. They were also important traders, serving as intermediaries between the [[classical world]] and the [[barbarian]] world.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nRecent excavations at [[:ru:\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe]] implies that this site was the political center of the Scythians in the 3rd century BC and the early part of the 2nd century BC. It was a well protected fortress constructed in accordance with Greek principles.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important site of the Late Crimean culture is Scythian Neaoplis, which was located in Crimea and served as the capital of the Late Scythian kingdom from the early 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 3rd century AD. Scythian Neapolis was largely constructed in accordance with Greek principles. Its royal palace was destroyed by [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]], a general of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], at the end of the 2nd century BC, and was not rebuilt. The city nevertheless continued to exist as a major urban center. It underwent significant change from the 1st century to the 2nd century AD, eventually being left with virtually no buildings except from its fortifications. New funerary rites and material features also appear. It is probable that these changes represent the assimilation of the Scythians by the Sarmatians. A certain continuity is however observable. From the end of the 2nd century to the middle of the 3rd century AD, Scythian Neapolis transforms into a non-fortified settlement containing only a few buildings.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from Scythian Neapolis and Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe, more than 100 fortified and non-fortified settlements from the Late Scythian culture have been discovered. They are often accompanied by a necropolis. Late Scythian sites are mostly found in areas around the foothills of the Crimean mountains and along the western coast of the Crimea. Some of these settlements had earlier been Greek settlements, such as [[Kalos Limen]] and [[Kerkinitis]]. Many of these coastal settlements served as trading ports.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe largest Scythian settlements after Neapolis and Ak-Kaya-Vishennoe were [[:ru:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d\u043e (\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c)|Bulganak]], [[:ru:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u0410\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ust-Alma]], and [[:ru:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u041a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d-\u041a\u044b\u0440|Kermen-Kyr]].

The material culture of these settlements was even more Hellenized than those on the Crimea, and they were probably closely connected to Olbia, if not dependent it.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBurials of the Late Scythian culture can be divided into two kurgans and necropolises, with necropolises becoming more and more common as time progresses. The largest such necropolis has been found at Ust-Alma.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBecause of close similarities between the material culture of the Late Scythians and that of neighboring Greek cities, many scholars have suggested that Late Scythian cites, particularly those of the Lower Dnieper, were populated at last partly by Greeks.

While the productivity of domesticated animal-breeding greatly exceeded that of the settled agricultural societies, the pastoral economy also needed supplemental agricultural produce, and stable nomadic confederations developed either symbiotic or forced alliances with sedentary peoples \u2013 in exchange for animal produce and military protection.\n\nHerodotus relates that three main tribes of the Scythians descended from three sons of Targitaus: Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais. They called themselves Scoloti, after one of their kings.<ref>Traces of the Iranian root ''x\u0161aya'' \u2013 \"ruler\" \u2013 may persist in all three names.</ref> Herodotus writes that the Auchatae tribe descended from Lipoxais, the Catiari and Traspians from Arpoxais, and the Paralatae (Royal Scythians) from Colaxais, who was the youngest brother.<ref name=\"Herodotus_4.5\">{{harvnb|Herodotus|1910}}, [[:Wikisource:The History of Herodotus (Rawlinson)/Book 4|4.5-4.7]]</ref> According to Herodotus the Royal Scythians were the largest and most powerful Scythian tribe, and looked \"upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves.\"<ref name=\"Herodotus_4.20\">{{harvnb|Herodotus|1910}}, [[:Wikisource:The History of Herodotus (Rawlinson)/Book 4|4.20]]</ref>\n\nAlthough scholars have traditionally treated the three tribes as geographically distinct, [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] interpreted the divine gifts as the symbols of social occupations, illustrating his [[trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional vision]] of early [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] societies: the plough and yoke symbolised the farmers, the axe \u2013 the warriors, the bowl \u2013 the priests. The first scholar to compare the three strata of Scythian society to the Indian [[caste]]s was [[Arthur Christensen]]. According to Dum\u00e9zil, \"the fruitless attempts of Arpoxais and Lipoxais, in contrast to the success of Colaxais, may explain why the highest strata was not that of farmers or magicians, but rather that of warriors.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Belier|1991|p=69}}</ref>\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Scythians shooting with bows Kertch antique Panticapeum Ukrainia 4th century BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Scythian archers shooting with the [[Composite bow|Scythian bow]], [[Kerch]] (ancient [[Panticapeum]]), [[Crimea]], 4th century BC.

With great mobility, the Scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry, just retreating into the steppes. Such tactics wore down their enemies, making them easier to defeat. The Scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors. Ruled by small numbers of closely allied elites, Scythians had a reputation for their [[Archery|archers]], and many gained employment as [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Scythian elites had [[kurgan]] tombs: high barrows heaped over chamber-tombs of [[larch]] wood, a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life-renewal, for it stands bare in winter.\n\nThe [[Ziwiye hoard]], a treasure of gold and silver metalwork and ivory found near the town of [[Sakiz]] south of [[Lake Urmia]] and dated to between 680 and 625 BC, includes objects with Scythian \"[[animal style]]\" features. One silver dish from this find bears some inscriptions, as yet undeciphered and so possibly representing a form of Scythian writing.\n\nScythians also had a reputation for the use of barbed and poisoned arrows of several types, for a [[nomadic]] life centred on horses \u2013 \"fed from horse-blood\" according to Herodotus \u2013 and for skill in [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSome Scythian-Sarmatian cultures may have given rise to Greek stories of [[Amazons]]. Graves of armed females have been found in southern Ukraine and Russia. [[David W. Anthony|David Anthony]] notes, \"About 20% of Scythian-Sarmatian 'warrior graves' on the lower Don and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were men, a style that may have inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\"<ref name=\"Anthony_329\">{{harvnb|Anthony|2010|p=329}}</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Scythian Warriors.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Scythian warriors, drawn after figures on an [[electrum]] cup from the [[Kul-Oba]] [[kurgan]] burial near [[Kerch]], Crimea.

The shield of the central figure may be made of plain leather over a wooden or wicker base. ([[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg)]]\nAccording to Herodotus, Scythian costume consisted of padded and quilted leather trousers tucked into boots, and open tunics. They rode without [[stirrups]] or saddles, using only saddle-cloths. Herodotus reports that Scythians used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], both to weave their clothing and to cleanse themselves in its smoke (Hist. 4.73\u201375); archaeology has confirmed the use of cannabis in funerary rituals. Men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear \u2013 either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap.\n\nWomen wore a variety of different headdresses, some conical in shape others more like flattened cylinders, also adorned with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nScythian women wore long, loose robes, ornamented with metal plaques (gold). Women wore shawls, often richly decorated with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nBased on numerous archeological findings in Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan, men and warrior women wore long sleeve tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts.\n\nMen and women wore long trousers, often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt appliqu\u00e9s; trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area. Materials used depended on the wealth, climate, and necessity.\n\nMen and women warriors wore variations of long and shorter boots, wool-leather-felt gaiter-boots, and moccasin-like shoes. They were either of a laced or simple slip on type.\nWomen wore also soft shoes with metal (gold) plaques.\n\nMen and women wore belts. Warrior belts were made of leather, often with gold or other metal adornments and had many attached leather thongs for fastening of the owner's [[gorytos]], sword, whet stone, whip etc. Belts were fastened with metal or horn [[belt hook|belt-hooks]], leather thongs, and metal (often golden) or horn belt-plates.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Scythian religion}}\n[[Scythian religion]] was a type of [[Ancient Iranian religion|Pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion]] and differed from the post-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Iranian thoughts.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\">{{harvnb|Harmatta|1996|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> The Scythian belief was a more archaic stage than the Zoroastrian and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] systems. The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nOur most important literary source on Scythian religion is Herodotus. According to him the leading deity in the Scythian pantheon was [[Tabiti]], whom he compared to the Greek god [[Hestia]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Tabiti was eventually replaced by [[Atar]], the fire-pantheon of Iranian tribes, and [[Agni]], the fire deity of [[Indo-Aryans]].<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>  Other deities mentioned by Herodotus include Papaios, Api, Goitosyros/Oitosyros, Argimpasa, and Thagimasadas, whom he identified with [[Zeus]], [[Gaia]], [[Apollo]], [[Aphrodite]], and [[Poseidon]] respectively. The Scythians are also said by Herodotus to have worshipped equivalents of [[Heracles]] and [[Ares]], but he does not mention their Scythian names.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> An additional Scythian deity, the goddess Dithagoia, is mentioned in the a dedication by Senamotis, daughter of King Skiluros, at Panticapaeum. Most of the names of Scythian deities can be traced back to Iranian roots.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nHerodotus states that Thagimasadas was worshipped by the Royal Scythians only, while the remaining deities were worshipped by all. He also states that \"Ares\", the god of war, was the only god to whom the Scythians dedicated statues, altars or temples. [[Tumuli]] were erected to him in every Scythian district, and both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices were performed in honor of him. At least one shrine to \"Ares\" has been discovered by archaeologists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Scythians had professional priests, but it is not known is they constituted a heridetary class. Among the priests there was a separate group, the [[Enarei]], who worshipped the goddess [[Argimpasa]] and assumed feminine identities.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the \"First Man\", who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings. Similar myths are common among other Iranian peoples. Considerable importance was given to the division of Scythian society into three hereditary classes, which consisted of warriors, priests, and producers. Kings were considered part of the warrior class. Royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> The Iranian principle of royal charisma, known as [[khvarenah]] in the [[Avesta]], played a prominent role in Scythian society. It is probable that the Scythians had a number of epic legends, which were possibly the source for Herodotus writings on them.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Traces of these epics can be found in the epics of the Ossetians of the present day.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nIn Scythian cosmology the world was divided into three parts, with the warriors, considered part of the upper world, the priests of the middle level, and the producers of the lower one.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Scythian art}}\n[[File:Placca pantera, da regione di krasnodar, kurgan chertomlyk, oro a sbalzo e cesellato, fine VII sec ac..JPG|thumb|Gold plaque with panther, probably for a shield or breast-plate, 13 in/33 cm long, end 7th-century BC]]\n[[File:Scythian comb.jpg|thumb|Scythian comb from [[Solokha]], early 4th century BC]]\nThe art of the Scythians and related peoples of the Scythian cultures is known as [[Scythian art]]. It is particularly characterized by its use of the [[animal style]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style appears in an already established form Eastern Europe in the 8th century BC along with the Early Scythian archaeological culture itself. It bears little resemblance to the art of pre-Scythian cultures of the area. Some scholars suggest the art style developed under Near Eastern influence during the military campaigns of the 7th century BC, but the more common theory is that it developed on the eastern part of the Eurasian Steppe under Chinese influence. Others have sought to reconcile the two theories, suggesting that the animal style of the west and eastern parts of the steppe developed independently of each other, under Near Eastern and Chinese influences respectively. Regardless, the animal style art of the Scythians differs considerable from that of peoples living further east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style works are typically divided into birds, ungulates, and beasts of prey. This probably reflects the tripatriate division of the Scythian cosmos, with birds belonging to the upper level, ungulates to the middle level, and beasts of prey in the lower level.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImages of mythological creatures such a [[griffin]]s are not uncommon in Scythian animal style, but these are probably the result of Near Eastern influences. By the late 6th century, as Scythian activity in the Near East was reduced, depictions of mythological creatures largely disappears from Scythian art. It however reappears again in the 4th century BC as a result of Greek influence.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Anthropomorphic]] depictions in Early Scythian art is known only from [[kurgan stelae]]. These depict warriors with almond-shaped eyes and mustaches, often including weapons and other military equipment.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nSince the 5th century BC, Scythian art changed considerably. This was probably a result of Greek and Persian influence, and possibly also internal developments caused by an arrival of a new nomadic people from the east. The changes are notable in the more realistic depictions of animals, who are now often depicted fighting each other rather than being depicted individually. Kurgan stelae of the time also display traces of Greek influences, with warriors being depicted with rounder eyes and full beards.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe 4th century BC show additional Greek influence. While animal style was still in use, it appears that much Scythian art by this point was being made by Greek craftsmen on behalf of Scythians. Such objects are frequently found in royal Scythian burials of the period. Depictions of human beings become more prevalent. Many objects of Scythian art made by Greeks are probably illustrations of Scythian legends. Several objects are believed to have been of religious significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBy the late 3rd century BC, original Scythian art disappears through ongoing Hellenization. The creation of anthropomorphic gravestones continued however.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nWorks of Scythian art are held at many museums and has been featured at many exhibitions. The largest collections of Scythian art are found at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and the Museum of Historical Treasures of the Ukraine in [[Kiev]], while smaller collections are found at the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] of [[Oxford]], and the [[Louvre]] of [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> \n\n=== Gender ===\nThe idea of gender was [[Gender-fluid|fluid]] in the Scythian culture.

He continues by saying that the women would remain virgins until they could kill three of their enemies. Pseudo-Hippocrates also says that young girls would have their right [[breast]] [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to stop it from developing; this would help give the young warrior enhanced strength as an archer. Herodotus called these women Amazons (meaning \"without a breast,\" in Greek). Women had a prominent role in hunting and in battle, according to Herodotus. He also says that women would sometimes [[Cross-dressing|dress like men]]. According to Barry Cunliffe, these accounts confirm each other and they are partially supported by archaeological evidence. In the old Sarmatian territory, one fifth of the warrior burials, dating to the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, are female; and a fifth of female graves contain weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218\u201320; 123|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Men ====\n{{Main|Enaree}}\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that some Scythian men were [[Eunuch|eunuchs]], spoke like women, performed female work, and wore female attire.

He said that gender transfer was more common among the rich and elite. Herodotus also noted the effeminacy of some Scythian men.

According to Chiasson, Herodotus' portrayal of the Enaree is much more accurate than Pseudo-Hippocrates' portrayal of them as aristocrats. Chiasson suggests that the reason for Pseudo-Hippocrates' view of the Scythians is because of his theory of [[climatic determinism]], where the climate affects both the physical and psychological characteristics of people. For example, he claims that the variation of Europe's climate made Europeans more courageous, fiercer, and more warlike than Asians. Pseudo-Hippocrates says that the cold and moist climate that the Scythians lived in robbed them of their desire for sex and that their nomadic lifestyle robbed them of the strength for sex\u2009\u2014\u2009the nomadic lifestyle entails excessive horse riding and too much trouser wearing, which, according to Pseudo-Hippocrates, robs men of the strength to have sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiasson|first=Charles|date=2001|title=Scythian Androgyny and Environmental Determinism in Herodotus and the Hippocratic \u03c0\u03f5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03f5\u0301\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03b4\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u00f3\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd|journal=Syllecta Classica|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=33\u201373|doi=10.1353/syl.2001.0007|issn=2160-5157}}</ref> The scholar and archaeologist [[Ellis Minns]] said that Pseudo-Hippocrates may have been correct in asserting that constant horse riding caused the phenomenon.

She says that it is one of the elements of the [[Shamanism|shamanic]] complex.

Some writers claim that Scythians figured in the formation of the empire of the [[Medes]] and likewise of [[Caucasian Albania]].\n\nThe Scythians also feature in some national origin-legends of the Celts. In the second paragraph of the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], the \u00e9lite of [[Scotland]] claim Scythia as a former homeland of the [[Scottish people|Scots]]. According to the 11th-century [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]] (''The Book of the Taking of [[Ireland]]''), the 14th-century [[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]] and other [[Irish folklore]], the [[Irish people|Irish]] originated in Scythia and were descendants of [[F\u00e9nius Farsaid]], a Scythian prince who created the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n\nThe [[Carolingian]] kings of the [[Franks]] traced [[Merovingian]] ancestry to the Germanic tribe of the [[Sicambri]]. [[Gregory of Tours]] documents in his ''History of the Franks'' that when [[Clovis I|Clovis]] was baptised, he was referred to as a Sicamber with the words \"Mitis depone colla, Sicamber, adora quod incendisti, incendi quod adorasti.\" The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] in turn reveals that the Franks believed the Sicambri to be a tribe of Scythian or Cimmerian descent, who had changed their name to [[Franks]] in honour of their chieftain Franco in 11 BC.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, foreigners regarded the [[Russians]] as descendants of Scythians. It became conventional to refer to Russians as Scythians in 18th-century poetry, and [[Alexander Blok]] drew on this tradition sarcastically in his last major poem, ''The Scythians'' (1920). In the 19th century, romantic revisionists in the West transformed the \"[[barbarian]]\" Scyths of literature into the wild and free, hardy and democratic ancestors of all blond [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].\n\nBased on such accounts of Scythian founders of certain Germanic as well as Celtic tribes, British historiography in the [[British Empire]] period such as [[Sharon Turner]] in his ''[[History of the Anglo-Saxons]]'', made them the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]].\n\n==Related ancient peoples==\nHerodotus and other classical historians listed quite a number of tribes who lived near the Scythians, and presumably shared the same general milieu and nomadic steppe culture, often called \"Scythian culture\", even though scholars may have difficulties in determining their exact relationship to the \"linguistic Scythians\". A partial list of these tribes includes the [[Agathyrsi]], [[Geloni]], [[Budini]], and [[Neuri]].\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Abii]]\n* [[Agathyrsi]]\n* [[Amardi]]\n* [[Amyrgians]]\n* [[Androphagi]]\n* [[Budini]]\n* [[Dahae]]\n** [[Parni]] (ancestors of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]])\n* [[Gelonians]]\n* [[Hamaxobii]]\n* [[Huns]]\n* [[Indo-Scythians]]\n** [[Apracharajas]]\n** [[Kambojas]]\n* [[Massagetae]]\n** [[Apasiacae]]\n* [[Melanchlaeni]]\n* [[Orthocorybantians]]\n* [[Saka]]\n* [[Sindi people|Sindi]]\n* [[Spali]]\n* [[Tapur tribe|Tapur]]\n* [[Tauri]]\n* [[Thyssagetae]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Scythia]]\n* [[Scythian art]]\n* [[Scythian languages]]\n* [[Eurasian nomads]]\n* [[Nomadic empire]]\n* [[List of rulers of the pre-Achaemenid kingdoms of Iran#Scythian kingdom, c. 700\u2013c. 530 BC|Pre-Achaemenid Scythian kings of Iran]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Early sources===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite book |last=Callimachus |author-link=Callimachus |translator-last1=Mair |translator-first1=A.

Targitaus allegedly lived a thousand years before the failed Persian invasion of [[Scythia]], or around 1500 BC. He had three sons, before whom fell from the sky a set of four golden implements \u2013 a plough, a yoke, a cup, and a battle-axe. Only the youngest son succeeded in touching the golden implements without them bursting with fire, and this son's descendants, called by Herodotus the \"Royal Scythians\", continued to guard them.\n# Secondly (4.8), a legend told by the [[Pontic Greeks]] featuring Scythes, the first king of the Scythians, as a child of [[Hercules]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]].\n# Thirdly (4.11), in the version which Herodotus said he believed most, the Scythians came from a more southern part of [[Central Asia]], until a war with the Massagetae (a powerful tribe of steppe nomads who lived just northeast of [[Persia]]) forced them westward.\n# Finally (4.13), a legend which Herodotus attributed to the Greek bard [[Aristeas]], who claimed to have got himself into such a Bacchanalian fury that he ran all the way northeast across Scythia and further. According to this, the Scythians originally lived south of the [[Urals|Rhipaean mountains]], until they got into a conflict with a tribe called the [[Issedones]], pressed in their turn by the \"one-eyed [[Arimaspi]]ans\"; and so the Scythians decided to migrate westwards.\n\nAccounts by Herodotus of Scythian origins has been discounted recently; although his accounts of Scythian raiding activities contemporary to his writings have been deemed more reliable.<ref>{{harvnb|Drews|2004|p=92}} \"Ever since critical history began, scholars have recognized that much of what Herodotos gives us is silly.\"</ref>\n\n====Archaeological evidence====\n[[File:Scythian cultures.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Distribution of the [[Scythian cultures]], of which the Scythians were part]]\nModern interpretation of historical, archaeological, and anthropological evidence has proposed two broad hypotheses on Scythian origins.<ref name=\"M_51\"/>\n\nThe first hypothesis, formerly more espoused by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and then [[Russia]]n researchers, roughly followed Herodotus' (third) account, holding that the Scythians were an [[Eastern Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian]]-speaking group who arrived from [[Inner Asia]], i.e. from the area of [[Turkestan]] and western Siberia.\n<ref name=\"M_51\">{{harvnb|Mallory|1991|pp=51\u201353}}</ref>\n\nThe second hypothesis, according to [[Roman Ghirshman]] and others, proposes that the Scythian cultural complex emerged from local groups of the [[Srubna culture]] at the Black Sea coast,<ref name=\"M_51\"/> although this is also associated with the Cimmerians.

He classes the Cimmerians as a distinct [[autochthon (person)|autochthonous]] tribe, expelled by the Scythians from the northern Black Sea coast (''Hist.'' 4.11\u201312).

Madius subsequently subjugated the [[Median Empire]]. During this time, Herodotus notes that the Scythians raided and exacted tribute from \"the whole of Asia\". In the 620s, [[Cyaxares]], leader of the [[Medes]], treacherously killed a large number of Scythian chieftains at a feast; the Scythians were subsequently driven back to the steppe. In 612 BC, the Medes and Scythians participated in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire with the [[Battle of Nineveh (612 BC)|Battle of Nineveh]].

Relations between the Greeks and the Scythians appear to have been peaceful, with the Scythians being substantially influenced by the Greeks, although the city of the [[Panticapaeum]] might have been destroyed by the Scythians in the mid century BC.

Suffering heavy losses, the Persians reached as far as the [[Sea of Azov]], until Darius was compelled to enter into negotiations with Idanthyrsus, which however broke down.

The border between the Scythians and the Odrysian kingdom was thereafter set at the Danube, and relations between the two dynasties were good, with dynastic marriages frequently occurring.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> The Scythians also expanded towards the north-west, where they destroyed numerous fortified settlements and probably subjucated numerous settled populations. A similar fate was suffered by the Greek cities of the northwestern Black Sea coast and parts of the Crimea, over which the Scythians established political control.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Greek settlements along the [[Don River]] also came under the control of the Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nA division of responsibility developed, with the Scythians holding the political and military power, the urban population carrying out trade, and the local sedentary population carrying out manual labor.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their territories grew grain, and shipped wheat, flocks, and cheese to Greece. The Scythians apparently obtained much of their wealth from their control over the [[slave trade]] from the north to Greece through the Greek [[Black Sea]] [[apoikia|colonial ports]] of [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]], [[Cimmerian Bosporus]], and [[Gorgippia]].\n\nWhen Herodotus wrote his ''Histories'' in the 5th century BC, Greeks distinguished [[Scythia Minor]], in present-day [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]], from a [[Scythia|Greater Scythia]] that extended eastwards for a 20-day ride from the Danube River, across the [[steppe]]s of today's East Ukraine to the lower [[Don River, Russia|Don]] basin.\n\nScythian offensives against the Greek colonies of the northeastern Black Sea coast were largely unsuccessful, as the Greeks united under the leadership of the city of Panticapaeum and put up a vigorous defence. These Greek cities developed into the [[Bosporan Kingdom]]. Meanwhile, several Greek colonies formerly under Scythian control began to reassert their independence. It is possible that the Scythians were suffering from internal troubles during this time.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the mid 4th century BC, the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to the east of the Scythians, began expanding into Scythian territory.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/>\n\n[[Image:Skiluros.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Scythian king [[Skilurus]], relief from [[Scythian Neapolis]], Crimea, 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC]]\n\nThe 4th century BC was a flowering of Scythian culture. The Scythian king [[Ateas]] managed to unite under his power the Scythian tribes living between the [[Maeotian Swamp|Maeotian marshes]] and the Danube, while simultaneously enroaching upon the Thracians.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> He conquered territories along the Danube as far the [[Sava]] river and established a trade route from the Black Sea to the [[Adriatic]], which enabled a flourishing of trade in the Scythian kingdom. The westward expansion of Ateas brought him into conflict with [[Philip II of Macedon]] (reigned 359 to 336 BC), with whom he had previously been allied,<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> who took military action against the Scythians in 339 BC. Ateas died in battle, and his empire disintegrated.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/> Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], continued the conflict with the Scythians. In 331 BC, his general [[Zopyrion]] invaded Scythian territory with a force of 30,000 men, but was routed and killed by the Scythians near Olbia.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the aftermath of conflict between Macedon and the Scythians, the [[Celts]] seem to have displaced the Scythians from the [[Balkans]]; while in south Russia, a kindred tribe, the Sarmatians, gradually overwhelmed them. In 310-309 BC, as noted by [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Scythians, in alliance with the Bosporan Kingdom, defeated the [[Siraces]] in a [[Battle of the River Thatis|great battle]] at the river Thatis.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/>\n\nBy the early 3rd century BC, the Scythian culture of the Pontic steppe suddenly disappears. The reasons for this are controversial, but the expansion of the Sarmatians certainly played a role. The Scythians in turn shifted their focus towards the Greek cities of the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Roman Empire 125 (cropped).png|thumb|right|The territory of the Scythae Basilaei (\"Royal Scyths\") along the north shore of the [[Black Sea]] around 125 AD.]]\n\nBy ca. 200 BC, the Scythians had largely withdrawn into the [[Crimea]]. By the time of Strabo's account (the first decades AD), the Crimean Scythians had created a new kingdom extending from the lower Dnieper to the Crimea, centered at [[Scythian Neapolis]] near modern [[Simferopol]]. They had become more settled and were intermingling with the local populations, in particular the [[Tauri]], and were also subjected to [[Hellenization]]. They maintained close relations with the Bosporan Kingdom, with whose dynasty they were linked by marriage. A separate Scythian territory, known as Scythia Minor, existed in modern-day [[Dobruja]], but was of little significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, the Scythian kings [[Skilurus]] and [[Palakus]] sought to exent their control over the Greek cities of north of the Black Sea. The Greek cities of Chersonesus and Olbia in turn requested the aid [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates the Great]], king of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], whose general [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]] defeated their armies in battle, took their capital and annexed their territory to the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Cernenko_3\"/><ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/><ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> After this time, the Scythians practically disappeared from history.<ref name=\"Cernenko_29\"/> Scythia Minor was also defeated by Mithradates.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn the years after the death of Mithradates, the Scythians had transitioned to a settled way of life and were assimilating into neighboring populations. They made a resurgence in the 1st century AD and laid siege to Chersonesos, who were obliged to seek help from the [[Roman Empire]]. The Scythians were in turn defeated by Roman commander [[Tiberius Plautius Silvanus Aelianus]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> By the 2nd century AD, archaeological evidence show that the Scythians had been largely assimilated by the Sarmatians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Their capital city, Scythian Neapolis, was destroyed by the invading [[Goths]] in the mid-3rd century AD.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Avar\u00e1rok.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Scythian defence line 339 BC reconstruction in [[Polg\u00e1r, Hungary]] ]]\nArchaeological remains of the Scythians include [[kurgans|kurgan]] tombs (ranging from simple exemplars to elaborate \"Royal kurgans\" containing the \"Scythian triad\" of weapons, horse-harness, and Scythian-style wild-animal art), [[gold]], [[silk]], and animal sacrifices, in places also with suspected [[human sacrifice]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1991|pp=64\u201365, 118}}</ref> [[Mummification]] techniques and [[permafrost]] have aided in the relative preservation of some remains.

The date of this transition is disputed among archaeologists. Dates ranging from the mid-8th century to the late 7th century BC have been proposed. A transition in the late 8th century has gained the most scholarly support. The origins of the Early Scythian culture is controversial. Many of its elements are of Central Asian origin, but the culture appears to have reached its ultimate form on the Pontic steppe, partially through the influence of [[North Caucasus|North Caucasian]] elements and to a smaller extent the influence of [[Near East]]ern elements.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe period in the 8th and 7th centuries BC when the Cimmerians and Scythians raided the Near East are ascribed to the later stages of the Early Scythian culture. Examples of Early Scythian burials in the Near East include those of [[:de:Nor\u015funtepe|Nor\u015funtepe]] and [[\u0130mirler, G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhac\u0131k\u00f6y|\u0130mirler]]. Objects of Early Scythian type have been found in [[Urartu|Urartian]] fortresses such as [[Teishebaini]], [[Bastam Citadel|Bastam]], and Ayanis-kale. Near Eastern influences are probably explained through objects made by Near Eastern craftsmen on behalf of Scythian chieftains.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:throne arm.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|An arm from the throne of a Scythian king, 7th century BC. Found at the Kelermess [[kurgan]] (burial mound), [[Krasnodar Krai]] in 1905. On exhibit at the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]\n\nEarly Scythian culture is known primarily from its funerary sites, because the Scythians at this time were nomads without permanent settlements. The most important sites are located in the northwestern parts of Scythian territories in the forest steppes of the Dnieper, and the southeastern parts of Scythian territories in the North Caucasus. At this time it was common for the Scythians to be buried in the edges of their territories. Early Scythian sites are characterized by similar artifacts with minor local variations.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Kurgan]]s from the Early Scythian culture have been discovered in the North Caucasus. Some if these are characterized by great wealth, and probably belonged royals of aristocrats. They contain not only the deceased, but also horses and even chariots. The burial rituals carried out in these [[kurgan]]s correspond closely with those described by Herodotus. The greatest kurgans from the Early Scythian culture in the North Caucasus are found at [[:ru:\u041a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Kelermesskaya]], Novozavedennoe II ([[:ru:\u0423\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u044b|Ulsky Kurgans]]) and [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]]. One kurgan at Ulsky was found measured at 15 meters in height and contained more than 400 horses. Kurgans from the 7th century BC, when the Scythians were raiding the Near East, typically contain objects of Near Eastern origin. Kurgans from the late 7th century however, contain few Middle Eastern objects, but rather objects of Greek origin, pointing to increased contacts between the Scythians and Greek colonists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been found in the forest steppes of the Dnieper. The most important of these finds is the [[:uk:\u041c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0443\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Melgunov Kurgan]]. This kurgan contains several objects of Near Eastern origin so similar to those found at the kurgan in Kelermesskaya that they were probably made in the same workshop. Most of Early Scythian sites in this area are situated along the banks of the Dnieper and its tributiaries. The funerary rites of these sites are similar but not identical to those of the kurgans in the North Caucasus.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImportant Early Scythian sites have also been discovered in the areas separating the North Caucasus and the forest steppes. These include the Krivorozhski\u012d kurgan on the eastern banks of the [[Donets]], and the Temir-gora kurgan in the Crimea. Both date to the 7th century BC and contain Greek imports. The Krivorozhski\u012d also display Near Eastern influences.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[File:Placa en forma de c\u00e9rvol tombat, trobada al t\u00famul de Kostromskoy a Kuban, segle VII aC.JPG|upright=1.15|thumb|The famous gold stag of [[Kostromskaya (rural locality)|Kostromskaya]], Russia]]\n\nApart from funerary sites, numerous settlements from the Early Scythian period have been discovered. Most of these settlements are located in the forest steppe zone and are non-fortified. The most important of these sites in the Dnieper area are [[Trakhtemyriv|Trakhtemirovo]], [[:uk:\u041c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Motroninskoe]], and Pastyrskoe. East of these, at the banks of the [[Vorskla River]], a tributiary of the Dnieper, lies the [[Bilsk, Kotelva Raion|Bilsk]] settlement. Occupying an area of 4,400 hectares with an outer rampart at over 30&nbsp;km, Bilsk is the largest settlement in the forest steppe zone.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> It has been tentatively identified by a team of archaeologists led by [[Boris Shramko]] as the site of [[Gelonus]], the purported capital of Scythia.\n\nAnother important large settlement can be found at [[Myriv]]. Dating from the 7th and 6th centuries BC, Myriv contains a significant amount of imported Greek objects, testifying to lively contacts with [[Borysthenes]], the first Greek colony established on the Pontic steppe (ca. 625 BC). Within the ramparts in these settlements there were areas without buildings, which where probably occupied by nomadic Scythians seasonally visiting the sites.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Early Scythian culture came to an end in the latter part of the 6th century BC.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Classical Scythian===\n[[File:Scythian capital and royal kurgans.png|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Distribution of Scythian kurgans and other sites along the [[Dnieper Rapids]] during the Classical Scythian period]]\nBy the end of the 6th century BC, a new period begins in the material culture of the Scythians. Certain scholars consider this a new stage in the Scythian culture, while others consider it an entirely new archaeological culture. It is possible that this new culture arose through the settlement of a new wave of nomads from the east, who intermingled with the local Scythians. The Classical Scythian period saw major changes in Scythian material culture, both with regards to weapons and art style. This was largely through Greek influence. Other elements had probably been brought from the east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nLike in Early Scythian culture, the Classical Scythian culture is primarily represented through funerary sites. The area of distribution of these sites has however changed. Most of them, including the richest, are located on the Pontic steppe, in particular the area around the [[Dnieper Rapids]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nAt the end of the 6th century BC, new funerary rites appeared, characterized by more complex kurgans. This new style was rapidly adopted throughout Scythian territory. Like before, elite burials usually contained horses. A buried king was usually accompanied with multiple people from his entourage. Burials containing both males and females are quite common both in elite burials and in the burials of the common people.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important Scythian kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture in the 6th and 5th centuries BC are Ostraya Tomakovskaya Mogila, Zavadskaya Mogila 1, Novogrigor\u2019evka 5, Baby and Raskopana Mogila in the Dnieper Rapids, and the Zolotoi and Kulakovski\u012d kurgans in the Crimea.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe greatest, so-called \"royal\" kurgans of the Classical Scythian culture are dated to the 4th century BC. These include [[Solokha]], [[:uk:\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430|Bol\u2019shaya Cymbalka]], [[:ru:\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043b\u044b\u043a (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Chertomlyk]], [[:uk:\u041e\u0433\u0443\u0437 (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Oguz]], [[:ru:\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d|Alexandropol]], and [[:uk:\u041a\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043b (\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0430)|Kozel]].

These include several unusually rich burials such as [[Kul-Oba]] (near [[Panticapaeum]] in the Crimea) and the necropolis of [[Nymphaion (Crimea)|Nymphaion]]. The sites probably represent Scythian aristocrats who had close ties, if not family ties, with the elite of Nymphaion and aristocrats, perhaps even royals, of the Bosporan Kingdom.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nIn total, more than 3,000 Scythian funerary sites from the 4th century BC have been discovered on the Pontic steppe. This number far exceeds the number of all funerary sites from previous centuries.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from funerary sites, remains of Scythian cities from this period have been discovered. These include both continuations from the Early Scythian period and newly founded settlements.

It was a fortified settlement occupying an area of 12 square km. The chief occupation of its inhabitants appears to have been metalworking, and the city was probably an important supplier of metalwork for the nomadic Scythians. Part of the population was probably composed of agriculturalists. It is likely that Kamenskoe also served as a political center in Scythia. A significant part of Kamenskoe was not built up, perhaps to set it aside for the Scythian king and his entourage during their seasonal visits to the city.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> [[J\u00e1nos Harmatta]] suggests that Kamenskoe served as a residence for the Scythian king Ateas.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nBy the 4th century it appears that some of the Scythians were adopting an agricultural way of life similar to the peoples of the forest steppes. As result, a number of fortified and non-fortified settlements spring up in the areas of the lower Dnieper.

This area was at the time mostly settled by Scythians.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nArchaeologically the Late Scythian culture has little in common with its predecessors. It represents a fusion of Scythian traditions with those of the Greek colonists and the [[Tauri]], who inhabited the mountains of the Crimea. The population of the Late Scythian culture was mainly settled, and were engaged in stockbreeding and agriculture. They were also important traders, serving as intermediaries between the [[classical world]] and the [[barbarian]] world.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nRecent excavations at [[:ru:\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe]] implies that this site was the political center of the Scythians in the 3rd century BC and the early part of the 2nd century BC. It was a well protected fortress constructed in accordance with Greek principles.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe most important site of the Late Crimean culture is Scythian Neaoplis, which was located in Crimea and served as the capital of the Late Scythian kingdom from the early 2nd century BC to the beginning of the 3rd century AD. Scythian Neapolis was largely constructed in accordance with Greek principles. Its royal palace was destroyed by [[Diophantus (general)|Diophantus]], a general of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] king [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]], at the end of the 2nd century BC, and was not rebuilt. The city nevertheless continued to exist as a major urban center. It underwent significant change from the 1st century to the 2nd century AD, eventually being left with virtually no buildings except from its fortifications. New funerary rites and material features also appear. It is probable that these changes represent the assimilation of the Scythians by the Sarmatians. A certain continuity is however observable. From the end of the 2nd century to the middle of the 3rd century AD, Scythian Neapolis transforms into a non-fortified settlement containing only a few buildings.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nApart from Scythian Neapolis and Ak-Kaya/Vishennoe, more than 100 fortified and non-fortified settlements from the Late Scythian culture have been discovered. They are often accompanied by a necropolis. Late Scythian sites are mostly found in areas around the foothills of the Crimean mountains and along the western coast of the Crimea. Some of these settlements had earlier been Greek settlements, such as [[Kalos Limen]] and [[Kerkinitis]]. Many of these coastal settlements served as trading ports.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe largest Scythian settlements after Neapolis and Ak-Kaya-Vishennoe were [[:ru:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d\u043e (\u041a\u0440\u044b\u043c)|Bulganak]], [[:ru:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u044c-\u0410\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435|Ust-Alma]], and [[:ru:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u041a\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d-\u041a\u044b\u0440|Kermen-Kyr]]. Like Neapolis and Ak-Kaya, these are characterized by a combination of Greek architectural principles and local ones.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nA unique group of Late Scythian settlements were city-states located on the banks of the Lower Dnieper. The material culture of these settlements was even more Hellenized than those on the Crimea, and they were probably closely connected to Olbia, if not dependent it.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBurials of the Late Scythian culture can be divided into two kurgans and necropolises, with necropolises becoming more and more common as time progresses. The largest such necropolis has been found at Ust-Alma.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBecause of close similarities between the material culture of the Late Scythians and that of neighboring Greek cities, many scholars have suggested that Late Scythian cites, particularly those of the Lower Dnieper, were populated at last partly by Greeks. Influences of Sarmatian elements and the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] have been pointed out.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Late Scythian culture ends in the 3rd century AD.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n==Culture and society==\n[[File:\u0421\u043a\u0456\u0444\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0425\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0456. \u041a\u0430\u043c'\u044f\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0430 \u0437 \u0417\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0457 \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0438 (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Kurgan stelae]] of a Scythian at [[Khortytsia]], Ukraine]]\nSince the Scythians did not have a written language, their non-material culture can only be pieced together through writings by non-Scythian authors, parallels found among other Iranian peoples, and archaeological evidence.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Tribal divisions===\n{{See also|Trifunctional hypothesis}}\nScythians lived in [[Confederation|confederated]] tribes, a political form of voluntary association which regulated pastures and organised a common defence against encroaching neighbours for the pastoral tribes of mostly [[Domestication of the horse|equestrian]] herdsmen. While the productivity of domesticated animal-breeding greatly exceeded that of the settled agricultural societies, the pastoral economy also needed supplemental agricultural produce, and stable nomadic confederations developed either symbiotic or forced alliances with sedentary peoples \u2013 in exchange for animal produce and military protection.\n\nHerodotus relates that three main tribes of the Scythians descended from three sons of Targitaus: Lipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais. They called themselves Scoloti, after one of their kings.<ref>Traces of the Iranian root ''x\u0161aya'' \u2013 \"ruler\" \u2013 may persist in all three names.</ref> Herodotus writes that the Auchatae tribe descended from Lipoxais, the Catiari and Traspians from Arpoxais, and the Paralatae (Royal Scythians) from Colaxais, who was the youngest brother.<ref name=\"Herodotus_4.5\">{{harvnb|Herodotus|1910}}, [[:Wikisource:The History of Herodotus (Rawlinson)/Book 4|4.5-4.7]]</ref> According to Herodotus the Royal Scythians were the largest and powerful powerful Scythian tribe, and looked \"upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves.\"<ref name=\"Herodotus_4.20\">{{harvnb|Herodotus|1910}}, [[:Wikisource:The History of Herodotus (Rawlinson)/Book 4|4.20]]</ref>\n\nAlthough scholars have traditionally treated the three tribes as geographically distinct, [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]] interpreted the divine gifts as the symbols of social occupations, illustrating his [[trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional vision]] of early [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] societies: the plough and yoke symbolised the farmers, the axe \u2013 the warriors, the bowl \u2013 the priests. The first scholar to compare the three strata of Scythian society to the Indian [[caste]]s was [[Arthur Christensen]]. According to Dum\u00e9zil, \"the fruitless attempts of Arpoxais and Lipoxais, in contrast to the success of Colaxais, may explain why the highest strata was not that of farmers or magicians, but rather that of warriors.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Belier|1991|p=69}}</ref>\n\n===Warfare===\n[[File:Scythians shooting with bows Kertch antique Panticapeum Ukrainia 4th century BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Scythian archers shooting with the [[Composite bow|Scythian bow]], [[Kerch]] (ancient [[Panticapeum]]), [[Crimea]], 4th century BC.

When engaged at war, almost the entire adult population, including a large number of women, would participate in battle.<ref name=\"Cernenko_20\">{{harvnb|Chernenko|2012|p=20}}</ref> The Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] noted that no people in either Europe or Asia could resist the Scythians without outside aid.<ref name=\"Cernenko_20\"/>\n\nScythians were particularly known for their [[equestrianism|equestrian]] skills, and their early use of [[composite bow]]s shot from horseback. With great mobility, the Scythians could absorb the attacks of more cumbersome footsoldiers and cavalry, just retreating into the steppes. Such tactics wore down their enemies, making them easier to defeat. The Scythians were notoriously aggressive warriors. Ruled by small numbers of closely allied elites, Scythians had a reputation for their [[Archery|archers]], and many gained employment as [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Scythian elites had [[kurgan]] tombs: high barrows heaped over chamber-tombs of [[larch]] wood, a deciduous conifer that may have had special significance as a tree of life-renewal, for it stands bare in winter.\n\nThe [[Ziwiye hoard]], a treasure of gold and silver metalwork and ivory found near the town of [[Sakiz]] south of [[Lake Urmia]] and dated to between 680 and 625 BC, includes objects with Scythian \"[[animal style]]\" features. One silver dish from this find bears some inscriptions, as yet undeciphered and so possibly representing a form of Scythian writing.\n\nScythians also had a reputation for the use of barbed and poisoned arrows of several types, for a [[nomadic]] life centred on horses \u2013 \"fed from horse-blood\" according to Herodotus \u2013 and for skill in [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSome Scythian-Sarmatian cultures may have given rise to Greek stories of [[Amazons]]. Graves of armed females have been found in southern Ukraine and Russia. [[David W. Anthony|David Anthony]] notes, \"About 20% of Scythian-Sarmatian 'warrior graves' on the lower Don and lower Volga contained females dressed for battle as if they were men, a style that may have inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons.\"<ref name=\"Anthony_329\">{{harvnb|Anthony|2010|p=329}}</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Scythian Warriors.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Scythian warriors, drawn after figures on an [[electrum]] cup from the [[Kul-Oba]] [[kurgan]] burial near [[Kerch]], Crimea. The warrior on the right strings his bow, bracing it behind his knee; note the typical pointed hood, long jacket with fur or fleece trimming at the edges, decorated trousers, and short boots tied at the ankle. Scythians apparently wore their hair long and loose, and all adult men apparently bearded. The ''[[gorytos]]'' appears clearly on the left hip of the bare-headed spearman. The shield of the central figure may be made of plain leather over a wooden or wicker base. ([[Hermitage Museum]], St Petersburg)]]\nAccording to Herodotus, Scythian costume consisted of padded and quilted leather trousers tucked into boots, and open tunics. They rode without [[stirrups]] or saddles, using only saddle-cloths. Herodotus reports that Scythians used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], both to weave their clothing and to cleanse themselves in its smoke (Hist. 4.73\u201375); archaeology has confirmed the use of cannabis in funerary rituals. Men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear \u2013 either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap.\n\nWomen wore a variety of different headdresses, some conical in shape others more like flattened cylinders, also adorned with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nScythian women wore long, loose robes, ornamented with metal plaques (gold). Women wore shawls, often richly decorated with metal (golden) plaques.\n\nBased on numerous archeological findings in Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan, men and warrior women wore long sleeve tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts.\n\nMen and women wore long trousers, often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt appliqu\u00e9s; trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area. Materials used depended on the wealth, climate, and necessity.\n\nMen and women warriors wore variations of long and shorter boots, wool-leather-felt gaiter-boots, and moccasin-like shoes. They were either of a laced or simple slip on type.\nWomen wore also soft shoes with metal (gold) plaques.\n\nMen and women wore belts. Warrior belts were made of leather, often with gold or other metal adornments and had many attached leather thongs for fastening of the owner's [[gorytos]], sword, whet stone, whip etc. Belts were fastened with metal or horn [[belt hook|belt-hooks]], leather thongs, and metal (often golden) or horn belt-plates.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Scythian religion}}\n[[Scythian religion]] was a type of [[Ancient Iranian religion|Pre-Zoroastrian Iranian religion]] and differed from the post-[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] Iranian thoughts.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\">{{harvnb|Harmatta|1996|pp=181\u2013182}}</ref> The Scythian belief was a more archaic stage than the Zoroastrian and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] systems. The use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nOur most important literary source on Scythian religion is Herodotus. According to him the leading deity in the Scythian pantheon was [[Tabiti]], whom he compared to the Greek god [[Hestia]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Tabiti was eventually replaced by [[Atar]], the fire-pantheon of Iranian tribes, and [[Agni]], the fire deity of [[Indo-Aryans]].<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>  Other deities mentioned by Herodotus include Papaios, Api, Goitosyros/Oitosyros, Argimpasa, and Thagimasadas, whom he identified with [[Zeus]], [[Gaia]], [[Apollo]], [[Aphrodite]], and [[Poseidon]] respectively. The Scythians are also said by Herodotus to have worshipped equivalents of [[Heracles]] and [[Ares]], but he does not mention their Scythian names.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> An additional Scythian deity, the goddess Dithagoia, is mentioned in the a dedication by Senamotis, daughter of King Skiluros, at Panticapaeum. Most of the names of Scythian deities can be traced back to Iranian roots.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nHerodotus states that Thagimasadas was worshipped by the Royal Scythians only, while the remaining deities were worshipped by all. He also states that \"Ares\", the god of war, was the only god to whom the Scythians dedicated statues, altars or temples. [[Tumuli]] were erected to him in every Scythian district, and both animal sacrifices and human sacrifices were performed in honor of him. At least one shrine to \"Ares\" has been discovered by archaeologists.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe Scythians had professional priests, but it is not known is they constituted a heridetary class. Among the priests there was a separate group, the [[Enarei]], who worshipped the goddess [[Argimpasa]] and assumed feminine identities.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian mythology gave much importance to myth of the \"First Man\", who was considered the ancestor of them and their kings. Similar myths are common among other Iranian peoples. Considerable importance was given to the division of Scythian society into three hereditary classes, which consisted of warriors, priests, and producers. Kings were considered part of the warrior class. Royal power was considered holy and of solar and heavenly origin.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/> The Iranian principle of royal charisma, known as [[khvarenah]] in the [[Avesta]], played a prominent role in Scythian society. It is probable that the Scythians had a number of epic legends, which were possibly the source for Herodotus writings on them.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> Traces of these epics can be found in the epics of the Ossetians of the present day.<ref name=\"Harmatta_181\"/>\n\nIn Scythian cosmology the world was divided into three parts, with the warriors, considered part of the upper world, the priests of the middle level, and the producers of the lower one.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Scythian art}}\n[[File:Placca pantera, da regione di krasnodar, kurgan chertomlyk, oro a sbalzo e cesellato, fine VII sec ac..JPG|thumb|Gold plaque with panther, probably for a shield or breast-plate, 13 in/33 cm long, end 7th-century BC]]\n[[File:Scythian comb.jpg|thumb|Scythian comb from [[Solokha]], early 4th century BC]]\nThe art of the Scythians and related peoples of the Scythian cultures is known as [[Scythian art]]. It is particularly characterized by its use of the [[animal style]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style appears in an already established form Eastern Europe in the 8th century BC along with the Early Scythian archaeological culture itself. It bears little resemblance to the art of pre-Scythian cultures of the area. Some scholars suggest the art style developed under Near Eastern influence during the military campaigns of the 7th century BC, but the more common theory is that it developed on the eastern part of the Eurasian Steppe under Chinese influence. Others have sought to reconcile the two theories, suggesting that the animal style of the west and eastern parts of the steppe developed independently of each other, under Near Eastern and Chinese influences respectively. Regardless, the animal style art of the Scythians differs considerable from that of peoples living further east.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nScythian animal style works are typically divided into birds, ungulates, and beasts of prey. This probably reflects the tripatriate division of the Scythian cosmos, with birds belonging to the upper level, ungulates to the middle level, and beasts of prey in the lower level.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nImages of mythological creatures such a [[griffin]]s are not uncommon in Scythian animal style, but these are probably the result of Near Eastern influences. By the late 6th century, as Scythian activity in the Near East was reduced, depictions of mythological creatures largely disappears from Scythian art. It however reappears again in the 4th century BC as a result of Greek influence.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\n[[Anthropomorphic]] depictions in Early Scythian art is known only from [[kurgan stelae]]. These depict warriors with almond-shaped eyes and mustaches, often including weapons and other military equipment.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nSince the 5th century BC, Scythian art changed considerably. This was probably a result of Greek and Persian influence, and possibly also internal developments caused by an arrival of a new nomadic people from the east. The changes are notable in the more realistic depictions of animals, who are now often depicted fighting each other rather than being depicted individually. Kurgan stelae of the time also display traces of Greek influences, with warriors being depicted with rounder eyes and full beards.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nThe 4th century BC show additional Greek influence. While animal style was still in use, it appears that much Scythian art by this point was being made by Greek craftsmen on behalf of Scythians. Such objects are frequently found in royal Scythian burials of the period. Depictions of human beings become more prevalent. Many objects of Scythian art made by Greeks are probably illustrations of Scythian legends. Several objects are believed to have been of religious significance.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nBy the late 3rd century BC, original Scythian art disappears through ongoing Hellenization. The creation of anthropomorphic gravestones continued however.<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/>\n\nWorks of Scythian art are held at many museums and has been featured at many exhibitions. The largest collections of Scythian art are found at the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] and the Museum of Historical Treasures of the Ukraine in [[Kiev]], while smaller collections are found at the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] in [[Berlin]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]] of [[Oxford]], and the [[Louvre]] of [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Ivantchik\"/> \n\n=== Gender ===\nThe idea of gender was [[Gender-fluid|fluid]] in the Scythian culture. [[Barry Cunliffe]] says, \"[the idea] that gender boundaries were fluid among the Scythians is explicitly stated by various classical observers, most notably Herodotus and Pseudo-Hippocrates.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218; quote found in \"Further Reading\" section at the end of the book|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Women ====\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] (a people considered part of Scythian culture) women would ride on horseback; and they use a bow and throw [[Javelin|javelins]] from their horses. He continues by saying that the women would remain virgins until they could kill three of their enemies. Pseudo-Hippocrates also says that young girls would have their right [[breast]] [[Cauterization|cauterized]] to stop it from developing; this would help give the young warrior enhanced strength as an archer. Herodotus called these women Amazons (meaning \"without a breast,\" in Greek). Women had a prominent role in hunting and in battle, according to Herodotus. He also says that women would sometimes [[Cross-dressing|dress like men]]. According to Barry Cunliffe, these accounts confirm each other and they are partially supported by archaeological evidence. In the old Sarmatian territory, one fifth of the warrior burials, dating to the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, are female; and a fifth of female graves contain weapons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=218\u201320; 123|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Men ====\n{{Main|Enaree}}\nPseudo-Hippocrates says that some Scythian men were [[Eunuch|eunuchs]], spoke like women, performed female work, and wore female attire.

He said that gender transfer was more common among the rich and elite. Herodotus also noted the effeminacy of some Scythian men. Herodotus says that the gods inflicted this \"female sickness\" upon them because they destroyed the temple of Venus in Ascalon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scythians: Nomad Warriors of the Steppe|last=Cunliffe|first=Barry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882012-3|location=|pages=219\u201320|language=en}}</ref> \n\nMale Scythian burials in [[Siberia]], dating back to the second and third centuries BCE, containing female decorations and utensils have been discovered.

However, recent interpretations of the burial have suggested that \"the face is definitely masculine\" and that it is an Enaree.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=Timothy|title=The Prehistory of Sex: Four Million Years of Human Sexual Culture|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1997|isbn=978-0553375275|location=|pages=214}}</ref>\n\nCharles Chiasson has pointed out that Pseudo-Hippocrates tries to display the cross dressers as the ruling class (Anarieis), who are \"aristocratic poster-boys for the effeminacy that he posits as a characteristic national trait\"; and Herodotus tries to represent the cross dressers (the Enaree, as they are called by Herodotus) as a marginalized group in a masculine warrior society\u2009\u2014\u2009he describes the cross dressing as a sickness inflicted on them by a foreign deity, thereby making their belief in [[androgyny]] foreign. According to Chiasson, Herodotus' portrayal of the Enaree is much more accurate than Pseudo-Hippocrates' portrayal of them as aristocrats. Chiasson suggests that the reason for Pseudo-Hippocrates' view of the Scythians is because of his theory of [[climatic determinism]], where the climate affects both the physical and psychological characteristics of people. For example, he claims that the variation of Europe's climate made Europeans more courageous, fiercer, and more warlike than Asians. Pseudo-Hippocrates says that the cold and moist climate that the Scythians lived in robbed them of their desire for sex and that their nomadic lifestyle robbed them of the strength for sex\u2009\u2014\u2009the nomadic lifestyle entails excessive horse riding and too much trouser wearing, which, according to Pseudo-Hippocrates, robs men of the strength to have sex.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiasson|first=Charles|date=2001|title=Scythian Androgyny and Environmental Determinism in Herodotus and the Hippocratic \u03c0\u03f5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03f5\u0301\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03b4\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u00f3\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd|journal=Syllecta Classica|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=33\u201373|doi=10.1353/syl.2001.0007|issn=2160-5157}}</ref> The scholar and archaeologist [[Ellis Minns]] said that Pseudo-Hippocrates may have been correct in asserting that constant horse riding caused the phenomenon.

She says that it is one of the elements of the [[Shamanism|shamanic]] complex.

Sometimes they exceeded 6 ft 3 in (1.90 m) in height, and males even exceeding 6 ft 6 in (2 m) have been uncovered. The ordinary people whom they dominated were of much smaller stature, averaging 4\u20136 in. (10-15 cm) below them in height.

These physical characteristics affirm an Iranian origin.<ref name=\"Rolle_55\"/>\n\n==Genetics==\nIn 2017, a genetic study of various Scythian cultures, including the Scythians, was published in [[Nature Communications]]. The study suggested that the Scythians arose independently of culturally similar groups further east. Though all groups studies shared a common origin in the [[Yamnaya culture]], the presence of east Eurasian mitochondrial lineages was largely absent among Scythians, but present among other groups further east. Modern populations most closely related to the Scythians were found to be populations living in proximity to the sites studied, suggesting genetic continuity.<ref name=\"\u00dcnterlander\">{{cite journal |last1=Unterl\u00e4nder |first1=Martina |author-link1= |date=March 3, 2017 |orig-year= |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |editor1-link= |title=Ancestry and demography and descendants of Iron Age nomads of the Eurasian Steppe |trans-title= |department= |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |type= |series= |language= |edition= |publication-date= |volume= 8|issue= |pages= 14615|bibcode= |bibcode-access= |doi=10.1038/ncomms14615 |pmid=28256537 |pmc=5337992 |doi-access= |jstor= |quote=Greek and Persian historians of the 1st millennium BCE chronicle the existence of the Massagetae and Sauromatians, and later, the Sarmatians and Sacae: cultures possessing artefacts similar to those found in classical Scythian monuments, such as weapons, horse harnesses and a distinctive \u2018Animal Style' artistic tradition.

The authors of the study suggested that the Scythians were not directly descended from the Srubnaya culture, but that the Scythians and the Srubnaya shared a common origin through the earlier Yamnaya culture. Significant genetic differences were found between the Scythians and materially similar groups further east, which underpinned the notion that although materially similar, the Scythians and groups further east should be seen as separate peoples belonging to a common cultural horizon, which perhaps had its source on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe and the southern [[Urals]].<ref name=\"Krzewi\u0144ska\"/>\n\nIn 2019, a genetic study of remains from the [[Aldy-Bel culture]] of southern Siberia, which is materially similar to that of the Scythians, was published in [[Human Genetics (journal)|Human Genetics]].

Some writers claim that Scythians figured in the formation of the empire of the [[Medes]] and likewise of [[Caucasian Albania]].\n\nThe Scythians also feature in some national origin-legends of the Celts. In the second paragraph of the 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]], the \u00e9lite of [[Scotland]] claim Scythia as a former homeland of the [[Scottish people|Scots]]. According to the 11th-century [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]] (''The Book of the Taking of [[Ireland]]''), the 14th-century [[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]] and other [[Irish folklore]], the [[Irish people|Irish]] originated in Scythia and were descendants of [[F\u00e9nius Farsaid]], a Scythian prince who created the [[Ogham]] alphabet.\n\nThe [[Carolingian]] kings of the [[Franks]] traced [[Merovingian]] ancestry to the Germanic tribe of the [[Sicambri]]. [[Gregory of Tours]] documents in his ''History of the Franks'' that when [[Clovis I|Clovis]] was baptised, he was referred to as a Sicamber with the words \"Mitis depone colla, Sicamber, adora quod incendisti, incendi quod adorasti.\" The [[Chronicle of Fredegar]] in turn reveals that the Franks believed the Sicambri to be a tribe of Scythian or Cimmerian descent, who had changed their name to [[Franks]] in honour of their chieftain Franco in 11 BC.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, foreigners regarded the [[Russians]] as descendants of Scythians. It became conventional to refer to Russians as Scythians in 18th-century poetry, and [[Alexander Blok]] drew on this tradition sarcastically in his last major poem, ''The Scythians'' (1920). In the 19th century, romantic revisionists in the West transformed the \"[[barbarian]]\" Scyths of literature into the wild and free, hardy and democratic ancestors of all blond [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]].\n\nBased on such accounts of Scythian founders of certain Germanic as well as Celtic tribes, British historiography in the [[British Empire]] period such as [[Sharon Turner]] in his ''[[History of the Anglo-Saxons]]'', made them the ancestors of the [[Anglo-Saxons]].\n\n==Related ancient peoples==\nHerodotus and other classical historians listed quite a number of tribes who lived near the Scythians, and presumably shared the same general milieu and nomadic steppe culture, often called \"Scythian culture\", even though scholars may have difficulties in determining their exact relationship to the \"linguistic Scythians\".

Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br />Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man\u2019s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian \u00bb 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017|date=2008-11-26}}</ref>}}\n\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.\n\n''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at.

In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread. William Gibson's ''Neuromancer,'' whose influence dominated the early cyberpunk movement, was also set in [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], one of Japan's largest industrial areas, although at the time of writing the novel Gibson did not know the location of Chiba and had no idea how perfectly it fit his vision in some ways. The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture.

Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. \n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk.

These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction.

These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.

Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br />Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{quote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man\u2019s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian \u00bb 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017|date=2008-11-26}}</ref>}}\n\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. Dick's protege and friend [[K. W. Jeter]] wrote a very dark and imaginative novel called ''[[Dr. Adder]]'' in 1972 that, Dick lamented, might have been more influential in the field had it been able to find a publisher at that time.{{cn|date=November 2019}} It was not published until 1984, after which Jeter made it the first book in a trilogy, followed by ''The Glass Hammer'' (1985) and ''Death Arms'' (1987). Jeter wrote other standalone cyberpunk novels before going on to write three authorized sequels to ''Do Androids Dream of electric sheep'', named ''Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human'' (1995), ''Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night'' (1996), and ''Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon''.\n\n''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'' was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after William Gibson's story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. That story, which also became a film years later in 1995, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{quote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly \u201cspeaking computer.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-books-fiction/the-early-life-of-the-word-cyberpunk/|title=The Early Life of the Word \"Cyberpunk\" - Neon Dystopia|date=13 November 2016|website=NeonDystopia.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAfterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article where he said \"About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic \u201cschool\u201d would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as \u201ccyberpunks\u201d \u2014 Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/12/30/science-fiction-in-the-eighties/526c3a06-f123-4668-9127-33e33f57e313/|title=Science Fiction in the Eighties|first=Gardner|last=Dozois|date=30 December 1984|publisher=|access-date=28 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>\n\nAbout that time in 1984, William Gibson's novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk \"virtual reality\", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called \"Neuromantics\", a pun on the name of the novel plus \"[[New Romantics]]\", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased [[Michael Swanwick]]'s argument for the term: \"the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation ''Neuromancer''\".\n\nSterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as either keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf|title=Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image|website=AthabascaU.ca|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called ''[[Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology]]'', an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2013/01/review-of-mirrorshades-cyberpunk.html|title=Speculiction...: Review of \"Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology\" Edited by Bruce Sterling|last=Jesse|date=27 January 2013|website=Speculiction.Blogspot.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' in 1992.\n\nBookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called ''[[Headcrash]]'', like ''Snow Crash'' a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIt satirized the genre in this way:\n{{quote|...full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements ... They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures.

Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously [[Steampunk]], but also a host of other [[Cyberpunk derivatives]].\n\n== Style and ethos ==\nPrimary figures in the cyberpunk movement include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Bruce Bethke]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]]. [[Philip K.

In the words of author and critic [[David Brin]]:\n\n<blockquote>...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others ''do'' depict [[Orwellian]] accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate [[elite]].<ref>[[David Brin|Brin, David]] ''The Transparent Society'', Basic Books, 1998 [http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738201448 Book link]</ref></blockquote>\n\nCyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the [[Internet]]. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the [[World Wide Web]] entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and some social commentators such as [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] began predicting that such networks would eventually form.<ref>[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] \"[[The Last Question]],\" ''Science Fiction Quarterly'', 1956</ref>\n\nSome observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and Africans. For instance, it is claimed that cyberpunk depicts fantasies that ultimately empower [[masculinity]] using fragmentary and decentered aesthetic that culminate in a masculine genre populated by male outlaws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Reload: Rethinking Women + Cyberculture|last=Flanagan|first=Mary|last2=Booth|first2=Austin|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0262062275|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=7\u20138}}</ref> Critics also note the absence of any reference to Africa or an African-American character in the quintessential cyberpunk film ''Blade Runner''<ref name=\":0\" /> while other films reinforce stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyberpunk Women, Feminism and Science Fiction: A Critical Study|last=Lavigne|first=Carlen|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers|year=2013|isbn=9780786466535|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=51}}</ref>\n\n== Media ==\n=== Literature ===\n{{See also|List of cyberpunk works#Print media|Cyborgs in fiction}}\nMinnesota writer [[Bruce Bethke]] coined the term in 1980 for his short story \"Cyberpunk,\" which was published in the November 1983 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing Science Fiction Stories]]''.<ref>[[Bruce Bethke|Bethke, Bruce]]. \"Cyberpunk\" ''Amazing Science Fiction Stories'', Vol. 57, No. 4; November 1983 [http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/cpunk.htm Link]</ref> The term was quickly appropriated as a label to be applied to the works of [[William Gibson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Pat Cadigan]] and others.

Cyberpunk made science fiction more attractive to academics, argues Brin; in addition, it made science fiction more profitable to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] and to the visual arts generally.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''.

The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture.

Officials denied that the target had been the ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'' sourcebook, but Jackson would later write that he and his colleagues \"were never able to secure the return of the complete manuscript; [...] The Secret Service at first flatly refused to return anything \u2013 then agreed to let us copy files, but when we got to their office, restricted us to one set of out-of-date files \u2013 then agreed to make copies for us, but said \"tomorrow\" every day from March 4 to March 26.

This event has achieved a sort of notoriety, which has extended to the book itself as well. All published editions of ''GURPS Cyberpunk'' have a tagline on the front cover, which reads \"The book that was seized by the U.S. Secret Service!\" Inside, the book provides a summary of the raid and its aftermath.\n\nCyberpunk has also inspired several [[tabletop game|tabletop]], [[miniature wargaming|miniature]] and [[board game]]s such as ''[[Necromunda]]'' by [[Games Workshop]]. ''[[Netrunner]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] introduced in 1996, based on the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' role-playing game. ''[[Tokyo NOVA]]'', debuting in 1993, is a cyberpunk role-playing game that uses [[playing cards]] instead of dice.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{See also|List of cyberpunk works#Music}}\n{{Quote box\n | quote =\"Much of the industrial/dance heavy 'Cyberpunk'\u2014recorded in [[Billy Idol]]'s Macintosh-run studio\u2014revolves around Idol's theme of the common man rising up to fight against a faceless, soulless, corporate world.\"\n | source =\u2014Julie Romandetta<ref name=\"Romandetta\">{{cite news |title=Cyber Sound: Old Fashioned Rock Gets a Future Shock from New Technology |first=Julie |last=Romandetta |authorlink=Julie Romandetta |newspaper=Boston Herald |location=Boston, Mass.

Some musicians and acts have been classified as cyberpunk due to their aesthetic style and musical content. Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]] opened with a cyberpunk section, where costumes, asethetics and stage props were used to accentuate the dystopian nature of the theatrical concert. \n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk. The former has been interpreted as a dystopian<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/exo-mw0002387718 | title=Exo - Gatekeeper | website=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=January 3, 2015 | author=Ham, Robert}}</ref> critique of [[capitalism]]<ref name=\"stylus1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.stylus.com/hzwtls | title=Vaporwave: Soundtrack to Austerity | publisher=Stylus.com | date=January 29, 2014 | accessdate=February 8, 2014 | author=Ward, Christian}}</ref> in the vein of cyberpunk and the latter as a nostalgic [[retrofuturistic]] revival of aspects of cyberpunk's origins.\n\n== Social impact ==\n=== Art and architecture ===\n{{Commons category-inline|Cyberpunk cityscapes}}\n\n[[File:SonyCenterAtNight.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[Berlin]]'s [[Sony Center]]]]\n\nSome [[Neo-Futurism]] artworks and cityscapes have been influenced by cyberpunk, such as<ref name=\"cyberpunk1\"/> the [[Sony Center]] in the [[Potsdamer Platz]] [[public square]] of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Suzuki |first=David |authorlink=David Suzuki |title=Good News for a Change:How Everyday People Are Helping the Planet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbvpz6NaZC8C&pg=PA332 |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2003 |page=332 |isbn=1-55054-926-X}}</ref>\n\n=== Society and counterculture ===\nSeveral subcultures have been inspired by cyberpunk fiction. These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like \"tech wear\", \"goth ninja\" or \"tech ninja\". Important designers in this type of fashion{{According to whom|date=January 2015}} are ACRONYM, Demobaza,<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.demobaza.com/ |title=Online Store |publisher=Demobaza |date= |accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> [[Boris Bidjan Saberi]], [[Rick Owens]] and [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]].\n\nThe [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[Hong Kong]] (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-new-look-at-kowloon-walled-city-the-internets-favorite-cyberpunk-slum|title=A New Look at Kowloon Walled City, the Internet's Favorite Cyberpunk Slum|publisher=|date=2014-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Related genres ===\n{{See also|Cyberpunk derivatives}}\nAs a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well-situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.

The planning area is bordered by [[Bedok]] and [[Paya Lebar]] to the west, [[Pasir Ris]] to the north, [[Changi]] to the east and the [[Singapore Straits]] to the south. Tampines [[Planned community#Singapore|New Town]] is located in the northern portion of Tampines planning area. Tampines is the third largest new town in Singapore by area, covering over 2089 hectares of land and also is the third most populated new town, following [[Bedok]] and [[Jurong West]]. It is the [[Regional centre (Singapore)|regional centre]] for the East Region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tampines Avenue 10 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Avenue 10]]\n[[File:Tampines HDB 10.JPG|thumb|200px|Apartment blocks in Tampines Town]]\nIn the past, Tampines was covered by forests, swamp and sand quarries. [[Ironwood]] trees, or ''tempinis'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], grew abundantly. The area was part of a military training area until about 1987.\n\nThe name Tampines goes back to the Franklin and Jackson map of 1828. It is named after [[Sungei Tampines]], which in turn got its name from the ''tempinis'' trees ([[Malay language|Malay]] for ''[[Streblus elongatus]]'') which were said to be growing by it.\n\nThe oldest street in the area, Tampines Road, dates to 1864 when it was a cart tract. At the turn of the 20th century, Tampines was a rubber plantation. Tampines was also home to the sand quarry for a long time. Among the plantations were Teo Tek Ho and Hun Yeang estates.\n\nThe new town started in 1978. Construction began for Neighbourhoods 1 and 2 and was completed between 1983 and 1987 although they were given priority. Neighbourhoods 8 and 9 started in 1985\u20131989, followed by Neighbourhood 5 which was completed in 1989 with the Tampines Town Centre. Neighbourhood 4 was completed with the new Tampines North Division between 1986 and 1988. Tampines Town was at the fast-paced expansion, that breaks it into Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North and Tampines Changkat divisions.\n\nFor the Singapore MRT plans, they showed \"Tampines North\" and \"Tampines South\" since the planning stages which is due to the similar townships from 1979 to 1982, before they were renamed respectively in 1985 to Tampines and [[Simei]].\n\nNew construction methods expedited the development of the town's infrastructure. More attractive designs, colours and finishings were incorporated into Tampines, compared to earlier public housing which consisted of uniform slabs of concrete laid out row after row with more thought given to function than form. The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form for the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tampines |url=https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tampines |website=Housing and Development Board |publisher=Housing and Development Board |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref> The [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) managed the construction of the town until 1991, when it handed the reins over to the Tampines Town Council. The Town Council is run by [[grassroot]] leaders and the residents themselves.\n\nThe Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the [[World Habitat Awards|World Habitat Award]] to Tampines, which was selected as a representative of Singapore's [[new towns]], on 5 October 1992. The award was given in recognition of an outstanding contribution towards human [[colonization|settlement]] and development.\n\nNeighbourhoods 3 and 7 were only fully completed in 1997, and the constituencies had been reformed to include the new Tampines Central division. Construction was paused until the developments of Tampines Central were started in 2010, which includes The Premiere @ Tampines, Tampines GreenLeaf, Centrale 8, Tampines Trilliant and Citylife @ Tampines, including some of the other leftover pockets of residential developments such as Tampines GreenTerrace, Arc @ Tampines, Q Bay Residences and The Santorini.\n\nNeighbourhood 6, which is also known as Tampines North New Town, has started construction with the first [[Build to order (HDB)|Build-To-Order]] (BTO) flats Tampines GreenRidges being announced at the end of November 2014. Tampines GreenRidges is also part of the first phase of development of the Tampines North New Town's Park West District, which is the first district to be constructed in the Tampines North New Town development.\n\nTampines Court<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-court-sold-en-bloc-for-970m/ Tampines Court En Bloc]</ref>, had been en-bloc since July 2017 and all residents vacated their premises by 12 December 2018.

Thus, an array of facilities are provided primarily for residents in the new towns. Tampines is one of Singapore's four regional centres (along with [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Jurong East]] and future [[Seletar]]), under the plan of the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. As a result, the Tampines Regional Centre serves the Tampines residents and the entire [[East Region, Singapore|East Region]].\n\n===Commercial services===\n[[File:Tampines Mall 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Mall]]\n[[File:IKEA Tampines 42.JPG|thumb|200px|IKEA Tampines]]\nRetail [[shopping]] in the Tampines Regional Centre is done at three main shopping malls: [[Tampines Mall]], [[Century Square]] and [[Tampines 1]].

Occasionally, community-related events are held at Festival Park.\n\nThere's also another unofficial park in Tampines Town, it is Tampines Quarry Park, which originally was a sand quarry. As time passed, rain water filled the quarry. It is the only park in Tampines that is not equipped with any facilities, but this park is still popular among residents living nearby. There are no signs to the park and there is no entrance as it is hidden among the greenery. There are hidden pathways to enter.\n\nIn future, there will be mainly 2 new main parks in Tampines Town, namely Tampines Boulevard Park and Tampines North Quarry Park which will be located at the future Tampines North New Town. There will also be more new neighbourhood parks added in the future in both Tampines Town and Tampines North New Town together with the developments in the area.\n\n===Our Tampines Hub===\nThe [[Our Tampines Hub]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1106058/1/.html|title=Tampines to have Town Hub by 2015|accessdate=21 January 2011|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tampines-new-town-hub-to/2086428.html|title=Tampines New Town Hub to open progressively from end-2016|last=Chan|first=Luo Er|date=2015-08-30|publisher=Channel News Asia|accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> is a new development in Tampines. Construction began in June 2013 and it opened on 9 November 2016. It is located at [[Tampines Stadium]] along Avenue 4 and 5, together with the swimming pool.\n\nIt is built for the residents of Tampines and provides a community space where residents can gather, interact and bond with others from the community. Facilities available include a community centre, sports and recreation centres, swimming pools, bowling alleys, karaoke facility, information centres and several offices. The Tampines Regional Library was also relocated here.\n\n==Politics==\nOriginally, Tampines was under the [[Tampines Single Member Constituency]] when it was still under development up until 1988, where its population was grown and made into [[Tampines Group Representation Constituency]]. The [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]] (and later [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] in the 2001 and 2006 elections) had always contested in the town in all the general elections except in 1997, when the party was disqualified, but the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won in every election they contested. \n\nSince 2015, Tampines was divided into four [[Group Representation Constituencies]], namely the namesake [[Tampines GRC|Tampines]] (central and regional centre), [[Aljunied GRC|Aljunied]] ([[Bedok Reservoir]] and [[Temasek Polytechnic]]), [[East Coast GRC|East Coast]] (the subregion of [[Simei]]) and [[Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC|Pasir Ris-Punggol]] (northernmost region, including IKEA and Giant hypermarket). Tampines was led by the PAP, among which the MPs include [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime]] and [[Minister for Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Heng Swee Keat]] and by [[Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources|Minister of the Environment and Water Resources]] and [[Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs|Muslim Affairs]] [[Masagos Zulkifli]], with the exception of Aljunied being led by the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Tampines MRT.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Tampines MRT station]]]]<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-mrt-stations]</ref>\n\n===Road network===\nA network of [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], namely the [[Pan-Island Expressway]], [[East Coast Parkway]] and [[Tampines Expressway]], and arterial roads allows easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the island. Tampines Avenue 10, an arterial road, forms the start/end of the [[Outer Ring Road System]], a semi-expressway.\n\n===Mass rapid transit===\nThere are currently 6 [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] stations that serve the planning area across 2 lines, the [[East West MRT Line|East West Line]] and [[Downtown MRT Line|Downtown Line]]. Both lines have two interchange stations at [[Tampines MRT station]] and [[Expo MRT station]] on the Changi Airport Branch line. The stations of the Downtown Line  were opened on 21 October 2017 as part of DTL3. The 6 stations are:\n\n*{{SMRT code 2I/C|EW|2|DT|32}} [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]]\n*{{SMRT code|EW|3}} [[Simei MRT station|Simei]]\n*{{SMRT code|DT|31}} [[Tampines West MRT station|Tampines West]]\n*{{SMRT code|DT|33}} [[Tampines East MRT station|Tampines East]]\n*{{SMRT code|DT|34}} [[Upper Changi MRT station|Upper Changi]]\n*{{SMRT code 2I/C|DT|35|CG|1}} [[Expo MRT station|Expo]]\n\n[[Xilin MRT station|Xilin MRT Station]] will be a future station as part of DTL3 extension, will be completed in 2024 in tandem with the opening of the Stage 4 of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson-East Coast Line]].\n\n[[Tampines North MRT station|Tampines North MRT Station]] will be the newest future station added to Tampines. It will be located in Tampines North New Town, and it is part of the stations in Stage 1 of the [[Cross Island MRT Line|Cross Island Line]], which will be completed in 2029.\n\n===Bus===\nThere are two bus interchanges, the [[Tampines Bus Interchange]] and [[Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange]]. Tampines Bus Interchange has been operating since 1983 as a bus terminus and later on it moved to Tampines Central 1 in 1987. Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange was opened on 18 December 2016 to increase the capacity of the existing Tampines Bus Interchange.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.todayonline.com/singapore/sengkang-and-tampines-bus-interchanges-be-expanded |title=Sengkang and Tampines bus interchanges to be expanded |accessdate=25 Nov 2014|publisher=[[Today Online]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange| url=http://landtransportguru.net/tampines-concourse-bus-interchange/| website=Land Transport Guru| accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> \n\nA third bus interchange, Tampines North Bus Interchange, is currently under planning and will be part of the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://landtransportguru.net/tampines-north-bus-interchange/|title=Tampines North Bus Interchange {{!}} Land Transport Guru|date=2017-03-01|work=Land Transport Guru|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Changi Business Park#Changi Business Park Bus Terminal|Changi Business Park Bus Terminal]] is a bus terminal in the northern part of Changi Business Park.

The planning area is bordered by [[Bedok]] and [[Paya Lebar]] to the west, [[Pasir Ris]] to the north, [[Changi]] to the east and the [[Singapore Straits]] to the south. Tampines [[Planned community#Singapore|New Town]] is located in the northern portion of Tampines planning area. Tampines is the third largest new town in Singapore by area, covering over 2089 hectares of land and also is the third most populated new town, following [[Bedok]] and [[Jurong West]]. It is the [[Regional centre (Singapore)|regional centre]] for the East Region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tampines Avenue 10 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Avenue 10]]\n[[File:Tampines HDB 10.JPG|thumb|200px|Apartment blocks in Tampines Town]]\nIn the past, Tampines was covered by forests, swamp and sand quarries. [[Ironwood]] trees, or ''tempinis'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], grew abundantly. The area was part of a military training area until about 1987.\n\nThe name Tampines goes back to the Franklin and Jackson map of 1828. It is named after [[Sungei Tampines]], which in turn got its name from the ''tempinis'' trees ([[Malay language|Malay]] for ''[[Streblus elongatus]]'') which were said to be growing by it.\n\nThe oldest street in the area, Tampines Road, dates to 1864 when it was a cart tract. At the turn of the 20th century, Tampines was a rubber plantation. Tampines was also home to the sand quarry for a long time. Among the plantations were Teo Tek Ho and Hun Yeang estates.\n\nThe new town started in 1978. Construction began for Neighbourhoods 1 and 2 and was completed between 1983 and 1987 although they were given priority. Neighbourhoods 8 and 9 started in 1985\u20131989, followed by Neighbourhood 5 which was completed in 1989 with the Tampines Town Centre. Neighbourhood 4 was completed with the new Tampines North Division between 1986 and 1988. Tampines Town was at the fast-paced expansion, that breaks it into Tampines East, Tampines West, Tampines North and Tampines Changkat divisions.\n\nFor the Singapore MRT plans, they showed \"Tampines North\" and \"Tampines South\" since the planning stages which is due to the similar townships from 1979 to 1982, before they were renamed respectively in 1985 to Tampines and [[Simei]].\n\nNew construction methods expedited the development of the town's infrastructure. More attractive designs, colours and finishings were incorporated into Tampines, compared to earlier public housing which consisted of uniform slabs of concrete laid out row after row with more thought given to function than form. The Town Centre was planned as an hourglass shape to create a unique urban design form for the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tampines |url=https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/history/hdb-towns-your-home/tampines |website=Housing and Development Board |publisher=Housing and Development Board |accessdate=30 June 2018}}</ref> The [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) managed the construction of the town until 1991, when it handed the reins over to the Tampines Town Council. The Town Council is run by [[grassroot]] leaders and the residents themselves.\n\nThe Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF) of the United Nations awarded the [[World Habitat Awards|World Habitat Award]] to Tampines, which was selected as a representative of Singapore's [[new towns]], on 5 October 1992. The award was given in recognition of an outstanding contribution towards human [[colonization|settlement]] and development.\n\nNeighbourhoods 3 and 7 were only fully completed in 1997, and the constituencies had been reformed to include the new Tampines Central division. Construction was paused until the developments of Tampines Central were started in 2010, which includes The Premiere @ Tampines, Tampines GreenLeaf, Centrale 8, Tampines Trilliant and Citylife @ Tampines, including some of the other leftover pockets of residential developments such as Tampines GreenTerrace, Arc @ Tampines, Q Bay Residences and The Santorini.\n\nNeighbourhood 6, which is also known as Tampines North New Town, has started construction with the first [[Build to order (HDB)|Build-To-Order]] (BTO) flats Tampines GreenRidges being announced at the end of November 2014. Tampines GreenRidges is also part of the first phase of development of the Tampines North New Town's Park West District, which is the first district to be constructed in the Tampines North New Town development.\n\nTampines Court<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-court-sold-en-bloc-for-970m/ Tampines Court En Bloc]</ref>, had been en-bloc since July 2017 and all residents vacated their premises by 12 December 2018.

Thus, an array of facilities are provided primarily for residents in the new towns. Tampines is one of Singapore's four regional centres (along with [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Jurong East]] and future [[Seletar]]), under the plan of the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]]. As a result, the Tampines Regional Centre serves the Tampines residents and the entire [[East Region, Singapore|East Region]].\n\n===Commercial services===\n[[File:Tampines Mall 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Mall]]\n[[File:IKEA Tampines 42.JPG|thumb|200px|IKEA Tampines]]\nRetail [[shopping]] in the Tampines Regional Centre is done at three main shopping malls: [[Tampines Mall]], [[Century Square]] and [[Tampines 1]]. Commercial tenants of the shopping centres include restaurants, supermarkets, [[department store]]s, cinemas, [[bookstore]]s, jewellery and gift shops.\n\nWhile outside of Tampines Town there is also [[Eastpoint Mall, Singapore|Eastpoint Mall]], Singapore Expo and [[Changi City Point]] nearby.\n\nOn 30 November 2006, [[IKEA]] opened its second outlet in Singapore at Tampines Retail Park, with adjacent [[Courts plc|Courts]] and [[Giant Hypermarket|Giant]], and together, these three are the first to have warehouse retail stores in Singapore.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, [[UNIQLO]] opened its first outlet in Singapore at [[Tampines 1]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporebusinessnews/view/420532/1/.html |title=First Uniqlo Singapore outlet to open on Thursday |accessdate=9 April 2009|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref>\n\n===Community services===\n[[File:Tampines Regional Library.JPG|thumb|200px|Tampines Regional Library]]\nThe [[Tampines Regional Library]] was located at Tampines Central and has now moved its facilities to the [[Our Tampines Hub]].\n\n===Parks===\nThe three main parks in the Tampines Town are Sunplaza Park, at Tampines Avenue 7 and 9; [[Tampines Bike Park]] (which officially closed on 17 September 2014, as to make way for the future developments of the future Tampines North New Town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/sports/bmx-fans-get-new-track-after-tampines-park-closes|title=BMX fans to get new track after Tampines park closes|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]/[[The Straits Times]]}}</ref>), at the junction of Tampines 9 and 7; and [[NParks]] latest nature park as of 24 April 2011, [[Tampines Eco Green]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1124537/1/.html|title=New Tampines Eco Green to nurture love for nature|accessdate=24 April 2011|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref> at the junction of Tampines 12 and 9. All of the parks are close to each other and interconnected by a walking and bicycle path..\n\nThe other parks in Tampines Town are mainly community parks\u2013 Tampines North Park, Tampines Leisure Park, Tampines Central Park, Tampines Park, Festival Park, Tampines Green, Tampines Tree Garden, and some neighbourhood parks. Occasionally, community-related events are held at Festival Park.\n\nThere's also another unofficial park in Tampines Town, it is Tampines Quarry Park, which originally was a sand quarry. As time passed, rain water filled the quarry. It is the only park in Tampines that is not equipped with any facilities, but this park is still popular among residents living nearby. There are no signs to the park and there is no entrance as it is hidden among the greenery. There are hidden pathways to enter.\n\nIn future, there will be mainly 2 new main parks in Tampines Town, namely Tampines Boulevard Park and Tampines North Quarry Park which will be located at the future Tampines North New Town. There will also be more new neighbourhood parks added in the future in both Tampines Town and Tampines North New Town together with the developments in the area.\n\n===Our Tampines Hub===\nThe [[Our Tampines Hub]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1106058/1/.html|title=Tampines to have Town Hub by 2015|accessdate=21 January 2011|publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tampines-new-town-hub-to/2086428.html|title=Tampines New Town Hub to open progressively from end-2016|last=Chan|first=Luo Er|date=2015-08-30|publisher=Channel News Asia|accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> is a new development in Tampines. Construction began in June 2013 and it opened on 9 November 2016. It is located at [[Tampines Stadium]] along Avenue 4 and 5, together with the swimming pool.\n\nIt is built for the residents of Tampines and provides a community space where residents can gather, interact and bond with others from the community. Facilities available include a community centre, sports and recreation centres, swimming pools, bowling alleys, karaoke facility, information centres and several offices. The Tampines Regional Library was also relocated here.\n\n==Politics==\nOriginally, Tampines was under the [[Tampines Single Member Constituency]] when it was still under development up until 1988, where its population was grown and made into [[Tampines Group Representation Constituency]]. The [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]] (and later [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] in the 2001 and 2006 elections) had always contested in the town in all the general elections except in 1997, when the party was disqualified, but the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won in every election they contested. \n\nSince 2015, Tampines was divided into four [[Group Representation Constituencies]], namely the namesake [[Tampines GRC|Tampines]] (central and regional centre), [[Aljunied GRC|Aljunied]] ([[Bedok Reservoir]] and [[Temasek Polytechnic]]), [[East Coast GRC|East Coast]] (the subregion of [[Simei]]) and [[Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC|Pasir Ris-Punggol]] (northernmost region, including IKEA and Giant hypermarket). Tampines was led by the PAP, among which the MPs include [[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime]] and [[Minister for Finance (Singapore)|Minister for Finance]] [[Heng Swee Keat]] and by [[Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources|Minister of the Environment and Water Resources]] and [[Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs|Muslim Affairs]] [[Masagos Zulkifli]], with the exception of Aljunied being led by the [[Workers' Party of Singapore]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Tampines MRT.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Tampines MRT station]]]]<ref>[https://www.the-treasures-tampines.com/tampines-mrt-stations]</ref>\n\n===Road network===\nA network of [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]], namely the [[Pan-Island Expressway]], [[East Coast Parkway]] and [[Tampines Expressway]], and arterial roads allows easy movement within the town and link it to other parts of the island. Tampines Avenue 10, an arterial road, forms the start/end of the [[Outer Ring Road System]], a semi-expressway.\n\n===Mass rapid transit===\nThere are currently 6 [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT]] stations that serve the planning area across 2 lines, the [[East West MRT Line|East West Line]] and [[Downtown MRT Line|Downtown Line]]. Both lines have two interchange stations at [[Tampines MRT station]] and [[Expo MRT station]] on the Changi Airport Branch line. The stations of the Downtown Line  were opened on 21 October 2017 as part of DTL3.

Tampines Bus Interchange has been operating since 1983 as a bus terminus and later on it moved to Tampines Central 1 in 1987. Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange was opened on 18 December 2016 to increase the capacity of the existing Tampines Bus Interchange.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.todayonline.com/singapore/sengkang-and-tampines-bus-interchanges-be-expanded |title=Sengkang and Tampines bus interchanges to be expanded |accessdate=25 Nov 2014|publisher=[[Today Online]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Tampines Concourse Bus Interchange| url=http://landtransportguru.net/tampines-concourse-bus-interchange/| website=Land Transport Guru| accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> \n\nA third bus interchange, Tampines North Bus Interchange, is currently under planning and will be part of the Tampines North Integrated Transport Hub (ITH).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://landtransportguru.net/tampines-north-bus-interchange/|title=Tampines North Bus Interchange {{!}} Land Transport Guru|date=2017-03-01|work=Land Transport Guru|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[Changi Business Park#Changi Business Park Bus Terminal|Changi Business Park Bus Terminal]] is a bus terminal in the northern part of Changi Business Park.

''cheval'' 'horse') or '''horsemen''' are [[soldier]]s or [[warrior]]s who [[Horses in warfare|fight mounted]] on [[horseback]]. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the [[combat arms]]. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''', '''horseman''', '''[[dragoon]]''', or '''[[trooper (rank)|trooper]]'''. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any [[Military animal|military forces that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]], mules or [[War elephant|elephants]]. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.\n\nCavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and [[inertial mass]] over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.\n\nThe speed, mobility, and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the [[Ancient era|Ancient]] and [[Horses in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in [[eurasian nomads|nomadic societies of Asia]], notably the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]] and the later [[Mongol Army|Mongol armies]].<ref>\nJohn Keegan, pages 188-189, ''[[A History of Warfare]],'' {{ISBN|0-09-174527-6}}\n</ref> In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured (heavy)]], and eventually evolving into the mounted [[knight]]s of the medieval period. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.\n\nIn [[Interwar period|the period]] between the [[World Wars]], many cavalry units were converted into [[motorized infantry]] and [[mechanized infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during [[World War II]], notably in the [[Red Army]], the [[Mongolian People's Army]], the [[Royal Italian Army]], the [[Romania in World War II|Romanian Army]], the [[Polish Land Forces]], and light reconnaissance units within the [[Waffen SS]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of [[reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition]] (RSTA).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Role of cavalry==\n{{Main|Cavalry tactics}}\n[[File:Rytter fra Bagirmi.jpg|thumb|upright|African horseman of [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] in full [[gambeson|padded armour]] suit]]\n\nIn many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of the disposition of the main body of troops, forward security, offensive [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance by combat]], defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, [[relief in place]], linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the \"[[Armoured warfare|armored]]\" designation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|left|[[Assyrian cavalry]]]]\n\nBefore the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].<ref>p. 1, Menon</ref> The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] from 1550 BC as well as the [[Assyrian army]] and [[Babylonia]]n royalty.<ref>Terrence Wise, p. 18, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nThe power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of [[horse]]s (then mostly small) to carry heavy [[armor]]. Nonetheless, there are indications that, from the 15th century BC onwards, horseback riding was practiced amongst the military elites of the great states of the ancient Near East, most notably those in [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]] <ref> https://www.academia.edu/1532320/Horseback_riding_and_Cavalry_in_Mycenaean_Greece</ref>.\n\nCavalry techniques, and the rise of true cavalry, were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Iranic]] [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sarmatians]].\n[[File:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]\n\nThe photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865\u2013860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the [[mounted archer]] were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.<ref>Terrence Wise, plate H, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 490 BC a [[Nisean horse|breed of large horses]] was bred in the [[Nisaean plain]] in Media to carry [[Cataphract|men with increasing amounts of armour]] (Herodotus 7,40 & 9,20), but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the fourth century BC the Chinese during the [[Warring States period]] (403&ndash;221 BC) began to use cavalry against rival states,<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\">Ebrey and others, ''Pre-Modern East Asia'', pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref> and by 331 BC when [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive [[scythed chariot]]s. The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=164|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\nHowever, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing.\n\nOutside of mainland Europe, the southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the [[Caledonia]]ns at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius|Mons Graupius]], in 84 AD.\n\n===Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===\n[[File:Amphora Louvre F12.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warrior's departure; an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[amphora]] dated 550\u2013540 BC.]]\n{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}\n\nDuring the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with [[javelin]]s, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using [[lance]]s, had the ability to close in on their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the [[hoplites]] or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=37|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nCavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], their first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by [[Phillip II of Macedon]] when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen,<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=18|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=54|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Macedon]]ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]])<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=17|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> of Philip II of Macedon and [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen<ref>{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Sekunda|page=42|title=Macedonian Armies after Alexander 323-168 BC|ISBN=978-1-84908-714-8}}</ref> called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or \"Horserider\"), Greek \"heavy\" cavalry, armed with [[Kontos (weapon)|kontos]] (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. The effectiveness of this combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquests of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=14\u201322|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Republic and Early Empire===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n{{main|Roman cavalry}}\n[[File:K\u00f6ln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tombstone of a Roman [[auxilia]]ry trooper from [[History of Cologne|Cologne]], Germany. Second half of the first century AD]]\n\nThe cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''\u2014men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. Horses were provided by the Republic and could be withdrawn if neglected or misused, together with the status of being a cavalryman.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=36|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref>\n\nAs the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the [[Second Punic War]] where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the [[Battle of Cannae]], where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortes Equitatae]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their [[Germanic bodyguard|personal bodyguards]] until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].\n\nFor the most part, Roman cavalry during the early Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the standing force comprising a consular army. Except in times of major mobilisation about 1,800 horsemen were maintained, with three hundred attached to each legion.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=36\u201337|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThe relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].\n\nAfter defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Negin|page=6|title=Roman heavy Cavalry (1) Cataphractarii & Clibanarii, 1st Century BC-5th Century AD.|ISBN=978-1-4728-3004-3}}</ref> \nAt the same time heavy spears and shields modelled on those favoured by the horsemen of the Greek city-states were adopted to replace the lighter weaponry of early Rome.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=38|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThese improvements in tactics and equipment reflected those of a thousand years earlier when the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to undertake similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their [[heavy infantry]] supported by auxiliary cavalry.\n\n===Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period===\n[[File:Roman Cavalry 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reenactor as a Roman [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalryman.]]\n\nIn the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.\n\nThe most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Iranian empires, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]s and their [[Persians|Persian]] [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic period]] with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/ |title=Roman-Persian Wars |work=Historynet.com |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,<ref>The raised rear part of a saddle</ref> was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by [[History of Iran|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.\n\nThe late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders\u2014individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Newark|pages=23\u201324|title=Sabre & Lance.

As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.\n[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders II.jpg|thumb|Mongols at war 14th century]]\n\nThe best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the [[Russian Empire]]. In eastern Europe, Russia, and out onto the [[steppes]], cavalry remained important much longer and dominated the scene of warfare until the early 17th century and even beyond, as the strategic mobility of cavalry was crucial for the semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lives that many steppe cultures led.<!-- This needs a re-write as the chronology is all over the place --> [[Tibet]]ans also had a tradition of cavalry warfare, in several military engagements with the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907 AD).\n\n====Khanates of Central Asia====\n{{main|Mounted archery}}\n<gallery widths=\"180\">\nFile:Mongol warrior of Genghis Khan.jpg|[[Mongol]] mounted archer of Genghis Khan late 12th century.\nFile:Ryszkiewicz Tatars in the vanguard.jpg|[[Tatar]] vanguard in [[Eastern Europe]] 13th\u201314th centuries.\n</gallery>\n\n===East Asia===\n{{further|Horses in East Asian warfare}}\n\n====China====\n{{multiple image| align = left | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = An [[Eastern Han]] glazed ceramic statue of a horse with [[bridle]] and [[halter]] headgear, from [[Sichuan]], late 2nd century to early 3rd century AD| footer_align = left | image1 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 02.JPG | width1 = 108 | caption1 = | image2 = Sichuan, han orientali, cavallo con ciuffo e criniera corta, seconda met\u00e0 II-inizio III sec. 03.JPG | width2 = 220| caption2 = }}\n\nFurther east, the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|military history of China]], specifically [[North China|northern China]], held a long tradition of intense military exchange between [[Han Chinese]] infantry forces of the settled dynastic empires and the mounted [[nomads]] or \"barbarians\" of the north. The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].\n\nIn 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\" />\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with saddle and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r 626\u2013649), c 650]]\nThe adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c 1600\u20131050 BC).<ref name=\"ebrey 29\">Ebrey, 29.</ref> By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.<ref name=\"ebrey 30\">Ebrey, 30.</ref> The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the fourth century BC;<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 41\">Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.</ref> it was written by the [[Song dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.<ref name=\"peers 130\">Peers, 130. we can right anything</ref>\n\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in ceremonial armor on horseback, painted by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (1688\u20131766)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], dated 1739 or 1758]]\nOn many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279\u20131368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r 141\u201387 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]\u2013[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.\n\nCavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.<ref name=\"Dien\">[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. \"THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY\"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231319/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup \u2013 history of Chinese science\".

Since at least the 3rd century BC, there was influence of northern [[nomad]]ic peoples and [[Yemaek]] peoples on Korean warfare. By roughly the first century BC, the ancient kingdom of [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]] also had mounted warriors.<ref>Ebrey, 120.</ref> The cavalry of [[Goguryeo]], one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], were called ''Gaemamusa'' (\uac1c\ub9c8\ubb34\uc0ac, \u93a7\u99ac\u6b66\u58eb), and were renowned as a fearsome heavy cavalry force. [[Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo|King Gwanggaeto the Great]] often led expeditions into the [[Baekje]], [[Gaya confederacy]], [[Buyeo Kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Later Yan]] and against [[Yamato period|Japanese]] invaders with his cavalry.<ref>Lee, Peter H & Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition, pp. 24\u201326. Columbia University Press, 1997.</ref>\nIn the 12th century, [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes began to violate the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders, and eventually invaded [[Goryeo]] Korea. After experiencing the invasion by the Jurchen, Korean general [[Yun Gwan]] realized that Goryeo lacked efficient cavalry units. He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders (\ub3d9\ubd81 9\uc131, \u6771\u5317 \u4e5d\u57ce).[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|upright|A mounted [[samurai]] with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet.

The emergence of the [[samurai]] aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging [[lancer]] cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.\n\nAn example is Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac?), a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special \"turnip-headed\" arrows successively at three wooden targets.\n\nThis style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.\nCurrently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.\n\nKasagake or Kasakake (\u7b20\u61f8, \u304b\u3055\u304c\u3051 lit. \"hat shooting\") is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.\n\n===South Asia===\nIn the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320\u2013600) period onwards. India has also the oldest evidence for the introduction of toe-[[stirrup]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/invention-of-the-stirrup-195161|title=Invention of the Stirrup|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIndian literature contains numerous references to the mounted warriors of the [[Central Asia]]n horse nomads, notably the [[Saka]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yona|Yavanas]], [[The Pahlavas|Pahlavas]] and [[Paradas]].

The arms and armour for heavy cavalry increased, the high-backed [[saddle]] developed, and [[stirrup]]s and [[spur]]s were added, increasing the advantage of heavy cavalry even more.\n\nThis shift in military importance was reflected in society as well; [[knight]]s took centre stage both on and off the battlefield. These are considered the \"ultimate\" in heavy cavalry: well-equipped with the best weapons, state-of-the-art armour from head to foot, leading with the [[lance]] in battle in a full-gallop, close-formation \"knightly charge\" that might prove irresistible, winning the battle almost as soon as it begun.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century depiction of a riding horse.

While mounted men-at-arms focused on a narrow combat role of shock combat, medieval armies relied on a large variety of foot troops to fulfill all the rest ([[skirmishing]], flank guards, scouting, holding ground, etc.). Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the common soldiers, which led early students of military history to suppose that heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields. But well-trained and disciplined infantry could defeat knights.\n\nMassed [[English longbow]]men triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339),<ref>{{cite book|first=H.W.|last=Koch|page=[https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189 189]|title=Medieval Warfare|ISBN=0-86124-008-1|url=https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189}}</ref> foot-soldiers proved they could resist cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.\n\nThis gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.\n\n===Greater Middle East===\n{{main|Religious war|Muslim conquests}}\n\n====Arabs====\n{{main|Mobile guard|List of battles of Muhammad}}\n[[File:Ikhwan.jpg|thumb|left|Arab [[Camel cavalry|camelry]]]]\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad made use of cavalry in many of his military campaigns including the [[Expedition of Dhu Qarad]],<ref>Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 231.

Its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629 ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.<ref>p. 239, Muir</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 AD was a conflict between the Arab [[Abbasid]] Caliphate and the [[China|Chinese]] [[Tang dynasty]] over the control of [[Central Asia]]. Chinese infantry were routed by [[Arab]] cavalry near the bank of the River Talas.\n\nLater [[Mamluk]]s were trained as cavalry soldiers. Mamluks were to follow the dictates of [[Furusiyya|al-furusiyya]],<ref>tradition of al-furusiyya is defined by principles of horsemanship, chivalry, and the mutual dependence of the rider and the horse</ref> a code of conduct that included values like courage and generosity but also doctrine of cavalry tactics, horsemanship, archery and treatment of wounds.\n\n====Maghreb====\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 025.jpg| thumb | 175px |A [[Morocco|Moroccan]] with his [[Arabian horse]] along the [[Barbary coast]].]]\n\nThe Islamic Berber states of North Africa employed elite horse mounted cavalry armed with spears and following the model of the original Arab occupiers of the region.

The elite corps were the ''ahadi'' who provided direct service to the Emperor and acted as guard cavalry. Supplementary cavalry or ''dakhilis'' were recruited, equipped and paid by the central state. This was in contrast to the ''tabinan'' horsemen who were the followers of individual noblemen. Their training and equipment varied widely but they made up the backbone of the Mughal cavalry. Finally there were tribal irregulars led by and loyal to tributary chiefs. These included Hindus, Afghans and Turks summoned for military service when their autonomous leaders were called on by the Imperial government.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicolle|pages=10\u201311|title=Mughul India 1504\u20131761|ISBN=1-85532-344-3}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mughal Troops Chase the Armies of Da'ud.jpg|Akbar leads the [[Mughal Army]] during a campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance Europe===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u20131441).]]\nIronically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the \"golden age\" of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.\n\nKnighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.\n\n[[File:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Polish hussars|Husarz]]'' (Polish Hussar) by [[J\u00f3zef Brandt]].]]\n\nFrom the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace.\n\nThe Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].\n\n===18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars===\n[[File:Battle of Eylau 1807 by Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|left|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on Fort]].]]\n\nCavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nEven with the increasing prominence of infantry, cavalry still had an important place in armies. They often patrolled the fringes of army encampments, with standing orders to intercept and kill suspected shirkers and deserters on sight.<ref name=MattWhite/>{{rp|257, 266}} Cavalry units also served as [[Picket (military)|outpost pickets]] in advance of the main body. During battle they might charge and override artillery cannon, plugging the touchholes with iron spikes. They also pursued enemy infantrymen who had broken from formation, as well as snipers. <ref name=MattWhite>{{cite book|title=[[The Great Big Book of Horrible Things]]|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

However, in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], repeated [[Battle of Waterloo#The French cavalry attack|charges by up to 9,000 French cavalrymen]] failed to break the line of the British and German infantry, who had formed [[Infantry square|square]]s.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/battle_waterloo_01.shtml#five BBC History: The Battle of Waterloo]</ref>\n\nMassed infantry was deadly to cavalry, but offered an excellent target for [[artillery]]. Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of [[World War I]].\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The charge of the Venezuelan First Division's cavalry at the [[Battle of Carabobo]].]]\n\n====Europe====\nBy the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:\n\n* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry\n* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry\n* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry\n* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s\n\nThere were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs \u00e0 cheval''; Prussia had the ''J\u00e4ger zu Pferd''; Bavaria, Saxony and Austria<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Knotel|pages=24, 182 & 230|title=Uniforms of the World.

Britain, from the mid-18th century, had Light Dragoons as light cavalry and Dragoons, Dragoon Guards and [[Household Cavalry]] as heavy cavalry. Only after the end of the Napoleonic wars were the Household Cavalry equipped with cuirasses, and some other regiments were converted to lancers. In the [[United States Army]] the cavalry were almost always dragoons.

The distinguished 1st Virginia Cavalry ranks as one of the most effectual and successful cavalry units on the Confederate side. Noted cavalry commanders included Confederate general [[J.E.B.

The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the [[Australian Light Horse]] served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign. In September 1914 cavalry comprised 9.28% of the total manpower of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in France\u2014by July 1918 this proportion had fallen to 1.65%.<ref>p. 212, ''The Oxford History of the British Army'', {{ISBN|0-19-285333-3}}</ref> As early as the first winter of the war most French cavalry regiments had dismounted a squadron each, for service in the trenches.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ian|last=Sumner|page=12|title=French Poilu 1914\u201318|ISBN=978-1-84603-332-2}}</ref> The French cavalry numbered 102,000 in May 1915 but had been reduced to 63,000 by October 1918.<ref>p. 216, Vol. XXX, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 12th Edition, 1922</ref>\nThe German Army dismounted nearly all their cavalry in the West, maintaining only one mounted division on that front by January 1917.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R42025, Warschau, Einmarsch deutscher Kavallerie.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Uhlan]]s after the capture of Warsaw, August 1915]]\nItaly entered the war in 1915 with thirty regiments of line cavalry, lancers and light horse. While employed effectively against their Austro-Hungarian counterparts during the initial offensives across the [[Isonzo River]], the Italian mounted forces ceased to have a significant role as the front shifted into mountainous terrain. By 1916 all cavalry machine-gun sections and two complete cavalry divisions had been dismounted and seconded to the infantry.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Nicolle|pages=34\u201335|title=The Italian Army of World War I|ISBN=1-84176-398-5}}</ref>\n\nSome cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come. [[Tank]]s, introduced on the Western Front by the British in September 1916, had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them. In their first major use at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]], the plan was for a cavalry division to follow behind the tanks, however they were not able to cross a canal because a tank had broken the only bridge.<ref>[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/battle_of_cambrai.htm History Learning Site: Battle of Cambrai]</ref> It was not until the German Army had been forced to retreat in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] of 1918, that cavalry were again able to operate in their intended role.

Some wide-ranging actions were fought, again mostly in the early months of the war.<ref name=\"Willmott\">''First World War'', Willmott, H. P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003</ref> However, even here the value of cavalry was overrated and the maintenance of large mounted formations at the front by the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Russian Army]] put a major strain on the railway system, to little strategic advantage.<ref>{{cite book|first=Norman|last=Stone|page=220|title=The Eastern Front 1914\u201317|ISBN=0-684-14492-1}}</ref> In February 1917 the Russian regular cavalry (exclusive of Cossacks) was reduced by nearly a third from its peak number of 200,000, as two squadrons of each regiment were dismounted and incorporated into additional infantry battalions.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir|last=Littauer|page=220|title=Russian Hussar|ISBN=1-59048-256-5}}</ref> Their Austro-Hungarian opponents, plagued by a shortage of trained infantry, had been obliged to progressively convert most horse cavalry regiments to dismounted rifle units starting in late 1914.<ref>{{cite book|first=James|last=Lucas|page=99|title=Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868\u20131914|ISBN=0-946771-04-9}}</ref>\n\n====Middle East====\nIn the Middle East, during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] mounted forces (British, Indian, Ottoman, Australian, Arab and New Zealand) retained an important strategic role both as mounted infantry and cavalry.\n\nIn Egypt the [[mounted infantry]] formations like the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade]] and [[Australian Light Horse]] of [[ANZAC Mounted Division]], operating as mounted infantry, drove German and Ottoman forces back from [[Battle of Romani|Romani]] to [[Battle of Magdhaba|Magdhaba]] and [[Battle of Rafa|Rafa]] and out of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula in 1916.\n\nAfter a stalemate on the Gaza\u2014Beersheba line between March and October 1917, [[Beersheba]] was captured by the [[Australian Mounted Division]]'s 4th Light Horse Brigade. Their mounted charge succeeded after a [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|coordinated attack]] by the British Infantry and Yeomanry cavalry and the Australian and New Zealand Light Horse and Mounted Rifles brigades. A series of coordinated attacks by these [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] infantry and mounted troops were also successful at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], during which the British infantry divisions and the Desert Mounted Corps drove two Ottoman armies back to the Jaffa\u2014Jerusalem line. The infantry with mainly dismounted cavalry and mounted infantry fought in the [[Judean Hills]] to eventually almost encircle [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem]] which was occupied shortly after.\n\nDuring a pause in operations necessitated by the [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 on the Western Front joint infantry and mounted infantry attacks towards [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Es Salt]] resulted in retreats back to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] which continued to be occupied by mounted divisions during the summer of 1918.\n\nThe Australian Mounted Division was armed with swords and in September, after the successful [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|breaching]] of the Ottoman line on the Mediterranean coast by [[Battle of Sharon (1918)|the British Empire infantry]] XXI Corps was followed by cavalry attacks by the [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|4th Cavalry Division]], [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|5th Cavalry Division]] and [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Australian Mounted Division]]s which almost encircled two Ottoman armies in the Judean Hills [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|forcing their retreat]]. Meanwhile, [[Chaytor's Force]] of infantry and mounted infantry in ANZAC Mounted Division [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918)|held the Jordan Valley]], covering the right flank to later advance eastwards to [[Third Transjordan attack|capture Es Salt and Amman]] and half of a third Ottoman army. A subsequent pursuit by the [[Charge at Irbid|4th Cavalry Division]] and the [[Battle of Jisr Benat Yakub|Australian Mounted Division]] followed by the [[Charge at Kiswe|5th Cavalry Division]] to [[Damascus]].

There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.\n\nCavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komar\u00f3w]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.\n[[File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Lithuania]]n lancers training in the 1930s]]\nThe post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nThe [[British Army]] mechanised all cavalry regiments between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.\n\nDuring the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.\n\nThe thirty-nine cavalry regiments of the [[British Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanization began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanized initially, in the majority of cases, to motorized infantry transported in 15cwt trucks.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=382|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}</ref> The last horsed regiment of the British Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its final mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists in the Pakistan Army as an armored regiment.\n\n===World War II===\nWhile most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns. Rather than charge their mounts into battle, cavalry units were either used as mounted infantry (using horses to move into position and then dismounting for combat) or as reconnaissance units (especially in areas not suited to tracked or wheeled vehicles).\n\n====Polish====\n[[File:Polski u\u0142an z karabinem przeciwpancernym UR.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Polish [[uhlan]] with [[wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]]. Military instruction published in [[Warsaw]] in 1938.]]\nA popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zaloga\n | first = S.

First, because motorised vehicles were in short supply, the Poles used horses to pull anti-tank weapons into position.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Time Staff|date=April 22, 1940|number= |title= The New Pictures|journal= Time|volume= |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763905-1,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-17}}</ref> Second, there were a few incidents when Polish cavalry was trapped by German tanks, and attempted to fight free. However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.<ref name=Davies324>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.<ref name=Davies325>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-054-1525-26, Frankreich, Kavallerie am Ausgang eines Dorfes.jpg|thumb|left|A German cavalry patrol in May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].]]\nA more correct term would be \"mounted infantry\" instead of \"cavalry\", as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, and in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]] included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), the [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapons, anti tank artillery such as the [[Bofors 37 mm]], also light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the [[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d]], when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.\n\nThe last classical cavalry charge of the war took place on March 1, 1945 during the [[Battle of Schoenfeld]] by the 1st \"Warsaw\" Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the \"Warsaw\"s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.\n\n====Greek====\nThe [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanized) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.<ref>''The Armed Forces of World War II 1914\u20131945'', Andrew Mollo, {{ISBN|0-85613-296-9}}</ref>\n\n====Soviet====\nBy the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops. The main usage of Soviet cavalry involved infiltration through front lines with subsequent deep raids, which disorganised German supply lines. Another role was the pursuit of retreating enemy forces during major frontline operations and breakthroughs.\n\n====Italian====\nThe last mounted sabre charge by Italian cavalry occurred on August 24, 1942 at [[Isbuscenskij Charge|Isbuscenski]] (Russia), when a squadron of the Savoia Cavalry Regiment charged the 812th Siberian Infantry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment, together with the Novara Lancers made a dismounted attack in an action that ended with the retreat of the Russians after heavy losses on both sides.<ref>Jeffrey T. Fowler, p. 45 \"Axis Cavalry in World War II, {{ISBN|1-84176-323-3}}</ref> The final Italian cavalry action occurred on October 17, 1942 in Poloj (now Croatia) by a squadron of the Alexandria Cavalry Regiment against a large group of Yugoslav partisans.\n\n====Other Axis====\nRomanian, Hungarian and Italian cavalry were dispersed or disbanded following the retreat of the Axis forces from Russia.<ref>Jeffrey T.

The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Myanmar]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)]], charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.\n\n====Mongolia====\n[[File:Battle of Khalkhin Gol-Mongolian cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Mongolian cavalry in the Khalkhin Gol (1939)]]\n\nIn the early stages of World War II, mounted units of the Mongolian People's Army were involved in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against invading Japanese forces. Soviet forces under the command of Georgy Zhukov, together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars. After the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941, Mongolia remained neutral throughout most of the war, but its geographical situation meant that the country served as a buffer between Japanese forces and the Soviet Union. In addition to keeping around 10% of the population under arms, Mongolia provided half a million trained horses for use by the Soviet Army. In 1945 a partially mounted Soviet-Mongolian [[Cavalry Mechanized Group]] played a supporting role on the western flank of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The last active service seen by cavalry units of the Mongolian Army occurred in 1946\u20131948, during border clashes between Mongolia and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\n===Post\u2013World War II to present day===\n\n[[File:US soldiers on horseback 1991 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] and [[Combat Controller]]s on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]\nWhile most modern \"cavalry\" units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (DF) includes a \"Cavalry Corps\" equipped with armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The DF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort of [[Blue Hussars]] drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.\n\nSome engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahi]]s to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954\u201362). The [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. The [[Portuguese Army]] used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique]] in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1964\u201379 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]] period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.\n\nCentral and South American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Asia, Europe, or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid-1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=English|first=Adrian J.|date=May 1985 |title=Armed Forces of Latin America:Their Histories, Development, Present Strength and Military Potential|url= |location= |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|page= |isbn=978-0710603210 |access-date= }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].<ref>Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n====Operational horse cavalry====\nToday the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest existing horse-mounted cavalry unit still having operational potential.<ref>[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703113133/http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html |date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated [[Imperial Service Troops|state cavalry]] squadrons of [[Gwalior]], [[Jodhpur]], and [[Mysore]].

The PLA mounted units last saw action during border clashes with [[Vietnam]] in the 1970s and 80s, after which most cavalry units were disbanded as part of the major military downsizing of the 1980s.\nIn the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there were calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain. Subsequent Chinese media reporting<ref>''Global Times'' 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011</ref> confirms that the Chinese Army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region for scouting and logistical purposes.\n\nThe [[Chilean Army]] still maintains a mixed armoured cavalry regiment, with elements of it acting as mounted mountain exploration troops, based in the city of [[Angol]], being part of the III Mountain Division<ref>[[:es:Regimiento de Caballer\u00eda n.\u00ba 3 \"H\u00fasares\"]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}, and another independent exploration cavalry detachment in the town of [[Chaiten]].

The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].\n\nEarly light cavalry (like the [[auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliaries of the Roman army]]) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy [[projectile|missile]] troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cataphract]] were used as shock troops\u2014they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term \"battle cavalry\".<ref>p. 490, Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry units still retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes, and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.\n\nSince the development of [[armored warfare]], the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while [[medium tank|medium]] and [[heavy tank]]s are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].\n\n==Social status==\nFrom the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.\n\nFor this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of lightly armed [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasant levies came into conflict, the poorly trained footmen would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.\n\nIn later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the [[line infantry]] regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their [[Royal Guards|royal or imperial guards]]. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards, through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Imperial Guard]] an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.\n\n==On film==\nSome sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', which featured some 2,000 cavalrymen,<ref>{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J.

''cheval'' 'horse') or '''horsemen''' are [[soldier]]s or [[warrior]]s who [[Horses in warfare|fight mounted]] on [[horseback]]. Cavalry were historically the most mobile of the [[combat arms]]. An individual soldier in the cavalry is known by a number of designations such as '''cavalryman''', '''horseman''', '''[[dragoon]]''', or '''[[trooper (rank)|trooper]]'''. The designation of cavalry was not usually given to any [[Military animal|military forces that used other animals]], such as [[Camel cavalry|camels]], mules or [[War elephant|elephants]]. [[Infantry]] who moved on horseback, but dismounted to fight on foot, were known in the 17th and early 18th centuries as [[dragoon]]s, a class of [[mounted infantry]] which later evolved into cavalry proper while retaining their historic title.\n\nCavalry had the advantage of improved mobility, and a man fighting from horseback also had the advantages of greater height, speed, and [[inertial mass]] over an opponent on foot. Another element of horse mounted warfare is the psychological impact a mounted soldier can inflict on an opponent.\n\nThe speed, mobility, and shock value of cavalry was greatly appreciated and exploited in armed forces in the [[Ancient era|Ancient]] and [[Horses in the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]]; some forces were mostly cavalry, particularly in [[eurasian nomads|nomadic societies of Asia]], notably the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]] and the later [[Mongol Army|Mongol armies]].<ref>\nJohn Keegan, pages 188-189, ''[[A History of Warfare]],'' {{ISBN|0-09-174527-6}}\n</ref> In Europe cavalry became increasingly [[Heavy cavalry|armoured (heavy)]], and eventually evolving into the mounted [[knight]]s of the medieval period. During the 17th century cavalry in Europe lost most of its armor, ineffective against the muskets and cannon which were coming into use, and by the mid-19th century armor had mainly fallen into disuse, although some regiments retained a small thickened [[cuirass]] that offered protection against lances and sabres and some protection against shot.\n\nIn [[Interwar period|the period]] between the [[World Wars]], many cavalry units were converted into [[motorized infantry]] and [[mechanized infantry]] units, or reformed as tank troops. However, some cavalry still served during [[World War II]], notably in the [[Red Army]], the [[Mongolian People's Army]], the [[Royal Italian Army]], the [[Romania in World War II|Romanian Army]], the [[Polish Land Forces]], and light reconnaissance units within the [[Waffen SS]]. Most cavalry units that are horse-mounted in modern armies serve in purely ceremonial roles, or as mounted infantry in difficult terrain such as mountains or heavily forested areas. Modern usage of the term generally refers to units performing the role of [[reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition]] (RSTA).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Role of cavalry==\n{{Main|Cavalry tactics}}\n[[File:Rytter fra Bagirmi.jpg|thumb|upright|African horseman of [[Kingdom of Baguirmi|Baguirmi]] in full [[gambeson|padded armour]] suit]]\n\nIn many modern armies, the term ''cavalry'' is still often used to refer to units that are a [[Combat Arms|combat arm]] of the [[armed forces]] which in the past filled the traditional horse-borne land combat [[light cavalry]] roles. These include [[reconnaissance|scouting]], [[skirmishing]] with enemy reconnaissance elements to deny them knowledge of the disposition of the main body of troops, forward security, offensive [[Reconnaissance#Reconnaissance-in-force|reconnaissance by combat]], defensive screening of friendly forces during retrograde movement, [[retreat (military)|retreat]], restoration of command and control, deception, battle handover and passage of lines, [[relief in place]], linkup, [[Breakout (military)|breakout]] operations, and [[Raid (military)|raiding]]. The [[shock attack|shock]] role, traditionally filled by [[heavy cavalry]], is generally filled by [[Military unit|unit]]s with the \"[[Armoured warfare|armored]]\" designation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Assyriancavalry.JPG|thumb|left|[[Assyrian cavalry]]]]\n\nBefore the [[Iron Age]], the role of cavalry on the battlefield was largely performed by light [[chariot]]s. The chariot originated with the [[Sintashta-Petrovka]] culture in [[Central Asia]] and spread by [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic [[Indo-Iranians]].<ref>p. 1, Menon</ref> The chariot was quickly adopted by settled peoples both as a military technology and an object of ceremonial status, especially by the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] from 1550 BC as well as the [[Assyrian army]] and [[Babylonia]]n royalty.<ref>Terrence Wise, p. 18, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nThe power of mobility given by mounted units was recognized early on, but was offset by the difficulty of raising large forces and by the inability of [[horse]]s (then mostly small) to carry heavy [[armor]]. Nonetheless, there are indications that, from the 15th century BC onwards, horseback riding was practiced amongst the military elites of the great states of the ancient Near East, most notably those in [[Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the [[Hittite Empire]], and [[Mycenaean Greece]] <ref> https://www.academia.edu/1532320/Horseback_riding_and_Cavalry_in_Mycenaean_Greece</ref>.\n\nCavalry techniques, and the rise of true cavalry, were an innovation of [[equestrian nomad]]s of the Central Asian and [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] steppe and [[pastoral farming|pastoralist]] [[tribe]]s such as the [[Persian people|Iranic]] [[Parthia]]ns and [[Sarmatians]].\n[[File:ParthianHorseman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parthian horseman, now on display at the [[Palazzo Madama, Turin]].]]\n\nThe photograph above left shows Assyrian cavalry from reliefs of 865\u2013860 BC. At this time, the men had no [[spur]]s, [[saddle]]s, [[saddle cloth]]s, or [[stirrup]]s. Fighting from the back of a horse was much more difficult than mere riding. The cavalry acted in pairs; the reins of the [[mounted archer]] were controlled by his neighbour's hand. Even at this early time, cavalry used swords, shields, and bows. The sculpture implies two types of cavalry, but this might be a simplification by the artist. Later images of Assyrian cavalry show saddle cloths as primitive saddles, allowing each archer to control his own horse.<ref>Terrence Wise, plate H, \"Ancient Armies of the Middle East\", Osprey Publishing Ltd 1981 {{ISBN|0-85045-384-4}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 490 BC a [[Nisean horse|breed of large horses]] was bred in the [[Nisaean plain]] in Media to carry [[Cataphract|men with increasing amounts of armour]] (Herodotus 7,40 & 9,20), but large horses were still very exceptional at this time. By the fourth century BC the Chinese during the [[Warring States period]] (403&ndash;221 BC) began to use cavalry against rival states,<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\">Ebrey and others, ''Pre-Modern East Asia'', pp. 29&ndash;30.</ref> and by 331 BC when [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians the use of chariots in battle was obsolete in most nations; despite a few ineffective attempts to revive [[scythed chariot]]s. The last recorded use of chariots as a shock force in continental Europe was during the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=164|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\nHowever, chariots remained in use for ceremonial purposes such as carrying the victorious general in a [[Roman triumph]], or for racing.\n\nOutside of mainland Europe, the southern [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] met [[Julius Caesar]] with chariots in [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|55 and 54 BC]], but by the time of the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a century later chariots were obsolete, even in Britannia. The last mention of chariot use in Britain was by the [[Caledonia]]ns at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius|Mons Graupius]], in 84 AD.\n\n===Ancient Greece: city-states, Thebes, Thessaly and Macedonia===\n[[File:Amphora Louvre F12.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Warrior's departure; an [[Athens|Athenian]] [[amphora]] dated 550\u2013540 BC.]]\n{{main|hippeis|companion cavalry}}\n\nDuring the classical Greek period cavalry were usually limited to those citizens who could afford expensive war-horses. Three types of cavalry became common: light cavalry, whose riders, armed with [[javelin]]s, could harass and skirmish; heavy cavalry, whose troopers, using [[lance]]s, had the ability to close in on their opponents; and finally those whose equipment allowed them to fight either on horseback or foot. The role of horsemen did however remain secondary to that of the [[hoplites]] or heavy infantry who comprised the main strength of the citizen levies of the various city states.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=37|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nCavalry played a relatively minor role in [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-states]], with conflicts decided by massed armored infantry. However, [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] produced [[Pelopidas]], their first great cavalry commander, whose tactics and skills were absorbed by [[Phillip II of Macedon]] when Phillip was a guest-hostage in Thebes. [[Thessaly]] was widely known for producing competent cavalrymen,<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=18|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> and later experiences in wars both with and against the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]s taught the [[Greeks]] the value of cavalry in skirmishing and pursuit. The [[Athens|Athenian]] author and soldier [[Xenophon]] in particular advocated the creation of a small but well-trained cavalry force; to that end, he wrote several manuals on horsemanship and cavalry operations.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Warry|page=54|title=Warfare in the Classical World|ISBN=0-86101-034-5}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Macedon]]ian Kingdom in the north, on the other hand, developed a strong cavalry force that culminated in the ''hetairoi'' ([[Companion cavalry]])<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=17|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref> of Philip II of Macedon and [[Alexander the Great]]. In addition to these heavy cavalry, the Macedonian army also employed lighter horsemen<ref>{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Sekunda|page=42|title=Macedonian Armies after Alexander 323-168 BC|ISBN=978-1-84908-714-8}}</ref> called [[prodromoi]] for scouting and screening, as well as the [[Macedonian phalanx|Macedonian pike phalanx]] and various kinds of [[light infantry]]. There were also the ''Ippiko'' (or \"Horserider\"), Greek \"heavy\" cavalry, armed with [[Kontos (weapon)|kontos]] (or cavalry lance), and sword. These wore leather armour or mail plus a helmet. They were medium rather than heavy cavalry, meaning that they were better suited to be scouts, skirmishers, and pursuers rather than front line fighters. The effectiveness of this combination of cavalry and infantry helped to break enemy lines and was most dramatically demonstrated in Alexander's conquests of [[Persia]], [[Bactria]], and northwestern India.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=14\u201322|title=The Army of Alexander the Great|ISBN=0-85045-539-1}}</ref>\n\n===Roman Republic and Early Empire===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n{{main|Roman cavalry}}\n[[File:K\u00f6ln Reitergrabmal.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Tombstone of a Roman [[auxilia]]ry trooper from [[History of Cologne|Cologne]], Germany. Second half of the first century AD]]\n\nThe cavalry in the early [[Roman Republic]] remained the preserve of the wealthy [[landed class]] known as the ''[[equites]]''\u2014men who could afford the expense of maintaining a horse in addition to arms and armor heavier than those of the common [[Roman legion|legion]]s. Horses were provided by the Republic and could be withdrawn if neglected or misused, together with the status of being a cavalryman.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=36|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref>\n\nAs the class grew to be more of a social elite instead of a functional property-based military grouping, the Romans began to employ Italian [[socii]] for filling the ranks of their cavalry. The weakness of Roman cavalry was demonstrated by Hannibal Barca during the [[Second Punic War]] where he used his superior mounted forces to win several battles. The most notable of these was the [[Battle of Cannae]], where he inflicted a catastrophic defeat on the Romans. At about the same time the Romans began to recruit foreign auxiliary cavalry from among [[Gauls]], [[Iberians]], and [[Numidians]], the last being highly valued as mounted skirmishers and scouts (see [[Numidian cavalry]]). [[Julius Caesar]] had a high opinion of his escort of Germanic mixed cavalry, giving rise to the ''[[cohors equitata|Cohortes Equitatae]]''. Early emperors maintained an [[Ala (Roman cavalry unit)|ala]] of [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an cavalry as their [[Germanic bodyguard|personal bodyguards]] until the unit was dismissed by [[Galba]] after the [[Batavian Rebellion]].\n\nFor the most part, Roman cavalry during the early Republic functioned as an adjunct to the legionary infantry and formed only one-fifth of the standing force comprising a consular army. Except in times of major mobilisation about 1,800 horsemen were maintained, with three hundred attached to each legion.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|pages=36\u201337|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThe relatively low ratio of horsemen to infantry does not mean that the utility of cavalry should be underestimated, as its strategic role in scouting, skirmishing, and outpost duties was crucial to the Romans' capability to conduct operations over long distances in hostile or unfamiliar territory. On some occasions Roman cavalry also proved its ability to strike a decisive tactical blow against a weakened or unprepared enemy, such as the final charge at the [[Battle of Aquilonia]].\n\nAfter defeats such as the [[Battle of Carrhae]], the Romans learned the importance of large cavalry formations from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Negin|page=6|title=Roman heavy Cavalry (1) Cataphractarii & Clibanarii, 1st Century BC-5th Century AD.|ISBN=978-1-4728-3004-3}}</ref> \nAt the same time heavy spears and shields modelled on those favoured by the horsemen of the Greek city-states were adopted to replace the lighter weaponry of early Rome.<ref>{{cite book|first=Nick|last=Sekunda|page=38|title=Republican Roman Army 200-104 BC|ISBN=1-85532-598-5}}</ref> \nThese improvements in tactics and equipment reflected those of a thousand years earlier when the first Iranians to reach the [[Iranian Plateau]] forced the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] to undertake similar reform. Nonetheless, the Romans would continue to rely mainly on their [[heavy infantry]] supported by auxiliary cavalry.\n\n===Late Roman Empire and the Migration Period===\n[[File:Roman Cavalry 1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reenactor as a Roman [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary]] cavalryman.]]\n\nIn the army of the late [[Roman Empire]], cavalry played an increasingly important role. The [[Spatha]], the classical sword throughout most of the 1st millennium was adopted as the standard model for the Empire's cavalry forces.\n\nThe most widespread employment of heavy cavalry at this time was found in the forces of the Iranian empires, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]s and their [[Persians|Persian]] [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] successors. Both, but especially the former, were famed for the [[cataphract]] (fully armored cavalry armed with lances) even though the majority of their forces consisted of lighter [[horse archer]]s. The West first encountered this eastern heavy cavalry during the [[Hellenistic period]] with further intensive contacts during the eight centuries of the [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]. At first the Parthians' mobility greatly confounded the Romans, whose armoured close-order infantry proved unable to match the speed of the Parthians. However, later the Romans would successfully adapt such heavy armor and cavalry tactics by creating their own units of cataphracts and ''clibanarii''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/mhq/blromespersianmirage/ |title=Roman-Persian Wars |work=Historynet.com |accessdate=November 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe decline of the Roman infrastructure made it more difficult to field large infantry forces, and during the 4th and 5th centuries cavalry began to take a more dominant role on the European battlefield, also in part made possible by the appearance of new, larger breeds of horses. The replacement of the Roman [[horse tack|saddle]] by variants on the Scythian model, with [[pommel (saddle)|pommel]] and cantle,<ref>The raised rear part of a saddle</ref> was also a significant factor as was the adoption of [[stirrup]]s and the concomitant increase in stability of the rider's seat. Armored cataphracts began to be deployed in eastern Europe and the Near East, following the precedents established by [[History of Iran|Persia]]n forces, as the main striking force of the armies in contrast to the earlier roles of cavalry as scouts, raiders, and outflankers.\n\nThe late-Roman cavalry tradition of organized units in a standing army differed fundamentally from the nobility of the Germanic invaders\u2014individual warriors who could afford to provide their own horses and equipment. While there was no direct linkage with these predecessors the early medieval knight also developed as a member of a social and martial elite, able to meet the considerable expenses required by his role from grants of land and other incomes.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter |last=Newark|pages=23\u201324|title=Sabre & Lance.

As European states began to assume the character of bureaucratic [[nation-states]] supporting professional standing armies, recruitment of these mounted warriors was undertaken in order to fill the strategic roles of scouts and raiders.\n[[File:DiezAlbumsArmedRiders II.jpg|thumb|Mongols at war 14th century]]\n\nThe best known instance of the continued employment of mounted tribal auxiliaries were the Cossack cavalry regiments of the [[Russian Empire]].

The [[naval history of China]] was centered more to the south, where mountains, rivers, and large lakes necessitated the employment of a large and well-kept [[Naval warfare|navy]].\n\nIn 307 BC, [[King Wuling of Zhao]], the ancient Chinese ruler of the former [[Jin (Chinese state)|State of Jin]] territory, ordered his military commanders and troops to adopt the [[trousers]] of the [[nomad]]s as well as practice the nomads' form of mounted archery to hone their new cavalry skills.<ref name=\"ebrey 29 30\" />\n\n[[File:Emperor Taizongs horses by Yan Liben.jpg|thumb|right|A bas-[[relief]] of a soldier and horse with saddle and [[stirrup]]s, from the tomb of Chinese [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r 626\u2013649), c 650]]\nThe adoption of massed cavalry in China also broke the tradition of the [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]-riding [[Four occupations|Chinese aristocracy]] in battle, which had been in use since the ancient [[Shang Dynasty]] (c 1600\u20131050 BC).<ref name=\"ebrey 29\">Ebrey, 29.</ref> By this time large Chinese infantry-based armies of 100,000 to 200,000 troops were now buttressed with several hundred thousand mounted cavalry in support or as an effective striking force.<ref name=\"ebrey 30\">Ebrey, 30.</ref> The handheld pistol-and-trigger [[crossbow]] was invented in China in the fourth century BC;<ref name=\"ebrey cambridge 41\">Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 41.</ref> it was written by the [[Song dynasty]] scholars Zeng Gongliang, Ding Du, and Yang Weide in their book ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' (1044 AD) that massed missile fire by crossbowmen was the most effective defense against enemy cavalry charges.<ref name=\"peers 130\">Peers, 130. we can right anything</ref>\n\n[[File:The Qianlong Emperor in Ceremonial Armour on Horseback.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in ceremonial armor on horseback, painted by [[Giuseppe Castiglione (1688\u20131766)|Giuseppe Castiglione]], dated 1739 or 1758]]\nOn many occasions the Chinese studied nomadic cavalry tactics and applied the lessons in creating their own potent cavalry forces, while in others they simply recruited the tribal horsemen wholesale into their armies; and in yet other cases nomadic empires proved eager to enlist Chinese infantry and engineering, as in the case of the [[Mongol Empire]] and its sinicized part, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279\u20131368). The Chinese recognized early on during the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) that they were at a disadvantage in lacking the number of horses the northern nomadic peoples mustered in their armies. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r 141\u201387 BC) went to war with the [[Dayuan]] for this reason, since the Dayuan were hoarding a massive amount of tall, strong, Central Asian bred horses in the [[Hellenized]]\u2013[[Greeks|Greek]] region of [[Fergana]] (established slightly earlier by [[Alexander the Great]]). Although experiencing some defeats early on in the campaign, Emperor Wu's war from 104 BC to 102 BC succeeded in gathering the prized tribute of horses from Fergana.\n\nCavalry tactics in China were enhanced by the invention of the saddle-attached [[stirrup]] by at least the 4th century, as the oldest reliable depiction of a rider with paired stirrups was found in a [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin Dynasty]] tomb of the year 322 AD.<ref name=\"Dien\">[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/stirrup.shtml Dien, Albert. \"THE STIRRUP AND ITS EFFECT ON CHINESE MILITARY HISTORY\"]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013231319/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1988_Oct/ai_6955868 \"The stirrup \u2013 history of Chinese science\".

He reorganized the Goryeo military into a professional army that would contain decent and well-trained cavalry units. In 1107, the Jurchen were ultimately defeated, and surrendered to Yun Gwan. To mark the victory, General Yun built nine fortresses to the northeast of the Goryeo\u2013Jurchen borders (\ub3d9\ubd81 9\uc131, \u6771\u5317 \u4e5d\u57ce).[[File:Samurai on horseback.png|thumb|upright|A mounted [[samurai]] with bow and arrows, wearing a horned helmet.

The emergence of the [[samurai]] aristocracy led to the development of armoured horse archers, themselves to develop into charging [[lancer]] cavalry as gunpowder weapons rendered bows obsolete.\n\nAn example is Yabusame (\u6d41\u93d1\u99ac?), a type of mounted archery in traditional Japanese archery. An archer on a running horse shoots three special \"turnip-headed\" arrows successively at three wooden targets.\n\nThis style of archery has its origins at the beginning of the Kamakura period. Minamoto no Yoritomo became alarmed at the lack of archery skills his samurai had. He organized yabusame as a form of practice.\nCurrently, the best places to see yabusame performed are at the Tsurugaoka Hachiman-g\u016b in Kamakura and Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto (during Aoi Matsuri in early May). It is also performed in Samukawa and on the beach at Zushi, as well as other locations.\n\nKasagake or Kasakake (\u7b20\u61f8, \u304b\u3055\u304c\u3051 lit. \"hat shooting\") is a type of Japanese mounted archery. In contrast to yabusame, the types of targets are various and the archer shoots without stopping the horse. While yabusame has been played as a part of formal ceremonies, kasagake has developed as a game or practice of martial arts, focusing on technical elements of horse archery.\n\n===South Asia===\nIn the Indian subcontinent, cavalry played a major role from the [[Gupta Dynasty]] (320\u2013600) period onwards.

The arms and armour for heavy cavalry increased, the high-backed [[saddle]] developed, and [[stirrup]]s and [[spur]]s were added, increasing the advantage of heavy cavalry even more.\n\nThis shift in military importance was reflected in society as well; [[knight]]s took centre stage both on and off the battlefield. These are considered the \"ultimate\" in heavy cavalry: well-equipped with the best weapons, state-of-the-art armour from head to foot, leading with the [[lance]] in battle in a full-gallop, close-formation \"knightly charge\" that might prove irresistible, winning the battle almost as soon as it begun.\n\n[[File:BritLibAddMS35166ApocalypseUnkFolio3SealBlackHorse.jpg|thumb|right|A 13th-century depiction of a riding horse.

While mounted men-at-arms focused on a narrow combat role of shock combat, medieval armies relied on a large variety of foot troops to fulfill all the rest ([[skirmishing]], flank guards, scouting, holding ground, etc.). Medieval chroniclers tended to pay undue attention to the knights at the expense of the common soldiers, which led early students of military history to suppose that heavy cavalry was the only force that mattered on medieval European battlefields. But well-trained and disciplined infantry could defeat knights.\n\nMassed [[English longbow]]men triumphed over French cavalry at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]], [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]] and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], while at [[Battle of Gisors|Gisors]] (1188), [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] (1314), and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]] (1339),<ref>{{cite book|first=H.W.|last=Koch|page=[https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189 189]|title=Medieval Warfare|ISBN=0-86124-008-1|url=https://archive.org/details/medievalwarfare00koch/page/189}}</ref> foot-soldiers proved they could resist cavalry charges as long as they held their formation. Once the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] developed their [[pike square]]s for offensive as well as defensive use, infantry started to become the principal arm. This aggressive new doctrine gave the Swiss victory over a range of adversaries, and their enemies found that the only reliable way to defeat them was by the use of an even more comprehensive [[combined arms]] doctrine, as evidenced in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. The introduction of missile weapons that required less skill than the longbow, such as the [[crossbow]] and [[hand cannon]], also helped remove the focus somewhat from cavalry elites to masses of cheap infantry equipped with easy-to-learn weapons. These missile weapons were very successfully used in the [[Hussite Wars]], in combination with [[Wagenburg]] tactics.\n\nThis gradual rise in the dominance of infantry led to the adoption of dismounted tactics. From the earliest times knights and mounted men-at-arms had frequently dismounted to handle enemies they could not overcome on horseback, such as in the [[Battle of the Dyle]] (891) and the [[Battle of Bremule]] (1119), but after the 1350s this trend became more marked with the dismounted men-at-arms fighting as super-heavy infantry with two-handed [[sword]]s and [[poleaxe]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In any case, warfare in the Middle Ages tended to be dominated by raids and sieges rather than pitched battles, and mounted men-at-arms rarely had any choice other than dismounting when faced with the prospect of assaulting a fortified position.\n\n===Greater Middle East===\n{{main|Religious war|Muslim conquests}}\n\n====Arabs====\n{{main|Mobile guard|List of battles of Muhammad}}\n[[File:Ikhwan.jpg|thumb|left|Arab [[Camel cavalry|camelry]]]]\n\nThe Islamic Prophet Muhammad made use of cavalry in many of his military campaigns including the [[Expedition of Dhu Qarad]],<ref>Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 231.

Its main role was to attack the enemy flanks and rear. These relatively lightly armored horsemen formed the most effective element of the Muslim armies during the later stages of the Islamic conquest of the Levant. The best use of this lightly armed fast moving cavalry was revealed at the '''[[Battle of Yarmouk]]''' (636 AD) in which [[Khalid ibn Walid]], knowing the skills of his horsemen, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage, disengage, then turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign of Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name ''Mutaharrik tulai'a''( \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0631\u0643 \u0637\u0644\u064a\u0639\u0629 ), or the [[Mobile guard]]. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that give it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine]] army.

The elite corps were the ''ahadi'' who provided direct service to the Emperor and acted as guard cavalry. Supplementary cavalry or ''dakhilis'' were recruited, equipped and paid by the central state. This was in contrast to the ''tabinan'' horsemen who were the followers of individual noblemen. Their training and equipment varied widely but they made up the backbone of the Mughal cavalry. Finally there were tribal irregulars led by and loyal to tributary chiefs. These included Hindus, Afghans and Turks summoned for military service when their autonomous leaders were called on by the Imperial government.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dr. David|last=Nicolle|pages=10\u201311|title=Mughul India 1504\u20131761|ISBN=1-85532-344-3}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mughal Troops Chase the Armies of Da'ud.jpg|Akbar leads the [[Mughal Army]] during a campaign.\n</gallery>\n\n===Renaissance Europe===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (8).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.9|Knighted cavalry and noblemen, painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (c. 1390\u20131441).]]\nIronically, the rise of infantry in the early 16th century coincided with the \"golden age\" of heavy cavalry; a French or Spanish army at the beginning of the century could have up to half its numbers made up of various kinds of light and heavy cavalry, whereas in earlier medieval and later 17th-century armies the proportion of cavalry was seldom more than a quarter.\n\nKnighthood largely lost its military functions and became more closely tied to social and economic prestige in an increasingly capitalistic Western society. With the rise of drilled and trained infantry, the mounted men-at-arms, now sometimes called ''[[gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]]'' and often part of the standing army themselves, adopted the same role as in the Hellenistic age, that of delivering a decisive blow once the battle was already engaged, either by charging the enemy in the flank or attacking their commander-in-chief.\n\n[[File:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Polish hussars|Husarz]]'' (Polish Hussar) by [[J\u00f3zef Brandt]].]]\n\nFrom the 1550s onwards, the use of [[Gunpowder warfare|gunpowder weapons]] solidified infantry's dominance of the battlefield and began to allow true mass armies to develop. This is closely related to the increase in the size of armies throughout the early modern period; heavily armored cavalrymen were expensive to raise and maintain and it took years to replace a skilled horseman or a trained horse, while [[arquebusier]]s and later [[musketeer]]s could be trained and kept in the field at much lower cost, and were much easier to replace.\n\nThe Spanish [[tercio]] and later formations relegated cavalry to a supporting role. The [[pistol]] was specifically developed to try to bring cavalry back into the conflict, together with manoeuvres such as the [[caracole]]. The caracole was not particularly successful, however, and the charge (whether with sword, pistol, or lance) remained as the primary mode of employment for many types of European cavalry, although by this time it was delivered in much deeper formations and with greater discipline than before. The [[demi-lancer]]s and the heavily armored sword-and-pistol [[reiter]]s were among the types of cavalry whose heyday was in the 16th and 17th centuries, as for the [[Polish Hussars|Polish winged hussars]], a heavy cavalry force that achieved great success against [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Russians]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].\n\n===18th-century Europe and Napoleonic Wars===\n[[File:Battle of Eylau 1807 by Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on.jpg|thumb|left|Cavalry charge at [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]], painted by [[Jean-Antoine-Sim\u00e9on Fort]].]]\n\nCavalry retained an important role in this age of regularization and standardization across European armies. First and foremost they remained the primary choice for confronting enemy cavalry. Attacking an unbroken infantry force head-on usually resulted in failure, but extended linear infantry formations were vulnerable to flank or rear attacks. Cavalry was important at [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Rossbach|Rossbach]] (1757), [[Battle of Eylau|Eylau]] and [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]] (1807), remaining significant throughout the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nEven with the increasing prominence of infantry, cavalry still had an important place in armies. They often patrolled the fringes of army encampments, with standing orders to intercept and kill suspected shirkers and deserters on sight.<ref name=MattWhite/>{{rp|257, 266}} Cavalry units also served as [[Picket (military)|outpost pickets]] in advance of the main body. During battle they might charge and override artillery cannon, plugging the touchholes with iron spikes. They also pursued enemy infantrymen who had broken from formation, as well as snipers. <ref name=MattWhite>{{cite book|title=[[The Great Big Book of Horrible Things]]|last=White|first=Matthew|authorlink=Matthew White (atrocitologist)|publisher=[[W.

However, in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], repeated [[Battle of Waterloo#The French cavalry attack|charges by up to 9,000 French cavalrymen]] failed to break the line of the British and German infantry, who had formed [[Infantry square|square]]s.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/battle_waterloo_01.shtml#five BBC History: The Battle of Waterloo]</ref>\n\nMassed infantry was deadly to cavalry, but offered an excellent target for [[artillery]]. Once the bombardment had disordered the infantry formation, cavalry were able to [[rout]] and pursue the scattered foot soldiers. It was not until individual firearms gained accuracy and improved rates of fire that cavalry was diminished in this role as well. Even then light cavalry remained an indispensable tool for scouting, screening the army's movements, and harassing the enemy's supply lines until military aircraft supplanted them in this role in the early stages of [[World War I]].\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The charge of the Venezuelan First Division's cavalry at the [[Battle of Carabobo]].]]\n\n====Europe====\nBy the 19th century, European cavalry fell into four main categories:\n\n* [[Cuirassier]]s, heavy cavalry\n* [[Dragoon]]s, originally mounted infantry but later regarded as medium cavalry\n* [[Hussar]]s, light cavalry\n* [[Lancer]]s or [[Uhlan]]s, light cavalry armed with [[lance]]s\n\nThere were cavalry variations for individual nations as well: France had the ''chasseurs \u00e0 cheval''; Prussia had the ''J\u00e4ger zu Pferd''; Bavaria, Saxony and Austria<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Knotel|pages=24, 182 & 230|title=Uniforms of the World.

The British and French armies dismounted many of their cavalry regiments and used them in infantry and other roles: the [[Life Guards (British Army)|Life Guards]] for example spent the last months of the War as a machine gun corps; and the [[Australian Light Horse]] served as light infantry during the Gallipoli campaign.

While employed effectively against their Austro-Hungarian counterparts during the initial offensives across the [[Isonzo River]], the Italian mounted forces ceased to have a significant role as the front shifted into mountainous terrain. By 1916 all cavalry machine-gun sections and two complete cavalry divisions had been dismounted and seconded to the infantry.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Nicolle|pages=34\u201335|title=The Italian Army of World War I|ISBN=1-84176-398-5}}</ref>\n\nSome cavalry were retained as mounted troops behind the lines in anticipation of a penetration of the opposing trenches that it seemed would never come. [[Tank]]s, introduced on the Western Front by the British in September 1916, had the capacity to achieve such breakthroughs but did not have the reliable range to exploit them. In their first major use at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)]], the plan was for a cavalry division to follow behind the tanks, however they were not able to cross a canal because a tank had broken the only bridge.<ref>[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/battle_of_cambrai.htm History Learning Site: Battle of Cambrai]</ref> It was not until the German Army had been forced to retreat in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] of 1918, that cavalry were again able to operate in their intended role.

Their mounted charge succeeded after a [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|coordinated attack]] by the British Infantry and Yeomanry cavalry and the Australian and New Zealand Light Horse and Mounted Rifles brigades. A series of coordinated attacks by these [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] infantry and mounted troops were also successful at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], during which the British infantry divisions and the Desert Mounted Corps drove two Ottoman armies back to the Jaffa\u2014Jerusalem line. The infantry with mainly dismounted cavalry and mounted infantry fought in the [[Judean Hills]] to eventually almost encircle [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem]] which was occupied shortly after.\n\nDuring a pause in operations necessitated by the [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 on the Western Front joint infantry and mounted infantry attacks towards [[First Transjordan attack on Amman|Amman]] and [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt|Es Salt]] resulted in retreats back to the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] which continued to be occupied by mounted divisions during the summer of 1918.\n\nThe Australian Mounted Division was armed with swords and in September, after the successful [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|breaching]] of the Ottoman line on the Mediterranean coast by [[Battle of Sharon (1918)|the British Empire infantry]] XXI Corps was followed by cavalry attacks by the [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|4th Cavalry Division]], [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|5th Cavalry Division]] and [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Australian Mounted Division]]s which almost encircled two Ottoman armies in the Judean Hills [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|forcing their retreat]].

There was a general reduction in the number of cavalry regiments in the British, French, Italian and other Western armies but it was still argued with conviction (for example in the 1922 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'') that mounted troops had a major role to play in future warfare. The 1920s saw an interim period during which cavalry remained as a proud and conspicuous element of all major armies, though much less so than prior to 1914.\n\nCavalry was extensively used in the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Soviet-Polish War]]. The last major cavalry battle was the [[Battle of Komar\u00f3w]] in 1920, between Poland and the Russian Bolsheviks. Colonial warfare in Morocco, Syria, the Middle East and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier]] of India provided some opportunities for mounted action against enemies lacking advanced weaponry.\n[[File:Lietuvos kavalerija.Lithuanian cavalry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Lithuania]]n lancers training in the 1930s]]\nThe post-war German Army ([[Reichsheer]]) was permitted a large proportion of cavalry (18 regiments or 16.4% of total manpower) under the conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]].\n\nThe [[British Army]] mechanised all cavalry regiments between 1929 and 1941, redefining their role from horse to armoured vehicles to form the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] together with the [[Royal Tank Regiment]]. The U.S. Cavalry abandoned its sabres in 1934 and commenced the conversion of its horsed regiments to mechanized cavalry, starting with the First Regiment of Cavalry in January 1933.\n\nDuring the 1930s the French Army experimented with integrating mounted and mechanised cavalry units into larger formations. Dragoon regiments were converted to motorised infantry (trucks and motor cycles), and cuirassiers to armoured units; while light cavalry (Chasseurs a' Cheval, Hussars and Spahis) remained as mounted sabre squadrons. The theory was that mixed forces comprising these diverse units could utilise the strengths of each according to circumstances. In practice mounted troops proved unable to keep up with fast moving mechanised units over any distance.\n\nThe thirty-nine cavalry regiments of the [[British Indian Army]] were reduced to twenty-one as the result of a series of amalgamations immediately following World War I. The new establishment remained unchanged until 1936 when three regiments were redesignated as permanent training units, each with six, still mounted, regiments linked to them. In 1938 the process of mechanization began with the conversion of a full cavalry brigade (two Indian regiments and one British) to armoured car and tank units. By the end of 1940 all of the Indian cavalry had been mechanized initially, in the majority of cases, to motorized infantry transported in 15cwt trucks.<ref>{{cite book|first=David|last=Chandler|page=382|title=The Oxford History of the British Army|ISBN=0-19-285333-3}}</ref> The last horsed regiment of the British Indian Army (other than the Viceregal Bodyguard and some Indian States Forces regiments) was the 19th King George's Own Lancers which had its final mounted parade at Rawalpindi on 28 October 1939. This unit still exists in the Pakistan Army as an armored regiment.\n\n===World War II===\nWhile most armies still maintained cavalry units at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, significant mounted action was largely restricted to the Polish, Balkan and Soviet campaigns. Rather than charge their mounts into battle, cavalry units were either used as mounted infantry (using horses to move into position and then dismounting for combat) or as reconnaissance units (especially in areas not suited to tracked or wheeled vehicles).\n\n====Polish====\n[[File:Polski u\u0142an z karabinem przeciwpancernym UR.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|Polish [[uhlan]] with [[wz. 35 anti-tank rifle]]. Military instruction published in [[Warsaw]] in 1938.]]\nA popular myth is that [[Polish cavalry]] armed with lances charged German tanks during the September 1939 campaign. This arose from misreporting of a single clash on 1 September near Krojanty, when two squadrons of the Polish 18th Lancers armed with sabres scattered German infantry before being caught in the open by German armoured cars.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zaloga\n | first = S.

However, this did not mean that the Polish army chose to attack tanks with horse cavalry.<ref name=Davies324>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Later, on the Eastern Front, the [[Red Army]] did deploy cavalry units effectively against the Germans.<ref name=Davies325>Davies ''God's Playground Volume II'' p. 325</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-054-1525-26, Frankreich, Kavallerie am Ausgang eines Dorfes.jpg|thumb|left|A German cavalry patrol in May 1940, during the [[Battle of France]].]]\nA more correct term would be \"mounted infantry\" instead of \"cavalry\", as horses were primarily used as a means of transportation, for which they were very suitable in view of the very poor road conditions in pre-war Poland. Another myth describes Polish cavalry as being armed with both sabres and lances; lances were used for peacetime ceremonial purposes only and the primary weapon of the Polish cavalryman in 1939 was a rifle. Individual equipment did include a sabre, probably because of well-established tradition, and in the case of a melee combat this secondary weapon would probably be more effective than a rifle and bayonet. Moreover, the [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]] included, apart from the mounted soldiers themselves, light and heavy machine guns (wheeled), the [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35]], anti-aircraft weapons, anti tank artillery such as the [[Bofors 37 mm]], also light and scout tanks, etc. The last cavalry vs. cavalry mutual charge in Europe took place in Poland during the [[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d]], when Polish and German cavalry units clashed with each other.\n\nThe last classical cavalry charge of the war took place on March 1, 1945 during the [[Battle of Schoenfeld]] by the 1st \"Warsaw\" Independent Cavalry Brigade. Infantry and tanks had been employed to little effect against the German position, both of which floundered in the open wetlands only to be dominated by infantry and antitank fire from the German fortifications on the forward slope of Hill 157, overlooking the wetlands. The Germans had not taken cavalry into consideration when fortifying their position which, combined with the \"Warsaw\"s swift assault, overran the German anti-tank guns and consolidated into an attack into the village itself, now supported by infantry and tanks.\n\n====Greek====\nThe [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October 1940 saw mounted cavalry used effectively by the Greek defenders along the mountainous frontier with Albania. Three Greek cavalry regiments (two mounted and one partially mechanized) played an important role in the Italian defeat in this difficult terrain.<ref>''The Armed Forces of World War II 1914\u20131945'', Andrew Mollo, {{ISBN|0-85613-296-9}}</ref>\n\n====Soviet====\nBy the final stages of the war only the Soviet Union was still fielding mounted units in substantial numbers, some in combined mechanized and horse units. The advantage of this approach was that in exploitation mounted infantry could keep pace with advancing tanks. Other factors favouring the retention of mounted forces included the high quality of Russian [[Cossacks]] and other horse cavalry; and the relative lack of roads suitable for wheeled vehicles in many parts of the Eastern Front. Another consideration was that the logistic capacity required to support very large motorised forces exceeded that necessary for mounted troops. The main usage of Soviet cavalry involved infiltration through front lines with subsequent deep raids, which disorganised German supply lines. Another role was the pursuit of retreating enemy forces during major frontline operations and breakthroughs.\n\n====Italian====\nThe last mounted sabre charge by Italian cavalry occurred on August 24, 1942 at [[Isbuscenskij Charge|Isbuscenski]] (Russia), when a squadron of the Savoia Cavalry Regiment charged the 812th Siberian Infantry Regiment. The remainder of the regiment, together with the Novara Lancers made a dismounted attack in an action that ended with the retreat of the Russians after heavy losses on both sides.<ref>Jeffrey T.

The final cavalry charge by British Empire forces occurred on 21 March 1942 when a 60 strong patrol of the Burma Frontier Force encountered Japanese infantry near [[Toungoo]] airfield in central [[Myanmar]]. The [[Sikh]] [[sowar]]s of the Frontier Force cavalry, led by Captain Arthur Sandeman of [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)]], charged in the old style with sabres and most were killed.\n\n====Mongolia====\n[[File:Battle of Khalkhin Gol-Mongolian cavalry.jpg|right|thumb|Mongolian cavalry in the Khalkhin Gol (1939)]]\n\nIn the early stages of World War II, mounted units of the Mongolian People's Army were involved in the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] against invading Japanese forces. Soviet forces under the command of Georgy Zhukov, together with Mongolian forces, defeated the Japanese Sixth army and effectively ended the Soviet\u2013Japanese Border Wars. After the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese Neutrality Pact]] of 1941, Mongolia remained neutral throughout most of the war, but its geographical situation meant that the country served as a buffer between Japanese forces and the Soviet Union. In addition to keeping around 10% of the population under arms, Mongolia provided half a million trained horses for use by the Soviet Army. In 1945 a partially mounted Soviet-Mongolian [[Cavalry Mechanized Group]] played a supporting role on the western flank of the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The last active service seen by cavalry units of the Mongolian Army occurred in 1946\u20131948, during border clashes between Mongolia and the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\n===Post\u2013World War II to present day===\n\n[[File:US soldiers on horseback 1991 Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[United States Army Special Forces|U.S. Special Forces]] and [[Combat Controller]]s on horseback with the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]] of [[Afghanistan]], which frequently used horses as military transport.]]\nWhile most modern \"cavalry\" units have some historic connection with formerly mounted troops this is not always the case. The modern Irish Defence Force (DF) includes a \"Cavalry Corps\" equipped with armoured cars and [[FV101 Scorpion|Scorpion tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles]]. The DF has never included horse cavalry since its establishment in 1922 (other than a small mounted escort of [[Blue Hussars]] drawn from the Artillery Corps when required for ceremonial occasions). However, the mystique of the cavalry is such that the name has been introduced for what was always a mechanised force.\n\nSome engagements in late 20th and early 21st century [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] wars involved mounted troops, particularly against partisan or guerrilla fighters in areas with poor transport infrastructure. Such units were not used as cavalry but rather as mounted infantry. Examples occurred in Afghanistan, [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|Portuguese Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. The French Army used existing mounted squadrons of [[Spahi]]s to a limited extent for patrol work during the Algerian War (1954\u201362). The [[Swiss Armed Forces|Swiss Army]] maintained a mounted dragoon regiment for combat purposes until 1973. The [[Portuguese Army]] used horse mounted cavalry with some success in the [[Portuguese Colonial War|wars of independence in Angola and Mozambique]] in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1964\u201379 [[Rhodesian Bush War]] the [[Rhodesian Army]] created an elite mounted infantry unit called [[Grey's Scouts]] to fight unconventional actions against the rebel forces of [[Robert Mugabe]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]. The horse mounted infantry of the Scouts were effective and reportedly feared by their opponents in the rebel African forces. In the 1978 to present [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghan Civil War]] period there have been several instances of horse mounted combat.\n\nCentral and South American armies maintained mounted cavalry for longer than those of Asia, Europe, or North America. The Mexican Army included a number of horse mounted cavalry regiments as late as the mid-1990s and the Chilean Army had five such regiments in 1983 as mounted mountain troops.<ref>{{cite book |last=English|first=Adrian J.|date=May 1985 |title=Armed Forces of Latin America:Their Histories, Development, Present Strength and Military Potential|url= |location= |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|page= |isbn=978-0710603210 |access-date= }}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[Soviet Army]] retained horse cavalry divisions until 1955, and even at the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was an independent horse mounted cavalry squadron in [[Kyrgyzstan]].<ref>Carey Schofield, Inside the Soviet Army, Headline, 1991, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\n====Operational horse cavalry====\nToday the [[Indian Army]]'s [[61st Cavalry (India)|61st Cavalry]] is reported to be the largest existing horse-mounted cavalry unit still having operational potential.<ref>[http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html India Polo Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703113133/http://www.indiapolo.com/Polopedia/Genesis/Indian_Army/61st_Cavalry/61st_cavalry.html |date=July 3, 2009 }}</ref> It was raised in 1951 from the amalgamated [[Imperial Service Troops|state cavalry]] squadrons of [[Gwalior]], [[Jodhpur]], and [[Mysore]].

The PLA mounted units last saw action during border clashes with [[Vietnam]] in the 1970s and 80s, after which most cavalry units were disbanded as part of the major military downsizing of the 1980s.\nIn the wake of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], there were calls to rebuild the army horse inventory for disaster relief in difficult terrain. Subsequent Chinese media reporting<ref>''Global Times'' 20 November 2009 and Xinhua News Agency 22 August 2011</ref> confirms that the Chinese Army maintains operational horse cavalry at squadron strength in the Mongolia Autonomous Region for scouting and logistical purposes.\n\nThe [[Chilean Army]] still maintains a mixed armoured cavalry regiment, with elements of it acting as mounted mountain exploration troops, based in the city of [[Angol]], being part of the III Mountain Division<ref>[[:es:Regimiento de Caballer\u00eda n.\u00ba 3 \"H\u00fasares\"]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}}, and another independent exploration cavalry detachment in the town of [[Chaiten]].

However, neither country retains a horse-mounted unit.\n\nSeveral [[armour|armored]] units of the modern [[United States Army]] retain the designation of \"[[Armored cavalry]]\". The United States also has \"[[Air assault|air cavalry]]\" units equipped with [[helicopter]]s. The Horse Cavalry Detachment of the U.S. Army's [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]], made up of active duty soldiers, still functions as an active unit; trained to approximate the weapons, tools, equipment and techniques used by the United States Cavalry in the 1880s.<ref>[http://pao.hood.army.mil/1stCavDiv/horseDet/default.html First Team!

The differences were their role in combat, the size of the mount, and how much armor was worn by the mount and [[Equestrianism|rider]].\n\nEarly light cavalry (like the [[auxiliary (Roman military)|auxiliaries of the Roman army]]) were typically used to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[skirmish]], to cut down retreating infantry, and for defeating enemy [[projectile|missile]] troops. Armoured cavalry such as the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[cataphract]] were used as shock troops\u2014they would charge the main body of the enemy and in many cases, their actions decided the outcome of the battle, hence the later term \"battle cavalry\".<ref>p. 490, Lynn</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Gunpowder warfare|Gunpowder Age]], armored cavalry units still retained [[cuirass]]es and helmets for their protective value against [[sword]] and [[bayonet]] strikes, and the morale boost these provide to the wearers. By this time the main difference between light and heavy cavalry was their training; the former was regarded as a tool for harassment and reconnaissance, while the latter was considered best for close-order charges.\n\nSince the development of [[armored warfare]], the distinction between light and heavy armor has persisted basically along the same lines. [[Armored car (military)|Armored car]]s and [[light tank]]s have adopted the [[reconnaissance]] role while [[medium tank|medium]] and [[heavy tank]]s are regarded as the decisive [[shock troops]].\n\n==Social status==\nFrom the beginning of civilization to the 20th century, ownership of heavy cavalry horses has been a mark of wealth amongst settled peoples. A cavalry horse involves considerable expense in breeding, training, feeding, and equipment, and has very little productive use except as a mode of transport.\n\nFor this reason, and because of their often decisive military role, the cavalry has typically been associated with high [[social status]]. This was most clearly seen in the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], where a lord was expected to enter combat armored and on horseback and bring with him an entourage of lightly armed [[peasants]] on foot. If landlords and peasant levies came into conflict, the poorly trained footmen would be ill-equipped to defeat armored knights.\n\nIn later national armies, service as an officer in the cavalry was generally a badge of high social status. For instance prior to 1914 most officers of British cavalry regiments came from a socially privileged background and the considerable expenses associated with their role generally required private means, even after it became possible for officers of the [[line infantry]] regiments to live on their pay. Options open to poorer cavalry officers in the various European armies included service with less fashionable (though often highly professional) frontier or colonial units. These included the British Indian cavalry, the Russian [[Cossacks]] or the French [[Chasseurs d' Afrique]].\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries most monarchies maintained a mounted cavalry element in their [[Royal Guards|royal or imperial guards]]. These ranged from small units providing ceremonial escorts and palace guards, through to large formations intended for active service. The mounted escort of the Spanish Royal Household provided an example of the former and the twelve cavalry regiments of the [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|Prussian Imperial Guard]] an example of the latter. In either case the officers of such units were likely to be drawn from the aristocracies of their respective societies.\n\n==On film==\nSome sense of the noise and power of a cavalry charge can be gained from the 1970 film ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'', which featured some 2,000 cavalrymen,<ref>{{citation |last=Corrigan |first=Major J.

Goofy is a tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who typically wears a [[turtle neck]] and [[vest]], with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled [[fedora]]. Goofy is a close friend of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He is normally characterized as extremely [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]] and somewhat [[Stupidity|dimwitted]], yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as [[intuitive]], and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.\n\nGoofy debuted in [[animated cartoon]]s, starting in 1932 with ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' as '''Dippy Dawg''', who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two ''Goofy'' shorts were nominated for an Oscar: ''[[How to Play Football]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including ''[[Polar Trappers]]'' (1938), where they first appeared without [[Mickey Mouse]]. Three more ''Goofy'' shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and [[Disney comics]]. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His last theatrical appearance was ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present), and ''[[Mickey Mouse: Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' (2017\u2013present).\n\nOriginally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \"Goofy\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called '''George G. Geef'''. Sources from the ''Goof Troop'' continuity give the character's full name as '''G. G. \"Goofy\" Goof''',<ref>{{cite episode|title=Everything's Coming Up Goofy|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 5, 1992|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=1}}: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G.

In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as '''Goofus D. Dawg'''.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pinto Colvig]], the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\" from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Oregon]], and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \"The Oregon Appleknocker\". After a discussion with [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Wilfred Jackson]], it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]]. Based on Colvig's \"grotesque poses and expressions\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colvig, Pinto|year=2015|title=It's A Crazy Business: The Goofy Life of a Disney Legend|page=99|editors=Pierce, Todd James; Mclain, Bob|isbn=978-1-941500-49-1}}</ref> Animator [[Art Babbit]] is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible [[Good Samaritan]], a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney's Goofy: The Good Sport |last=O'Brien |first=Flora |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=HPBooks |location=Tucson |isbn=978-0-89586-414-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless.  Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend.  The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' series (1992\u20131993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named [[Max Goof|Max]], and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the ''Goof Troop'' continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy's wife was never shown, while George Geef's wife appeared\u2014[[Unseen character|but always with her face unseen]]\u2014in 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a \"family man\".<ref>Officially, Disney's Guest Services once declared there to be \"no definitive answer\" as to \"who Max's mother is and where \"Mrs. Goofy\" went\", leaving her fate up to unofficial speculation and presumption. {{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Disneyland IMG 3970.jpg|thumb|right|Goofy's house at [[Disneyland]].]]\n\nIn the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey's sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist.<ref>[https://inducks.org/comp2.php?code=&keyw=&keywt=i&exactpg=&pg1=&pg2=&bro2=&bro3=&exactparts=&parts1=&parts2=&kind=nk&rowsperpage=0&columnsperpage=0&hero=&xapp=Goofy&univ=&xa2=&creat=&creat2=&plot=&plot2=&writ=&writ2=&art=&art2=&ink=&ink2=&excludeCZ=on&pub1=1900&pub2=&ser=&xref=&mref=&xrefd=&repabb=&repabbc=al&imgmode=0&vdesc2=on&vdesc=en&vus=on&sort1=s.firstpublicationdate Chronological list of Goofy's appearances in comics] according to the [[INDUCKS]] database.

As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide [[make-work]] for his animators.<ref name=\"micechat\">{{cite web |url=http://micechat.com/forums/news/42925-disneytim-talks-walt-disney-historian-neal-gabler-micechat-news-team-10-29-06-a.html |title=Disneytim Talks with Walt Disney Historian Neal Gabler \u2013 MiceChat News Team, 10/29/06 |publisher=micechat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/Gabler/GablerErrata.htm |author= Barrier, Michael |date= December 2006 |title= 'Walt Disney's Errors and Ambiguities' |publisher= MichaelBarrier.com |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Goofy Debut.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932).]]\n\nGoofy first appeared in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] this short movie features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]]. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in ''[[The Whoopee Party]]'', first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere [[Cameo appearance|cameos]].\n\nIn the Silly Symphonies cartoon ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]],'' the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character.\n\nBy his seventh appearance, in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \"Goofy\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: [[Donald Duck]] and [[Clara Cluck]].\n\n===Trio years with Mickey and Donald===\n''[[Mickey's Service Station]]'' directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', first released on October 15, 1937, and ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics.\n\nProgressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey\u2014who became progressively gentler and more laid-back\u2014seemed to act as the [[double act|straight man]] of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. ''[[Polar Trappers]]'', first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\" They have settled in the [[Arctic]] for an unspecified period of time, to capture live [[walrus]]es to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of [[canning|canned]] [[bean]]s. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch [[penguin]]s to use as food&nbsp;\u2014 both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in ''[[The Whalers]]'', first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also ''Tugboat Mickey'', released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.\n\n===Break off into solo series===\nGoofy next starred at his first solo cartoon ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' directed by [[Dick Huemer]], first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet [[grasshopper]].\n\n===The ''How to...'' series===\n[[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Walt Disney|Disney]] drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941.]]\nIn 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> According to [[Leonard Maltin]], this is what caused the ''How to...'' cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy ''How to...'' cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the most recent being the ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater'', released theatrically in 2007.\n\nLater, starting with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where ''every'' single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by [[Jack Kinney]].\n\n===[[World War II]]===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\nDuring World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the [[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] and the [[756th Air Refueling Squadron|756 Bombardment Squadron]] U.S. Air Corps.\n<gallery>\nFile:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>602d Bombardment Squadron emblem (approved 6 March 1944)<ref name=Maurer602BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons '', pp. 680-681</ref></center>\nFile:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>756th Bombardment Squadron emblem</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===The ''Everyman'' years===\n[[File:Geefgoof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Goofy in his \"George Geef\" persona in {{nowrap|''Cold War''}} (1951).]]\n\nThe 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,<ref>Harry Tytle ''One Of \"Walt's Boys,\"'' (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86</ref> hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \"Goofy\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \"''Walt Disney presents Goofy''\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \"George Geef\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts.\n\nAccording to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a [[suburb]]an [[everyman]] in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 27-28</ref> His clothing changed from a [[casual attire|casual style]] to wearing [[business suits]]. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\nLehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social [[conformity]]. He cites as an example ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up accident]], every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the [[society of the United States]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> ''Aquamania'' was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the [[status quo]] of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received [[Normative social influence|social approval]] for it. ''Aquamania'' itself received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter the 1965 educational film ''Goofy's Freeway Troubles'', Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor [[Pinto Colvig]]. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, [[Disney on Parade]] with costar [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. He only makes a brief appearance in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]]'s Academy Award-winning hit ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in which the titular [[Roger Rabbit]] says of Goofy: \"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\". However, he made a comeback in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until [[Bill Farmer]] became the official voice.\n\n[[File:Goofymoviemain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goofy (right) with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] (left) in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995)]] \nIn the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called ''[[Goof Troop]]''. In the show, Goofy lives with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his family. ''Goof Troop'' eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in 1995) and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 1999) and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \"stolen\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.\n\nGoofy returned to his traditional personality in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and appeared as a head waiter in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son [[Max Goof|Max]] also appeared in ''House of Mouse'' as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in ''Goof Troop'' and its aforementioned related media. In both ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Goofy also seemed to have a crush on [[Clarabelle Cow]], as he asks her on a date in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"Super Goof\" and is stalked by the bovine in the [[Mickey Mouse Works]] cartoon \"How To Be a Spy\". Though Clarabelle was noted as [[Horace Horsecollar]]'s fianc\u00e9 in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent cartoons like the aforementioned ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', as well as ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.\n\nOn [[Disney's Toontown Online]], an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \"Grand Prix Monday\" and \"Silly Saturday\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.\n\nGoofy also appears in the [[children's television series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''. Recently, Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'', that premiered at the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]]. The short received a positive review from animation historian [[Jerry Beck]]<ref name=\"cartoonbrew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |title=Report from Ottawa: Persepolis and Goofy &#124; Cartoon Brew |publisher=cartoonbrew.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204045016/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel.\n\nIn 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising [[Disney Cruise Line]].<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|title=\"Checkin' In With Goofy\"  &#124; Cartoon Brew|publisher=cartoonbrew.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215140838/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> He is also a main character on ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]].''

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.\n\nThe [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining [[Donald Duck (comic strip)|his own newspaper strip]], Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing [[Horace Horsecollar]] as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare.\nGoofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by [[Paul Murry]].\n\nA character called \"Glory-Bee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |title=Glory-Bee |publisher=Users.cwnet.com |accessdate=2014-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131713/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |archivedate=2015-03-13 }}</ref> was Goofy's girlfriend for some years.\n\nIn 1990, when Disney was publishing [[Disney Comics (publishing)|their own comics]], Goofy starred in ''[[Goofy Adventures]]'', that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, ''Goofy Adventures'' was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.\n\n===Super Goof===\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image         =\n| caption       =\n| character_name = Super Goof\n| real_name     = Goofy\n| publisher     = [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] (licenser)<br />[[Western Publishing]] (licensee)\n| debut='''First version''': \"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\" (''Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot'' #2, Feb. 1965)<br />'''Second version''': \"All's Well that Ends Awful\" (''[[Donald Duck (American comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #102, July 1965)<br />'''Third and definitive version''': \"The Thief of Zanzipar\" (''Walt Disney Super Goof'' #1, Oct. 1965)\n| creators      = Del Connell (script, first two versions)<br />[[Bob Ogle]] (script, third and definitive version)<br />[[Paul Murry]] (art, all three versions)\n| alliances     = Super Gilbert\n| previous_alliances =\n| aliases      =\n| powers       = Can fly, has x-ray vision, invulnerability, super strength, super speed, superbreath, and other powers\n}}\n\n'''Super Goof''' is Goofy's [[superhero]] alter ego who gets his powers by eating super [[goobers]] (peanuts).

Following a letter left by the missing king Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald, the court magician, meet [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and embark on a quest with him to find the King and Sora's missing friends. In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the'' Kingdom Hearts'' series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why [[Organization XIII]] was after the [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], and he was the first to see through [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]'s disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \"look before we leap\" when Sora and Donald saw [[Mushu]]'s shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless.\n\nGoofy reappears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries.\n\n===In other video games===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}{{Update section|date=March 2020}}\n\n*Goofy was the star of an early platformer, ''Matterhorn Screamer'' for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \"Junk\" store in ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n* Goofy also starred in [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] action game ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' alongside his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and in ''[[Goofy's Hysterical History Tour]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits.\n\n* Goofy appears briefly in ''[[Quackshot]]'', a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game.\n\n* He also was in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Disney's Party]]'' as one of the playable characters.\n\n* Two games for kids were released: ''[[Goofy's Fun House]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] and ''Goofy's Railway Express'' for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* He also appears 2001 in ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]].\n\n* Goofy is a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''.\n\n* Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 [[Wii]] game, ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. He appears as one of the \"buddies\" that the Mad Doctor creates for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam.\n\n* Goofy briefly appears in ''[[Disney's Magical Quest]]'' for Super NES, released in 1992.\n\n* As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game ''[[Toontown Online]]''.\n\n* Goofy was also a playable character in ''[[Disney Golf]]'' for the PS2.\n\n* Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game ''Disney Kart: Circuit Tour''.\n\n==Voice actors==\n[[Pinto Colvig]] voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (''[[Mickey's Revue]]'') to 1938 (''[[The Whalers]]'') when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Canemaker/> However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (''How to Be a Sailor'') until shortly before his death in 1967.

He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and stars in both the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999), its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004), and the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Max is a [[playable character]] on the [[Super NES]] video game ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1993), the [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''Disney Golf'' (2002), and the [[Personal computer|PC]] video game ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' (2001).\n\nMax is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', then a high school student in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. In ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a [[valet parking|parking valet]].\n\n==Goofy holler==\nThe Goofy holler is a [[stock sound effect]] that is used frequently in [[Walt Disney]] cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as \"Yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooey!\" The holler was originally recorded by [[yodeling|yodeller]] [[Hannes Schroll|Hann\u00e8s Schroll]] for the 1941 short ''[[The Art of Skiing]]''.

He also does this in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games.\n\nThe holler is also used in films and cartoons in which Goofy does not appear, generally in situations that are particularly \"goofy\" (examples include ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'').\n\nIn a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode titled \"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\", the Joker performs the holler when the plane crashes toward a canyon.\n\nIn the \"Wacky Delly\" episode of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', the holler is heard at the end of the haphazardly made cartoon created by [[Rocko]], [[Heffer Wolfe]], and [[Filburt]] for Ralph Bighead.\n\nA version of the holler is used in a cutaway in the \"[[Dial Meg for Murder]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when Goofy is cast into [[Hell]] for causing [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\nThe term \"Goofy Holler\" was first created by a user of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and originated on the trivia page for ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''.

Goofy is a tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who typically wears a [[turtle neck]] and [[vest]], with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled [[fedora]]. Goofy is a close friend of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He is normally characterized as extremely [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]] and somewhat [[Stupidity|dimwitted]], yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as [[intuitive]], and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.\n\nGoofy debuted in [[animated cartoon]]s, starting in 1932 with ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' as '''Dippy Dawg''', who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two ''Goofy'' shorts were nominated for an Oscar: ''[[How to Play Football]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including ''[[Polar Trappers]]'' (1938), where they first appeared without [[Mickey Mouse]]. Three more ''Goofy'' shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and [[Disney comics]]. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His last theatrical appearance was ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present), and ''[[Mickey Mouse: Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' (2017\u2013present).\n\nOriginally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \"Goofy\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called '''George G. Geef'''. Sources from the ''Goof Troop'' continuity give the character's full name as '''G. G. \"Goofy\" Goof''',<ref>{{cite episode|title=Everything's Coming Up Goofy|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 5, 1992|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=1}}: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G.

In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as '''Goofus D. Dawg'''.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pinto Colvig]], the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\" from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Oregon]], and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \"The Oregon Appleknocker\". After a discussion with [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Wilfred Jackson]], it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]]. Based on Colvig's \"grotesque poses and expressions\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colvig, Pinto|year=2015|title=It's A Crazy Business: The Goofy Life of a Disney Legend|page=99|editors=Pierce, Todd James; Mclain, Bob|isbn=978-1-941500-49-1}}</ref> Animator [[Art Babbit]] is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible [[Good Samaritan]], a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney's Goofy: The Good Sport |last=O'Brien |first=Flora |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=HPBooks |location=Tucson |isbn=978-0-89586-414-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless.  Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend.  The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' series (1992\u20131993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named [[Max Goof|Max]], and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the ''Goof Troop'' continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy's wife was never shown, while George Geef's wife appeared\u2014[[Unseen character|but always with her face unseen]]\u2014in 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a \"family man\".<ref>Officially, Disney's Guest Services once declared there to be \"no definitive answer\" as to \"who Max's mother is and where \"Mrs. Goofy\" went\", leaving her fate up to unofficial speculation and presumption. {{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Disneyland IMG 3970.jpg|thumb|right|Goofy's house at [[Disneyland]].]]\n\nIn the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey's sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist.<ref>[https://inducks.org/comp2.php?code=&keyw=&keywt=i&exactpg=&pg1=&pg2=&bro2=&bro3=&exactparts=&parts1=&parts2=&kind=nk&rowsperpage=0&columnsperpage=0&hero=&xapp=Goofy&univ=&xa2=&creat=&creat2=&plot=&plot2=&writ=&writ2=&art=&art2=&ink=&ink2=&excludeCZ=on&pub1=1900&pub2=&ser=&xref=&mref=&xrefd=&repabb=&repabbc=al&imgmode=0&vdesc2=on&vdesc=en&vus=on&sort1=s.firstpublicationdate Chronological list of Goofy's appearances in comics] according to the [[INDUCKS]] database.

As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide [[make-work]] for his animators.<ref name=\"micechat\">{{cite web |url=http://micechat.com/forums/news/42925-disneytim-talks-walt-disney-historian-neal-gabler-micechat-news-team-10-29-06-a.html |title=Disneytim Talks with Walt Disney Historian Neal Gabler \u2013 MiceChat News Team, 10/29/06 |publisher=micechat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/Gabler/GablerErrata.htm |author= Barrier, Michael |date= December 2006 |title= 'Walt Disney's Errors and Ambiguities' |publisher= MichaelBarrier.com |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Goofy Debut.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932).]]\n\nGoofy first appeared in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] this short movie features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]]. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in ''[[The Whoopee Party]]'', first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere [[Cameo appearance|cameos]].\n\nIn the Silly Symphonies cartoon ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]],'' the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character.\n\nBy his seventh appearance, in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \"Goofy\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: [[Donald Duck]] and [[Clara Cluck]].\n\n===Trio years with Mickey and Donald===\n''[[Mickey's Service Station]]'' directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', first released on October 15, 1937, and ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics.\n\nProgressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey\u2014who became progressively gentler and more laid-back\u2014seemed to act as the [[double act|straight man]] of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. ''[[Polar Trappers]]'', first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\" They have settled in the [[Arctic]] for an unspecified period of time, to capture live [[walrus]]es to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of [[canning|canned]] [[bean]]s. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch [[penguin]]s to use as food&nbsp;\u2014 both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in ''[[The Whalers]]'', first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also ''Tugboat Mickey'', released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.\n\n===Break off into solo series===\nGoofy next starred at his first solo cartoon ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' directed by [[Dick Huemer]], first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet [[grasshopper]].\n\n===The ''How to...'' series===\n[[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Walt Disney|Disney]] drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941.]]\nIn 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> According to [[Leonard Maltin]], this is what caused the ''How to...'' cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy ''How to...'' cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the most recent being the ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater'', released theatrically in 2007.\n\nLater, starting with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where ''every'' single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by [[Jack Kinney]].\n\n===[[World War II]]===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\nDuring World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the [[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] and the [[756th Air Refueling Squadron|756 Bombardment Squadron]] U.S. Air Corps.\n<gallery>\nFile:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>602d Bombardment Squadron emblem (approved 6 March 1944)<ref name=Maurer602BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons '', pp. 680-681</ref></center>\nFile:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>756th Bombardment Squadron emblem</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===The ''Everyman'' years===\n[[File:Geefgoof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Goofy in his \"George Geef\" persona in {{nowrap|''Cold War''}} (1951).]]\n\nThe 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,<ref>Harry Tytle ''One Of \"Walt's Boys,\"'' (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86</ref> hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \"Goofy\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \"''Walt Disney presents Goofy''\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \"George Geef\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts.\n\nAccording to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a [[suburb]]an [[everyman]] in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 27-28</ref> His clothing changed from a [[casual attire|casual style]] to wearing [[business suits]]. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\nLehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social [[conformity]]. He cites as an example ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up accident]], every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the [[society of the United States]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> ''Aquamania'' was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the [[status quo]] of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received [[Normative social influence|social approval]] for it. ''Aquamania'' itself received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter the 1965 educational film ''Goofy's Freeway Troubles'', Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor [[Pinto Colvig]]. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, [[Disney on Parade]] with costar [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. He only makes a brief appearance in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]]'s Academy Award-winning hit ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in which the titular [[Roger Rabbit]] says of Goofy: \"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\". However, he made a comeback in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until [[Bill Farmer]] became the official voice.\n\n[[File:Goofymoviemain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goofy (right) with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] (left) in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995)]] \nIn the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called ''[[Goof Troop]]''. In the show, Goofy lives with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his family. ''Goof Troop'' eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in 1995) and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 1999) and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \"stolen\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.\n\nGoofy returned to his traditional personality in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and appeared as a head waiter in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son [[Max Goof|Max]] also appeared in ''House of Mouse'' as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in ''Goof Troop'' and its aforementioned related media. In both ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Goofy also seemed to have a crush on [[Clarabelle Cow]], as he asks her on a date in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"Super Goof\" and is stalked by the bovine in the [[Mickey Mouse Works]] cartoon \"How To Be a Spy\". Though Clarabelle was noted as [[Horace Horsecollar]]'s fianc\u00e9 in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent cartoons like the aforementioned ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', as well as ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.\n\nOn [[Disney's Toontown Online]], an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \"Grand Prix Monday\" and \"Silly Saturday\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.\n\nGoofy also appears in the [[children's television series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''. Recently, Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'', that premiered at the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]]. The short received a positive review from animation historian [[Jerry Beck]]<ref name=\"cartoonbrew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |title=Report from Ottawa: Persepolis and Goofy &#124; Cartoon Brew |publisher=cartoonbrew.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204045016/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel.\n\nIn 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising [[Disney Cruise Line]].<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|title=\"Checkin' In With Goofy\"  &#124; Cartoon Brew|publisher=cartoonbrew.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215140838/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> He is also a main character on ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]].''

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.\n\nThe [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining [[Donald Duck (comic strip)|his own newspaper strip]], Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing [[Horace Horsecollar]] as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare.\nGoofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by [[Paul Murry]].\n\nA character called \"Glory-Bee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |title=Glory-Bee |publisher=Users.cwnet.com |accessdate=2014-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131713/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |archivedate=2015-03-13 }}</ref> was Goofy's girlfriend for some years.\n\nIn 1990, when Disney was publishing [[Disney Comics (publishing)|their own comics]], Goofy starred in ''[[Goofy Adventures]]'', that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, ''Goofy Adventures'' was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.\n\n===Super Goof===\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image         =\n| caption       =\n| character_name = Super Goof\n| real_name     = Goofy\n| publisher     = [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] (licenser)<br />[[Western Publishing]] (licensee)\n| debut='''First version''': \"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\" (''Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot'' #2, Feb. 1965)<br />'''Second version''': \"All's Well that Ends Awful\" (''[[Donald Duck (American comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #102, July 1965)<br />'''Third and definitive version''': \"The Thief of Zanzipar\" (''Walt Disney Super Goof'' #1, Oct. 1965)\n| creators      = Del Connell (script, first two versions)<br />[[Bob Ogle]] (script, third and definitive version)<br />[[Paul Murry]] (art, all three versions)\n| alliances     = Super Gilbert\n| previous_alliances =\n| aliases      =\n| powers       = Can fly, has x-ray vision, invulnerability, super strength, super speed, superbreath, and other powers\n}}\n\n'''Super Goof''' is Goofy's [[superhero]] alter ego who gets his powers by eating super [[goobers]] (peanuts).

In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the'' Kingdom Hearts'' series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why [[Organization XIII]] was after the [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], and he was the first to see through [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]'s disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \"look before we leap\" when Sora and Donald saw [[Mushu]]'s shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless.\n\nGoofy reappears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries.\n\n===In other video games===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}{{Update section|date=March 2020}}\n\n*Goofy was the star of an early platformer, ''Matterhorn Screamer'' for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \"Junk\" store in ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n* Goofy also starred in [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] action game ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' alongside his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and in ''[[Goofy's Hysterical History Tour]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits.\n\n* Goofy appears briefly in ''[[Quackshot]]'', a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game.\n\n* He also was in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Disney's Party]]'' as one of the playable characters.\n\n* Two games for kids were released: ''[[Goofy's Fun House]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] and ''Goofy's Railway Express'' for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* He also appears 2001 in ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]].\n\n* Goofy is a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''.\n\n* Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 [[Wii]] game, ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. He appears as one of the \"buddies\" that the Mad Doctor creates for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam.\n\n* Goofy briefly appears in ''[[Disney's Magical Quest]]'' for Super NES, released in 1992.\n\n* As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game ''[[Toontown Online]]''.\n\n* Goofy was also a playable character in ''[[Disney Golf]]'' for the PS2.\n\n* Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game ''Disney Kart: Circuit Tour''.\n\n==Voice actors==\n[[Pinto Colvig]] voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (''[[Mickey's Revue]]'') to 1938 (''[[The Whalers]]'') when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Canemaker/> However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (''How to Be a Sailor'') until shortly before his death in 1967. One of his last known performances as the character was for the [[Telephone Pavilion (Expo 67)|Telephone Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5484336/the_akron_beacon_journal/|title=The Akron Beacon Journal, October 21, 1967|newspaper=The Akron Beacon Journal}}</ref> Many cartoons feature Goofy silent or have recycled dialogue from earlier shorts or have various different-sounding Goofys instead of the original. Colvig also gave Goofy a normal voice for four George Geef. [[Stuart Buchanan]] voiced Goofy in ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]''. Bob Jackman took Colvig's place when he left the Disney Studios for unknown reasons and voiced Goofy in 1951 for a brief time.

[[Will Ryan]] did the voice for ''[[D-TV|DTV Valentine]]'' in 1986 and ''Down and Out with Donald Duck'' in 1987. [[Tony Pope]] voiced Goofy in the 1979 Disney album, ''[[Mickey Mouse Disco]]'' for the song, \"Watch out for Goofy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainstgazette.com/2007/11/growing-up-disney-mickey-mouse-disco.html|title=Growing Up Disney \u2013 Mickey Mouse Disco|website=www.mainstgazette.com}}</ref> He then voiced him in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' in 1987 and ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988. Aside from those occasions, [[Bill Farmer]] has been voicing Goofy since 1987. While Pope was the sole voice credit for Goofy in ''Roger Rabbit'', Farmer actually provided some of Goofy's lines in the movie as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhpr84WzJLg 2011 Disneyana Fan Club Convention Highlight: Voice Panel]</ref> Farmer closely imitated Colvig for projects like ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' but began putting his own spin on the character in 1992's ''[[Goof Troop]]''. Farmer also inherited Colvig's other characters, like [[Pluto (Disney character)|Pluto]], [[Sleepy (character)|Sleepy]], and [[Practical Pig]].\n\n==Relatives==\n\n===Max Goof===\n{{Main|Max Goof}}\n\nMax Goof is Goofy's teenage son. He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and stars in both the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999), its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004), and the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Max is a [[playable character]] on the [[Super NES]] video game ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1993), the [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''Disney Golf'' (2002), and the [[Personal computer|PC]] video game ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' (2001).\n\nMax is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', then a high school student in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. In ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a [[valet parking|parking valet]].\n\n==Goofy holler==\nThe Goofy holler is a [[stock sound effect]] that is used frequently in [[Walt Disney]] cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as \"Yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooey!\" The holler was originally recorded by [[yodeling|yodeller]] [[Hannes Schroll|Hann\u00e8s Schroll]] for the 1941 short ''[[The Art of Skiing]]''.

''Minkowski addition'' is  defined as the addition of the sets' [[element (mathematics)|member]]s: for example, adding the set consisting of the [[integer]]s zero and one to itself yields the set consisting of zero, one, and two:\n: {0,&nbsp;1}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1} = {0&nbsp;+&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1} = {0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2}.\nThe Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma and related results provide an affirmative answer to the question, \"Is the sum of many sets close to being [[convex set|convex]]?\"<ref name=\"Howe\" >{{harvtxt|Howe|1979|p=1}}: {{citation|title=On the tendency toward convexity of the vector&nbsp;sum of sets|authorlink=Roger Evans Howe|last=Howe|first=Roger |date=3 November 1979 |publisher=[[Cowles Foundation|Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics]], Yale University|series=Cowles Foundation discussion papers|location=Box&nbsp;2125 Yale&nbsp;Station, New&nbsp;Haven, CT&nbsp;06520|volume=538 |url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d05a/d0538.pdf|<!-- url-2=http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cwl:cwldpp:538 -->|accessdate=1 January 2011}}\n</ref>  A set is defined to be ''convex'' if every [[line segment]] joining two of its points is a [[subset]] in the set: For example, the solid [[unit disk|disk]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\bullet</math></big> is a convex set but  the [[unit circle|circle]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\circ</math></big> is not, because the line segment joining two distinct points&nbsp;<math>\\oslash</math> is not a subset of the circle.

The ''convex hull'' of a set&nbsp;''Q'' is the smallest convex&nbsp;set that contains&nbsp;''Q''. This distance is zero [[if and only if]] the sum is convex. \nThe theorem's bound on the distance depends&nbsp;on the dimension&nbsp;''D'' and on the shapes of the summand-sets, but ''not'' on the number of summand-sets&nbsp;''N'', {{nowrap|when ''N'' > ''D''.}} \nThe shapes of a subcollection of only&nbsp;''D'' summand-sets determine the bound on the distance between the Minkowski&nbsp;''[[arithmetic mean|average]]'' of&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;sets\n: {{frac|1|''N''}} (''Q''<sub>1</sub> + ''Q''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''Q''<sub>''N''</sub>)\nand its convex hull.

Starr]], who was investigating the existence of [[general equilibrium theory#Nonconvexities in large economies|economic equilibria]] while studying with [[Kenneth Arrow]].<ref name=\"s69\"/> In his paper, Starr studied a ''convexified'' economy, in which non-convex sets were replaced by their convex hulls; Starr proved that the convexified economy has equilibria that are closely approximated by \"quasi-equilibria\" of the original economy; moreover, he proved that every quasi-equilibrium has many of the optimal properties of true equilibria, which are proved to exist for convex economies. Following Starr's&nbsp;1969 paper, the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr results have been widely used to show that central results of (convex) economic theory are good approximations to large economies with non-convexities; for example, quasi-equilibria closely approximate equilibria of a convexified economy. \"The derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory\", wrote [[Roger&nbsp;Guesnerie]].<ref name=\"g89-p138\">{{harvtxt|Guesnerie|1989|p=138}}</ref> The topic of [[non-convexity (economics)|non-convex sets in economics]] has been studied by many [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel laureates]], besides Lloyd Shapley who won the prize in 2012: Arrow (1972), [[Robert Aumann]] (2005), [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]] (1983), [[Tjalling Koopmans]] (1975), [[Paul Krugman]] (2008), and [[Paul Samuelson]] (1970); the complementary topic of [[convexity in economics|convex sets in economics]] has been emphasized by these laureates, along with [[Leonid Hurwicz]], [[Leonid Kantorovich]] (1975), and [[Robert Solow]] (1987).\n\nThe Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has applications also in [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] and [[probability theory]].<ref name=\"Starr08\" >{{harvtxt|Starr|2008}}</ref> In optimization theory, the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has been used to explain the successful solution of minimization problems that are sums of many [[function (mathematics)|function]]s.<ref name=\"Ekeland76\"/><ref name=\"Bertsekas82\"/> The Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has also been used in [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of the [[law of large numbers|\"law of averages\"]] for [[stochastic geometry|random sets]], a theorem that had been proved <!-- to hold --> for only convex sets.<ref name=\"ArtsteinVitale\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Introductory example==\nFor example, the subset of the integers&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2} is contained in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[real number]]s&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;2], which is convex.

Two points in the Cartesian&nbsp;plane can be ''[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|added]]'' coordinate-wise\n: (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) + (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) = (''x''<sub>1</sub>+''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>+''y''<sub>2</sub>);\nfurther, a point can be ''[[scalar multiplication|multiplied]]'' by each real&nbsp;number&nbsp;''\u03bb'' coordinate-wise\n: ''\u03bb''&nbsp;(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = (''\u03bbx'', ''\u03bby'').\n\nMore generally, any real vector space of (finite) dimension&nbsp;''D'' can be viewed as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[tuple|''D''-tuple]]s of&nbsp;''D'' real&nbsp;numbers {{nowrap|{&nbsp;(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, ''v''<sub>D</sub>)}}&nbsp;} on which  two&nbsp;[[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s are defined: [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector&nbsp;addition]] and [[scalar multiplication|multiplication by a real&nbsp;number]]. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vector&nbsp;addition and real-number&nbsp;multiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the Cartesian plane.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|p=375}}</ref>\n\n===Convex sets===\n{{multiple image\n   | width     =155\n   | footer    = [[Line segment]]s test whether a subset be [[convex set|convex]].\n   | image1    = Convex polygon illustration1.svg\n   | alt1      = Illustration of a convex set, which looks somewhat like a disk: A (green) convex set contains the (black) line-segment joining the points x and y.

For example, a solid [[unit disk|disk]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\bullet</math></big> is convex but a [[unit circle|circle]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\circ</math></big> is not, because it does not contain a line segment joining its points&nbsp;<math>\\oslash</math>; the non-convex set of three integers&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2} is contained in the interval&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;2], which is convex.

Each basket is represented as a non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an ''[[indifference curve]]'' is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's ''preference set'' (relative to an indifference curve) is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's ''preferences'' are ''convex'' if all such preference sets are convex.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mas-Colell|1985|pp=58\u201361}} and {{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=76\u201379}}</ref>\n\nAn optimal basket of goods occurs where the budget-line [[supporting hyperplane|supports]] a consumer's preference set, as shown in the diagram.

Thus, the set of optimal baskets is a <!--  set valued function, or multifunction, or correspondence or relation-->[[function (mathematics)|function]] of the <!-- relative --> prices, and this function is called the consumer's ''[[demand]]''. If the preference set is convex, then at every price the consumer's demand is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket or a line-segment of baskets.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=79\u201381}}</ref>\n\n====Non-convex preferences====\n[[File:NonConvex.gif|right|thumb|alt=Image of a non-convex preference set with a concavity un-supported by the budget line|When the consumer's preferences have concavities, the consumer may jump between two separate optimal baskets.]]\n{{See also|Non-convexity (economics)}}\nHowever, if a preference set is ''non-convex'', then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two ''separate'' optimal-baskets.

We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a [[griffin]])!

In the convexified economy, at each price, the <!-- not necessarily closed -->[[aggregate demand]] was the sum of convex hulls of the consumers' demands. Starr's ideas interested the mathematicians [[Lloyd Shapley]] and [[Jon Folkman]], who proved their [[eponym]]ous <!-- Shapley\u2013Folkman --> lemma and <!-- the Shapley\u2013Folkman --> theorem in \"private correspondence\", <!-- entitled \"Starr's problem\" (1966), --> which was reported by Starr's published paper of 1969.<ref name=\"s69\"/>\n\nIn his 1969 publication, Starr applied the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr theorem. Starr proved that the \"convexified\" economy has general equilibria that can be closely approximated by \"''quasi-equilibria''\" of the original economy, when the number of agents exceeds the dimension of the goods: Concretely, Starr proved that there exists at least one quasi-equilibrium of prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub> with the following properties:\n\n* For each quasi-equilibrium's prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub>, all consumers can choose optimal baskets (maximally preferred and meeting their budget constraints).\n* At quasi-equilibrium prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub> in the convexified economy, every good's market is in equilibrium: Its supply equals its demand.\n* For each quasi-equilibrium, the prices \"nearly clear\" the markets for the original economy: an [[upper bound]] on the [[Hausdorff distance|distance]] between the set of equilibria of the  \"convexified\" economy and the set of quasi-equilibria of the original economy followed from Starr's corollary to the Shapley\u2013Folkman theorem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=169\u2013182}}. {{harvtxt|Starr|1969|pp=27\u201333}}\n</ref>\n\nStarr established that\n<blockquote>\n\"in the aggregate, the discrepancy between an allocation in the fictitious economy generated by [taking the convex hulls of all of the consumption&nbsp;and&nbsp;production sets] and some allocation in the real economy is bounded in a way that is independent of the number of economic agents. Therefore, the average&nbsp;agent experiences a deviation from intended actions that vanishes in significance as the number&nbsp;of&nbsp;agents goes to infinity\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Green|Heller|1981|p=44}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nFollowing Starr's&nbsp;1969 paper, the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr results have been widely used in economic theory. [[Roger&nbsp;Guesnerie]] summarized their economic implications: \"<!-- [s] -->Some key results obtained under the convexity assumption remain (approximately) relevant in circumstances where convexity fails.

However, the [[sine|sine&nbsp;function]] (pictured) is non-convex on the [[interval (mathematics)#Terminology|interval]]&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;\u03c0).\n\n====Additive optimization problems====\nIn many optimization problems, the [[optimization (mathematics)#objective function|objective function]]&nbsp;f is ''separable'': that is, ''f'' is the sum of ''many'' summand-functions, each of which has its own argument:\n\n: ''f''(''x'') = ''f''<big>(</big>&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>)<big>&nbsp;)</big> = <big>\u2211</big>&nbsp;''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nFor example, problems of [[linear programming|linear optimization]] are separable. Given a separable problem with an optimal solution, we fix an optimal solution\n\n: ''x''<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''N''</sub>)<sub>min</sub>\n\nwith the minimum value&nbsp;{{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>).}}  For this separable problem, we also consider an optimal solution  <big>(</big>''x''<sub>min</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>) <big>)</big>\nto the \"''convexified problem''\", where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of  the summand functions. Such an optimal solution is the [[limit of a sequence]] of points in the convexified problem\n: <big>(</big>''x''<sub>''j''</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>j</sub>) <big>)</big><big>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;</big> <big>\u2211</big> Conv <big>(</big>Graph( ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> ) <big>)</big>.<ref name=\"Ekeland76\"/><ref>\nThe [[limit of a sequence]] is a member of the [[closure (topology)|closure of the original set]], which is the smallest [[closed set]] that contains the original set. The Minkowski sum of two [[closed set]]s need not be closed, so the following [[subset#inclusion|inclusion]] can be strict\n: Clos(P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;Clos(Q) \u2286 Clos(&nbsp;Clos(P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;Clos(Q)&nbsp;);\nthe inclusion can be strict even for two ''convex'' closed summand-sets, according to {{harvtxt|Rockafellar|1997|pp=49 and&nbsp;75}}. Ensuring that the Minkowski&nbsp;sum of sets be closed requires the closure operation, which appends limits of convergent sequences.</ref>\nOf course, the given optimal-point  is a sum of points in the graphs of the original summands and of a small number of convexified summands, by the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma.\n\nThis analysis was published by [[Ivar Ekeland]] in&nbsp;1974 to explain the apparent convexity of separable problems with many summands, despite the non-convexity of the summand problems. In 1973, the young mathematician [[Claude Lemar\u00e9chal]] was surprised by his success with [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] [[iterative method|method]]s on problems that were known to be non-convex; for [[nonlinear programming|minimizing nonlinear]] problems, a solution of the [[dual problem]] need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem, unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a [[constraint qualification]]. Lemar\u00e9chal's problem was additively separable, and each summand function was non-convex; nonetheless, a solution to the dual problem provided a close approximation to the primal problem's optimal value.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lemar\u00e9chal|1973|p=38}}: {{citation|last=Lemar\u00e9chal|first=Claude|authorlink=Claude Lemar\u00e9chal|title=Utilisation de la dualit\u00e9 dans les probl\u00e9mes non&nbsp;convexes [Use of duality for non\u2013convex problems]|language=French| date=April 1973 |issue=16|location=Domaine de&nbsp;Voluceau, [[Rocquencourt]],&nbsp;78150 [[Le Chesnay|Le&nbsp;Chesnay]], France|publisher=[[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|IRIA (now&nbsp;INRIA)]], Laboratoire de recherche en informatique et automatique|page=41|ref=harv}}. <!-- Ekeland cites this report in the ''[[Comptes Rendus|CRAS]]'' announcement of the results of his Appendix&nbsp;I -->\nLemar\u00e9chal's experiments were discussed in later publications: <p>{{harvtxt|Aardal|1995|pp=2\u20133}}: {{cite journal|first=Karen|last=Aardal|authorlink=Karen Aardal|title=''Optima'' interview <!--sic., neither colon nor m-dash appear -->Claude  Lemar\u00e9chal|journal=Optima: Mathematical Programming Society Newsletter|pages=2\u20134|date=March 1995|volume=45|url=http://www.mathprog.org/Old-Optima-Issues/optima45.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2011|ref=harv}}</p><p>{{harvtxt|Hiriart-Urruty|Lemar\u00e9chal|1993|pp=143\u2013145, 151, 153, and&nbsp;156}}: {{cite book|last1=Hiriart-Urruty|first1=Jean-Baptiste|last2=Lemar\u00e9chal|first2=Claude|authorlink2=Claude Lemar\u00e9chal|ref=harv|chapter=XII Abstract duality for practitioners|title=Convex analysis and minimization algorithms, Volume&nbsp;'''II''': Advanced theory and bundle methods|series=Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences]|volume=306|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1993|pages=136\u2013193 (and bibliographical comments on pp.&nbsp;334\u2013335)|isbn=3-540-56852-2|mr=1295240}}</p>\n</ref><ref name=\"Ekeland76\" >{{harv|Ekeland|1999|pp=357\u2013359}}: Published in the first English edition of 1976, Ekeland's appendix proves the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma, also acknowledging [[Claude Lemar\u00e9chal|Lemar\u00e9chal]]'s experiments on page&nbsp;373.</ref><ref name=\"Ekeland74\" >{{cite journal|last=Ekeland|first=Ivar|<!-- authorlink=Ivar Ekeland -->|title=Une estimation ''a&nbsp;priori'' en programmation non&nbsp;convexe|journal=Comptes&nbsp;Rendus Hebdomadaires des S\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences|series=S\u00e9ries&nbsp;A et&nbsp;B|language=French|issn=0151-0509<!-- Not archived on CRAS site, and CRAS's title has changed multiple times -->|volume=279|year=1974|pages=149\u2013151|mr=395844|ref=harv}}<!-- Ekeland sole author; cites Lemar\u00e9chal by title whereas the 1976 appendix acknowledges but does not cite Lemar\u00e9chal (1973)--></ref> Ekeland's analysis explained the success of methods of convex&nbsp;minimization on ''large'' and ''separable'' problems, despite the non-convexities of the summand functions.

''Minkowski addition'' is  defined as the addition of the sets' [[element (mathematics)|member]]s: for example, adding the set consisting of the [[integer]]s zero and one to itself yields the set consisting of zero, one, and two:\n: {0,&nbsp;1}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1} = {0&nbsp;+&nbsp;0,&nbsp;0&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1} = {0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2}.\nThe Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma and related results provide an affirmative answer to the question, \"Is the sum of many sets close to being [[convex set|convex]]?\"<ref name=\"Howe\" >{{harvtxt|Howe|1979|p=1}}: {{citation|title=On the tendency toward convexity of the vector&nbsp;sum of sets|authorlink=Roger Evans Howe|last=Howe|first=Roger |date=3 November 1979 |publisher=[[Cowles Foundation|Cowles Foundation for Research in Economics]], Yale University|series=Cowles Foundation discussion papers|location=Box&nbsp;2125 Yale&nbsp;Station, New&nbsp;Haven, CT&nbsp;06520|volume=538 |url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d05a/d0538.pdf|<!-- url-2=http://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:cwl:cwldpp:538 -->|accessdate=1 January 2011}}\n</ref>  A set is defined to be ''convex'' if every [[line segment]] joining two of its points is a [[subset]] in the set: For example, the solid [[unit disk|disk]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\bullet</math></big> is a convex set but  the [[unit circle|circle]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\circ</math></big> is not, because the line segment joining two distinct points&nbsp;<math>\\oslash</math> is not a subset of the circle.

The ''convex hull'' of a set&nbsp;''Q'' is the smallest convex&nbsp;set that contains&nbsp;''Q''. This distance is zero [[if and only if]] the sum is convex. \nThe theorem's bound on the distance depends&nbsp;on the dimension&nbsp;''D'' and on the shapes of the summand-sets, but ''not'' on the number of summand-sets&nbsp;''N'', {{nowrap|when ''N'' > ''D''.}} \nThe shapes of a subcollection of only&nbsp;''D'' summand-sets determine the bound on the distance between the Minkowski&nbsp;''[[arithmetic mean|average]]'' of&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;sets\n: {{frac|1|''N''}} (''Q''<sub>1</sub> + ''Q''<sub>2</sub> + ... + ''Q''<sub>''N''</sub>)\nand its convex hull.

Starr]], who was investigating the existence of [[general equilibrium theory#Nonconvexities in large economies|economic equilibria]] while studying with [[Kenneth Arrow]].<ref name=\"s69\"/> In his paper, Starr studied a ''convexified'' economy, in which non-convex sets were replaced by their convex hulls; Starr proved that the convexified economy has equilibria that are closely approximated by \"quasi-equilibria\" of the original economy; moreover, he proved that every quasi-equilibrium has many of the optimal properties of true equilibria, which are proved to exist for convex economies. Following Starr's&nbsp;1969 paper, the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr results have been widely used to show that central results of (convex) economic theory are good approximations to large economies with non-convexities; for example, quasi-equilibria closely approximate equilibria of a convexified economy. \"The derivation of these results in general form has been one of the major achievements of postwar economic theory\", wrote [[Roger&nbsp;Guesnerie]].<ref name=\"g89-p138\">{{harvtxt|Guesnerie|1989|p=138}}</ref> The topic of [[non-convexity (economics)|non-convex sets in economics]] has been studied by many [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel laureates]], besides Lloyd Shapley who won the prize in 2012: Arrow (1972), [[Robert Aumann]] (2005), [[G\u00e9rard Debreu]] (1983), [[Tjalling Koopmans]] (1975), [[Paul Krugman]] (2008), and [[Paul Samuelson]] (1970); the complementary topic of [[convexity in economics|convex sets in economics]] has been emphasized by these laureates, along with [[Leonid Hurwicz]], [[Leonid Kantorovich]] (1975), and [[Robert Solow]] (1987).\n\nThe Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has applications also in [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] and [[probability theory]].<ref name=\"Starr08\" >{{harvtxt|Starr|2008}}</ref> In optimization theory, the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has been used to explain the successful solution of minimization problems that are sums of many [[function (mathematics)|function]]s.<ref name=\"Ekeland76\"/><ref name=\"Bertsekas82\"/> The Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma has also been used in [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of the [[law of large numbers|\"law of averages\"]] for [[stochastic geometry|random sets]], a theorem that had been proved <!-- to hold --> for only convex sets.<ref name=\"ArtsteinVitale\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Introductory example==\nFor example, the subset of the integers&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2} is contained in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[real number]]s&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;2], which is convex.

Two points in the Cartesian&nbsp;plane can be ''[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|added]]'' coordinate-wise\n: (''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>1</sub>) + (''x''<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;''y''<sub>2</sub>) = (''x''<sub>1</sub>+''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>+''y''<sub>2</sub>);\nfurther, a point can be ''[[scalar multiplication|multiplied]]'' by each real&nbsp;number&nbsp;''\u03bb'' coordinate-wise\n: ''\u03bb''&nbsp;(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') = (''\u03bbx'', ''\u03bby'').\n\nMore generally, any real vector space of (finite) dimension&nbsp;''D'' can be viewed as the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[tuple|''D''-tuple]]s of&nbsp;''D'' real&nbsp;numbers {{nowrap|{&nbsp;(''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, ''v''<sub>D</sub>)}}&nbsp;} on which  two&nbsp;[[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s are defined: [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector&nbsp;addition]] and [[scalar multiplication|multiplication by a real&nbsp;number]]. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vector&nbsp;addition and real-number&nbsp;multiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the Cartesian plane.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|p=375}}</ref>\n\n===Convex sets===\n{{multiple image\n   | width     =155\n   | footer    = [[Line segment]]s test whether a subset be [[convex set|convex]].\n   | image1    = Convex polygon illustration1.svg\n   | alt1      = Illustration of a convex set, which looks somewhat like a disk: A (green) convex set contains the (black) line-segment joining the points x and y.

For example, a solid [[unit disk|disk]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\bullet</math></big> is convex but a [[unit circle|circle]]&nbsp;<big><math>\\circ</math></big> is not, because it does not contain a line segment joining its points&nbsp;<math>\\oslash</math>; the non-convex set of three integers&nbsp;{0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2} is contained in the interval&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;2], which is convex.

Each basket is represented as a non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an ''[[indifference curve]]'' is defined for each consumer; a consumer's indifference curve contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same indifference curve, the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one indifference curve. A consumer's ''preference set'' (relative to an indifference curve) is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the indifference curve and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the indifference curve. A consumer's ''preferences'' are ''convex'' if all such preference sets are convex.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mas-Colell|1985|pp=58\u201361}} and {{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=76\u201379}}</ref>\n\nAn optimal basket of goods occurs where the budget-line [[supporting hyperplane|supports]] a consumer's preference set, as shown in the diagram.

Thus, the set of optimal baskets is a <!--  set valued function, or multifunction, or correspondence or relation-->[[function (mathematics)|function]] of the <!-- relative --> prices, and this function is called the consumer's ''[[demand]]''. If the preference set is convex, then at every price the consumer's demand is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket or a line-segment of baskets.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=79\u201381}}</ref>\n\n====Non-convex preferences====\n[[File:NonConvex.gif|right|thumb|alt=Image of a non-convex preference set with a concavity un-supported by the budget line|When the consumer's preferences have concavities, the consumer may jump between two separate optimal baskets.]]\n{{See also|Non-convexity (economics)}}\nHowever, if a preference set is ''non-convex'', then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two ''separate'' optimal-baskets.

We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of a lion (or a [[griffin]])!

In the convexified economy, at each price, the <!-- not necessarily closed -->[[aggregate demand]] was the sum of convex hulls of the consumers' demands. Starr's ideas interested the mathematicians [[Lloyd Shapley]] and [[Jon Folkman]], who proved their [[eponym]]ous <!-- Shapley\u2013Folkman --> lemma and <!-- the Shapley\u2013Folkman --> theorem in \"private correspondence\", <!-- entitled \"Starr's problem\" (1966), --> which was reported by Starr's published paper of 1969.<ref name=\"s69\"/>\n\nIn his 1969 publication, Starr applied the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr theorem. Starr proved that the \"convexified\" economy has general equilibria that can be closely approximated by \"''quasi-equilibria''\" of the original economy, when the number of agents exceeds the dimension of the goods: Concretely, Starr proved that there exists at least one quasi-equilibrium of prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub> with the following properties:\n\n* For each quasi-equilibrium's prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub>, all consumers can choose optimal baskets (maximally preferred and meeting their budget constraints).\n* At quasi-equilibrium prices&nbsp;''p''<sub>opt</sub> in the convexified economy, every good's market is in equilibrium: Its supply equals its demand.\n* For each quasi-equilibrium, the prices \"nearly clear\" the markets for the original economy: an [[upper bound]] on the [[Hausdorff distance|distance]] between the set of equilibria of the  \"convexified\" economy and the set of quasi-equilibria of the original economy followed from Starr's corollary to the Shapley\u2013Folkman theorem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Arrow|Hahn|1980|pp=169\u2013182}}. {{harvtxt|Starr|1969|pp=27\u201333}}\n</ref>\n\nStarr established that\n<blockquote>\n\"in the aggregate, the discrepancy between an allocation in the fictitious economy generated by [taking the convex hulls of all of the consumption&nbsp;and&nbsp;production sets] and some allocation in the real economy is bounded in a way that is independent of the number of economic agents. Therefore, the average&nbsp;agent experiences a deviation from intended actions that vanishes in significance as the number&nbsp;of&nbsp;agents goes to infinity\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Green|Heller|1981|p=44}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nFollowing Starr's&nbsp;1969 paper, the Shapley\u2013Folkman\u2013Starr results have been widely used in economic theory. [[Roger&nbsp;Guesnerie]] summarized their economic implications: \"<!-- [s] -->Some key results obtained under the convexity assumption remain (approximately) relevant in circumstances where convexity fails.

However, the [[sine|sine&nbsp;function]] (pictured) is non-convex on the [[interval (mathematics)#Terminology|interval]]&nbsp;(0,&nbsp;\u03c0).\n\n====Additive optimization problems====\nIn many optimization problems, the [[optimization (mathematics)#objective function|objective function]]&nbsp;f is ''separable'': that is, ''f'' is the sum of ''many'' summand-functions, each of which has its own argument:\n\n: ''f''(''x'') = ''f''<big>(</big>&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''</sub>)<big>&nbsp;)</big> = <big>\u2211</big>&nbsp;''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nFor example, problems of [[linear programming|linear optimization]] are separable. Given a separable problem with an optimal solution, we fix an optimal solution\n\n: ''x''<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''x''<sub>''N''</sub>)<sub>min</sub>\n\nwith the minimum value&nbsp;{{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>).}}  For this separable problem, we also consider an optimal solution  <big>(</big>''x''<sub>min</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>) <big>)</big>\nto the \"''convexified problem''\", where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of  the summand functions. Such an optimal solution is the [[limit of a sequence]] of points in the convexified problem\n: <big>(</big>''x''<sub>''j''</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>j</sub>) <big>)</big><big>&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;</big> <big>\u2211</big> Conv <big>(</big>Graph( ''f''<sub>''n''</sub> ) <big>)</big>.<ref name=\"Ekeland76\"/><ref>\nThe [[limit of a sequence]] is a member of the [[closure (topology)|closure of the original set]], which is the smallest [[closed set]] that contains the original set. The Minkowski sum of two [[closed set]]s need not be closed, so the following [[subset#inclusion|inclusion]] can be strict\n: Clos(P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;Clos(Q) \u2286 Clos(&nbsp;Clos(P)&nbsp;+&nbsp;Clos(Q)&nbsp;);\nthe inclusion can be strict even for two ''convex'' closed summand-sets, according to {{harvtxt|Rockafellar|1997|pp=49 and&nbsp;75}}. Ensuring that the Minkowski&nbsp;sum of sets be closed requires the closure operation, which appends limits of convergent sequences.</ref>\nOf course, the given optimal-point  is a sum of points in the graphs of the original summands and of a small number of convexified summands, by the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma.\n\nThis analysis was published by [[Ivar Ekeland]] in&nbsp;1974 to explain the apparent convexity of separable problems with many summands, despite the non-convexity of the summand problems. In 1973, the young mathematician [[Claude Lemar\u00e9chal]] was surprised by his success with [[convex optimization|convex minimization]] [[iterative method|method]]s on problems that were known to be non-convex; for [[nonlinear programming|minimizing nonlinear]] problems, a solution of the [[dual problem]] problem need not provide useful information for solving the primal problem, unless the primal problem be convex and satisfy a [[constraint qualification]]. Lemar\u00e9chal's problem was additively separable, and each summand function was non-convex; nonetheless, a solution to the dual problem provided a close approximation to the primal problem's optimal value.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lemar\u00e9chal|1973|p=38}}: {{citation|last=Lemar\u00e9chal|first=Claude|authorlink=Claude Lemar\u00e9chal|title=Utilisation de la dualit\u00e9 dans les probl\u00e9mes non&nbsp;convexes [Use of duality for non\u2013convex problems]|language=French| date=April 1973 |issue=16|location=Domaine de&nbsp;Voluceau, [[Rocquencourt]],&nbsp;78150 [[Le Chesnay|Le&nbsp;Chesnay]], France|publisher=[[National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control|IRIA (now&nbsp;INRIA)]], Laboratoire de recherche en informatique et automatique|page=41|ref=harv}}. <!-- Ekeland cites this report in the ''[[Comptes Rendus|CRAS]]'' announcement of the results of his Appendix&nbsp;I -->\nLemar\u00e9chal's experiments were discussed in later publications: <p>{{harvtxt|Aardal|1995|pp=2\u20133}}: {{cite journal|first=Karen|last=Aardal|authorlink=Karen Aardal|title=''Optima'' interview <!--sic., neither colon nor m-dash appear -->Claude  Lemar\u00e9chal|journal=Optima: Mathematical Programming Society Newsletter|pages=2\u20134|date=March 1995|volume=45|url=http://www.mathprog.org/Old-Optima-Issues/optima45.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2011|ref=harv}}</p><p>{{harvtxt|Hiriart-Urruty|Lemar\u00e9chal|1993|pp=143\u2013145, 151, 153, and&nbsp;156}}: {{cite book|last1=Hiriart-Urruty|first1=Jean-Baptiste|last2=Lemar\u00e9chal|first2=Claude|authorlink2=Claude Lemar\u00e9chal|ref=harv|chapter=XII Abstract duality for practitioners|title=Convex analysis and minimization algorithms, Volume&nbsp;'''II''': Advanced theory and bundle methods|series=Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences]|volume=306|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|year=1993|pages=136\u2013193 (and bibliographical comments on pp.&nbsp;334\u2013335)|isbn=3-540-56852-2|mr=1295240}}</p>\n</ref><ref name=\"Ekeland76\" >{{harv|Ekeland|1999|pp=357\u2013359}}: Published in the first English edition of 1976, Ekeland's appendix proves the Shapley\u2013Folkman lemma, also acknowledging [[Claude Lemar\u00e9chal|Lemar\u00e9chal]]'s experiments on page&nbsp;373.</ref><ref name=\"Ekeland74\" >{{cite journal|last=Ekeland|first=Ivar|<!-- authorlink=Ivar Ekeland -->|title=Une estimation ''a&nbsp;priori'' en programmation non&nbsp;convexe|journal=Comptes&nbsp;Rendus Hebdomadaires des S\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences|series=S\u00e9ries&nbsp;A et&nbsp;B|language=French|issn=0151-0509<!-- Not archived on CRAS site, and CRAS's title has changed multiple times -->|volume=279|year=1974|pages=149\u2013151|mr=395844|ref=harv}}<!-- Ekeland sole author; cites Lemar\u00e9chal by title whereas the 1976 appendix acknowledges but does not cite Lemar\u00e9chal (1973)--></ref> Ekeland's analysis explained the success of methods of convex&nbsp;minimization on ''large'' and ''separable'' problems, despite the non-convexities of the summand functions.

{"title_page": "Leo Glynn", "text_new": "{{for|the Australian footballer|Leo Glynn (footballer)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=August 2008}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''Leo Glynn'''  (played by [[Ernie Hudson]]) is a fictional character on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. He is the warden of the Oswald State Correctional Facility.\n\n==Character overview==\n\nGlynn began working as a correctional officer in the early 1960s and, true to that era, is a very old-fashioned and [[conservatism|conservative]] official. As described in the journal of [[Augustus Hill]], Glynn's philosophy of running a prison is based more on retribution than redemption and rehabilitation. As stated in the journal, the reasoning behind this is so Glynn can one day be promoted to the position of Commissioner of Prisons and perhaps even become the state's first African-American Governor. He runs the entire prison, answering mainly to [[Governor James Devlin]], a [[right-wing]] politician with whom even Glynn has policy disagreements.\n\nThroughout the series, Glynn is well-respected by the staff and, for the most part, treats the prisoners as justly as need be. Despite this, he has had moments which show another side of his personality. He can be petty and vindictive at times, notably refusing to move Andrew Schillinger due to his dislike of Vern Schillinger and making Alvarez miss a meeting with his family out of a dislike of Latinos. Furthermore, he is often prone to take sides against those he works with. He fired - and quickly rehired - Sister Pete for protesting an execution. He was unwilling to defend McManus and Em City from Devlin as well as siding with black inmates on some issues. Glynn can also act on his disdain for prisoners on occasion, such as letting Alvarez starve and nearly commit suicide after he blinded a guard.\n\n===As Warden===\n\nAs Glynn's philosophy in running a prison is retribution-based, he is very conservative on issues involving Law and Order, believing that the prisoners in Oz should serve hard time for hard crimes. As warden, he cares most about maintaining order in his prison and stopping the drug trade amongst other things. To prevent drugs from moving within Oz, Glynn is a fan of week-long lockdowns as a means of keeping the inmates from moving drugs within Oz. Knowing the demographics and power structure of Oz, Glynn also secretly assigns two black Narcotics Detectives from the Police Department on two different occasions to put a plug in the drug traffic. As a former CO, Glynn realizes that contraband or \"tits\" does get sneaked into Oz and won't go away completely, but he wants the staff to enforce the smuggling as much as possible.\n\nWhen acts of violence occur in Oz, Glynn has a tendency to lead a harsh interrogation of the suspected inmates, but is quick to file a crime as \"unsolved\" when there is not adequate enough evidence to convict someone. Glynn also tries to only make convictions on inmates that result in a major change of Oz's power structure. On violence between the inmates, Glynn is preventive when lives are at risk and quick to lock down and isolate specific inmates as a means of stopping a war. He never seems to favor one side of inmates in any war and is quick to inflict penalties upon the gang's leaders. When inmates misbehave in general, Glynn immediately orders the staff to place them in solitary, as Glynn wants the inmates who cause the most trouble out of the general population for as long as he can keep them out. Solitary seems to be the most preferable punishment to Glynn, as he is quick to send an inmate to Ad Seg when the prison rules have been somewhat violated. When obtaining inside information about acts of violence to occur in Oz, Glynn often cares less about the informants' motives in reporting it and uses the information to cause a lock-down of the prison.\n\nOn the issue of [[prison rape]], Glynn is typically slow to investigate acts of sexual abuse and violence for two main reasons. First, Glynn realizes rape will occur in prison no matter what he does, and second, Glynn sees the positive administrative standpoint of rape inside prison in the \"leveling effect\" it has upon the rape victims. Glynn feels that inmates who are victims of rape are less likely to be a discipline problem, such as when inmate Peter Schibetta, whom Glynn has a personal vendetta against, is raped on two different occasions. This attitude shocks Oz staff members such as [[Sister Peter Marie]], who remind Leo that he should take a more compassionate view about rape following the rape of his daughter.\n\nAmongst the inmates, Glynn is feared due to his toughened law and order based attitude. Glynn's preference for the isolation ward, week-long lock downs, and harsh interrogation style helps him empower this fear. Unlike [[Tim McManus]], he does not try to build a working relationship with the inmates to help them better themselves; rather, he just cares that they are obedient of his command of the prison. Glynn seems to get along with the inmates who run the cafeteria as long as it is run in an efficient and respectable manner. In general though, Glynn treats the inmates as fairly as need be, assuming they have not done anything to cross his path.\n\nAmongst his staff, Glynn is well-respected even by COs who have shown a dislike for Oz's minority inmates. When problems pertaining to COs and inmates arise, Glynn is quick to help his officers out, whether it be keeping inmates who attack them in Solitary Confinement or preventing an investigation that could lead to the firing of one of his officers. This is mainly because Glynn feels that he and his staff must remain unified and see eye-to-eye as much as possible. Throughout the series, Glynn has disagreements with some of the higher ranking liberal staff members such as [[Tim McManus]], [[Sister Peter Marie|Sister Pete]], and [[Dr. Gloria Nathan]], but respects their vision and does what he can to meet them halfway on most issues. Overall, Glynn is focused on maintaining order amongst the inmates, stopping the drug trade, and convicting the inmates he can for crimes that they commit when sufficient evidence is present.\n\n===Family and relationships===\n\nEarlier in the series, Leo has a wife, Mary, with at least one daughter, Ardeth. At that point Ardeth is college-aged and Leo is stressed out when she asks him if she and her boyfriend can share an apartment. She is raped at school by a gang of Latinos, a move that puts Glynn into disarray, causing him to lash out against Latino inmate [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]]. When Alvarez claims to know who committed the rape, he tortures Leo with this knowledge. Leo would have beaten Miguel into submission had Father Ray Mukada not been around. This starts the bad blood between Alvarez and Glynn, which continues to the end of the series.\n\nLeo's brother Mark also has economic issues in Season 2 and commits a murder for the mafia that Italian inmate Peter Schibetta uses for leverage. When Mark turns himself in, Leo remains on bad terms with Schibetta and shows no interest in investigating when Peter is raped on two different occasions.\n\nDuring Season 4's election campaign, Glynn uses details about his brother and daughter as part of his campaign, a move that angers Mary, culminating in a divorce in the second half of the season. While separated, the viewers assume that Glynn will begin a relationship with new secretary [[Floria Mills]], but no specific details on the show confirm this. As far as other family members are concerned, CO [[Clayton Hughes]] is the son of Leo's best friend, deceased CO Samuel Hughes, and Leo becomes the closest thing Hughes has to a father. When Hughes goes crazy and is incarcerated at nearby Lardner prison, Glynn demands that he be transferred to Oz where he can be protected; however, in Oz, Hughes experiences a psychotic break and tries to murder Glynn during a hostage situation. Hughes' erratic behavior drives Glynn to an alcoholic state where he is seen drinking whiskey on the job during two instances in Season 4. When Tim McManus' ex-wife [[Eleanor O'Connor]] comes to Oz, she and Leo begin a relationship.\n\n===As an African American===\n\nGlynn treats prisoners of every race equally, never showing favoritism towards any specific ethnic group. (He is seen being forced to show favoritism to the Italian inmates at one point due to blackmail; similarly, he for a while took a very hard line against Latinos in the prison as a result of a Latino gang raping his daughter.) As Oz is racially divided by individual groups, several of the white inmates such as [[Vern Schillinger]] have often referred to Glynn as Oz's \"[[Nigger]] [[Prison warden|Warden]]\". Glynn states to [[Clayton Hughes]], whom he views as a son, that he feels no sense of brotherhood toward any of the Black inmates in Oz, only towards Blacks who obey the law. Glynn is also politically conservative, so he often does not feel the same way that most other Blacks do when it comes to various state issues (In season 4, it is stated that [[Governor Devlin]]'s office has a bad relationship with the state's black community). Glynn also points out in Season 3 that he began working as a CO in Oz in the late 1960s, suggesting that he could very well be Oz's first black correctional officer.\n\nIn season 1, Glynn initially attempts to get black inmate [[Kareem Said]] to tone down his rhetoric about the prison system by telling him \"Don't fuck with me, my brother\" as a means of telling him, as one Black man to another, not to cause any racial uprisings within Oz. In season 4, Glynn is asked to run as Devlin's Lieutenant Governor mainly because [[Alvah Case]], a well-respected African American law school dean, is the Democratic candidate for governor. Glynn agrees because he is as conservative as Devlin on most every issue. At this point, Glynn is also pressured to fire Tim McManus but does not do so until McManus commits a series of self-destructive acts closed out by the singing of \"De [[Camptown Races]]\", a [[blackface]] minstrel song at the funeral of a Black CO. During the campaign, Glynn is pressured by fellow black community activists to replace McManus with a black Unit Manager. He does, but eventually McManus and inmate [[Kareem Said]] show evidence of corruption in Emerald City, which results in McManus getting his job back.\n\nGlynn's ethnicity is brought up once again in Season 6 when an associate of [[Governor Devlin]], City Mayor [[Wilson Loewen]], is found guilty of aiding and abetting members of the [[White supremacist]] organization the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a 1963 murder of two young [[African American]] girls. A [[race riot]] breaks out in the city's African-American neighborhoods and Glynn prevents one from breaking out in Oz by immediately locking down the prison upon the news airing of the trial. When Loewen is sent to Oz, Glynn is forced by Devlin to place him in a safe housing unit with no African-American inmates, as a means of keeping Loewen alive until Devlin can eventually pardon him. Loewen arrives in Oz attempting to bring up good memories between him and Leo during the governor campaign but Glynn, disgusted by Loewen's crime, states that their past relationship is now over as the courts have found him guilty. As Loewen pleads innocence, Glynn turns a deaf ear causing Loewen to presumptuously tell Glynn that as an African-American male, he should realize the courts' decisions have not always been correct.\n\n==Season 1==\n\nAs warden of Oz, Glynn carries out Governor James Devlin's orders and does what he can to manage the state's largest correctional facility. An experimental cell block, Emerald City, is opened up and run by unit manager Tim McManus. McManus is unlike the rest of the higher ranking staff at Oz in that he came in with a college education and never started off as a correctional officer. He is a [[Liberalism|liberal]] idealist with whom Glynn often disagrees. McManus has complete control of Em City from the commissioner but Glynn overrides his decisions at times. One in particular is the addition of inmate [[Paul Markstrom]] to the population of Em City: Markstrom, according to the file, is a petty African American drug dealer supposedly related to Glynn, but in actuality he is an undercover narcotics detective looking to put a plug in the drug trade. Glynn is the only staff member who knows his true identity and this becomes a problem when the [[Italy|Italian]] inmates, led by [[Nino Schibetta]], kill Markstrom. Throughout the season, McManus and Glynn argue frequently over the methods of controlling the drug distribution amongst the inmates. Glynn believes in more lockdowns and shakedowns to stop the traffic, while McManus argues for addiction treatment. Glynn announces several new policies over the season that anger the majority of the prison population. The board of corrections has decided to ban smoking and conjugal visit privileges from the prisoners and Glynn, while not agreeing with all the policies, decides that enforcing them is more important. Tim McManus is most vocal against Devlin's administration and states that a riot may very well occur in Oz. Adding to this tension is the arrival of inmate Kareem Sa\u00efd, a black Muslim who is incarcerated for arson. Sa\u00efd is a well known militant who poses a major threat to the staff, Homeboys, and the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryan Brotherhood]] inmates.\n\nThroughout the season several inmates die in Em City, mainly caught in the drug war between the Italian and Black inmates. This angers Devlin, who is already in the process of reinstating the death penalty. The death penalty is reinstated and  Homeboy leader [[Jefferson Keane]] is executed by the state for murdering other inmates. Another inmate, [[Donald Groves]], attempts to murder Glynn as he is trying to help the cause of Kareem Sa\u00efd. Groves instead kills African American CO [[Lawrence Smith (Oz)|Lawrence Smith]] and as a result he is sentenced to death. Groves' attempt on Glynn and murdering of a CO causes the other guards to begin randomly assaulting prisoners throughout Oz, which appalls McManus. Glynn is urged by prison doctor Gloria Nathan and McManus to fire the guards for this, but Glynn instead temporarily suspends various COs without pay. This decision angers staff investigator [[Lenny Burrano]], who explains to Glynn that, as they both came up through the ranks as guards, they should understand the hardness and attitude that develop with the job. Glynn also is trying to put a plug in the drug trade and urges McManus to shut down the Italian inmates who control it the most. McManus does his best to do this by transferring all of the Italians, with the exception of Schibetta, out of Emerald City.\n\nIn the meantime, Kareem Sa\u00efd is organizing the Muslims and other inmates secretly, causing McManus to be greatly concerned about a riot. When disgraced Muslim [[Huseni Mershah]] claims that Sa\u00efd wants to start a riot, Glynn orders a shakedown of Emerald City that results in a weapons seizure from every inmate but Sa\u00efd. McManus' suspicions come true and the prisoners stage a coup in Em City, taking the COs hostage. Sa\u00efd has a gun (which an unknown Black CO gave to him) during the riot and uses it to force the inmates to organize. With the help of [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]], [[Ryan O'Reily]], [[Simon Adebisi]], and Miguel Alvarez, Sa\u00efd and the inmates make a list of demands in exchange for the guards they have taken hostage. Glynn finds most of the demands to be reasonable, but Devlin urges Glynn to have the S.O.R.T. team take back Em City force. McManus opposes this and goes into Em City with food for the prisoners in order to see how the hostages are doing. When McManus does not return, Devlin has the S.O.R.T. team go in with machine guns and a violent battle ensues. As a result, 6 inmates and 2 correctional officers die and the rest of the prisoners are sent back to Gen Pop (With the exception of the riot leaders who were taken to Solitary). McManus and several other staff members are accidentally shot and wounded in the fray, but survive.\n\n==Season 2==\n\nThe aftermath of the riot is investigated by Alvah Case, a law school dean whom [[Governor James Devlin|Devlin]] has appointed to lead the investigation for purposes of diverting blame from Devlin. Throughout the investigation, Glynn and the staff attempt to cover up the murder of inmate [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]] from Case. Ross was shot in the head, heart, and genitals and after interrogating several staff members, Case is convinced that CO [[Diane Whittlesey]] is the shooter. Glynn urges Case to leave it alone, as Whittlesey is one of his best guards and Ross was widely disliked by both staff and inmates. Case concludes that the only way to clear Devlin of culpability in using force is to file no charges against any of the prisoners. He states that the riot was caused directly by anti-prisoner acts passed through the Governor's office and that if the prisoners are guilty, Devlin is too. Devlin warns Case that he will not become the state's attorney general as a result, but Case no longer wants the position as after investigating the prison conditions, he wants to run against Devlin for governor in the next election instead. Devlin is not supportive of this but goes through with it as Case announces to the press that no one in particular is at fault for the riot but improvements will be made to prevent another riot. This saves the job of Glynn and everyone else on the staff and also guarantees the reopening of Em City.\n\nEmerald City is reopened 10 months after the riot under a new deal approved by Glynn and McManus. Ten inmate groups - The Muslims, Aryans, Homeboys, Latinos, Italians, Irish, Bikers, Gays, Christians, and Others - will have four inmates from each group living in Em City and one representative from each group will be present on a Seg Council as a means of figuring out how to make life better for themselves and the staff inside of Oz. McManus starts a GED program which Glynn supports until Governor Devlin cuts it from the state budget. The program has positive results, however, particularly with inmate [[Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson]], whose talent for poetry brings a good name to Oz, a published book, and an early parole. This is short-lived however as Poet violates parole and murders a drug dealer to whom he owed money, causing his return to Oz.\n\nGlynn is distraught when his daughter is raped at school by a gang of Latinos. A snide remark by inmate Miguel Alvarez during a speech that Glynn gives the inmates causes him to lash out and send Alvarez to solitary confinement. Sister Pete urges Glynn that he is a better man than that and that Miguel Alvarez was incarcerated at the time of the rape. Glynn lets Alvarez out of solitary; Alvarez, however, knows the men responsible for the rape and taunts Glynn with this knowledge as revenge. In an interrogation, Alvarez refuses to give names but scomments pertaining to Glynn's daughter's rape. Glynn nearly assaults Alvarez but is stopped by [[Father Ray Mukada]]. This incident causes bad blood between Glynn and Alvarez, who later in the season blinds a Latino CO named [[Eugene Rivera]]. As a result, Alvarez is gladly sent to solitary by Glynn.\n\nThe introduction of Italian inmate Peter Schibetta is a further source of tension for Glynn. Peter is the son of deceased leader Nino Schibetta and runs the Italians with the help of [[Chucky Pancamo]]. Leo's brother Mark committed a murder for the mafia, and Peter uses knowledge of this as leverage to get what he wants from Glynn. Peter takes control of the kitchen for the Italians and then tells Leo that he will pay the price if Mark does not turn himself in for the murder. Mark turns himself in after a talk with Leo, who then furiously transfers the Italian inmates out of the kitchen and into the dress factory. Peter is later raped by Black inmate Simon Adebisi and Glynn makes no effort to investigate, as he wants Schibetta to suffer. [[Antonio Nappa]] comes to Oz to run the Italians, and with the help of the Italian staff members gets Glynn to take Adebisi off of heroin as a result.\n\nOther issues that preside for Glynn come in the form of Vernon Schillinger and Kareem Sa\u00efd. Inmate [[Alexander Vogel]] is murdered with the word \"JEW\" carved into his chest. Glynn quickly interrogates Schillinger, the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood, but gets nothing besides Schillinger's obstinent and racist behavior (Schillinger tells Glynn that his \"people\", i.e. [[African Americans]] are as anti-semitic as the Brotherhood in addition to humming a [[blackface]] minstrel song praising slavery). Glynn finds proof from gay inmate [[Richie Hanlon]], who is then forced to cop to Vogel's murder by Aryan Guard [[Karl Metzger]]. Schillinger thereby goes free, which angers Glynn. During the Islamic month of Ramadan, Glynn announces that Governor Devlin is pardoning a Muslim inmate from Oz. Kareem Sa\u00efd is chosen but refuses to accept at the press conference as he believes it is a cheap way of gaining Islamic voters throughout the state. Sa\u00efd stays in Oz, a move that shocks Glynn and Tim McManus.\n\n==Season 3==\n\nA number of incidents involving the Aryan Brotherhood have occurred and Tim McManus thinks CO Karl Metzger is responsible. McManus' suspicions are proven right when it is discovered that Metzger used to belong to a White Supremacist organization; however, Glynn refuses to take action until there is hard evidence that Metzger is working with Vern Schillinger and the Aryans. This surprises McManus, who points out to Glynn that Metzger only thinks of Glynn as a \"Nigger.\" [[Chris Keller]] then comes forward with evidence and Vernon Schillinger is placed in solitary, but Metzger is found murdered before charges can be brought. Glynn later approves the hiring of [[Sean Murphy (Oz)|Sean Murphy]], who is a lifelong friend of Tim McManus, as the head CO of Emerald City. Murphy starts a boxing program where one inmate from each group will be represented in a tournament. Meanwhile, Augustus Hill, with the help of Kareem Said, testifies against inmate [[Malcolm Coyle]] for murdering an Italian American family without getting caught. Glynn informs the DA but is too late as the Italians, led by Antonio Nappa, protect Hill by murdering Coyle. Glynn also must deal with letting Miguel Alvarez redeem himself for blinding Rivera by interacting with Sister Pete. In the midst of this, the Latinos are caught dealing drugs and after being unsuccessfully interrogated by Glynn, they make an attempt on Alvarez's life.\n\nGlynn has a major issue when Clayton Hughes applies for a job at Oz. Hughes' father Samuel was an African American CO and Glynn's best friend, who died working in Oz in 1982. As a result, Leo is the closest thing Clayton has to a father since Sam's death, and he ardently refuses to hire Clayton out of fear for his safety. Glynn ultimately hires Clayton, however, to the objections of his mother, Lenore, as Clayton did well enough in CO training to be hired immediately in another State Prison. Glynn keeps a close eye on Clayton, who ends up working in Em City. Unfortunately, Clayton proves to be a poor fit, messing up on more than one occasion, and is transferred to the library as a result. Glynn must also tell Hughes about the details pertaining to his father's death, which greatly disturb Clayton. Things are made worse for Clayton when Simon Adebisi tells him that Samuel's killing was racially motivated.\n\nIn the course of the season Tim McManus is accused of sexually harassing CO [[Claire Howell]] and inmate [[Kenny Wangler]]. Because of McManus' reputation for bed hopping and womanizing, Glynn does not know what to believe and warns McManus that if any of the allegations are true, he will be fired, complaining of the \"shit storms\" McManus has created. McManus retorts that Glynn's judgment is clouded by racial bias, pointing out that he has automatically taken the side of any Black inmate or staff member when issues pertaining to McManus arise.\n\nAt the same time, the racial tension in Oz is on the rise due to the boxing tournament (which Ryan O'Reilly has been manipulating to ensure his brother Cyril wins all his fights) and a plan Simon Abedisi is formulating. The boxing tournament is put on hold when the Aryan and Muslim inmates fight, but Ryan O'Reily and [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]] convince Glynn to let the finals happen. The finals end in tragedy, fueling to the emotional fire between the inmates, and Glynn is forced to lock down the prison. As he does so Hughes comes to him, stating that they should be helping the black inmates out instead of punishing them. Glynn then states he feels no sense of brotherhood towards any of the black inmates in Oz and then fires Hughes. As the lockdown is put into effect, Hughes sneaks Adebisi a gun as a going away gift.\n\n==Season 4 Part I==\n\nGlynn ends the lock down, telling the Black and White inmates separately that if one more racially motivated incident occurs, Oz will be permanently locked down. The Latinos in the meantime are not warned, as they are somewhat neutral throughout the racial tension. [[Governor James Devlin]]'s campaign manager then tells Glenn he has been chosen as a candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor]], as their current Lieutenant Frank Feeley has throat cancer and will not be running for re-election. Glynn immediately asks if this is because [[Alvah Case]], a fellow [[African American]] has announced that he is running against Devlin. Devlin's campaign manager [[Wendy Schultz]] says it is a strong reason why Glynn has been chosen, as there is a bad history between Devlin and the State's [[African American]] community. Racial issues aside, Schultz states that their office figures that someone as conservative and publicly known as Glynn would be a great candidate for Lieutenant Governor and Glynn then says yes, suspiciously. In Oz, Glynn wants to stop the drug traffic as the Homeboys, Latinos, and Italians (for the time being) are allied, so he gets a narcotics detective [[Johnny Basil]] to pose as a Jamaican drug dealer named [[Desmond Mobay]]. Glynn is the only one who knows Basil's true identity and informs him of the dangers associated with Oz, as another undercover detective Paul Markstrom died many years earlier in Oz. Throughout the season, Basil is somewhat convincing as Mobay to the point where he ends up snorting a lot of heroin and murdering an inmate to get in the good graces of all three gangster groups.\n\nAdebisi then asks Glynn to move Black inmates [[Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson]], [[Kenny Wangler]], and [[List of Oz (TV series) characters#Homeboys|Junior Pierce]] out of Unit B and into Em City as a means of ending some of the racial tension within Oz's walls. [[Tim McManus]] opposes this mainly because he hates Wangler for lying about a sexual harassment charge. Glynn is interested in eliminating racial issues within Oz and overrides McManus' objection.  More racial issues arise, however, as those three inmates harass a new White inmate unfit for prison. Adebisi, wanting revenge on Wangler, gives a gun to this inmate [[Guillaume Tarrant]] who then shoots Wangler, Pierce and a Black CO [[Joseph Howard (Oz)|Joseph Howard]] amongst others. Glynn is now under intense pressure to fire Tim McManus and solve the gun smuggling quickly as a means of making the prison look well managed during the election campaign. Adebisi and Muslim inmate [[Zahir Arif]] point out that McManus must go and a Black unit manager must be hired. Glynn does not yet give in, as he still thinks McManus is competent and mentally sound enough to run Emerald City. McManus, however, is on a self-destructive path following recent relationship problems and sings De Camptown Races, a blackface minstrel song at the funeral of Joseph Howard, the Black CO who died in the shooting. As seen through earlier issues regarding race between McManus and Glynn, Leo draws the line with McManus here and immediately fires him as Unit Manager of Emerald City.\n\nA problem arises when inmates [[Agamemnon Busmalis]] and Miguel Alvarez escape Oz through a tunnel and Glynn asks [[Raoul \"El Cid\" Hernandez]], the Latino's leader who despises Alvarez to help find him. El Cid orders a hit on Alvarez, who is now on the run. Meanwhile, when investigating the gun smuggling, Glynn is told by El Cid that Adebisi got the gun from Clayton Hughes on Hughes' last day of work. Glynn furiously calls in Clayton who admits to smuggling the gun and Glynn has Hughes arrested and told to shut up in the meantime. Since being fired, Hughes has become a Black Militant and is giving speeches that condemn Governor Devlin on a routine basis. Busmalis is then captured and the Republican party then is looking better in the preliminary polls. The Muslim inmates convince African American community leaders to pressure Glynn into hiring a Black unit manager for Em City, and he begins to listen more and more as a means of becoming Lieutenant Governor with the Black vote. Glynn then hires [[Martin Querns]] a Black man to run Em City, appeasing the general public.\n\nMartin Querns has experience working in several state detention centers and federal penitentiaries and is also from the ghetto like several of Oz's African American inmates. Querns is told he may run Em City any way he wishes as long as racial tension and violence are eliminated. Querns immediately reduces the violence by more than 92% and eliminates the racial tension element altogether. Although he does this by empowering Simon Adebisi and his followers and sending most of the White inmates out of Em City, Glynn does not care as, for the time being, the Unit looks better managed. In the meantime, Tim McManus undergoes psychiatric therapy and wants to run Em City again; but, the only available job in the Unit Manager position is Unit B, which he reluctantly takes. During the campaign as order is maintained in Oz, Glynn stops paying attention to what changes are being made in Em City and is more focused on becoming the Lieutenant Governor. At a staff meeting, Tim McManus points out what has happened in Em City and Glynn turns a deaf ear because the violence has been almost eliminated from Em City. At a press conference shortly afterwards, Clayton Hughes goes psycho and tries to kill Governor Devlin. Devlin nearly dies, Hughes is charged with attempted murder, and Glynn drops out of the election race to stand by Clayton as he goes to trial.\n\nOut of the election campaign, Glynn is brought more up to what has happened inside of Oz. Detective Johnny Basil turns himself in for the murder of [[Bruno Goergen]], as his conscience kicks in and tell him to stop doing what he's doing to prove that he is not undercover. Two inmates then die, both residents of Em City and Glynn begins to get angered with Querns. McManus points out that Querns has empowered Adebisi and the Homeboys in Em City turning a blind eye to their behavior as long as order is maintained. He points out the lack of diversity as all the COs are now Black and White inmates are also scarce. Finally, he points out drugs are out of control as stopping the drug traffic is not a priority of Querns. Glynn isn't convinced of this until McManus, with the help of Kareem Said, brings him a videotape of a party inside of Adebisi's pod. Glynn is disgusted by the acts involving drugs, alcohol, and sex that the Black inmates are committing unpunished. As a result, Querns is immediately fired and Leo realizes he hasn't paid enough attention to what has happened in Oz. He reinstates McManus as unit manager of Em City, and Adebisi then dies making a murder attempt on Kareem Sa\u00efd.\n\n==Season 4 Part II==\n\nThis half of the season starts out with the investigation of a news crew coming into Oz. Glynn is afraid that several dead issues will be resurrected through the media and is fearful that Oz may be shut down altogether. To make matters worse several inmates suggest what has happened during Adebisi's reign of power in Em City. Martin Querns then comes to Glynn asking him to destroy any evidence relating to the rampant drug use that occurred in Em City as a means of saving both of them from facing criminal charges. This news crew led by Jack Eldridge eventually agrees with Glynn that the story should not be aired and this is completed by a beating at the hands of inmate [[Cyril O'Reily]]. Even though the staff is glad that O'Reily scarred off the news crew, Cyril's behavior grows worse over the season and Glynn is urged by McManus to send him to a mental institute. Amongst the O'Reily's, Cyril's brother Ryan is accused by Muslim inmate Zahir Arif of murdering [[Patrick Keenan]], an investigation that angers Glynn and frustrates Ryan. There is not enough evidence at the time however and Glynn must let O'Reily go free.\n\nA number of new developments occur throughout this season however for Glynn. Oz is temporarily asked to house some illegal refugees from China who get caught up in a war between the Homeboys, Italians, and Latinos. This war escalates throughout the season to the point that inmates Supreme Allah and [[Enrique Morales]] are targeted to die by the Homeboy's new leader Burr Redding. Supreme is attacked in the visiting room at one point and later dies in the cafeteria all on acts devised by the Homeboys. Morales lives though and with the help of Chucky Pancamo the Italian's leader, makes numerous attempts on Redding throughout the season. Miguel Alvarez is recaptured near the Mexican border and comes back to Oz. Alvarez then makes a deal with Glynn to remain out of solitary. He agrees to be Glynn's informant in Em City if allowed to stay there. This is short lived however as Alvarez cannot get back into El Norte and find any useful information. Amongst the Black inmates, the Muslims now have a war with the Aryans and Bikers that gets ugly throughout the season. Brotherhood initiate [[Carl Jenkins (Oz)|Carl Jenkins]] makes an attempt on the life of Kareem Sa\u00efd but instead kills the newly converted [[Leroy Tidd]]. This murder angers Sa\u00efd who wants Aryan inmate [[James Robson (Oz)|James Robson]] to suffer for setting up the murder. When Glynn tells Sa\u00efd there is not enough evidence to convict Robson of killing Tidd, Sa\u00efd violently attacks Robson and Schillinger to the point where the entire prison is threatened with a lock down until a truce is called. The truce is short lived however when the Aryans threaten the parole of white inmate Tobias Beecher. Sa\u00efd stabs Schillinger and Robson and Glynn has the DA charge him with attempted murder.\n\nDuring the season, Glynn hires a new secretary and hosts the regional Warden's conference. At home, his wife requests a divorce which puts Leo into disarray. It can be assumed that his wife is divorcing him because he exploited several details of their family issues while running for Lieutenant Governor. Martin Querns has been hired by the commissioner to be Warden at Lardner, the other main prison in the state and shows up at the conference. At the conference, Querns tells Glynn that Clayton Hughes who is serving his sentence at Lardner is doing horribly and will most likely die within the year. Glynn wants Hughes to serve his sentence protected and begs for him to be transferred to Oz. In Oz, Hughes serves time in Unit J, one of the safest units in the prison as it is the Unit for convicted police officers. In that unit, Hughes serves time with [[Alvin Yood]] a small town sheriff imprisoned for assault and Detective Johnny Basil who is no longer under the alias of Desmond Mobay. Hughes is problem for both of them and kills Basil. This forces Glynn to transfer him to solitary which he manages to take over. In solitary Hughes goes psycho capturing and threatening to rape CO [[Travis Smith (Oz)|Travis Smith]]. As the SORT team attempts to recapture Hughes, Glynn goes in first to try to reason with him as a means of preventing Hughes from doing anything crazy. Clayton then tries to kill Glynn who is saved by inmate [[Greg Penders]]. The death of both Hughes and Basil, two of the only two inmates whom he had any considerable care for the well being of and  the divorce from his wife puts Glynn into a bad state. Glynn is then seen drunk in his office distraught over the bad things that have happened and then considers resigning as Warden of Oz.\n\nIn this half of the season a baptist reverend named [[Jeremiah Cloutier]] comes to Oz for embezzlement. Cloutier is really a good person who is in Oz for stealing money, so Glynn privileges him more than the other prisoners. As a result, Cloutier has a positive impact on several of Oz's inmates but is threatened by Catholic convert [[Timmy Kirk]] who is out to cause trouble. Kirk uses his conversion as an excuse to bully several Catholic inmates and then with the help of the Bikers gets Reverend Cloutier trapped into a wall that is being constructed. This gets worse when O'Reilly accidental leaves the gas stove turned on which is then ignited by a CO lighting a cigarette.  The resulting explosion destroys the cafeteria leaving Cloutier with third degree burns across his body. The kitchen and Em City are both destroyed and Glynn must send all the inmates to Gen Pop.\n\n==Season 5==\n\nThe kitchen and Emerald City are both rebuilt and in the rebuilding it is discovered that Reverend Cloutier has been engulfed in the explosion and is barely alive covered in third degree burns over the majority of his body. Also, the death of Patrick Keenan gets complicated as Ryan O'Reily pays and plays off two inmates against each other to state different stories. In reopening Emerald City, the prisoners in solitary are transferred in as repairs to the air ducts must be made. Glynn states to these prisoners that if they behave they do not have to return to solitary. A new liaison to the governor's office Eleanor O'Connor is hired to work at Oz. O'Connor coincidentally is the ex-wife of Tim McManus. Upon the reopening of Em City, visits are allowed for the first time in months but this ends in tragedy as the bus transporting the visitors crashes near the entry gate. As Em City is reopened, the staff warns the Muslim and Aryan inmates to temporarily call a truce so that no blood is shed. Issues develop though when James Robson kills a young Muslim inmate [[Ahmad Lalar]] undetected. This war is stopped for the most part as Sister Pete has Kareem Sa\u00efd, Tobias Beecher, and Vernon Schillinger involved in various interaction sessions.\n\nGlynn also sees that Peter Schibetta has finally been released from the psychiatric unit recovering from the raping received three years earlier by Simon Adebisi. Schibetta is not out for long though as he is raped for a second time as the Italians and Aryan Brotherhood go to war over the death of Hank Schillinger, Vern's son. When Sister Pete wants to help bring Schibetta's rapists to justice, she discovers how much Glynn really hates Schibetta as he states that \"Here in Oz, rape has a leveling effect.\" This war causes a crippling blow to all of the Italians' current leaders causing a request to Glynn from Burr Redding to control the cafeteria. Glynn does not want the Homeboys to manage the cafeteria mainly because of the disastrous way it was run under the management of Simon Adebisi. Redding convinces Glynn though that the Italians are currently unfit to manage the place and the Black inmates who are the majority of the staff are more likely to do a good job under his leadership so he is given control.\n\nGlynn also deals with the issues pertaining to Reverend Cloutier this season. As he was badly burned in the gas explosion, the only inmate they can for the time being implicate is Jaz Hoyt as he was the head of the repair crew that trapped Cloutier. Things get complicated between Cloutier's flock, The Bikers, and inmate Timmy Kirk and Hoyt then after seeing a supposed vision confesses to a series of murders inside of Oz and ends up on death row. Kirk in the meantime is trying to cause trouble for Father Ray Mukada and hires inmate [[Clarence Seroy]] to set up a burning of the rectory in which Mukada resides. Glynn is angered by this and with help from the Bikers, gets Kirk moved to death row. Reverend Cloutier's body ends up missing though and leaves the staff baffled.\n\nGlynn later sees that McManus is engaging two new programs for the inmates to help rehabilitate themselves. He is starting a singing program with the help of Ryan O'Reily's mother and a guide dog program from a woman named Alicia Hinden. Both programs have positive results especially for inmates [[Omar White]] and Miguel Alvarez, two inmates the staff have almost no hope or belief in. Alvarez is on an upward trend coming into his parole hearing which Tim McManus supports. Glynn ardently refuses to acknowledge Alvarez's attempts at rehabilitation and tells the parole board to do everything in their power not to let him go. The board is successful as Alvarez gets agitated and strikes Luis Ruiz, the only Latino on the board during the hearing. Glynn shortly afterwards gets evidence from Tobias Beecher implicating Vernon Schillinger in the raping of inmates [[Franklin Winthrop]] and [[Adam Guenzel]]. As a result, Glynn sentences Vern to solitary for an undecided length of time.\n\n==Season 6==\n\nThe final season of Oz begins for Glynn with the bi-annual solitary review. In this review, it is decided whether or not to release the solitary inmates back into the general population. Miguel Alvarez, Greg Penders, Vern Schillinger, Omar White, [[Carlos Martinez (Oz)|Carlos Martinez]], and [[Henry Stanton (Oz)|Henry Stanton]] are up for review and voted on by Glynn and the staff. Being that Glynn cares about his officers, he refuses to let Martinez and Penders out of solitary as the two of them are in for attacking COs. Omar White then remains in solitary as well. Stanton and Schillinger are released along with Miguel Alvarez whom Tim McManus insisted upon releasing into Emerald City. Glynn then sees that an associate of his, Mayor [[Wilson Loewen]] is on trial for assisting the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a racially motivated killing of two African American girls in 1963. This trial causes a race riot in the city's African American neighborhoods and a lockdown of Oz whose Black inmates are angered at the mere presence of the trial. As the SORT team locks the prison down, they discover the dead body of Tobias Beecher's father who died at the hands of Franklin Winthrop.\n\nThe trial of Wilson Loewen ends with him being found guilty of murder in the second degree. Loewen is a key politician that helped Governor Devlin get elected so Devlin is very insistent on how Loewen will be carefully handled when he gets sent to prison. Devlin has Loewen sent to Oz to placate and appease the African American mob that has formed. Devlin has an unannounced intention of pardoning him as the racial tension outside of Oz cools down. In Oz, Devlin insists that he be placed in the safest unit which happens to be Unit J, the bad police unit which currently has no African American inmates. As Glynn sees Loewen arriving to prison, Loewen tells him that he is innocent but Glynn does not care as the courts have found him guilty. Loewen then pleas that as a Black man, Glynn should realize that the court's decisions aren't always correct. Loewen is in Oz safely until he blackmails Governor Devlin for a pardon. Devlin then uses his African American assistant [[Perry Loftus]] to secretly cause the death of Loewen and then handpicks police detectives to help keep their hands clean from the murder. However, Glynn, Tim McManus, Eleanor O'Connor and Detective McGorry figure out that it is Loftus and CO [[Adrian Johnson (Oz)|Adrian Johnson]] who are responsible for the deaths of Loewen and other inmates who know about the murder. Shortly afterwards, O'Connor and Glynn have an affair which shocks McManus. As suspicions grow, Johnson has inmate [[Lionel Kelsch]] murder Glynn the night of the lifetime achievement award ceremony. Glynn's murder causes Tim McManus to put together every possible piece of evidence to convict Devlin of the whole conspiracy that took place. In the meantime, Martin Querns is named as his replacement as warden.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hbo.com/oz/cast/character_glynn.shtml Official character biography at Oz website]\n\n{{Oz (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glynn, Leo}}\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Oz (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Fictional American prison officers and governors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1997]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Australian footballer|Leo Glynn (footballer)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=August 2008}}\n{{unreferenced|date=March 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''Leo Glynn'''  (played by [[Ernie Hudson]]) is a fictional character on the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. He is the warden of the Oswald State Correctional Facility.\n\n==Character overview==\n\nGlynn began working as a correctional officer in the early 1960s and, true to that era, is a very old-fashioned and [[conservatism|conservative]] official. As described in the journal of [[Augustus Hill]], Glynn's philosophy of running a prison is based more on retribution than redemption and rehabilitation. As stated in the journal, the reasoning behind this is so Glynn can one day be promoted to the position of Commissioner of Prisons and perhaps even become the state's first African-American Governor. He runs the entire prison, answering mainly to [[Governor James Devlin]], a [[right-wing]] politician with whom even Glynn has policy disagreements.\n\nThroughout the series, Glynn is well-respected by the staff and, for the most part, treats the prisoners as justly as need be. Despite this, he has had moments which show another side of his personality. He can be petty and vindictive at times, notably refusing to move Andrew Schillinger due to his dislike of Vern Schillinger and making Alvarez miss a meeting with his family out of a dislike of Latinos. Furthermore, he is often prone to take sides against those he works with. He fired - and quickly rehired - Sister Pete for protesting an execution. He was unwilling to defend McManus and Em City from Devlin as well as siding with black inmates on some issues. Glynn can also act on his disdain for prisoners on occasion, such as letting Alvarez starve and nearly commit suicide after he blinded a guard.\n\n===As Warden===\n\nAs Glynn's philosophy in running a prison is retribution-based, he is very conservative on issues involving Law and Order, believing that the prisoners in Oz should serve hard time for hard crimes. As warden, he cares most about maintaining order in his prison and stopping the drug trade amongst other things. To prevent drugs from moving within Oz, Glynn is a fan of week-long lockdowns as a means of keeping the inmates from moving drugs within Oz. Knowing the demographics and power structure of Oz, Glynn also secretly assigns two black Narcotics Detectives from the Police Department on two different occasions to put a plug in the drug traffic. As a former CO, Glynn realizes that contraband or \"tits\" does get sneaked into Oz and won't go away completely, but he wants the staff to enforce the smuggling as much as possible.\n\nWhen acts of violence occur in Oz, Glynn has a tendency to lead a harsh interrogation of the suspected inmates, but is quick to file a crime as \"unsolved\" when there is not adequate enough evidence to convict someone. Glynn also tries to only make convictions on inmates that result in a major change of Oz's power structure. On violence between the inmates, Glynn is preventive when lives are at risk and quick to lock down and isolate specific inmates as a means of stopping a war. He never seems to favor one side of inmates in any war and is quick to inflict penalties upon the gang's leaders. When inmates misbehave in general, Glynn immediately orders the staff to place them in solitary, as Glynn wants the inmates who cause the most trouble out of the general population for as long as he can keep them out. Solitary seems to be the most preferable punishment to Glynn, as he is quick to send an inmate to Ad Seg when the prison rules have been somewhat violated. When obtaining inside information about acts of violence to occur in Oz, Glynn often cares less about the informants' motives in reporting it and uses the information to cause a lock-down of the prison.\n\nOn the issue of [[prison rape]], Glynn is typically slow to investigate acts of sexual abuse and violence for two main reasons. First, Glynn realizes rape will occur in prison no matter what he does, and second, Glynn sees the positive administrative standpoint of rape inside prison in the \"leveling effect\" it has upon the rape victims. Glynn feels that inmates who are victims of rape are less likely to be a discipline problem, such as when inmate Peter Schibetta, whom Glynn has a personal vendetta against, is raped on two different occasions. This attitude shocks Oz staff members such as [[Sister Peter Marie]], who remind Leo that he should take a more compassionate view about rape following the rape of his daughter.\n\nAmongst the inmates, Glynn is feared due to his toughened law and order based attitude. Glynn's preference for the isolation ward, week-long lock downs, and harsh interrogation style helps him empower this fear. Unlike [[Tim McManus]], he does not try to build a working relationship with the inmates to help them better themselves; rather, he just cares that they are obedient of his command of the prison. Glynn seems to get along with the inmates who run the cafeteria as long as it is run in an efficient and respectable manner. In general though, Glynn treats the inmates as fairly as need be, assuming they have not done anything to cross his path.\n\nAmongst his staff, Glynn is well-respected even by COs who have shown a dislike for Oz's minority inmates. When problems pertaining to COs and inmates arise, Glynn is quick to help his officers out, whether it be keeping inmates who attack them in Solitary Confinement or preventing an investigation that could lead to the firing of one of his officers. This is mainly because Glynn feels that he and his staff must remain unified and see eye-to-eye as much as possible. Throughout the series, Glynn has disagreements with some of the higher ranking liberal staff members such as [[Tim McManus]], [[Sister Peter Marie|Sister Pete]], and [[Dr. Gloria Nathan]], but respects their vision and does what he can to meet them halfway on most issues. Overall, Glynn is focused on maintaining order amongst the inmates, stopping the drug trade, and convicting the inmates he can for crimes that they commit when sufficient evidence is present.\n\n===Family and relationships===\n\nEarlier in the series, Leo has a wife, Mary, with at least one daughter, Ardeth. At that point Ardeth is college-aged and Leo is stressed out when she asks him if she and her boyfriend can share an apartment. She is raped at school by a gang of Latinos, a move that puts Glynn into disarray, causing him to lash out against Latino inmate [[Miguel Alvarez (Oz)|Miguel Alvarez]]. When Alvarez claims to know who committed the rape, he tortures Leo with this knowledge. Leo would have beaten Miguel into submission had Father Ray Mukada not been around. This starts the bad blood between Alvarez and Glynn, which continues to the end of the series.\n\nLeo's brother Mark also has economic issues in Season 2 and commits a murder for the mafia that Italian inmate Peter Schibetta uses for leverage. When Mark turns himself in, Leo remains on bad terms with Schibetta and shows no interest in investigating when Peter is raped on two different occasions.\n\nDuring Season 4's election campaign, Glynn uses details about his brother and daughter as part of his campaign, a move that angers Mary, culminating in a divorce in the second half of the season. While separated, the viewers assume that Glynn will begin a relationship with new secretary [[Floria Mills]], but no specific details on the show confirm this. As far as other family members are concerned, CO [[Clayton Hughes]] is the son of Leo's best friend, deceased CO Samuel Hughes, and Leo becomes the closest thing Hughes has to a father. When Hughes goes crazy and is incarcerated at nearby Lardener prison, Glynn demands that he be transferred to Oz where he can be protected; however, in Oz, Hughes experiences a psychotic break and tries to murder Glynn during a hostage situation. Hughes' erratic behavior drives Glynn to an alcoholic state where he is seen drinking whiskey on the job during two instances in Season 4. When Tim McManus' ex-wife [[Eleanor O'Connor]] comes to Oz, she and Leo begin a relationship.\n\n===As an African American===\n\nGlynn treats prisoners of every race equally, never showing favoritism towards any specific ethnic group. (He is seen being forced to show favoritism to the Italian inmates at one point due to blackmail; similarly, he for a while took a very hard line against Latinos in the prison as a result of a Latino gang raping his daughter.) As Oz is racially divided by individual groups, several of the white inmates such as [[Vern Schillinger]] have often referred to Glynn as Oz's \"[[Nigger]] [[Prison warden|Warden]]\". Glynn states to [[Clayton Hughes]], whom he views as a son, that he feels no sense of brotherhood toward any of the Black inmates in Oz, only towards Blacks who obey the law. Glynn is also politically conservative, so he often does not feel the same way that most other Blacks do when it comes to various state issues (In season 4, it is stated that [[Governor Devlin]]'s office has a bad relationship with the state's black community). Glynn also points out in Season 3 that he began working as a CO in Oz in the late 1960s, suggesting that he could very well be Oz's first black correctional officer.\n\nIn season 1, Glynn initially attempts to get black inmate [[Kareem Said]] to tone down his rhetoric about the prison system by telling him \"Don't fuck with me, my brother\" as a means of telling him, as one Black man to another, not to cause any racial uprisings within Oz. In season 4, Glynn is asked to run as Devlin's Lieutenant Governor mainly because [[Alvah Case]], a well-respected African American law school dean, is the Democratic candidate for governor. Glynn agrees because he is as conservative as Devlin on most every issue. At this point, Glynn is also pressured to fire Tim McManus but does not do so until McManus commits a series of self-destructive acts closed out by the singing of \"De [[Camptown Races]]\", a [[blackface]] minstrel song at the funeral of a Black CO. During the campaign, Glynn is pressured by fellow black community activists to replace McManus with a black Unit Manager. He does, but eventually McManus and inmate [[Kareem Said]] show evidence of corruption in Emerald City, which results in McManus getting his job back.\n\nGlynn's ethnicity is brought up once again in Season 6 when an associate of [[Governor Devlin]], City Mayor [[Wilson Loewen]], is found guilty of aiding and abetting members of the [[White supremacist]] organization the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a 1963 murder of two young [[African American]] girls. A [[race riot]] breaks out in the city's African-American neighborhoods and Glynn prevents one from breaking out in Oz by immediately locking down the prison upon the news airing of the trial. When Loewen is sent to Oz, Glynn is forced by Devlin to place him in a safe housing unit with no African-American inmates, as a means of keeping Loewen alive until Devlin can eventually pardon him. Loewen arrives in Oz attempting to bring up good memories between him and Leo during the governor campaign but Glynn, disgusted by Loewen's crime, states that their past relationship is now over as the courts have found him guilty. As Loewen pleads innocence, Glynn turns a deaf ear causing Loewen to presumptuously tell Glynn that as an African-American male, he should realize the courts' decisions have not always been correct.\n\n==Season 1==\n\nAs warden of Oz, Glynn carries out Governor James Devlin's orders and does what he can to manage the state's largest correctional facility. An experimental cell block, Emerald City, is opened up and run by unit manager Tim McManus. McManus is unlike the rest of the higher ranking staff at Oz in that he came in with a college education and never started off as a correctional officer. He is a [[Liberalism|liberal]] idealist with whom Glynn often disagrees. McManus has complete control of Em City from the commissioner but Glynn overrides his decisions at times. One in particular is the addition of inmate [[Paul Markstrom]] to the population of Em City: Markstrom, according to the file, is a petty African American drug dealer supposedly related to Glynn, but in actuality he is an undercover narcotics detective looking to put a plug in the drug trade. Glynn is the only staff member who knows his true identity and this becomes a problem when the [[Italy|Italian]] inmates, led by [[Nino Schibetta]], kill Markstrom. Throughout the season, McManus and Glynn argue frequently over the methods of controlling the drug distribution amongst the inmates. Glynn believes in more lockdowns and shakedowns to stop the traffic, while McManus argues for addiction treatment. Glynn announces several new policies over the season that anger the majority of the prison population. The board of corrections has decided to ban smoking and conjugal visit privileges from the prisoners and Glynn, while not agreeing with all the policies, decides that enforcing them is more important. Tim McManus is most vocal against Devlin's administration and states that a riot may very well occur in Oz. Adding to this tension is the arrival of inmate Kareem Sa\u00efd, a black Muslim who is incarcerated for arson. Sa\u00efd is a well known militant who poses a major threat to the staff, Homeboys, and the [[The Aryan Brotherhood in Oz|Aryan Brotherhood]] inmates.\n\nThroughout the season several inmates die in Em City, mainly caught in the drug war between the Italian and Black inmates. This angers Devlin, who is already in the process of reinstating the death penalty. The death penalty is reinstated and  Homeboy leader [[Jefferson Keane]] is executed by the state for murdering other inmates. Another inmate, [[Donald Groves]], attempts to murder Glynn as he is trying to help the cause of Kareem Sa\u00efd. Groves instead kills African American CO [[Lawrence Smith (Oz)|Lawrence Smith]] and as a result he is sentenced to death. Groves' attempt on Glynn and murdering of a CO causes the other guards to begin randomly assaulting prisoners throughout Oz, which appalls McManus. Glynn is urged by prison doctor Gloria Nathan and McManus to fire the guards for this, but Glynn instead temporarily suspends various COs without pay. This decision angers staff investigator [[Lenny Burrano]], who explains to Glynn that, as they both came up through the ranks as guards, they should understand the hardness and attitude that develop with the job. Glynn also is trying to put a plug in the drug trade and urges McManus to shut down the Italian inmates who control it the most. McManus does his best to do this by transferring all of the Italians, with the exception of Schibetta, out of Emerald City.\n\nIn the meantime, Kareem Sa\u00efd is organizing the Muslims and other inmates secretly, causing McManus to be greatly concerned about a riot. When disgraced Muslim [[Huseni Mershah]] claims that Sa\u00efd wants to start a riot, Glynn orders a shakedown of Emerald City that results in a weapons seizure from every inmate but Sa\u00efd. McManus' suspicions come true and the prisoners stage a coup in Em City, taking the COs hostage. Sa\u00efd has a gun (which an unknown Black CO gave to him) during the riot and uses it to force the inmates to organize. With the help of [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]], [[Ryan O'Reily]], [[Simon Adebisi]], and Miguel Alvarez, Sa\u00efd and the inmates make a list of demands in exchange for the guards they have taken hostage. Glynn finds most of the demands to be reasonable, but Devlin urges Glynn to have the S.O.R.T. team take back Em City force. McManus opposes this and goes into Em City with food for the prisoners in order to see how the hostages are doing. When McManus does not return, Devlin has the S.O.R.T. team go in with machine guns and a violent battle ensues. As a result, 6 inmates and 2 correctional officers die and the rest of the prisoners are sent back to Gen Pop (With the exception of the riot leaders who were taken to Solitary). McManus and several other staff members are accidentally shot and wounded in the fray, but survive.\n\n==Season 2==\n\nThe aftermath of the riot is investigated by Alvah Case, a law school dean whom [[Governor James Devlin|Devlin]] has appointed to lead the investigation for purposes of diverting blame from Devlin. Throughout the investigation, Glynn and the staff attempt to cover up the murder of inmate [[Scott Ross (Oz)|Scott Ross]] from Case. Ross was shot in the head, heart, and genitals and after interrogating several staff members, Case is convinced that CO [[Diane Whittlesey]] is the shooter. Glynn urges Case to leave it alone, as Whittlesey is one of his best guards and Ross was widely disliked by both staff and inmates. Case concludes that the only way to clear Devlin of culpability in using force is to file no charges against any of the prisoners. He states that the riot was caused directly by anti-prisoner acts passed through the Governor's office and that if the prisoners are guilty, Devlin is too. Devlin warns Case that he will not become the state's attorney general as a result, but Case no longer wants the position as after investigating the prison conditions, he wants to run against Devlin for governor in the next election instead. Devlin is not supportive of this but goes through with it as Case announces to the press that no one in particular is at fault for the riot but improvements will be made to prevent another riot. This saves the job of Glynn and everyone else on the staff and also guarantees the reopening of Em City.\n\nEmerald City is reopened 10 months after the riot under a new deal approved by Glynn and McManus. Ten inmate groups - The Muslims, Aryans, Homeboys, Latinos, Italians, Irish, Bikers, Gays, Christians, and Others - will have four inmates from each group living in Em City and one representative from each group will be present on a Seg Council as a means of figuring out how to make life better for themselves and the staff inside of Oz. McManus starts a GED program which Glynn supports until Governor Devlin cuts it from the state budget. The program has positive results, however, particularly with inmate [[Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson]], whose talent for poetry brings a good name to Oz, a published book, and an early parole. This is short-lived however as Poet violates parole and murders a drug dealer to whom he owed money, causing his return to Oz.\n\nGlynn is distraught when his daughter is raped at school by a gang of Latinos. A snide remark by inmate Miguel Alvarez during a speech that Glynn gives the inmates causes him to lash out and send Alvarez to solitary confinement. Sister Pete urges Glynn that he is a better man than that and that Miguel Alvarez was incarcerated at the time of the rape. Glynn lets Alvarez out of solitary; Alvarez, however, knows the men responsible for the rape and taunts Glynn with this knowledge as revenge. In an interrogation, Alvarez refuses to give names but scomments pertaining to Glynn's daughter's rape. Glynn nearly assaults Alvarez but is stopped by [[Father Ray Mukada]]. This incident causes bad blood between Glynn and Alvarez, who later in the season blinds a Latino CO named [[Eugene Rivera]]. As a result, Alvarez is gladly sent to solitary by Glynn.\n\nThe introduction of Italian inmate Peter Schibetta is a further source of tension for Glynn. Peter is the son of deceased leader Nino Schibetta and runs the Italians with the help of [[Chucky Pancamo]]. Leo's brother Mark committed a murder for the mafia, and Peter uses knowledge of this as leverage to get what he wants from Glynn. Peter takes control of the kitchen for the Italians and then tells Leo that he will pay the price if Mark does not turn himself in for the murder. Mark turns himself in after a talk with Leo, who then furiously transfers the Italian inmates out of the kitchen and into the dress factory. Peter is later raped by Black inmate Simon Adebisi and Glynn makes no effort to investigate, as he wants Schibetta to suffer. [[Antonio Nappa]] comes to Oz to run the Italians, and with the help of the Italian staff members gets Glynn to take Adebisi off of heroin as a result.\n\nOther issues that preside for Glynn come in the form of Vernon Schillinger and Kareem Sa\u00efd. Inmate [[Alexander Vogel]] is murdered with the word \"JEW\" carved into his chest. Glynn quickly interrogates Schillinger, the leader of the Aryan Brotherhood, but gets nothing besides Schillinger's obstinent and racist behavior (Schillinger tells Glynn that his \"people\", i.e. [[African Americans]] are as anti-semitic as the Brotherhood in addition to humming a [[blackface]] minstrel song praising slavery). Glynn finds proof from gay inmate [[Richie Hanlon]], who is then forced to cop to Vogel's murder by Aryan Guard [[Karl Metzger]]. Schillinger thereby goes free, which angers Glynn. During the Islamic month of Ramadan, Glynn announces that Governor Devlin is pardoning a Muslim inmate from Oz. Kareem Sa\u00efd is chosen but refuses to accept at the press conference as he believes it is a cheap way of gaining Islamic voters throughout the state. Sa\u00efd stays in Oz, a move that shocks Glynn and Tim McManus.\n\n==Season 3==\n\nA number of incidents involving the Aryan Brotherhood have occurred and Tim McManus thinks CO Karl Metzger is responsible. McManus' suspicions are proven right when it is discovered that Metzger used to belong to a White Supremacist organization; however, Glynn refuses to take action until there is hard evidence that Metzger is working with Vern Schillinger and the Aryans. This surprises McManus, who points out to Glynn that Metzger only thinks of Glynn as a \"Nigger.\" [[Chris Keller]] then comes forward with evidence and Vernon Schillinger is placed in solitary, but Metzger is found murdered before charges can be brought. Glynn later approves the hiring of [[Sean Murphy (Oz)|Sean Murphy]], who is a lifelong friend of Tim McManus, as the head CO of Emerald City. Murphy starts a boxing program where one inmate from each group will be represented in a tournament. Meanwhile, Augustus Hill, with the help of Kareem Said, testifies against inmate [[Malcolm Coyle]] for murdering an Italian American family without getting caught. Glynn informs the DA but is too late as the Italians, led by Antonio Nappa, protect Hill by murdering Coyle. Glynn also must deal with letting Miguel Alvarez redeem himself for blinding Rivera by interacting with Sister Pete. In the midst of this, the Latinos are caught dealing drugs and after being unsuccessfully interrogated by Glynn, they make an attempt on Alvarez's life.\n\nGlynn has a major issue when Clayton Hughes applies for a job at Oz. Hughes' father Samuel was an African American CO and Glynn's best friend, who died working in Oz in 1982. As a result, Leo is the closest thing Clayton has to a father since Sam's death, and he ardently refuses to hire Clayton out of fear for his safety. Glynn ultimately hires Clayton, however, to the objections of his mother, Lenore, as Clayton did well enough in CO training to be hired immediately in another State Prison. Glynn keeps a close eye on Clayton, who ends up working in Em City. Unfortunately, Clayton proves to be a poor fit, messing up on more than one occasion, and is transferred to the library as a result. Glynn must also tell Hughes about the details pertaining to his father's death, which greatly disturb Clayton. Things are made worse for Clayton when Simon Adebisi tells him that Samuel's killing was racially motivated.\n\nIn the course of the season Tim McManus is accused of sexually harassing CO [[Claire Howell]] and inmate [[Kenny Wangler]]. Because of McManus' reputation for bed hopping and womanizing, Glynn does not know what to believe and warns McManus that if any of the allegations are true, he will be fired, complaining of the \"shit storms\" McManus has created. McManus retorts that Glynn's judgment is clouded by racial bias, pointing out that he has automatically taken the side of any Black inmate or staff member when issues pertaining to McManus arise.\n\nAt the same time, the racial tension in Oz is on the rise due to the boxing tournament (which Ryan O'Reilly has been manipulating to ensure his brother Cyril wins all his fights) and a plan Simon Abedisi is formulating. The boxing tournament is put on hold when the Aryan and Muslim inmates fight, but Ryan O'Reily and [[Hamid Khan (Oz)|Hamid Khan]] convince Glynn to let the finals happen. The finals end in tragedy, fueling to the emotional fire between the inmates, and Glynn is forced to lock down the prison. As he does so Hughes comes to him, stating that they should be helping the black inmates out instead of punishing them. Glynn then states he feels no sense of brotherhood towards any of the black inmates in Oz and then fires Hughes. As the lockdown is put into effect, Hughes sneaks Adebisi a gun as a going away gift.\n\n==Season 4 Part I==\n\nGlynn ends the lock down, telling the Black and White inmates separately that if one more racially motivated incident occurs, Oz will be permanently locked down. The Latinos in the meantime are not warned, as they are somewhat neutral throughout the racial tension. [[Governor James Devlin]]'s campaign manager then tells Glenn he has been chosen as a candidate for [[Lieutenant Governor]], as their current Lieutenant Frank Feeley has throat cancer and will not be running for re-election. Glynn immediately asks if this is because [[Alvah Case]], a fellow [[African American]] has announced that he is running against Devlin. Devlin's campaign manager [[Wendy Schultz]] says it is a strong reason why Glynn has been chosen, as there is a bad history between Devlin and the State's [[African American]] community. Racial issues aside, Schultz states that their office figures that someone as conservative and publicly known as Glynn would be a great candidate for Lieutenant Governor and Glynn then says yes, suspiciously. In Oz, Glynn wants to stop the drug traffic as the Homeboys, Latinos, and Italians (for the time being) are allied, so he gets a narcotics detective [[Johnny Basil]] to pose as a Jamaican drug dealer named [[Desmond Mobay]]. Glynn is the only one who knows Basil's true identity and informs him of the dangers associated with Oz, as another undercover detective Paul Markstrom died many years earlier in Oz. Throughout the season, Basil is somewhat convincing as Mobay to the point where he ends up snorting a lot of heroin and murdering an inmate to get in the good graces of all three gangster groups.\n\nAdebisi then asks Glynn to move Black inmates [[Arnold \"Poet\" Jackson]], [[Kenny Wangler]], and [[List of Oz (TV series) characters#Homeboys|Junior Pierce]] out of Unit B and into Em City as a means of ending some of the racial tension within Oz's walls. [[Tim McManus]] opposes this mainly because he hates Wangler for lying about a sexual harassment charge. Glynn is interested in eliminating racial issues within Oz and overrides McManus' objection.  More racial issues arise, however, as those three inmates harass a new White inmate unfit for prison. Adebisi, wanting revenge on Wangler, gives a gun to this inmate [[Guillaume Tarrant]] who then shoots Wangler, Pierce and a Black CO [[Joseph Howard (Oz)|Joseph Howard]] amongst others. Glynn is now under intense pressure to fire Tim McManus and solve the gun smuggling quickly as a means of making the prison look well managed during the election campaign. Adebisi and Muslim inmate [[Zahir Arif]] point out that McManus must go and a Black unit manager must be hired. Glynn does not yet give in, as he still thinks McManus is competent and mentally sound enough to run Emerald City. McManus, however, is on a self-destructive path following recent relationship problems and sings De Camptown Races, a blackface minstrel song at the funeral of Joseph Howard, the Black CO who died in the shooting. As seen through earlier issues regarding race between McManus and Glynn, Leo draws the line with McManus here and immediately fires him as Unit Manager of Emerald City.\n\nA problem arises when inmates [[Agamemnon Busmalis]] and Miguel Alvarez escape Oz through a tunnel and Glynn asks [[Raoul \"El Cid\" Hernandez]], the Latino's leader who despises Alvarez to help find him. El Cid orders a hit on Alvarez, who is now on the run. Meanwhile, when investigating the gun smuggling, Glynn is told by El Cid that Adebisi got the gun from Clayton Hughes on Hughes' last day of work. Glynn furiously calls in Clayton who admits to smuggling the gun and Glynn has Hughes arrested and told to shut up in the meantime. Since being fired, Hughes has become a Black Militant and is giving speeches that condemn Governor Devlin on a routine basis. Busmalis is then captured and the Republican party then is looking better in the preliminary polls. The Muslim inmates convince African American community leaders to pressure Glynn into hiring a Black unit manager for Em City, and he begins to listen more and more as a means of becoming Lieutenant Governor with the Black vote. Glynn then hires [[Martin Querns]] a Black man to run Em City, appeasing the general public.\n\nMartin Querns has experience working in several state detention centers and federal penitentiaries and is also from the ghetto like several of Oz's African American inmates. Querns is told he may run Em City any way he wishes as long as racial tension and violence are eliminated. Querns immediately reduces the violence by more than 92% and eliminates the racial tension element altogether. Although he does this by empowering Simon Adebisi and his followers and sending most of the White inmates out of Em City, Glynn does not care as, for the time being, the Unit looks better managed. In the meantime, Tim McManus undergoes psychiatric therapy and wants to run Em City again; but, the only available job in the Unit Manager position is Unit B, which he reluctantly takes. During the campaign as order is maintained in Oz, Glynn stops paying attention to what changes are being made in Em City and is more focused on becoming the Lieutenant Governor. At a staff meeting, Tim McManus points out what has happened in Em City and Glynn turns a deaf ear because the violence has been almost eliminated from Em City. At a press conference shortly afterwards, Clayton Hughes goes psycho and tries to kill Governor Devlin. Devlin nearly dies, Hughes is charged with attempted murder, and Glynn drops out of the election race to stand by Clayton as he goes to trial.\n\nOut of the election campaign, Glynn is brought more up to what has happened inside of Oz. Detective Johnny Basil turns himself in for the murder of [[Bruno Goergen]], as his conscience kicks in and tell him to stop doing what he's doing to prove that he is not undercover. Two inmates then die, both residents of Em City and Glynn begins to get angered with Querns. McManus points out that Querns has empowered Adebisi and the Homeboys in Em City turning a blind eye to their behavior as long as order is maintained. He points out the lack of diversity as all the COs are now Black and White inmates are also scarce. Finally, he points out drugs are out of control as stopping the drug traffic is not a priority of Querns. Glynn isn't convinced of this until McManus, with the help of Kareem Said, brings him a videotape of a party inside of Adebisi's pod. Glynn is disgusted by the acts involving drugs, alcohol, and sex that the Black inmates are committing unpunished. As a result, Querns is immediately fired and Leo realizes he hasn't paid enough attention to what has happened in Oz. He reinstates McManus as unit manager of Em City, and Adebisi then dies making a murder attempt on Kareem Sa\u00efd.\n\n==Season 4 Part II==\n\nThis half of the season starts out with the investigation of a news crew coming into Oz. Glynn is afraid that several dead issues will be resurrected through the media and is fearful that Oz may be shut down altogether. To make matters worse several inmates suggest what has happened during Adebisi's reign of power in Em City. Martin Querns then comes to Glynn asking him to destroy any evidence relating to the rampant drug use that occurred in Em City as a means of saving both of them from facing criminal charges. This news crew led by Jack Eldridge eventually agrees with Glynn that the story should not be aired and this is completed by a beating at the hands of inmate [[Cyril O'Reily]]. Even though the staff is glad that O'Reily scarred off the news crew, Cyril's behavior grows worse over the season and Glynn is urged by McManus to send him to a mental institute. Amongst the O'Reily's, Cyril's brother Ryan is accused by Muslim inmate Zahir Arif of murdering [[Patrick Keenan]], an investigation that angers Glynn and frustrates Ryan. There is not enough evidence at the time however and Glynn must let O'Reily go free.\n\nA number of new developments occur throughout this season however for Glynn. Oz is temporarily asked to house some illegal refugees from China who get caught up in a war between the Homeboys, Italians, and Latinos. This war escalates throughout the season to the point that inmates Supreme Allah and [[Enrique Morales]] are targeted to die by the Homeboy's new leader Burr Redding. Supreme is attacked in the visiting room at one point and later dies in the cafeteria all on acts devised by the Homeboys. Morales lives though and with the help of Chucky Pancamo the Italian's leader, makes numerous attempts on Redding throughout the season. Miguel Alvarez is recaptured near the Mexican border and comes back to Oz. Alvarez then makes a deal with Glynn to remain out of solitary. He agrees to be Glynn's informant in Em City if allowed to stay there. This is short lived however as Alvarez cannot get back into El Norte and find any useful information. Amongst the Black inmates, the Muslims now have a war with the Aryans and Bikers that gets ugly throughout the season. Brotherhood initiate [[Carl Jenkins (Oz)|Carl Jenkins]] makes an attempt on the life of Kareem Sa\u00efd but instead kills the newly converted [[Leroy Tidd]]. This murder angers Sa\u00efd who wants Aryan inmate [[James Robson (Oz)|James Robson]] to suffer for setting up the murder. When Glynn tells Sa\u00efd there is not enough evidence to convict Robson of killing Tidd, Sa\u00efd violently attacks Robson and Schillinger to the point where the entire prison is threatened with a lock down until a truce is called. The truce is short lived however when the Aryans threaten the parole of white inmate Tobias Beecher. Sa\u00efd stabs Schillinger and Robson and Glynn has the DA charge him with attempted murder.\n\nDuring the season, Glynn hires a new secretary and hosts the regional Warden's conference. At home, his wife requests a divorce which puts Leo into disarray. It can be assumed that his wife is divorcing him because he exploited several details of their family issues while running for Lieutenant Governor. Martin Querns has been hired by the commissioner to be Warden at Lardner, the other main prison in the state and shows up at the conference. At the conference, Querns tells Glynn that Clayton Hughes who is serving his sentence at Lardner is doing horribly and will most likely die within the year. Glynn wants Hughes to serve his sentence protected and begs for him to be transferred to Oz. In Oz, Hughes serves time in Unit J, one of the safest units in the prison as it is the Unit for convicted police officers. In that unit, Hughes serves time with [[Alvin Yood]] a small town sheriff imprisoned for assault and Detective Johnny Basil who is no longer under the alias of Desmond Mobay. Hughes is problem for both of them and kills Basil. This forces Glynn to transfer him to solitary which he manages to take over. In solitary Hughes goes psycho capturing and threatening to rape CO [[Travis Smith (Oz)|Travis Smith]]. As the SORT team attempts to recapture Hughes, Glynn goes in first to try to reason with him as a means of preventing Hughes from doing anything crazy. Clayton then tries to kill Glynn who is saved by inmate [[Greg Penders]]. The death of both Hughes and Basil, two of the only two inmates whom he had any considerable care for the well being of and  the divorce from his wife puts Glynn into a bad state. Glynn is then seen drunk in his office distraught over the bad things that have happened and then considers resigning as Warden of Oz.\n\nIn this half of the season a baptist reverend named [[Jeremiah Cloutier]] comes to Oz for embezzlement. Cloutier is really a good person who is in Oz for stealing money, so Glynn privileges him more than the other prisoners. As a result, Cloutier has a positive impact on several of Oz's inmates but is threatened by Catholic convert [[Timmy Kirk]] who is out to cause trouble. Kirk uses his conversion as an excuse to bully several Catholic inmates and then with the help of the Bikers gets Reverend Cloutier trapped into a wall that is being constructed. This gets worse when O'Reilly accidental leaves the gas stove turned on which is then ignited by a CO lighting a cigarette.  The resulting explosion destroys the cafeteria leaving Cloutier with third degree burns across his body. The kitchen and Em City are both destroyed and Glynn must send all the inmates to Gen Pop.\n\n==Season 5==\n\nThe kitchen and Emerald City are both rebuilt and in the rebuilding it is discovered that Reverend Cloutier has been engulfed in the explosion and is barely alive covered in third degree burns over the majority of his body. Also, the death of Patrick Keenan gets complicated as Ryan O'Reily pays and plays off two inmates against each other to state different stories. In reopening Emerald City, the prisoners in solitary are transferred in as repairs to the air ducts must be made. Glynn states to these prisoners that if they behave they do not have to return to solitary. A new liaison to the governor's office Eleanor O'Connor is hired to work at Oz. O'Connor coincidentally is the ex-wife of Tim McManus. Upon the reopening of Em City, visits are allowed for the first time in months but this ends in tragedy as the bus transporting the visitors crashes near the entry gate. As Em City is reopened, the staff warns the Muslim and Aryan inmates to temporarily call a truce so that no blood is shed. Issues develop though when James Robson kills a young Muslim inmate [[Ahmad Lalar]] undetected. This war is stopped for the most part as Sister Pete has Kareem Sa\u00efd, Tobias Beecher, and Vernon Schillinger involved in various interaction sessions.\n\nGlynn also sees that Peter Schibetta has finally been released from the psychiatric unit recovering from the raping received three years earlier by Simon Adebisi. Schibetta is not out for long though as he is raped for a second time as the Italians and Aryan Brotherhood go to war over the death of Hank Schillinger, Vern's son. When Sister Pete wants to help bring Schibetta's rapists to justice, she discovers how much Glynn really hates Schibetta as he states that \"Here in Oz, rape has a leveling effect.\" This war causes a crippling blow to all of the Italians' current leaders causing a request to Glynn from Burr Redding to control the cafeteria. Glynn does not want the Homeboys to manage the cafeteria mainly because of the disastrous way it was run under the management of Simon Adebisi. Redding convinces Glynn though that the Italians are currently unfit to manage the place and the Black inmates who are the majority of the staff are more likely to do a good job under his leadership so he is given control.\n\nGlynn also deals with the issues pertaining to Reverend Cloutier this season. As he was badly burned in the gas explosion, the only inmate they can for the time being implicate is Jaz Hoyt as he was the head of the repair crew that trapped Cloutier. Things get complicated between Cloutier's flock, The Bikers, and inmate Timmy Kirk and Hoyt then after seeing a supposed vision confesses to a series of murders inside of Oz and ends up on death row. Kirk in the meantime is trying to cause trouble for Father Ray Mukada and hires inmate [[Clarence Seroy]] to set up a burning of the rectory in which Mukada resides. Glynn is angered by this and with help from the Bikers, gets Kirk moved to death row. Reverend Cloutier's body ends up missing though and leaves the staff baffled.\n\nGlynn later sees that McManus is engaging two new programs for the inmates to help rehabilitate themselves. He is starting a singing program with the help of Ryan O'Reily's mother and a guide dog program from a woman named Alicia Hinden. Both programs have positive results especially for inmates [[Omar White]] and Miguel Alvarez, two inmates the staff have almost no hope or belief in. Alvarez is on an upward trend coming into his parole hearing which Tim McManus supports. Glynn ardently refuses to acknowledge Alvarez's attempts at rehabilitation and tells the parole board to do everything in their power not to let him go. The board is successful as Alvarez gets agitated and strikes Luis Ruiz, the only Latino on the board during the hearing. Glynn shortly afterwards gets evidence from Tobias Beecher implicating Vernon Schillinger in the raping of inmates [[Franklin Winthrop]] and [[Adam Guenzel]]. As a result, Glynn sentences Vern to solitary for an undecided length of time.\n\n==Season 6==\n\nThe final season of Oz begins for Glynn with the bi-annual solitary review. In this review, it is decided whether or not to release the solitary inmates back into the general population. Miguel Alvarez, Greg Penders, Vern Schillinger, Omar White, [[Carlos Martinez (Oz)|Carlos Martinez]], and [[Henry Stanton (Oz)|Henry Stanton]] are up for review and voted on by Glynn and the staff. Being that Glynn cares about his officers, he refuses to let Martinez and Penders out of solitary as the two of them are in for attacking COs. Omar White then remains in solitary as well. Stanton and Schillinger are released along with Miguel Alvarez whom Tim McManus insisted upon releasing into Emerald City. Glynn then sees that an associate of his, Mayor [[Wilson Loewen]] is on trial for assisting the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a racially motivated killing of two African American girls in 1963. This trial causes a race riot in the city's African American neighborhoods and a lockdown of Oz whose Black inmates are angered at the mere presence of the trial. As the SORT team locks the prison down, they discover the dead body of Tobias Beecher's father who died at the hands of Franklin Winthrop.\n\nThe trial of Wilson Loewen ends with him being found guilty of murder in the second degree. Loewen is a key politician that helped Governor Devlin get elected so Devlin is very insistent on how Loewen will be carefully handled when he gets sent to prison. Devlin has Loewen sent to Oz to placate and appease the African American mob that has formed. Devlin has an unannounced intention of pardoning him as the racial tension outside of Oz cools down. In Oz, Devlin insists that he be placed in the safest unit which happens to be Unit J, the bad police unit which currently has no African American inmates. As Glynn sees Loewen arriving to prison, Loewen tells him that he is innocent but Glynn does not care as the courts have found him guilty. Loewen then pleas that as a Black man, Glynn should realize that the court's decisions aren't always correct. Loewen is in Oz safely until he blackmails Governor Devlin for a pardon. Devlin then uses his African American assistant [[Perry Loftus]] to secretly cause the death of Loewen and then handpicks police detectives to help keep their hands clean from the murder. However, Glynn, Tim McManus, Eleanor O'Connor and Detective McGorry figure out that it is Loftus and CO [[Adrian Johnson (Oz)|Adrian Johnson]] who are responsible for the deaths of Loewen and other inmates who know about the murder. Shortly afterwards, O'Connor and Glynn have an affair which shocks McManus. As suspicions grow, Johnson has inmate [[Lionel Kelsch]] murder Glynn the night of the lifetime achievement award ceremony. Glynn's murder causes Tim McManus to put together every possible piece of evidence to convict Devlin of the whole conspiracy that took place. In the meantime, Martin Querns is named as his replacement as warden.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hbo.com/oz/cast/character_glynn.shtml Official character biography at Oz website]\n\n{{Oz (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glynn, Leo}}\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Oz (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Fictional American prison officers and governors]]\n[[Category:Fictional Republicans (United States)]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1997]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Lardener->Lardner -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Glynn"}

There does not appear to be reliable statistics about the number of these pageants held each year around the world. They vary in style, and categories may include a talent segment as well as costume and theme wear. Contestants often wear makeup, fake teeth, [[Eyelash extensions|false eyelashes]], [[lipstick]], elaborate hairstyles with [[Artificial hair integrations|hair extensions]], and specially designed, sometimes provocative, outfits. Spray tanning and waxing are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=16 Horrifying Child Beauty Pageant Pictures|url=http://firsttoknow.com/16-horrifying-child-beauty-pageant-pictures/|accessdate=10 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ugly truth about beauty pageants|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/ugly-truth-about-beauty-pageants/news-story/715edcfaf127b65e929bbd67cef5f145|accessdate=10 January 2017|date=August 2011}}</ref> Contestants compete for prizes and are judged on the way they look and how they act on stage, similar to the judgment criteria in adult [[beauty pageant]]s. Many parents attribute confidence-building as one of the reasons they enter their children in [[beauty pageant]]s, but critics argue that the negative effects of beauty pageantry, especially the [[sexualization]] of young children, outweigh the positive intentions.\n\n== Background ==\nThere are several components to sexualization that set it apart from healthy [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].

Supporters often cite self-confidence and poise as attributes that children learn during the pageant process, and still more defend pageants as being similar to other athletic, music, or educational programs. Since young girls like playing dress up and enjoy participating in beauty pageants, they argue, they are positive events.<ref name=Michael /> The Pageant Director for the Cities of America preliminary pageant system echoes these sentiments and argues that pageants are good for girls\u2014they develop self-confidence by actively trying to be a part of something, they compete with others through a fair process, and they enjoy meeting others with similar interests.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jen|title=Pageantry With Purpose|url=http://nationalsteenpageants.wordpress.com/about/|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> Being able to communicate and network with others is an important skill that children learn at a young age when participating in beauty pageants.

{"title_page": "List of Queen live performances", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Weasel|date=July 2008}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=August 2014}}\n{{Original research|date=July 2008}}}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] was well known for its diverse music style. Their large sound systems, lighting rigs, innovative pyrotechnics and extravagant costumes often gave shows a theatrical nature. Artists such as [[Bob Geldof]], [[George Michael]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Robbie Williams]] have expressed admiration for lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]]'s stage presence.\n\nQueen wrote certain songs, such as \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", with the goal of audience participation. \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\" came to inspire synchronized hand-clapping (this routine, originating from the song's video, was the invention of the video's director, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]). This influenced Queen's appearance at [[Live Aid]], where the 72,000-person crowd at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] would often sing loudly and clap their hands in unison. Queen's performance at [[Live Aid]] was later voted the greatest live show of all time by a large selection of musicians and critics .<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4420308.stm|title=Queen win greatest live gig poll|author=BBC|accessdate=2006-07-12 | date=9 November 2005|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\nQueen played approximately 700 live performances during their career with roughly two-thirds during the 1970s. Their early performances were generally hard rock, but the band developed a noticeably more pop-oriented sound in later years. Many of their future trademarks first appeared in these early shows, although some could be traced back to the members' previous bands and artistic outlets (e.g., [[Smile (band)|Smile]], Ibex later renamed as Wreckage, and Sour Milk Sea).\n\n[[Freddie Mercury]] often dressed in a flamboyant, Thespian manner and acted with camp; dry ice and multicoloured lights were used to great effect. During the concerts, it was typical for both [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] to have impromptu, instrumental interludes and for Mercury to engage in a crowd 'shout-along' whereas it was traditional for Taylor to sing one song. Brian May and [[John Deacon]] sang backup vocals. Other distinguishable trademarks were Mercury's microphone, which featured only the upper part of the stand with no base (which allegedly came about while Mercury was with \"Wreckage\" during which the bottom of his stand accidentally broke off), a grand piano, and May's hand-built electric guitar, the [[Red Special]]. The lengthy guitar solo by May showcased his adeptness in using a multiple-delay effect. This helped create a layered, orchestral atmosphere. Rarely, Queen would host a non-member on stage with them, the most notable being keyboardist [[Spike Edney]] who performed with the band during the 1980s. A semi-informal medley of 1950s rock 'n' roll songs (especially \"[[Big Spender]]\" and \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\") was also a staple and usually formed the backbone of an encore. The band's logo, designed by Mercury shortly before the release of the first album, is made up of the band's star signs and was usually displayed on the front of Taylor's bass drum during their early tours. Some stage costumes worn by Mercury and May on their earliest tours and a few subsequent tours were created by fashion designer [[Zandra Rhodes]].\n\nThe concert duration and set-list for each Queen show progressed significantly during its career, eventually leading to shows exceeding two hours. Queen performed most of the songs released on their studio albums during concerts. Many of their concerts (especially those during tours in the 70s) have been recorded on videotape. Examples include shows in: [[Rainbow Theatre]] (1974), [[Hammersmith Odeon]] (1975), [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] (1976), [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] (1977), [[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] (1977), and the Hammersmith Odeon (1979). So far, two shows have been officially released, which are the [[Live at the Rainbow '74|November 1974 show at the Rainbow]] and the [[A Night at the Odeon \u2013 Hammersmith 1975|Christmas Eve 1975 show at the Hammersmith Odeon]]. Footage from other 70s shows exists, especially from Japan in 1975/1976 and Europe in 1978/1979.\n\n[[Lisa Marie Presley]] stated that the first rock concert she attended was by Queen in Los Angeles in the late 70s. After the show, she gave Mercury a scarf that belonged to [[Elvis Presley|her late father]].<ref>[http://www.lisapresley.com/news/interviews/pop_ent.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721075537/http://www.lisapresley.com/news/interviews/pop_ent.htm |date=21 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Queen \u2013 Queen II Tours===\n{{main|Queen I Tour}}\n{{main|Queen II Tour}}\nWith the release of their first two albums [[Queen (Queen album)|Queen]] & [[Queen II]], the band began live performing in earnest, essentially following the traditional 'album-tour' cycle throughout the 70s. The embryonic Queen played numerous gigs in and around London in the early seventies, but evidence{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} suggests that its first performance was on 27 June 1970 at Truro in England, while still billed as \"Smile\". The band's first major step toward becoming a recognized live act came when Queen was a support act to [[Mott the Hoople]] on its UK tour. Queen's performances consistently received an enthusiastic reception from audiences. This led to Mott the Hoople's inviting Queen to be its support act for Hoople's US tour. Here, the band was able to hone its on-stage presentations in front of large crowds, try out different songs and arrangements, and gain valuable experience with state-of-the-art light and sound systems. The friendly relationship between Mott the Hoople and Queen still remains strong to this day. The Queen song \"[[Now I'm Here]]\" was written by [[Brian May]] as a tribute to [[Mott The Hoople]].\n\n[[Jim Kerr]] from [[Simple Minds]] first saw Queen when they opened for Mott the Hoople during the 1974 UK tour. At the launch party of the ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' album, Kerr stated that Queen \"blew Hoople off the stage!\". Similarly, [[Richie Sambora]] from [[Bon Jovi]] saw Queen open for Hoople three times in New York in 1974, stating that they were \"absolutely fantastic\", and that he \"never forgot\" the performances. On this same US tour, a show in Pennsylvania also featured a then-relatively unknown [[Aerosmith]], which was at a similar stage as Queen in its lengthy career.\n\n===Sheer Heart Attack Tour===\n{{main article|Sheer Heart Attack Tour}}\nThe [[Sheer Heart Attack]] Tour of 1974 is particularly notable for the fanatical excitement Queen encountered, especially in Japan, despite a substantial number of shows getting cancelled due to Brian May's health problems. Mercury was so impressed by the band's experiences on the Japanese leg that he would sometimes wear a kimono on stage during the encores at shows in other countries. This was the first time where the UK national anthem, \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", was used as the concert finale, and this tour also marked the first instance where the band employed pyrotechnics (during \"[[Sheer Heart Attack#In the Lap of the God...Revisited|In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited]]\"), making Queen one of the earliest bands to experiment with this live effect. For light humor and novelty, Deacon would sometimes play a single note on a triangle, Mercury would sip champagne, and May would play a handful of chords on a ukulele. The song \"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", which often clocked in at over 8 minutes, was a highlight for many fans, almost always demanded by audiences. During \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", Mercury would frantically shake a tambourine, and, more often than not, throw it into the crowd. On 19-20 November 1974, Queen was filmed while performing at the Rainbow Theatre in London. The show is often regarded as having shown Queen's blend of notable lead vocals, rhythm-sections and backing harmonies, as well as the rich guitar tone characteristic of the band's textured live sound. These qualities are especially evident in renditions of \"Liar\" and \"Stone Cold Crazy.\" Plus, on the credits of the Live At The Rainbow Video, [[John Deacon]] is credited under, \"Bass Guitar, Vocals, Triangle,\" since he sang on Liar.\n\n===A Night at the Opera Tour===\n{{main article|A Night At The Opera Tour}}\nThe [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]] Tour of 1975/76 coincided with \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" dominating the singles charts, and the band performed sections of it on three occasions during the course of a typical show. It was perhaps fitting that, given his passionate efforts in promoting the Bohemian Rhapsody single on the radio, the concert opened with a recorded introduction by [[Kenny Everett]] followed by the operatic section, during which the band waited in the wings. This was followed by the hard rock section, which would typically lead into \"[[Ogre Battle (song)|Ogre Battle]]\". The opening two verses and the closing ballad would be played later in the show as part of a piano-based medley with \"[[Killer Queen (song)|Killer Queen]]\", \"[[March of the Black Queen]]\", and sometimes \"[[You're My Best Friend (Queen song)|You're My Best Friend]]\". This arrangement allowed the band to avoid the logistical nightmare of performing the entire rhapsody live, and they could simply allow the operatic section to roll from tape.  Most of the so-called Christmas Eve gig was broadcast on the [[Old Grey Whistle Test]] \u2013 a television music show on [[BBC 2]]. At the end of many shows, Mercury tossed roses and/or carnations into the audience.\n\n===Summer 1976===\n{{main|Queen Hyde Park 1976}}\nQueen played four shows during a short UK tour during September 1976. Beginning on 1 September, Queen played in [[Edinburgh]], as well as on the following night on 2 September. On 10 September, they played in [[Cardiff]], which was Queen's second and final show in the city, having played there on the previous tour in 1975.\n\nThe final Queen show of the year was in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], performed on 18 September during the hot summer of 1976. The Hyde Park gig was in fact a free concert, which drew in a crowd of about 180,000. The free concert was organised by [[Richard Branson]], an entrepreneur at the time.\n\nThe Hyde Park show has several audio sources available, including a soundboard source. The only other concert on the tour with available audio is the second Edinburgh concert, which has an audience recording in circulation.\n\nThis tour features the debut performances of \"You Take My Breath Away,\" and \"Tie Your Mother Down\" (Tie Your Mother Down was not played at Hyde Park due to limited time), about 3 months before A Day At The Races was released.\n\n===A Day at the Races Tour===\n{{main article|A Day at the Races Tour}}\nThe [[A Day at the Races (album)|Day at the Races]] Tour of 1977 incorporated the first acoustic, or 'unplugged' renditions of songs (e.g. \"[['39]]\"). Shortly before the album came out, the band played a handful of UK concerts, at which several tracks were played before being officially released.  This was followed by a free show at Hyde Park in London that coincided with the anniversary of the death of [[Jimi Hendrix]]. On the tour proper, the band opened their shows with \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", which became a standard opening or closing song on subsequent tours. The band also adopted what would become the standard arrangement for Bohemian Rhapsody on this tour: performing the first two verses on stage, then exiting and allowing the operatic section to be played over the [[Public address|PA system]], and finally returning to the stage to play the hard rock section through the end. At this time, Queen first began to experiment with moving and tilting lighting rigs, which required some degree of unseen, mechanical wizardry. The USA leg was double-billed with [[Thin Lizzy]], and their performances were, perhaps unsurprisingly, noticeably heavier. This was also the first US tour that Queen performed at the legendary [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Some of Mercury's leotards were inspired by the stage costumes of ballet dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. A filming of this show at Earls Court in London remains a favourite of many long-term fans. This was the final tour during which the band played the encore staple \"Rock 'n Roll Medley\" in its original form, although individual songs from it (most frequently \"Jailhouse Rock\") continued to appear in later tours.\n\n===News of the World===\n{{main article|News of the World Tour}}\nQueen began the [[News of the World Tour]] in the United States in late 1977, and in Europe in early 1978. This show featured the first performances of \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", whose compositions had been largely inspired by Queen's live reputation. The two songs were used as the first encore during this tour and followed by \"[[Sheer Heart Attack (song)|Sheer Heart Attack]]\" and a \"Jailhouse Rock\" cover. Later, \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\" ended virtually every Queen concert. The up-tempo version of \"We Will Rock You\", which was never officially released on a studio album, was the opening song for this tour and many tours to come. Possibly as a response to the punk explosion, Mercury regularly acted destructive during the performance of \"Sheer Heart Attack\" near the end of the show. It was on this tour that \"[[I'm in Love with My Car]]\", featuring Taylor on lead vocals, was initially introduced to the setlist. This was also the first time in which \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" was performed live, as a reworked acoustic version, and it became a highlight of the show almost instantly. The fans often took control of the lead vocals of this song, while Mercury conducted the audience as a choir. To make way for the new material, most songs from the first two Queen albums were omitted.\n\n===Jazz===\n{{main article|Jazz Tour}}\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|[[Hanover, Germany]], 1979]]\n\nOn the exhausting [[Jazz Tour]] in late 1978 for the US and early 1979 through Europe and Japan, most European dates were recorded and then later spliced together to make up the [[Live Killers]] double-album.  This tour featured their \"Pizza Oven\" lighting rig which consisted of 320 par lights arranged on a massive moveable rig above the band.  It was nicknamed the \"Pizza Oven\" due to the massive amount of heat that the lights generated.  When introducing the song \"[[Death on Two Legs]]\", Mercury often swore profusely about the band's previous managers which had to be dubbed over on the album. This tour saw Mercury start to wear full leather/vinyl outfits instead of glam-inspired leotards (which drew a public jibe from [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]]) and, in keeping with a theme of their latest singles \"[[Bicycle Race]]\" and \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", a group of topless women riding bicycles sometimes appeared on stage. To some observers, there seemed to be a 'sex theme' deliberately integrated into the shows and this tour first saw the now famous Brian-Brian chant from the audience. Another unexpected feature of many shows was the requests for the seemingly inconspicuous song \"Mustapha\" by numerous members of the crowd. On this tour, Mercury would sing only the opening few bars [[a cappella]] as on the album version, but the band would perform the song in full on the next few tours. On the Japanese shows, the band played \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" with May playing piano.\n\nDuring the 15-date Japanese leg of this tour, Mercury experienced a variety of difficulties with his voice, as heard on several bootlegs of this leg of the tour. The string of concerts from April 21st in [[Kanazawa]] to May 2nd in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]] has been considered by fans as the lowest point in his live career.\n\n===Crazy Tour===\n{{main article|Crazy Tour}}\nThe small-scale [[Crazy Tour]] in late 1979, which was only preceded by a big-selling single and not an album, saw Mercury with short hair and it was the first time that Mercury played the acoustic guitar (i.e. \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\") on stage. The band would typically drop \"Brighton Rock\" from the shows on this, and future, tours so that the guitar solo by May (which had its genesis in \"Son and Daughter\") effectively became a stand-alone performance. In some concerts, Mercury would appear on stage near the closing of the show sitting on the shoulders of [[Superman]] or [[Darth Vader]] although this would lead to some minor legality problems. Because of the many small venues used on this tour, the road crew often encountered problems when constructing the band's stages and so the stages, and sometimes the venues themselves, had to be altered substantially. One noteworthy show on this particular tour was their Boxing Day gig at the [[Concerts for the People of Kampuchea]] in London which was also filmed. This tour also features Mercury delivering some of his finest live vocals in Queen's live career.\n\n==1980s==\n\n===The Game Tour===\n{{main|The Game Tour}}\n[[The Game Tour]] in 1980 coincided with Queen being at their most popular with massive sales of their latest album both inside and outside of the United States. One surprise, however, to many concert-goers was the prominent moustache that Mercury had grown. Also Mercury's stage costumes appeared to be more local and less flamboyant (e.g. T-shirts and sport shoes) than in the earlier tours. Moreover, the band, and Mercury in particular, would emphasise the funk/dance sound when performing the songs \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" and \"[[Dragon Attack]]\" although many of their loyal hard-rock fans were rather indifferent. It is noted that a small selection of material from the [[Flash Gordon (album)|Flash Gordon]] album was also included in the play list.\n\n[[The Game Tour]] in 1981 heralded in a largely untapped frontier for live rock music. In this case, Queen embarked on a short, yet frantic, tour of South America that included a number of dates at some of the world's biggest [[football (soccer)|football]] stadiums. No major rock band had ever seriously toured this area of the globe. Queen's album sales in South America had been quite high from quite early on in the band's career which provided the main inspiration for the tour. Overall Queen played to approximately 700,000 people in the space of just 13 concerts with the show at [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil setting the world record for the biggest paying audience at 250,000 people. As a point of note, football star [[Diego Maradona]] appeared on stage with the band in [[Argentina]]. Some of the shows were filmed and the two Canadian gigs at Montreal were filmed and released as the [[We Will Rock You (video)|We Will Rock You]] video, and DVD at a later date, but sometimes referred to as just Live In Concert. In this era, Mercury appeared onstage naked except for some white pants. Producer [[Saul Swimmer]] asked Queen to wear the same clothes in both nights. The band, however, were angry with the producers, so they decided to ruin the continuity by constantly changing clothes during the course of the two nights. This was confirmed by Brian May on the Queen Rock Montreal DVD commentary.\n\nThis tour was also the last in which Queen performed without additional musicians, singers or backing track. However, the live output of all the bandmembers\u2019 microphones could be doubled in 'real-time', creating up to 32 voices. The only playback part is and has always been the opera part in Bohemian Rhapsody, where the band is offstage.\n\n===Hot Space Tour===\n{{main|Hot Space Tour}}\nThe [[Hot Space Tour]] of 1982 followed a controversial studio album. A notable concert of the tour was an open-air concert at the [[Milton Keynes]] Bowl near [[Northampton]], which was released on home video several years later. To many concert-goers, the band's sound as well as Mercury's vocal performances now had a distinctive soul/funk tone. It is worth noting that this was the tour in which Queen started employing the services of another musician, a keyboardist, on stage. Hence keyboards would become a prominent feature of Queen's live sound from this point onwards although the piano, played by Mercury, was still retained. Almost no material from this album would be played on future tours -- \"[[Staying Power]]\" saw some play early in the next tour, and only \"[[Under Pressure]]\" would become a lasting addition to the setlist. The band performed two songs live, namely \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (from The Game), along with \"Under Pressure\", on [[Saturday Night Live]] as well. Also one of the Japan gigs was filmed although it did not receive an international release. However some live footage from this Japan show, as well as some footage from an Austrian gig, is commercially available. The 'Hot Space Tour' was to be Queen's last tour in America.\n\n===The Works Tour===\n{{main|The Works Tour}}\n[[The Works Tour]] in 1984/1985 was one of Queen's largest tours and included the Brazil [[Rock in Rio]] festival\u2014in which they appeared on stage at two o'clock in the morning in front of 470,000 people during the first night and 250,000 on the second night. \nThe ''Boston Globe'' described it as a \"mesmerising performance\".<ref name=\"globe\"/> A selection of highlights of both nights was released on VHS with the title ''Queen: Live in Rio'', and was later broadcast on MTV in the US.<ref name=\"globe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_02-15-1986_-_Boston_Globe_-_Rock_in_Rio|title=Queen: Rock in Rio|publisher=Queenarchives.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/39837/Queen-Live-in-Rio/overview |title=Queen: Live in Rio (1985)|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> In April and May 1985, Queen completed the Works Tour with sold-out shows in Australia and Japan.<ref>Grein, Paul.

The lack of US dates is seen as peculiar given that Mercury had started living in New York around this time. The album was partially recorded in Los Angeles, and Queen had changed their US label from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]. It was rumored that a full-scale US tour would put too much strain on Mercury's voice. Both media reports (e.g. covering the Wembley Arena show) and bootleg recordings throughout the tour show that Mercury would sometimes have vocal difficulties. Usually Mercury wore leotards reminiscent of his seventies attire but, in keeping with its unconventional video, on a number of occasions he would make a cameo appearance dressed, or partly dressed, in drag when \"[[I Want to Break Free]]\" was being performed. This sometimes received a mixed reception. Audiences reproduced the synchronised hand-clapping routine that appeared in the \"Radio Ga Ga\" video during the choruses of this song. In this tour, the band brought back some of the material from their first three albums into the set-list as part of a 'flash-back' medley. Rick Parfitt from [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] also appeared on-stage with the band during one of their London gigs and [[Tony Hadley]] from [[Spandau Ballet]] appeared on-stage with the band during their only New Zealand concert.\n\nQueen were to participate in two music festivals (in 1984 and 1986) at Montreux in Switzerland, where they lip-synched a small selection of their latest material. This surprised many onlookers as the band had often spoken out strongly against this style of performance. The concerts were filmed and then broadcast to many millions of people throughout Europe. To their fans, it seemed obvious that the band, as well as some members of the audience, were dis-oriented and somewhat confused during these faked performances.\n\nThe 1984 performances in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City, South Africa]] landed the band in hot water. Many well-known acts, both before and after Queen, have played at the holiday resort in a meteor crater and were not subsequently criticised for it. The international deploration of apartheid, however, would reach a high-point shortly after the band performed. Many action groups, including a group of musicians called [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], publicly condemned Queen for their appearances at the resort. To try to calm the waters, Queen officially released a statement that they had no wish to promote racial prejudice.\n\n===Live Aid===\n{{main|Live Aid}}The performance at [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1985 is often regarded<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8785536/Queen-their-finest-moment-at-Live-Aid.html |title=Queen: their finest moment at Live Aid |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> as Queen's greatest single live performance. Their set lasted 21 minutes and consisted of a version of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" (ballad section and guitar solo) slightly sped up in lyrics, \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", a crowd singalong, \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\", \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" (1st verse), and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\". Mercury and May returned later on to perform a version of \"[[Is This the World We Created?]]\" The band were unenthusiastic about performing when they were first approached by [[Bob Geldof]], but the acclaim they received after their performance led to them writing, collectively, the song \"[[One Vision]]\" which was then released as a single.\n\n===The Magic Tour===\n{{main|Magic Tour (Queen)}}\n[[Magic Tour (Queen)|The Magic Tour]] in 1986 was Queen's final tour with their lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and bass guitarist [[John Deacon]]. On this occasion the tour did not extend beyond Europe and included back-to-back shows at Wembley Stadium in London (where [[INXS]], [[The Alarm]] and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] were the supporting acts) as well as one concert at Budapest in Hungary. One striking image of Mercury from the Wembley show would be regularly used for promotional purposes (e.g. the Tribute Concert posters, the memorial statue at Montreux, the cover of the [[Greatest Hits III (Queen album)|Greatest Hits III]] album, the Musical billboards). Throughout the tour, Mercury would regularly make an impromptu statement on stage that denounced the rumour that Queen were about to split up. As \"God Save the Queen\" played over the PA system at the end of each show, Mercury would come on stage wearing a cloak and a replica of the crown jewels. After this tour, Queen were credited as being one of the first rock bands to employ the oversized screen (or [[Jumbotron]]) at live concerts. Many of the shows were recorded and a heavily edited album, titled [[Live Magic]], was released shortly afterwards. Similarly the Budapest concert was released as the Live In Budapest video (released on DVD, Blu-ray and CD as Queen Hungarian Rhapsody: Live In Budapest in November 2012) and one of the Wembley concerts would be released as the [[Live at Wembley '86|Live At Wembley album/CD]] and [[Queen at Wembley|video/DVD]] many years later. The final show of the tour was held on 9 August 1986 at Knebworth Park in England (with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] as support act) and drew an estimated 200,000 in attendance.\n\nShortly after the completion of The Magic Tour, a three-video rockumentary was released called ''The Magic Years'' which had footage from various live shows. Following on from this, a compilation of entirely live material was released by way of the ''Rare Live \u2013 A Concert Through Time and Space'' video. However neither of these have been re-released on DVD to date. The last albums to be released while Mercury was still alive were ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' (1989), ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' (1991), and ''[[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|Greatest Hits II]]'' (1991) and no tours were planned. According to the ''Mercury and Me'' book,<ref>Jim Hutton and Tim Waspshott. ''Mercury and Me.'' Bloomsbury, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7475-1922-6}}</ref> Mercury was diagnosed with [[AIDS]] in the year following The Magic Tour (i.e. 1987) which may explain why they stopped touring so abruptly. However Taylor did form a band called [[The Cross (band)|The Cross]], that went on to release three studio albums, who performed a number of live concerts with Taylor adopting the role of lead vocalist and [[rhythm guitar]]ist not drummer. No live recordings were ever released although some bootlegs do exist.\n\n==1990s==\nQueen did not perform any concerts in their original line-up in the 1990s. After Freddie Mercury's death in November 1991, Queen organised [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] and took place in April 1992 at Wembley Stadium. The three remaining members (in one of the few concerts they played together after Mercury's death) and a host of special guests staged a lengthy and emotional show billed as the Concert For AIDS Awareness (as well as Concert for Life) that was televised worldwide. Queen appeared only sporadically following the concert. Not all appearances featured all three surviving members. The final occasion where all remaining members of Queen performed on stage was in January 1997 at Paris in France for the world premiere of Bejart Ballet For Life. Joining the surviving trio were [[Spike Edney]] on keyboards/backing-vocals and [[Elton John]] who sang lead vocals. They only performed one song, namely \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" which was one of the two songs they had performed together at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, and this was the last reported appearance of John Deacon on stage.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date<ref name=\"queenconcerts.com\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/postfreddie.html |title=Queen live concertography: Brian + Roger + ? |publisher=Queen Concerts |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Venue\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Notes\n|-\n|20 April 1992\n|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Wembley Stadium\n|[[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]\n|-\n|18 August 1993\n|Midhurst\n|Cowdray Park\n|Festival appearance, featured only Taylor and Deacon\n|-\n|17 January 1997\n|Paris\n|France\n|Theatre National de Chaillot\n|Queen + [[Elton John]], last appearance of John Deacon\n|-\n|25 November 1999\n|London\n|England\n|Brixton Academy\n|May and Taylor appearance at a [[Foo Fighters]] concert\n|}\n\n==2000s==\n\nFollowing Freddie Mercury's death and John Deacon's retirement, May and Taylor continued to make sporadic live appearances in addition to their long-term collaboration with [[Paul Rodgers]].\n\n'''One-off performances'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date<ref name=\"queenconcerts.com\"/>\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Venue\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Notes\n|-\n|9 July 2000\n|rowspan=\"2\"|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Hyde Park\n|Queen + [[Five (band)|Five]]\n|-\n|27 September 2000\n|Millennium Dome\n|Queen + Five\n|-\n|19 March 2001\n|New York\n|United States\n|Waldorf Astoria Hotel\n|[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Induction\n|-\n|24 November 2001\n|London\n|England\n|Ocean Club\n|Fan Club concert for 10th anniversary of Mercuy's death\n|-\n|30 April 2002\n|Amsterdam\n|The Netherlands\n|Museum Square\n|Birthday party for Dutch Queen\n|-\n|14 May 2002\n|rowspan=\"2\"|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Astoria Theater\n|With the cast of ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''\n|-\n|3 June 2002\n|Buckingham Palace\n|Queen's Jubilee\n|-\n|18 October 2002\n|Los Angeles\n|United States\n|Club 1650\n|\n|-\n|16 November 2002\n|rowspan=\"2\"|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Children in Need\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|14 May 2003\n|Billingsgate Market\n|\n|-\n|27 May 2003\n|Modena\n|Italy\n|Parco Novi Sad\n|With [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Zucchero Fornaciari]]\n|-\n|12 June 2003\n|New York\n|United States\n|Marriott Marquis Hotel\n|Songwriter's Hall of Fame Induction\n|-\n|7 August 2003\n|Melbourne\n|Australia\n|Regent Theatre\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|29 November 2003\n|Cape Town\n|South Africa\n|Green Point Stadium\n|46664 charity concert\n|-\n|8 September 2004\n|Las Vegas\n|United States\n|Paris Hotel\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|9 October 2004\n|Sydney\n|Australia\n|Lyric Theatre\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|16 October 2004\n|Moscow\n|Russia\n|State Kremlin Palace\n|Russian Music Awards, with the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|11 November 2004\n|London\n|England\n|Hackney Empire\n|Hall of Fame Induction\n|-\n|12 December 2004\n|Cologne\n|Germany\n|Flora\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|12 January 2005\n|rowspan=\"3\"|London\n|rowspan=\"3\"|England\n|Dominion Theatre\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|17 June 2006\n|Hyde Park\n|Appearance at a Foo Fighters concert\n|-\n|5 September 2006\n|Dominion Theatre\n|Freddie Mercury 60th birthday celebration, with the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|}\n\n===Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour===\n[[File:Queenpaulkoeln.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Queen + Paul Rodgers performing at Cologne on 6 July 2005 during their European Tour.]] [[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Brian May performing during the tour.]]\n{{Main article|Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour}}\n'''Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour''' was a world [[concert tour]] by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] lead guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], joined by singer [[Paul Rodgers]] under the moniker of [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]]. The tour was Queen's first since [[Magic Tour (Queen)|The Magic Tour]] in 1986, and the death of lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] in November 1991.<ref name=\"Guardian\">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/05/arts.artsnews1 Queen most loved band] The Guardian. Retrieved 3 August 2011</ref> Roger Taylor commented; \"We never thought we would tour again, Paul (Rodgers) came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Bass guitarist [[John Deacon]] also did not take part due to his retirement in 1997, however he gave the enterprise his blessing.\n\nThe origins of the collaboration came when Brian May played at the [[The Strat Pack|Fender Strat Pack]] concert in 2004. Now for the first time, he joined Paul Rodgers for a rendition of [[Free (band)|Free's]] classic, \"[[All Right Now]]\". After this Brian spoke of a chemistry between the two of them. Following this, Brian invited Paul to play with Queen at their induction to the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]]. Again citing a new excitement with Rodgers, the three announced they would tour in 2005. The tour originally was meant only to include Europe and the [[46664 (concerts)|46664 concerts]] of that year. However at the end of the European tour, some dates in the US and Japan were added. In 2006, a full scale US tour was undertaken, with very poor attendance.\n\nThe stage design for the tour was minimal, lacking a large backing screen that would later be featured on the [[Rock The Cosmos Tour]], and elaborate stage theatrics. A large 'B Stage' was constructed out from the main stage, into the audience which would frequently be used for acoustic performances by all the members of the band. The show began with the [[Eminem]] song \"[[Lose Yourself]]\" being played over the PA system, and a dance-theme remix of the Queen song [[Made In Heaven|It's A Beautiful Day]]. Toward the end of [[Lose Yourself]], the guitar would join in from behind a large curtain which covered the band from view, before Rodgers would appear singing a shortened version of the song \"Reachin' Out\". Thought by many fans to be a new song, it was a charity song that both Brian and Paul had played together on in the 1990s. Brian would appear after, playing the introductory riff to \"Tie Your Mother Down\", before the curtain fell and the band would perform the full song.\n\nThe first segment of the concert consisted largely of Queen hits and some of Rodgers' songs. To introduce \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", Brian would play the introductory riff from the earlier Queen song \"White Man\". Rodgers often played a muted steel string guitar on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\". An acoustic section would follow, Taylor leaving the kit at times to sing \"Say It's Not True\" on the B-Stage, while Brian would play acoustic Queen songs such as \"Love of My Life\" and \"39\". A unique version of \"Hammer To Fall\" would be played, which featured a slower and mellower first verse sung by May and Rodgers. The second half of the song would be played as a full band, depending on the condition of his voice, Rodgers would also sing this section, or leave it to Taylor. Taylor would often play an intricate cover of Sandy Nelson drum instrumental \"Let There Be Drums\", followed by a performance of \"I'm In Love With My Car\", with Taylor taking lead vocals and the drum parts.\n\nA guitar solo by May would follow, with a band instrumental of \"Last Horizon\" playing, in which a large mirror ball was used. During the second half of the concert, Taylor would leave the kit to sing \"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\", with a screen playing nostalgic footage, including shots of the band on their early tours in Japan. \"Radio GaGa\" would follow, with Taylor singing the first and second verses, with drum samples from the studio version controlled by Edney. Rodgers would take the rest of the song, with Taylor playing live drums for the rest of the song. During \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Freddie's vocal and piano part, along with video footage from Queen's 1986 show at Wembley Stadium would be used, while the rest of the band would play live music. After the operatic section, Rodgers would sing the heavy part, while the closing lines of the song would be an interchanging duet between Rodgers and Mercury. The song would end with Mercury taking a bow to the crowd, and the band would leave the stage. For the encore, a largely rigid line up of \"The Show Must Go On\", \"All Right Now\", \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are The Champions\" would be played, before the band would leave the stage, Taylor throwing his drumsticks into the audience.\n\n===Rock The Cosmos Tour===\n{{Main article|Rock the Cosmos Tour}}\nThe '''Rock The Cosmos Tour''' was the second and final [[concert tour]] by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]], promoting their first and only studio album \"[[The Cosmos Rocks]]\".

Their large sound systems, lighting rigs, innovative pyrotechnics and extravagant costumes often gave shows a theatrical nature. Artists such as [[Bob Geldof]], [[George Michael]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Robbie Williams]] have expressed admiration for lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]]'s stage presence.\n\nQueen wrote certain songs, such as \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", with the goal of audience participation. \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\" came to inspire synchronized hand-clapping (this routine, originating from the song's video, was the invention of the video's director, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]). This influenced Queen's appearance at [[Live Aid]], where the 72,000-person crowd at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] would often sing loudly and clap their hands in unison. Queen's performance at [[Live Aid]] was later voted the greatest live show of all time by a large selection of musicians and critics .<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4420308.stm|title=Queen win greatest live gig poll|author=BBC|accessdate=2006-07-12 | date=9 November 2005|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\nQueen played approximately 700 live performances during their career with roughly two-thirds during the 1970s. Their early performances were generally hard rock, but the band developed a noticeably more pop-oriented sound in later years. Many of their future trademarks first appeared in these early shows, although some could be traced back to the members' previous bands and artistic outlets (e.g., [[Smile (band)|Smile]], Ibex later renamed as Wreckage, and Sour Milk Sea).\n\n[[Freddie Mercury]] often dressed in a flamboyant, Thespian manner and acted with camp; dry ice and multicoloured lights were used to great effect. During the concerts, it was typical for both [[Brian May]] and [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] to have impromptu, instrumental interludes and for Mercury to engage in a crowd 'shout-along' whereas it was traditional for Taylor to sing one song. Brian May and [[John Deacon]] sang backup vocals. Other distinguishable trademarks were Mercury's microphone, which featured only the upper part of the stand with no base (which allegedly came about while Mercury was with \"Wreckage\" during which the bottom of his stand accidentally broke off), a grand piano, and May's hand-built electric guitar, the [[Red Special]]. The lengthy guitar solo by May showcased his adeptness in using a multiple-delay effect. This helped create a layered, orchestral atmosphere. Rarely, Queen would host a non-member on stage with them, the most notable being keyboardist [[Spike Edney]] who performed with the band during the 1980s. A semi-informal medley of 1950s rock 'n' roll songs (especially \"[[Big Spender]]\" and \"[[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]\") was also a staple and usually formed the backbone of an encore. The band's logo, designed by Mercury shortly before the release of the first album, is made up of the band's star signs and was usually displayed on the front of Taylor's bass drum during their early tours. Some stage costumes worn by Mercury and May on their earliest tours and a few subsequent tours were created by fashion designer [[Zandra Rhodes]].\n\nThe concert duration and set-list for each Queen show progressed significantly during its career, eventually leading to shows exceeding two hours. Queen performed most of the songs released on their studio albums during concerts. Many of their concerts (especially those during tours in the 70s) have been recorded on videotape. Examples include shows in: [[Rainbow Theatre]] (1974), [[Hammersmith Odeon]] (1975), [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] (1976), [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] (1977), [[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] (1977), and the Hammersmith Odeon (1979). So far, two shows have been officially released, which are the [[Live at the Rainbow '74|November 1974 show at the Rainbow]] and the [[A Night at the Odeon \u2013 Hammersmith 1975|Christmas Eve 1975 show at the Hammersmith Odeon]]. Footage from other 70s shows exists, especially from Japan in 1975/1976 and Europe in 1978/1979.\n\n[[Lisa Marie Presley]] stated that the first rock concert she attended was by Queen in Los Angeles in the late 70s. After the show, she gave Mercury a scarf that belonged to [[Elvis Presley|her late father]].<ref>[http://www.lisapresley.com/news/interviews/pop_ent.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721075537/http://www.lisapresley.com/news/interviews/pop_ent.htm |date=21 July 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Queen \u2013 Queen II Tours===\n{{main|Queen I Tour}}\n{{main|Queen II Tour}}\nWith the release of their first two albums [[Queen (Queen album)|Queen]] & [[Queen II]], the band began live performing in earnest, essentially following the traditional 'album-tour' cycle throughout the 70s. The embryonic Queen played numerous gigs in and around London in the early seventies, but evidence{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} suggests that its first performance was on 27 June 1970 at Truro in England, while still billed as \"Smile\". The band's first major step toward becoming a recognized live act came when Queen was a support act to [[Mott the Hoople]] on its UK tour. Queen's performances consistently received an enthusiastic reception from audiences. This led to Mott the Hoople's inviting Queen to be its support act for Hoople's US tour. Here, the band was able to hone its on-stage presentations in front of large crowds, try out different songs and arrangements, and gain valuable experience with state-of-the-art light and sound systems. The friendly relationship between Mott the Hoople and Queen still remains strong to this day. The Queen song \"[[Now I'm Here]]\" was written by [[Brian May]] as a tribute to [[Mott The Hoople]].\n\n[[Jim Kerr]] from [[Simple Minds]] first saw Queen when they opened for Mott the Hoople during the 1974 UK tour. At the launch party of the ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' album, Kerr stated that Queen \"blew Hoople off the stage!\". Similarly, [[Richie Sambora]] from [[Bon Jovi]] saw Queen open for Hoople three times in New York in 1974, stating that they were \"absolutely fantastic\", and that he \"never forgot\" the performances. On this same US tour, a show in Pennsylvania also featured a then-relatively unknown [[Aerosmith]], which was at a similar stage as Queen in its lengthy career.\n\n===Sheer Heart Attack Tour===\n{{main article|Sheer Heart Attack Tour}}\nThe [[Sheer Heart Attack]] Tour of 1974 is particularly notable for the fanatical excitement Queen encountered, especially in Japan, despite a substantial number of shows getting cancelled due to Brian May's health problems. Mercury was so impressed by the band's experiences on the Japanese leg that he would sometimes wear a kimono on stage during the encores at shows in other countries. This was the first time where the UK national anthem, \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", was used as the concert finale, and this tour also marked the first instance where the band employed pyrotechnics (during \"[[Sheer Heart Attack#In the Lap of the God...Revisited|In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited]]\"), making Queen one of the earliest bands to experiment with this live effect. For light humor and novelty, Deacon would sometimes play a single note on a triangle, Mercury would sip champagne, and May would play a handful of chords on a ukulele. The song \"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", which often clocked in at over 8 minutes, was a highlight for many fans, almost always demanded by audiences. During \"[[Keep Yourself Alive]]\", Mercury would frantically shake a tambourine, and, more often than not, throw it into the crowd. On 19-20 November 1974, Queen was filmed while performing at the Rainbow Theatre in London. The show is often regarded as having shown Queen's blend of notable lead vocals, rhythm-sections and backing harmonies, as well as the rich guitar tone characteristic of the band's textured live sound. These qualities are especially evident in renditions of \"Liar\" and \"Stone Cold Crazy.\" Plus, on the credits of the Live At The Rainbow Video, [[John Deacon]] is credited under, \"Bass Guitar, Vocals, Triangle,\" since he sang on Liar.\n\n===A Night at the Opera Tour===\n{{main article|A Night At The Opera Tour}}\nThe [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]] Tour of 1975/76 coincided with \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" dominating the singles charts, and the band performed sections of it on three occasions during the course of a typical show. It was perhaps fitting that, given his passionate efforts in promoting the Bohemian Rhapsody single on the radio, the concert opened with a recorded introduction by [[Kenny Everett]] followed by the operatic section, during which the band waited in the wings. This was followed by the hard rock section, which would typically lead into \"[[Ogre Battle (song)|Ogre Battle]]\". The opening two verses and the closing ballad would be played later in the show as part of a piano-based medley with \"[[Killer Queen (song)|Killer Queen]]\", \"[[March of the Black Queen]]\", and sometimes \"[[You're My Best Friend (Queen song)|You're My Best Friend]]\". This arrangement allowed the band to avoid the logistical nightmare of performing the entire rhapsody live, and they could simply allow the operatic section to roll from tape.  Most of the so-called Christmas Eve gig was broadcast on the [[Old Grey Whistle Test]] \u2013 a television music show on [[BBC 2]]. At the end of many shows, Mercury tossed roses and/or carnations into the audience.\n\n===Summer 1976===\n{{main|Queen Hyde Park 1976}}\nQueen played four shows during a short UK tour during September 1976. Beginning on 1 September, Queen played in [[Edinburgh]], as well as on the following night on 2 September. On 10 September, they played in [[Cardiff]], which was Queen's second and final show in the city, having played there on the previous tour in 1975.\n\nThe final Queen show of the year was in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], performed on 18 September during the hot summer of 1976. The Hyde Park gig was in fact a free concert, which drew in a crowd of about 180,000. The free concert was organised by [[Richard Branson]], an entrepreneur at the time.\n\nThe Hyde Park show has several audio sources available, including a soundboard source. The only other concert on the tour with available audio is the second Edinburgh concert, which has an audience recording in circulation.\n\nThis tour features the debut performances of \"You Take My Breath Away,\" and \"Tie Your Mother Down\" (Tie Your Mother Down was not played at Hyde Park due to limited time), about 3 months before A Day At The Races was released.\n\n===A Day at the Races Tour===\n{{main article|A Day at the Races Tour}}\nThe [[A Day at the Races (album)|Day at the Races]] Tour of 1977 incorporated the first acoustic, or 'unplugged' renditions of songs (e.g. \"[['39]]\"). Shortly before the album came out, the band played a handful of UK concerts, at which several tracks were played before being officially released.  This was followed by a free show at Hyde Park in London that coincided with the anniversary of the death of [[Jimi Hendrix]]. On the tour proper, the band opened their shows with \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", which became a standard opening or closing song on subsequent tours. The band also adopted what would become the standard arrangement for Bohemian Rhapsody on this tour: performing the first two verses on stage, then exiting and allowing the operatic section to be played over the [[Public address|PA system]], and finally returning to the stage to play the hard rock section through the end. At this time, Queen first began to experiment with moving and tilting lighting rigs, which required some degree of unseen, mechanical wizardry. The USA leg was double-billed with [[Thin Lizzy]], and their performances were, perhaps unsurprisingly, noticeably heavier. This was also the first US tour that Queen performed at the legendary [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Some of Mercury's leotards were inspired by the stage costumes of ballet dancer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]]. A filming of this show at Earls Court in London remains a favourite of many long-term fans. This was the final tour during which the band played the encore staple \"Rock 'n Roll Medley\" in its original form, although individual songs from it (most frequently \"Jailhouse Rock\") continued to appear in later tours.\n\n===News of the World===\n{{main article|News of the World Tour}}\nQueen began the [[News of the World Tour]] in the United States in late 1977, and in Europe in early 1978. This show featured the first performances of \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\", whose compositions had been largely inspired by Queen's live reputation. The two songs were used as the first encore during this tour and followed by \"[[Sheer Heart Attack (song)|Sheer Heart Attack]]\" and a \"Jailhouse Rock\" cover. Later, \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are the Champions\" ended virtually every Queen concert. The up-tempo version of \"We Will Rock You\", which was never officially released on a studio album, was the opening song for this tour and many tours to come. Possibly as a response to the punk explosion, Mercury regularly acted destructive during the performance of \"Sheer Heart Attack\" near the end of the show. It was on this tour that \"[[I'm in Love with My Car]]\", featuring Taylor on lead vocals, was initially introduced to the setlist. This was also the first time in which \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" was performed live, as a reworked acoustic version, and it became a highlight of the show almost instantly. The fans often took control of the lead vocals of this song, while Mercury conducted the audience as a choir. To make way for the new material, most songs from the first two Queen albums were omitted.\n\n===Jazz===\n{{main article|Jazz Tour}}\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|[[Hanover, Germany]], 1979]]\n\nOn the exhausting [[Jazz Tour]] in late 1978 for the US and early 1979 through Europe and Japan, most European dates were recorded and then later spliced together to make up the [[Live Killers]] double-album.  This tour featured their \"Pizza Oven\" lighting rig which consisted of 320 par lights arranged on a massive moveable rig above the band.  It was nicknamed the \"Pizza Oven\" due to the massive amount of heat that the lights generated.  When introducing the song \"[[Death on Two Legs]]\", Mercury often swore profusely about the band's previous managers which had to be dubbed over on the album. This tour saw Mercury start to wear full leather/vinyl outfits instead of glam-inspired leotards (which drew a public jibe from [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]]) and, in keeping with a theme of their latest singles \"[[Bicycle Race]]\" and \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", a group of topless women riding bicycles sometimes appeared on stage. To some observers, there seemed to be a 'sex theme' deliberately integrated into the shows and this tour first saw the now famous Brian-Brian chant from the audience. Another unexpected feature of many shows was the requests for the seemingly inconspicuous song \"Mustapha\" by numerous members of the crowd. On this tour, Mercury would sing only the opening few bars [[a cappella]] as on the album version, but the band would perform the song in full on the next few tours. On the Japanese shows, the band played \"[[Teo Torriatte]]\" with May playing piano.\n\nDuring the 15-date Japanese leg of this tour, Mercury experienced a variety of difficulties with his voice, as heard on several bootlegs of this leg of the tour. The string of concerts from April 21st in [[Kanazawa]] to May 2nd in [[Yamaguchi]] has been considered by fans as the lowest point in his live career.\n\n===Crazy Tour===\n{{main article|Crazy Tour}}\nThe small-scale [[Crazy Tour]] in late 1979, which was only preceded by a big-selling single and not an album, saw Mercury with short hair and it was the first time that Mercury played the acoustic guitar (i.e. \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\") on stage. The band would typically drop \"Brighton Rock\" from the shows on this, and future, tours so that the guitar solo by May (which had its genesis in \"Son and Daughter\") effectively became a stand-alone performance. In some concerts, Mercury would appear on stage near the closing of the show sitting on the shoulders of [[Superman]] or [[Darth Vader]] although this would lead to some minor legality problems. Because of the many small venues used on this tour, the road crew often encountered problems when constructing the band's stages and so the stages, and sometimes the venues themselves, had to be altered substantially. One noteworthy show on this particular tour was their Boxing Day gig at the [[Concerts for the People of Kampuchea]] in London which was also filmed. This tour also features Mercury delivering some of his finest live vocals in Queen's live career.\n\n==1980s==\n\n===The Game Tour===\n{{main|The Game Tour}}\n[[The Game Tour]] in 1980 coincided with Queen being at their most popular with massive sales of their latest album both inside and outside of the United States. One surprise, however, to many concert-goers was the prominent moustache that Mercury had grown. Also Mercury's stage costumes appeared to be more local and less flamboyant (e.g. T-shirts and sport shoes) than in the earlier tours. Moreover, the band, and Mercury in particular, would emphasise the funk/dance sound when performing the songs \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\" and \"[[Dragon Attack]]\" although many of their loyal hard-rock fans were rather indifferent. It is noted that a small selection of material from the [[Flash Gordon (album)|Flash Gordon]] album was also included in the play list.\n\n[[The Game Tour]] in 1981 heralded in a largely untapped frontier for live rock music. In this case, Queen embarked on a short, yet frantic, tour of South America that included a number of dates at some of the world's biggest [[football (soccer)|football]] stadiums. No major rock band had ever seriously toured this area of the globe. Queen's album sales in South America had been quite high from quite early on in the band's career which provided the main inspiration for the tour. Overall Queen played to approximately 700,000 people in the space of just 13 concerts with the show at [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil setting the world record for the biggest paying audience at 250,000 people. As a point of note, football star [[Diego Maradona]] appeared on stage with the band in [[Argentina]]. Some of the shows were filmed and the two Canadian gigs at Montreal were filmed and released as the [[We Will Rock You (video)|We Will Rock You]] video, and DVD at a later date, but sometimes referred to as just Live In Concert. In this era, Mercury appeared onstage naked except for some white pants. Producer [[Saul Swimmer]] asked Queen to wear the same clothes in both nights. The band, however, were angry with the producers, so they decided to ruin the continuity by constantly changing clothes during the course of the two nights. This was confirmed by Brian May on the Queen Rock Montreal DVD commentary.\n\nThis tour was also the last in which Queen performed without additional musicians, singers or backing track. However, the live output of all the bandmembers\u2019 microphones could be doubled in 'real-time', creating up to 32 voices. The only playback part is and has always been the opera part in Bohemian Rhapsody, where the band is offstage.\n\n===Hot Space Tour===\n{{main|Hot Space Tour}}\nThe [[Hot Space Tour]] of 1982 followed a controversial studio album. A notable concert of the tour was an open-air concert at the [[Milton Keynes]] Bowl near [[Northampton]], which was released on home video several years later. To many concert-goers, the band's sound as well as Mercury's vocal performances now had a distinctive soul/funk tone. It is worth noting that this was the tour in which Queen started employing the services of another musician, a keyboardist, on stage. Hence keyboards would become a prominent feature of Queen's live sound from this point onwards although the piano, played by Mercury, was still retained. Almost no material from this album would be played on future tours -- \"[[Staying Power]]\" saw some play early in the next tour, and only \"[[Under Pressure]]\" would become a lasting addition to the setlist. The band performed two songs live, namely \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (from The Game), along with \"Under Pressure\", on [[Saturday Night Live]] as well. Also one of the Japan gigs was filmed although it did not receive an international release. However some live footage from this Japan show, as well as some footage from an Austrian gig, is commercially available. The 'Hot Space Tour' was to be Queen's last tour in America.\n\n===The Works Tour===\n{{main|The Works Tour}}\n[[The Works Tour]] in 1984/1985 was one of Queen's largest tours and included the Brazil [[Rock in Rio]] festival\u2014in which they appeared on stage at two o'clock in the morning in front of 470,000 people during the first night and 250,000 on the second night. \nThe ''Boston Globe'' described it as a \"mesmerising performance\".<ref name=\"globe\"/> A selection of highlights of both nights was released on VHS with the title ''Queen: Live in Rio'', and was later broadcast on MTV in the US.<ref name=\"globe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_02-15-1986_-_Boston_Globe_-_Rock_in_Rio|title=Queen: Rock in Rio|publisher=Queenarchives.com|accessdate=28 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/39837/Queen-Live-in-Rio/overview |title=Queen: Live in Rio (1985)|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref> In April and May 1985, Queen completed the Works Tour with sold-out shows in Australia and Japan.<ref>Grein, Paul.

The lack of US dates is seen as peculiar given that Mercury had started living in New York around this time. The album was partially recorded in Los Angeles, and Queen had changed their US label from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]. It was rumored that a full-scale US tour would put too much strain on Mercury's voice. Both media reports (e.g. covering the Wembley Arena show) and bootleg recordings throughout the tour show that Mercury would sometimes have vocal difficulties. Usually Mercury wore leotards reminiscent of his seventies attire but, in keeping with its unconventional video, on a number of occasions he would make a cameo appearance dressed, or partly dressed, in drag when \"[[I Want to Break Free]]\" was being performed. This sometimes received a mixed reception. Audiences reproduced the synchronised hand-clapping routine that appeared in the \"Radio Ga Ga\" video during the choruses of this song. In this tour, the band brought back some of the material from their first three albums into the set-list as part of a 'flash-back' medley. Rick Parfitt from [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] also appeared on-stage with the band during one of their London gigs and [[Tony Hadley]] from [[Spandau Ballet]] appeared on-stage with the band during their only New Zealand concert.\n\nQueen were to participate in two music festivals (in 1984 and 1986) at Montreux in Switzerland, where they lip-synched a small selection of their latest material. This surprised many onlookers as the band had often spoken out strongly against this style of performance. The concerts were filmed and then broadcast to many millions of people throughout Europe. To their fans, it seemed obvious that the band, as well as some members of the audience, were dis-oriented and somewhat confused during these faked performances.\n\nThe 1984 performances in [[Sun City, North West|Sun City, South Africa]] landed the band in hot water. Many well-known acts, both before and after Queen, have played at the holiday resort in a meteor crater and were not subsequently criticised for it. The international deploration of apartheid, however, would reach a high-point shortly after the band performed. Many action groups, including a group of musicians called [[Artists United Against Apartheid]], publicly condemned Queen for their appearances at the resort. To try to calm the waters, Queen officially released a statement that they had no wish to promote racial prejudice.\n\n===Live Aid===\n{{main|Live Aid}}The performance at [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1985 is often regarded<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/8785536/Queen-their-finest-moment-at-Live-Aid.html |title=Queen: their finest moment at Live Aid |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref> as Queen's greatest single live performance. Their set lasted 21 minutes and consisted of a version of \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" (ballad section and guitar solo) slightly sped up in lyrics, \"[[Radio Ga Ga]]\", a crowd singalong, \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\", \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" (1st verse), and \"[[We Are the Champions]]\". Mercury and May returned later on to perform a version of \"[[Is This the World We Created?]]\" The band were unenthusiastic about performing when they were first approached by [[Bob Geldof]], but the acclaim they received after their performance led to them writing, collectively, the song \"[[One Vision]]\" which was then released as a single.\n\n===The Magic Tour===\n{{main|Magic Tour (Queen)}}\n[[Magic Tour (Queen)|The Magic Tour]] in 1986 was Queen's final tour with their lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and bass guitarist [[John Deacon]]. On this occasion the tour did not extend beyond Europe and included back-to-back shows at Wembley Stadium in London (where [[INXS]], [[The Alarm]] and [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] were the supporting acts) as well as one concert at Budapest in Hungary. One striking image of Mercury from the Wembley show would be regularly used for promotional purposes (e.g. the Tribute Concert posters, the memorial statue at Montreux, the cover of the [[Greatest Hits III (Queen album)|Greatest Hits III]] album, the Musical billboards). Throughout the tour, Mercury would regularly make an impromptu statement on stage that denounced the rumour that Queen were about to split up. As \"God Save the Queen\" played over the PA system at the end of each show, Mercury would come on stage wearing a cloak and a replica of the crown jewels. After this tour, Queen were credited as being one of the first rock bands to employ the oversized screen (or [[Jumbotron]]) at live concerts. Many of the shows were recorded and a heavily edited album, titled [[Live Magic]], was released shortly afterwards. Similarly the Budapest concert was released as the Live In Budapest video (released on DVD, Blu-ray and CD as Queen Hungarian Rhapsody: Live In Budapest in November 2012) and one of the Wembley concerts would be released as the [[Live at Wembley '86|Live At Wembley album/CD]] and [[Queen at Wembley|video/DVD]] many years later. The final show of the tour was held on 9 August 1986 at Knebworth Park in England (with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] as support act) and drew an estimated 200,000 in attendance.\n\nShortly after the completion of The Magic Tour, a three-video rockumentary was released called ''The Magic Years'' which had footage from various live shows. Following on from this, a compilation of entirely live material was released by way of the ''Rare Live \u2013 A Concert Through Time and Space'' video. However neither of these have been re-released on DVD to date. The last albums to be released while Mercury was still alive were ''[[The Miracle (album)|The Miracle]]'' (1989), ''[[Innuendo (album)|Innuendo]]'' (1991), and ''[[Greatest Hits II (Queen album)|Greatest Hits II]]'' (1991) and no tours were planned. According to the ''Mercury and Me'' book,<ref>Jim Hutton and Tim Waspshott. ''Mercury and Me.'' Bloomsbury, 1994. {{ISBN|0-7475-1922-6}}</ref> Mercury was diagnosed with [[AIDS]] in the year following The Magic Tour (i.e. 1987) which may explain why they stopped touring so abruptly. However Taylor did form a band called [[The Cross (band)|The Cross]], that went on to release three studio albums, who performed a number of live concerts with Taylor adopting the role of lead vocalist and [[rhythm guitar]]ist not drummer. No live recordings were ever released although some bootlegs do exist.\n\n==1990s==\nQueen did not perform any concerts in their original line-up in the 1990s. After Freddie Mercury's death in November 1991, Queen organised [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] and took place in April 1992 at Wembley Stadium. The three remaining members (in one of the few concerts they played together after Mercury's death) and a host of special guests staged a lengthy and emotional show billed as the Concert For AIDS Awareness (as well as Concert for Life) that was televised worldwide. Queen appeared only sporadically following the concert. Not all appearances featured all three surviving members. The final occasion where all remaining members of Queen performed on stage was in January 1997 at Paris in France for the world premiere of Bejart Ballet For Life. Joining the surviving trio were [[Spike Edney]] on keyboards/backing-vocals and [[Elton John]] who sang lead vocals. They only performed one song, namely \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" which was one of the two songs they had performed together at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, and this was the last reported appearance of John Deacon on stage.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date<ref name=\"queenconcerts.com\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.queenconcerts.com/live/queen/postfreddie.html |title=Queen live concertography: Brian + Roger + ? |publisher=Queen Concerts |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}</ref>\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Venue\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Notes\n|-\n|20 April 1992\n|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Wembley Stadium\n|[[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]\n|-\n|18 August 1993\n|Midhurst\n|Cowdray Park\n|Festival appearance, featured only Taylor and Deacon\n|-\n|17 January 1997\n|Paris\n|France\n|Theatre National de Chaillot\n|Queen + [[Elton John]], last appearance of John Deacon\n|-\n|25 November 1999\n|London\n|England\n|Brixton Academy\n|May and Taylor appearance at a [[Foo Fighters]] concert\n|}\n\n==2000s==\n\nFollowing Freddie Mercury's death and John Deacon's retirement, May and Taylor continued to make sporadic live appearances in addition to their long-term collaboration with [[Paul Rodgers]].\n\n'''One-off performances'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date<ref name=\"queenconcerts.com\"/>\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:250px;\"|Venue\n! style=\"width:300px;\"|Notes\n|-\n|9 July 2000\n|rowspan=\"2\"|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Hyde Park\n|Queen + [[Five (band)|Five]]\n|-\n|27 September 2000\n|Millennium Dome\n|Queen + Five\n|-\n|19 March 2001\n|New York\n|United States\n|Waldorf Astoria Hotel\n|[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Induction\n|-\n|24 November 2001\n|London\n|England\n|Ocean Club\n|Fan Club concert for 10th anniversary of Mercuy's death\n|-\n|30 April 2002\n|Amsterdam\n|The Netherlands\n|Museum Square\n|Birthday party for Dutch Queen\n|-\n|14 May 2002\n|rowspan=\"2\"|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Astoria Theater\n|With the cast of ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''\n|-\n|3 June 2002\n|Buckingham Palace\n|Queen's Jubilee\n|-\n|18 October 2002\n|Los Angeles\n|United States\n|Club 1650\n|\n|-\n|16 November 2002\n|rowspan=\"2\"|London\n|rowspan=\"2\"|England\n|Children in Need\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|14 May 2003\n|Billingsgate Market\n|\n|-\n|27 May 2003\n|Modena\n|Italy\n|Parco Novi Sad\n|With [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and [[Zucchero Fornaciari]]\n|-\n|12 June 2003\n|New York\n|United States\n|Marriott Marquis Hotel\n|Songwriter's Hall of Fame Induction\n|-\n|7 August 2003\n|Melbourne\n|Australia\n|Regent Theatre\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|29 November 2003\n|Cape Town\n|South Africa\n|Green Point Stadium\n|46664 charity concert\n|-\n|8 September 2004\n|Las Vegas\n|United States\n|Paris Hotel\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|9 October 2004\n|Sydney\n|Australia\n|Lyric Theatre\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|16 October 2004\n|Moscow\n|Russia\n|State Kremlin Palace\n|Russian Music Awards, with the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|11 November 2004\n|London\n|England\n|Hackney Empire\n|Hall of Fame Induction\n|-\n|12 December 2004\n|Cologne\n|Germany\n|Flora\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|12 January 2005\n|rowspan=\"3\"|London\n|rowspan=\"3\"|England\n|Dominion Theatre\n|With the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|-\n|17 June 2006\n|Hyde Park\n|Appearance at a Foo Fighters concert\n|-\n|5 September 2006\n|Dominion Theatre\n|Freddie Mercury 60th birthday celebration, with the cast of ''We Will Rock You''\n|}\n\n===Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour===\n[[File:Queenpaulkoeln.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Queen + Paul Rodgers performing at Cologne on 6 July 2005 during their European Tour.]] [[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Brian May performing during the tour.]]\n{{Main article|Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour}}\n'''Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour''' was a world [[concert tour]] by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] lead guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], joined by singer [[Paul Rodgers]] under the moniker of [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]]. The tour was Queen's first since [[Magic Tour (Queen)|The Magic Tour]] in 1986, and the death of lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] in November 1991.<ref name=\"Guardian\">[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/05/arts.artsnews1 Queen most loved band] The Guardian. Retrieved 3 August 2011</ref> Roger Taylor commented; \"We never thought we would tour again, Paul (Rodgers) came along by chance and we seemed to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Bass guitarist [[John Deacon]] also did not take part due to his retirement in 1997, however he gave the enterprise his blessing.\n\nThe origins of the collaboration came when Brian May played at the [[The Strat Pack|Fender Strat Pack]] concert in 2004. Now for the first time, he joined Paul Rodgers for a rendition of [[Free (band)|Free's]] classic, \"[[All Right Now]]\". After this Brian spoke of a chemistry between the two of them. Following this, Brian invited Paul to play with Queen at their induction to the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]]. Again citing a new excitement with Rodgers, the three announced they would tour in 2005. The tour originally was meant only to include Europe and the [[46664 (concerts)|46664 concerts]] of that year. However at the end of the European tour, some dates in the US and Japan were added. In 2006, a full scale US tour was undertaken, with very poor attendance.\n\nThe stage design for the tour was minimal, lacking a large backing screen that would later be featured on the [[Rock The Cosmos Tour]], and elaborate stage theatrics. A large 'B Stage' was constructed out from the main stage, into the audience which would frequently be used for acoustic performances by all the members of the band. The show began with the [[Eminem]] song \"[[Lose Yourself]]\" being played over the PA system, and a dance-theme remix of the Queen song [[Made In Heaven|It's A Beautiful Day]]. Toward the end of [[Lose Yourself]], the guitar would join in from behind a large curtain which covered the band from view, before Rodgers would appear singing a shortened version of the song \"Reachin' Out\". Thought by many fans to be a new song, it was a charity song that both Brian and Paul had played together on in the 1990s. Brian would appear after, playing the introductory riff to \"Tie Your Mother Down\", before the curtain fell and the band would perform the full song.\n\nThe first segment of the concert consisted largely of Queen hits and some of Rodgers' songs. To introduce \"Fat Bottomed Girls\", Brian would play the introductory riff from the earlier Queen song \"White Man\". Rodgers often played a muted steel string guitar on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\". An acoustic section would follow, Taylor leaving the kit at times to sing \"Say It's Not True\" on the B-Stage, while Brian would play acoustic Queen songs such as \"Love of My Life\" and \"39\". A unique version of \"Hammer To Fall\" would be played, which featured a slower and mellower first verse sung by May and Rodgers. The second half of the song would be played as a full band, depending on the condition of his voice, Rodgers would also sing this section, or leave it to Taylor. Taylor would often play an intricate cover of Sandy Nelson drum instrumental \"Let There Be Drums\", followed by a performance of \"I'm In Love With My Car\", with Taylor taking lead vocals and the drum parts.\n\nA guitar solo by May would follow, with a band instrumental of \"Last Horizon\" playing, in which a large mirror ball was used. During the second half of the concert, Taylor would leave the kit to sing \"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\", with a screen playing nostalgic footage, including shots of the band on their early tours in Japan. \"Radio GaGa\" would follow, with Taylor singing the first and second verses, with drum samples from the studio version controlled by Edney. Rodgers would take the rest of the song, with Taylor playing live drums for the rest of the song. During \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Freddie's vocal and piano part, along with video footage from Queen's 1986 show at Wembley Stadium would be used, while the rest of the band would play live music. After the operatic section, Rodgers would sing the heavy part, while the closing lines of the song would be an interchanging duet between Rodgers and Mercury. The song would end with Mercury taking a bow to the crowd, and the band would leave the stage. For the encore, a largely rigid line up of \"The Show Must Go On\", \"All Right Now\", \"We Will Rock You\" and \"We Are The Champions\" would be played, before the band would leave the stage, Taylor throwing his drumsticks into the audience.\n\n===Rock The Cosmos Tour===\n{{Main article|Rock the Cosmos Tour}}\nThe '''Rock The Cosmos Tour''' was the second and final [[concert tour]] by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]], promoting their first and only studio album \"[[The Cosmos Rocks]]\".

He was the first general manager of the Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company Limited, formed in 1908. Nee Soon and Company was formed in 1911.\n\nNee Soon was one of the pioneers that opened up [[Sembawang]]. He served on the Rural Board from 1913 to 1921 and was also appointed a [[Justice]] of [[Peace]]. In the field of education, he was one of the [[wiktionary:Founder|founder]]s of [[The Chinese High School|Chinese High School]] and was a member of the Raffles College Committee. Nee Soon Road was officially named in 1950 by the Rural Board to facilitate [[Mail|postal services]]. Several roads in Yishun are named after his business concerns and family members. Nee Soon was a leading member of the [[Teochew people|Teochew]] clan association ''poit ip huay kwan'', and a close friend of Dr [[Sun Yat Sen]].\n\nThe name ''Nee Soon'' was one of those changed at the height of the campaign to replace [[dialect]] names with Mandarin ones. While the government later revoked some of its decisions and reinstated names like [[Bukit Panjang]] (for Zhenghua), Yishun remained unchanged and is now the name attached to streets, roads, parks and many amenities.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of Yishun started in 1976 with the first HDB apartments being built at the Chong Pang area. Yishun Neighbourhood 1 was developed in 1981, followed by Neighbourhood 7 and Neighbourhood 2. Neighbourhood 6, 8 and 9 were developed in 1987, together with the Town Centre. Neighbourhood 3 and 4 followed slightly later in 1992. Construction of Neighbourhood 5 was started in 2009 and was completed in 2015. Within the Yishun vicinity, 8 of its neighbourhoods are allocated for construction of HDB apartments namely Yishun Neighbourhood 1 (Yishun North), Yishun Neighbourhood 2 (Taman Yishun), Yishun Neighbourhoods 3, 4 and 5 (Yishun East), Yishun Neighbourhood 6 and 9 (Yishun Central), Yishun Neighbourhood 7 (Yishun West), and Yishun Neighbourhood 8 (Yishun South).\n\nYishun planning areas contain the subzones of Yishun South, Yishun West, Northland, Yishun East, Nee Soon, Springleaf, Lower Seletar, Khatib and Yishun Central. \n\nSpringleaf and Nee Soon subzones are private housing estates in Yishun.\n\n==Amenities==\n\n===Shopping Malls===\n\n*[[Northpoint City, Singapore|Northpoint City]] - The largest shopping mall in the North, it is located beside [[Yishun MRT station]]. Previously known as Northpoint Shopping Centre, it underwent its first expansion which was completed in 2010. It included a new building connected to the main shopping mall built on a plot of land next to it. The expansion increased the square footage of Northpoint Shopping Centre and had more shops as well. Additionally, Yishun community library moved to its new location, at the top floor of Northpoint Shopping Centre. The shopping centre was opened in 1992 making it the first modern sub-urban mall in a major housing estate (new town). Currently, sub-urban malls are almost a standard feature in all housing estates.  Northpoint Shopping Centre was then renamed Northpoint Ciiy. After undergoing a massive expansion, it is the first shopping mall in Singapore which includes an Integrated Transport Hub (ITH), a condominium called North Park Residences, a Yishun Public library, connection to Yishun MRT station and Nee Soon Central community club. The latest expansion brings the number of shops and restaurants to 500. \n\n*[[GV Yishun]] - The first Golden Village Cinema opened in May 1992, it was then the largest multiplex with the most screens (10 in all) in Asia.

A typical \"heartland\" neighbourhood centre would consist of stores such as provision stores, eateries (commonly called coffee shops), supermarket chains, mini-marts, clinics, local banks, and salons. In the last few decades, fast food outlets like McDonald's as well as pharmacies have opened in these areas.\n*Yishun Park Hawker Centre - Operated by the Timbre Group, the Yishun Park Hawker Centre at Yishun Avenue 11 opened on 20th Sep 2017.

Eventually, the [[Visigoths]] would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula, including the [[Spania|Byzantine province of Spania]], into the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which more or less unified politically, ecclesiastically and legally all the former Roman provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as [[Hispania]].\n\nIn the early eighth century the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Islamic Caliphate]], that arrived to the peninsula in the year 711. The Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula ([[al-Andalus]]) soon became autonomous from Baghdad. The handful of small Christian pockets in the north left out of Muslim rule, along the presence of the [[Carolingian Empire]] near the Pyreneean range, would eventually led to the emergence of the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. Along seven centuries, an intermittent southwards expansion of the latter kingdoms (metahistorically dubbed as a reconquest: the ''[[Reconquista]]'') took place, culminating with the Christian seizure of the last Muslim polity (the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]]) in 1492, the same year Christopher Columbus arrived in the [[New World]]. A process of political conglomeration among the Christian kingdoms also ensued, and the late 15th-century saw the dynastic union of Castile and Aragon under the [[Catholic Monarchs]], sometimes considered as the point of emergence of Spain as unified country. The [[Conquest of Navarre]] would take in 1512, while [[Iberian Union|the Kingdom of Portugal was also ruled by the Hapsburg Dynasty]] between 1580 and 1640.\n\nIn the early modern period, Spain ruled [[Spanish Empire|one of the largest empires in history]] which was also one of the first global empires, leaving a large cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 570 million [[Hispanophone]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2017/noticias/Presentaci%C3%B3n-Anuario-2017.htm|title=572 millones de personas hablan espa\u00f1ol, cinco millones m\u00e1s que hace un a\u00f1o, y aumentar\u00e1n a 754 millones a mediados de siglo|website=www.cervantes.es}}</ref> making Spanish the world's [[List of languages by number of native speakers|second-most spoken native language]], after Mandarin Chinese.

After an [[Roman conquest of Hispania|arduous conquest]], the peninsula came fully under [[Hispania|Roman rule]]. During the early Middle Ages it came under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] rule, and then much of it was conquered by [[Muslim]] invaders from [[North Africa]].

The last Muslim state [[Fall of Granada|fell in 1492]], the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A [[Spanish Empire|global empire]] began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for a century and a half, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.\n\nContinued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The [[Peninsular War|Napoleonic conflict in Spain]] led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Spain suffered a devastating [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]] in the 1930s and then came under the rule of an [[Francoist Spain|authoritarian government]], which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually democracy was [[Spanish transition to democracy|restored]] in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.

These tribes had crossed the [[Rhine]] in early 407 and ravaged [[Gaul]].

As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.\n\n[[File:Corona de (29049230050).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Votive crown]] of [[Reccesuinth]] from the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]]]]\nThe [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia.

These [[Visigoths]], or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed. [[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.\n\n[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554). [[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Recared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589).

The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]].

In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal.

These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nSpain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens ([[Peninsulars]]) over those born overseas ([[Criollo people|Criollos]]) and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|re-assert control]] proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|army revolts]] followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n[[File:Barcelona, proclamaci\u00f3n de la rep\u00fablica, aspecto de la plaza de San Jaime en la ma\u00f1ana del 21 de febrero, de Pellicer.jpg|thumb|left|Proclamation of the [[First Spanish Republic]] in Barcelona, 1873.

In the 1830s and 1840s Anti-liberal forces known as [[Carlism|Carlists]] fought against liberals in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]], a more stable [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchic period began]] characterised by the practice of ''turnismo'' (the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government).\n\n[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in Barcelona after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] events in 1909]]\n\nIn the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the United States became involved. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]] who were conducting an analysis of the country.\n\nAlthough the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonisation of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It remained neutral during World War I (see [[Spain in World War I]]). The heavy losses suffered during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.\n\n=== Second Republic ===\n{{Main|Second Spanish Republic}}\n[[File:01 eibar.jpg|thumb|right|Women were granted the right to vote for the first time in Spain during the Second Republic.]]\n[[File:Column of Guardias Civiles during the 1934 Asturian Revolution, Bra\u00f1osera.jpg|thumb|Arrested miners during the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]] in [[Bra\u00f1osera]]]]\nAfter a period of dictatorship during the governments of Generals [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]] and Admiral [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as|Aznar-Caba\u00f1as]] (1923\u20131931), the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931 Spanish local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councillors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government.\n\nA [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931 Spanish general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] supported by republican parties and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. The violent acts during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'\u00e9tat led by Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms in order to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation or [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].\n\nOn 17 July and 18, 1936, part of the military [[Spanish coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'\u00e9tat]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]], and the other controlled by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], most critically supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]. General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels in the Autumn of 1936. An uneasy relation between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who maintained a partial [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Social revolution]] also ensued.\n\n=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Francoist Spain}}\n[[File:Belchite - Vista general01.JPG|thumb|left|250px|After being destroyed, the village of [[Belchite]] was not rebuilt and remains as a monument.]]\n\nThe Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936.

It has two varieties: ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n** The ''Csa'' zone is associated to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country. The ''Csa'' zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which K\u00f6ppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.\n** The ''Csb'' zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile\u2013Le\u00f3n]], northeastern [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and northern [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]) and into much rainier areas (notably [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.\n* The [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', ''BSh''), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley, which crosses southern [[Navarre]], central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.\n* The [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Cantabria, [[Asturias]], and partly Galicia and Castile\u2013Le\u00f3n). Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico|Iberian System]] and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (''Cfa'') also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.\n\nApart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the [[alpine climate]] in areas with very high altitude, the [[humid subtropical climate]] in areas of northeastern Spain and the [[continental climate]]s (''Dfc'', ''Dfb'' / ''Dsc'', ''Dsb'') in the [[Pyrenees]] as well as parts of the [[Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica|Cantabrian Range]], the [[Sistema Central|Central System]], [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico|Iberian System]], and a typical [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', ''BWh'') in the zone of Almer\u00eda, Murcia and eastern [[Canary Islands]]. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} during their coldest month, thus having a [[tropical climate]].\n\n=== Fauna and flora ===\n[[File:Iberian Wolf AdF 001.jpg|thumb|The [[Iberian wolf]] in [[Castile and Leon]]. The region has the 25% of the land covered by [[Natura 2000]] protected natural spaces.]]\n{{main|Wildlife of Spain}}\n\nThe [[fauna]] presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and [[Eurasia]], and the great diversity of habitats and [[biotopes]], the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.\n\nThe vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief, the climate and [[latitude]].

Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the ''comarques'' (sing. ''comarca'') and the ''vegueries'' (sing. ''vegueria'') both of which have administrative powers; ''comarques'' being aggregations of municipalities, and the ''vegueries'' being aggregations of ''comarques''. The concept of a ''comarca'' exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.\n\n==== Autonomous communities ====\n{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}\n{{See also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}\n{{Autonomous regions of Spain|float=right}}\n\nSpain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the \"[[nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions of Spain]]\".<ref>Article 143 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2</ref> The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits. This territorial organisation, based on [[devolution]], is literally known in Spain as the \"State of Autonomies\".\n\nThe basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Chapter 3. Autonomous Communities. 147th Article]. ''Spanish Constitution of 1978''. Retrieved 10 December 2007</ref>\n\nThe governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers and comprise\n* a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by [[universal suffrage]] according to the system of [[proportional representation]] and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;\n* a government council, with executive and administrative functions headed by a president, elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];\n* a supreme court, under the supreme court of Spain, which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community.\n\nCatalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as ''nationalities'', were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |title=Estatut |language=es |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021746/http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009}}</ref> the Canary Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html#pre |title=Nuevo Estatuto de Autonom\u00eda de Canarias |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |accessdate=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120074716/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html |archivedate=20 January 2011}}</ref> the Balearic Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |title=BOCAe32.QXD |language=ca |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711090828/http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2009}}</ref> and Aragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |title=Estatuto de Autonom\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n |publisher=Narros.congreso.es |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211225055/http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |archivedate=11 December 2009  }}</ref>\n\nThe autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities\u2014the Basque Country and Navarre\u2014have full fiscal autonomy. Beyond fiscal autonomy, the ''nationalities''\u2014Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia\u2014were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: [[Ertzaintza]], [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Polic\u00eda Foral]] respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the ''Polic\u00eda Aut\u00f3noma Andaluza''<ref name=\"cartujo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|title=Unidad de Polic\u00eda de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Andaluc\u00eda|publisher=Cartujo.org|accessdate=23 October 2007|language=es|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107145807/http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|archivedate=7 November 2007}}</ref> in [[Andalusia]] or the [[BESCAM]] in Madrid.\n\nNonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the ''nationalities'' and the rest of the regions.\n\nFinally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.\n\n==== Provinces and municipalities ====\n{{Main|Provinces of Spain|Municipalities of Spain}}\n\nAutonomous communities are divided into [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are divided into [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]]. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Articles 140 and 141]. Spanish Constitution of 1978</ref>\n\nThe current provincial division structure is based\u2014with minor changes\u2014on the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|1833 territorial division]] by [[Javier de Burgos]], and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Spain}}\n[[File:Presidenta de la Rep\u00fablica asisti\u00f3 a la inauguraci\u00f3n de la XXIV Cumbre Iberoamerican (15368470204).jpg|thumb|The [[Ibero-American Summit]], in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], 2014]]\nAfter the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, Spain's [[foreign policy]] priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco years]] and expand [[diplomatic relations]], enter the [[European Union|European Community]], and define security relations with the West.\n\nAs a member of [[NATO]] since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities.

The island lies {{convert|250|m|ft}} just off the coast of Morocco, {{convert|8|km|mi}} from [[Ceuta]] and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.\n\nBesides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and [[Melilla]] and the ''[[plazas de soberan\u00eda]]'' islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]] which was annexed by Spain in 1801 after the [[War of the Oranges]].

Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (''secano''), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (''regad\u00edo'') accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in [[Province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]]\u2014one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain\u2014of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.\n\n[[File:Vi\u00f1edos en Bri\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|A [[vineyard]] in [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]]]\n\nThough only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40\u201345% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in [[maize|corn]], [[fruit tree]]s, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, [[legume]]s, [[olive tree]]s, mangos, [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and [[fodder]] grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.\n\n[[Citrus fruit]]s, vegetables, [[cereal grain]]s, [[olive oil]], and wine\u2014Spain's traditional agricultural products\u2014continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and [[dairy product]]s. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did [[sunflower seed oil]] that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]].\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Spain}}\n[[File:Benidorm - Playa de Poniente 26.jpg|thumb|[[Benidorm]], one of Europe's largest coastal tourist destinations]]\n\nIn 2017, Spain was the second most visited country in the world, recording 82 million tourists which marked the fifth consecutive year of record-beating numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/gobierno/news/Paginas/2018/20180110_balancetourist17.aspx |title=Spain posts record number of 82 million inbound tourists in 2017 |date=10 January 2018 |accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref> The headquarters of the [[World Tourism Organization]] are located in Madrid.\n\nSpain's geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture, and excellent infrastructure has made the country's international tourist industry among the largest in the world.

The Valencian chivalric romance [[Tirant lo Blanch]] written in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] is also remarkable.\n\nOther major plays from the medieval times were ''[[Mester de Juglar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Mester de Clerec\u00eda]]'', ''[[Coplas por la muerte de su padre]]'' or ''[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (The Book of Good Love).\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] the major plays are ''[[La Celestina]]'' and ''[[El Lazarillo de Tormes]]'', while many religious literature was created with poets as [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[San Juan de la Cruz]], [[Santa Teresa de Jes\u00fas]], etc.\n\nThe [[Baroque]] is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The famous ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de La Mancha]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] or [[Tirso de Molina]].\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] we find names such as [[Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn]], [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] or [[Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn]].\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Emilia Pardo Bazan (1896).jpg\n| width1    = 118\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Mar\u00eda Zambrano ca. 1918.JPG\n| width2    = 117\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Rodoreda.jpg\n| width3    = 113\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n| footer    = [[Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n]], [[Mar\u00eda Zambrano]] and [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]]\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nDuring the [[Romanticism]], [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]] created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in [[Don Juan Tenorio]].

Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general \"Realism\", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.\n\nThe group that has become known as the [[Generation of 1898]] was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The \"Disaster\" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ''Regeneracionismo''. For a group of younger writers, among them [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[P\u00edo Baroja]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz]] (Azor\u00edn), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], and \u00c1ngel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda del Valle Incl\u00e1n, de Audouard.jpg\n| width1    = 129\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Photo of Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s.jpg\n| width2    = 88\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca.

The next supposed \"generation\" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914\u2014the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]\u2014a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.\n\nLeading voices include the poet [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]], the academics and essayists [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], [[Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]], [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]], [[Maria Zambrano]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Clara Campoamor]] and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Mir\u00f3, [[Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala]], and [[Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna]]. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the [[College of Europe]] and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the [[Liberal International]].\n\nThe Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]]. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ''regeneracionistas'' and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.\n[[File:Miguel Delibes (d\u00e9cada de 1960) - 4.tif|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Miguel Delibes]] ([[Valle de Sedano]] in 1960), describes the situation of rural Spain after the [[Rural flight]] in the 1950s.]]\nThe two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]] and [[Miguel Delibes]] from [[Generation of '36]]. Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and with Latin American laureates they made the Spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all. The Spanish writers are: [[Jos\u00e9 Echegaray]], [[Jacinto Benavente]], [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]] and [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]]. The Portuguese writer [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. Saramago was also well known by his [[Iberism|Iberist]] ideas.\n\nThe [[Generation of '50]] are also known as the children of the civil war. [[Rosa Chacel]], [[Gloria Fuertes]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite]], [[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]], [[Juan Mars\u00e9]], [[Blas de Otero]], [[Gabriel Celaya]], [[Antonio Gamoneda]], [[Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio]] or [[Ignacio Aldecoa]].\n\n[[Premio Planeta de Novela]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] was a philosopher residing in Spain during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nDuring [[Al-Andalus]], Muslim, Jewish and Christian philosophies flourished, also [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].\n\nIn the Middle Ages [[Ramon Llull]] flourished in Spain.\n\nHumanist [[Luis Vives]] worked in Spain during the [[Renaissance]], as did [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (creator of the [[School of Salamanca]] and scholar on [[international law]]) and [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]].\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain arrived later and was less strong than in other European countries, but during the [[XIX century]] liberal ideas arrived in Spanish society. At the end of the century, socialist and libertarian ideas also flourished, with thinkers such as [[Francisco Pi i Margall]], [[Ricardo Mella]] and [[Francisco Ferrer Guardia]].\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century among the most prominent philosophers were [[Maria Zambrano]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]].\n\nContemporary philosophers include [[Fernando Savater]] and [[Adela Cortina]], creator of the term ''[[aporophobia]]''.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Spanish art}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Las Meninas, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg\n| width1    = 126\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| footer    = ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]\n| footer_align = left\n| valign    = middle\n}}\nArtists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and [[Hispanic America|American]] [[art movement|artistic movements]]. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]], is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque|Spanish Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]], [[Herrerian]] architecture or the [[Isabelline Gothic]].\n\nDuring the [[Golden Age]] painters working in Spain included [[El Greco]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Ribera]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]]. Also in the Baroque period [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and ''[[Las Hilanderas (Vel\u00e1zquez)|Las Hilanderas]]''.\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] painted during a historical period that includes the [[Peninsular War|Spanish Independence War]], the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the rise of contemporary nations-states.\n\n[[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla]] is a well-known modern impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]].\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n[[File:Chillida-peine.jpg|thumb|''The Comb of the Wind'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]] in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]]]\n\nThe Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. [[Alonso Berruguete]] ([[Valladolid]] School) is called the \"Prince of Spanish sculpture\". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa \u00darsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolom\u00e9 Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], [[Diego de Silo\u00e9]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Dami\u00e0 Forment|Dami\u00e1n Forment]].\n\nThere were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]] belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.\n\nOther notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Rold\u00e1n]] and his daughter [[Luisa Rold\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]]. In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], and [[Pablo Serrano]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema of Spain}}\n[[File:Pedro Almodovar and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] and [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] in [[Oviedo]] ([[Princess of Asturias Awards]])]]\n\nSpanish cinema has achieved major international success including [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for recent films such as ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' and ''[[Volver]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Barry|first2=Rikki |last2=Morgan-Tamosunas|author-link2=Rikki Morgan-Tamosunas|title=Contemporary spanish cinema|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1998}}</ref> In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] was the first to achieve world recognition, followed by [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] in the 1980s ([[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a]]). [[Mario Camus]] and [[Pilar Mir\u00f3]] worked together in [[Curro Jim\u00e9nez]].\n\nSpanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]], [[Flori\u00e1n Rey]], [[Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Julio Medem]], [[Isabel Coixet]], [[Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar]], [[Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn]] and brothers [[David Trueba]] and [[Fernando Trueba]].\n\nActresses [[Sara Montiel]] and [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] or actor [[Antonio Banderas]] are among those who have become [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] stars.\n\nInternational Film Festivals of [[Seminci|Valladolid]] and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian]] are the oldest and more relevant in Spain.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Spanish architecture}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Hemispheric - Valencia, Spain - Jan 2007.jpg\n| width1    = 230\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Casacolgantecuenca.jpg\n| width2    = 97\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| footer    = The modern Hemispheric at the [[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies]] in Valencia and [[Hanging houses of Cuenca]]\n| footer_align = left\n| valign    = middle\n}}\n\nDue to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive [[Roman era]] infrastructure, [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic [[Umayyad dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Cruz|title=Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other|editor= David R. Blanks  |editor2=Michael Frassetto|location=New York|publisher=Saint Martin's Press|year=1999|page=56}}</ref> Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]], which built its famed palace complex in [[Granada]].\n\nSimultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a [[pre-Romanesque]] style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] streams. There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.\n\nThe arrival of [[Modernism]] in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in [[Barcelona]], known as [[modernisme]], produced a number of important architects, of which [[Gaud\u00ed]] is one. The [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] was led by groups like [[GATEPAC]]. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in [[contemporary architecture]] and [[:Category:Spanish architects|Spanish architects]] like [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Ricardo Bofill]] as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{Main|Music of Spain}}\n[[File:Belen maya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Flamenco]] is an Andalusian artistic form that evolved from the [[Seguidilla]].]]\n\nSpanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with [[flamenco]], a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of [[folk music]] abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.\n\nIn the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Enrique Granados]] and singers and performers such as [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]], [[Alicia de Larrocha]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Ricardo Vi\u00f1es]], [[Jos\u00e9 Iturbi]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Teresa Berganza]].

It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep [[Mediterranean]] roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:\n\n'''''Mediterranean''''' Spain \u2013 all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia \u2013 heavy use of seafood, such as ''pesca\u00edto frito'' (fried fish); several cold soups like ''[[gazpacho]]''; and many rice-based dishes like ''[[paella]]'' from Valencia<ref name=\"paella\" /> and ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'' (black rice) from Catalonia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |title=Spain Gain at Mercat Negre |work=The Village Voice |date=1 December 2009 |last=DiGregorio |first=Sarah |location=New York |accessdate=6 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208050334/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |archivedate=8 December 2009  }}</ref>\n\n'''''Inner''''' Spain \u2013 Castile \u2013 hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based ''Castilian soup'', along with substantial stews such as ''[[cocido madrile\u00f1o]]''.

Also, the lightly cured ''[[Lac\u00f3n Gallego|lac\u00f3n]]'' ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, as in the Basque-style [[cod]], [[albacore]] or [[anchovy]] or the Galician octopus-based ''[[polbo \u00e1 feira]]'' and shellfish dishes.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Spain}}\n[[File:Barcelona-1992-rr-800.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona]]\n\nWhile varieties of football have been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. [[Real Madrid C.F.]] and [[FC Barcelona]] are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. [[Spain national football team|The country's national football team]] won the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], and is the first team ever to win three back-to-back major international tournaments.\n\n[[Basketball]], [[tennis]], cycling, [[team handball|handball]], [[Spain national futsal team|futsal]], [[motorcycling]] and, lately, [[Formula One]] also can boast of Spanish champions. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] that were hosted in [[Barcelona]], which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for [[water sports]], [[golf]] and [[skiing]]. In their respective regions, the traditional games of [[Basque pelota]] and [[Valencian pilota]] both are popular.\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Spain|Fiestas of International Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain}}\n[[File:Encierro en la calle Mercaderes.jpg|thumb|[[San Ferm\u00edn]] festival, [[Pamplona]]]]\n\nPublic holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious ([[Roman Catholic]]), national and regional observances.

Some of them are known worldwide, and every year millions of people from all over the world go to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is [[San Ferm\u00edn]], in [[Pamplona]]. While its most famous event is the ''encierro'', or the [[running of the bulls]], which happens at 8:00&nbsp;am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.\n\nOther festivals include: [[La Tomatina]] tomato festival in [[Bu\u00f1ol]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the carnivals in the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Falles]] in [[Valencia]] or the [[Holy Week]] in Andalusia and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spain}}\n* [[Outline of Spain]]\n* {{Books-inline|Spain}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[[Raymond Carr|Carr, Raymond]], ed.

Eventually, the [[Visigoths]] would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula, including the [[Spania|Byzantine province of Spania]], into the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], which more or less unified politically, ecclesiastically and legally all the former Roman provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as [[Hispania]].\n\nIn the early eighth century the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Islamic Caliphate]], that arrived to the peninsula in the year 711. The Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula ([[al-Andalus]]) soon became autonomous from Baghdad. The handful of small Christian pockets in the north left out of Muslim rule, along the presence of the [[Carolingian Empire]] near the Pyreneean range, would eventually led to the emergence of the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. Along seven centuries, an intermittent southwards expansion of the latter kingdoms (metahistorically dubbed as a reconquest: the ''[[Reconquista]]'') took place, culminating with the Christian seizure of the last Muslim polity (the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]]) in 1492, the same year Christopher Columbus arrived in the [[New World]]. A process of political conglomeration among the Christian kingdoms also ensued, and the late 15th-century saw the dynastic union of Castile and Aragon under the [[Catholic Monarchs]], sometimes considered as the point of emergence of Spain as unified country. The [[Conquest of Navarre]] would take in 1512, while [[Iberian Union|the Kingdom of Portugal was also ruled by the Hapsburg Dynasty]] between 1580 and 1640.\n\nIn the early modern period, Spain ruled [[Spanish Empire|one of the largest empires in history]] which was also one of the first global empires, leaving a large cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 570 million [[Hispanophone]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2017/noticias/Presentaci%C3%B3n-Anuario-2017.htm|title=572 millones de personas hablan espa\u00f1ol, cinco millones m\u00e1s que hace un a\u00f1o, y aumentar\u00e1n a 754 millones a mediados de siglo|website=www.cervantes.es}}</ref> making Spanish the world's [[List of languages by number of native speakers|second-most spoken native language]], after Mandarin Chinese.

As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.\n\n[[File:Corona de (29049230050).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|[[Votive crown]] of [[Reccesuinth]] from the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]]]]\nThe [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia.

[[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed. [[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.\n\n[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554).

[[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Recared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589).

The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]].

In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal.

These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nSpain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens ([[Peninsulars]]) over those born overseas ([[Criollo people|Criollos]]) and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|re-assert control]] proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|army revolts]] followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n[[File:Barcelona, proclamaci\u00f3n de la rep\u00fablica, aspecto de la plaza de San Jaime en la ma\u00f1ana del 21 de febrero, de Pellicer.jpg|thumb|left|Proclamation of the [[First Spanish Republic]] in Barcelona, 1873.

In the 1830s and 1840s Anti-liberal forces known as [[Carlism|Carlists]] fought against liberals in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]], a more stable [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchic period began]] characterised by the practice of ''turnismo'' (the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government).\n\n[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in Barcelona after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] events in 1909]]\n\nIn the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the United States became involved. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]] who were conducting an analysis of the country.\n\nAlthough the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonisation of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It remained neutral during World War I (see [[Spain in World War I]]). The heavy losses suffered during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.\n\n=== Second Republic ===\n{{Main|Second Spanish Republic}}\n[[File:01 eibar.jpg|thumb|right|Women were granted the right to vote for the first time in Spain during the Second Republic.]]\n[[File:Column of Guardias Civiles during the 1934 Asturian Revolution, Bra\u00f1osera.jpg|thumb|Arrested miners during the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]] in [[Bra\u00f1osera]]]]\nAfter a period of dictatorship during the governments of Generals [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]] and Admiral [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as|Aznar-Caba\u00f1as]] (1923\u20131931), the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the [[1931 Spanish local elections|12 April 1931 municipal elections]]. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councillors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government.\n\nA [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|constitution]] for the country was passed in October 1931 following the [[1931 Spanish general election|June 1931 Constituent general election]], and a series of cabinets presided by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] supported by republican parties and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. The violent acts during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|1932 failed coup d'\u00e9tat led by Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms in order to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation or [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]].\n\nOn 17 July and 18, 1936, part of the military [[Spanish coup of July 1936|carried out a coup d'\u00e9tat]] that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]], in which the territory was divided into two zones: one [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|under the authority of the Republican government]], that counted on outside support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]], and the other controlled by the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist rebels]], most critically supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]. General [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels in the Autumn of 1936. An uneasy relation between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who maintained a partial [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Social revolution]] also ensued.\n\n=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Francoist Spain}}\n[[File:Belchite - Vista general01.JPG|thumb|left|250px|After being destroyed, the village of [[Belchite]] was not rebuilt and remains as a monument.]]\n\nThe Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936.

It has two varieties: ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n** The ''Csa'' zone is associated to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country. The ''Csa'' zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which K\u00f6ppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.\n** The ''Csb'' zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile\u2013Le\u00f3n]], northeastern [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and northern [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]) and into much rainier areas (notably [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.\n* The [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', ''BSh''), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley, which crosses southern [[Navarre]], central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.\n* The [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Cantabria, [[Asturias]], and partly Galicia and Castile\u2013Le\u00f3n). Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico|Iberian System]] and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (''Cfa'') also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.\n\nApart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the [[alpine climate]] in areas with very high altitude, the [[humid subtropical climate]] in areas of northeastern Spain and the [[continental climate]]s (''Dfc'', ''Dfb'' / ''Dsc'', ''Dsb'') in the [[Pyrenees]] as well as parts of the [[Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica|Cantabrian Range]], the [[Sistema Central|Central System]], [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico|Iberian System]], and a typical [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', ''BWh'') in the zone of Almer\u00eda, Murcia and eastern [[Canary Islands]]. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} during their coldest month, thus having a [[tropical climate]].\n\n=== Fauna and flora ===\n[[File:Iberian Wolf AdF 001.jpg|thumb|The [[Iberian wolf]] in [[Castile and Leon]]. The region has the 25% of the land covered by [[Natura 2000]] protected natural spaces.]]\n{{main|Wildlife of Spain}}\n\nThe [[fauna]] presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and [[Eurasia]], and the great diversity of habitats and [[biotopes]], the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.\n\nThe vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief, the climate and [[latitude]].

Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the ''comarques'' (sing. ''comarca'') and the ''vegueries'' (sing. ''vegueria'') both of which have administrative powers; ''comarques'' being aggregations of municipalities, and the ''vegueries'' being aggregations of ''comarques''. The concept of a ''comarca'' exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.\n\n==== Autonomous communities ====\n{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}\n{{See also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}\n{{Autonomous regions of Spain|float=right}}\n\nSpain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the \"[[nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions of Spain]]\".<ref>Article 143 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2</ref> The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits. This territorial organisation, based on [[devolution]], is literally known in Spain as the \"State of Autonomies\".\n\nThe basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Chapter 3. Autonomous Communities. 147th Article]. ''Spanish Constitution of 1978''. Retrieved 10 December 2007</ref>\n\nThe governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers and comprise\n* a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by [[universal suffrage]] according to the system of [[proportional representation]] and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;\n* a government council, with executive and administrative functions headed by a president, elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];\n* a supreme court, under the supreme court of Spain, which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community.\n\nCatalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as ''nationalities'', were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |title=Estatut |language=es |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021746/http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009}}</ref> the Canary Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html#pre |title=Nuevo Estatuto de Autonom\u00eda de Canarias |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |accessdate=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120074716/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html |archivedate=20 January 2011}}</ref> the Balearic Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |title=BOCAe32.QXD |language=ca |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711090828/http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2009}}</ref> and Aragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |title=Estatuto de Autonom\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n |publisher=Narros.congreso.es |accessdate=20 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211225055/http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |archivedate=11 December 2009  }}</ref>\n\nThe autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities\u2014the Basque Country and Navarre\u2014have full fiscal autonomy. Beyond fiscal autonomy, the ''nationalities''\u2014Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia\u2014were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: [[Ertzaintza]], [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Polic\u00eda Foral]] respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the ''Polic\u00eda Aut\u00f3noma Andaluza''<ref name=\"cartujo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|title=Unidad de Polic\u00eda de la Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma de Andaluc\u00eda|publisher=Cartujo.org|accessdate=23 October 2007|language=es|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107145807/http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|archivedate=7 November 2007}}</ref> in [[Andalusia]] or the [[BESCAM]] in Madrid.\n\nNonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the ''nationalities'' and the rest of the regions.\n\nFinally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.\n\n==== Provinces and municipalities ====\n{{Main|Provinces of Spain|Municipalities of Spain}}\n\nAutonomous communities are divided into [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are divided into [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]]. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Articles 140 and 141]. Spanish Constitution of 1978</ref>\n\nThe current provincial division structure is based\u2014with minor changes\u2014on the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|1833 territorial division]] by [[Javier de Burgos]], and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Spain}}\n[[File:Presidenta de la Rep\u00fablica asisti\u00f3 a la inauguraci\u00f3n de la XXIV Cumbre Iberoamerican (15368470204).jpg|thumb|The [[Ibero-American Summit]], in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], 2014]]\nAfter the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, Spain's [[foreign policy]] priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco years]] and expand [[diplomatic relations]], enter the [[European Union|European Community]], and define security relations with the West.\n\nAs a member of [[NATO]] since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities.

The island lies {{convert|250|m|ft}} just off the coast of Morocco, {{convert|8|km|mi}} from [[Ceuta]] and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.\n\nBesides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and [[Melilla]] and the ''[[plazas de soberan\u00eda]]'' islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]] which was annexed by Spain in 1801 after the [[War of the Oranges]].

Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (''secano''), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (''regad\u00edo'') accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in [[Province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]]\u2014one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain\u2014of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.\n\n[[File:Vi\u00f1edos en Bri\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|A [[vineyard]] in [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]]]\n\nThough only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40\u201345% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in [[maize|corn]], [[fruit tree]]s, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, [[legume]]s, [[olive tree]]s, mangos, [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and [[fodder]] grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.\n\n[[Citrus fruit]]s, vegetables, [[cereal grain]]s, [[olive oil]], and wine\u2014Spain's traditional agricultural products\u2014continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and [[dairy product]]s. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did [[sunflower seed oil]] that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]].\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Spain}}\n[[File:Benidorm - Playa de Poniente 26.jpg|thumb|[[Benidorm]], one of Europe's largest coastal tourist destinations]]\n\nIn 2017, Spain was the second most visited country in the world, recording 82 million tourists which marked the fifth consecutive year of record-beating numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/gobierno/news/Paginas/2018/20180110_balancetourist17.aspx |title=Spain posts record number of 82 million inbound tourists in 2017 |date=10 January 2018 |accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref> The headquarters of the [[World Tourism Organization]] are located in Madrid.\n\nSpain's geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture, and excellent infrastructure has made the country's international tourist industry among the largest in the world.

The Valencian chivalric romance [[Tirant lo Blanch]] written in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] is also remarkable.\n\nOther major plays from the medieval times were ''[[Mester de Juglar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Mester de Clerec\u00eda]]'', ''[[Coplas por la muerte de su padre]]'' or ''[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (The Book of Good Love).\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] the major plays are ''[[La Celestina]]'' and ''[[El Lazarillo de Tormes]]'', while many religious literature was created with poets as [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[San Juan de la Cruz]], [[Santa Teresa de Jes\u00fas]], etc.\n\nThe [[Baroque]] is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The famous ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de La Mancha]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] or [[Tirso de Molina]].\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] we find names such as [[Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn]], [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] or [[Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn]].\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Emilia Pardo Bazan (1896).jpg\n| width1    = 118\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Mar\u00eda Zambrano ca. 1918.JPG\n| width2    = 117\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Rodoreda.jpg\n| width3    = 113\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n| footer    = [[Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n]], [[Mar\u00eda Zambrano]] and [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]]\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nDuring the [[Romanticism]], [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]] created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in [[Don Juan Tenorio]].

Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general \"Realism\", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.\n\nThe group that has become known as the [[Generation of 1898]] was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The \"Disaster\" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ''Regeneracionismo''. For a group of younger writers, among them [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[P\u00edo Baroja]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz]] (Azor\u00edn), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], and \u00c1ngel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda del Valle Incl\u00e1n, de Audouard.jpg\n| width1    = 129\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Photo of Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s.jpg\n| width2    = 88\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca.

The next supposed \"generation\" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914\u2014the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]\u2014a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.\n\nLeading voices include the poet [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]], the academics and essayists [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], [[Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]], [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]], [[Maria Zambrano]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Clara Campoamor]] and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Mir\u00f3, [[Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala]], and [[Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna]]. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the [[College of Europe]] and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the [[Liberal International]].\n\nThe Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]]. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ''regeneracionistas'' and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.\n[[File:Miguel Delibes (d\u00e9cada de 1960) - 4.tif|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Miguel Delibes]] ([[Valle de Sedano]] in 1960), describes the situation of rural Spain after the [[Rural flight]] in the 1950s.]]\nThe two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]] and [[Miguel Delibes]] from [[Generation of '36]]. Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and with Latin American laureates they made the Spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all. The Spanish writers are: [[Jos\u00e9 Echegaray]], [[Jacinto Benavente]], [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]] and [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]]. The Portuguese writer [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. Saramago was also well known by his [[Iberism|Iberist]] ideas.\n\nThe [[Generation of '50]] are also known as the children of the civil war. [[Rosa Chacel]], [[Gloria Fuertes]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite]], [[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]], [[Juan Mars\u00e9]], [[Blas de Otero]], [[Gabriel Celaya]], [[Antonio Gamoneda]], [[Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio]] or [[Ignacio Aldecoa]].\n\n[[Premio Planeta de Novela]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] was a philosopher residing in Spain during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nDuring [[Al-Andalus]], Muslim, Jewish and Christian philosophies flourished, also [[Ibn Arabi]], [[Averroes]] and [[Maimonides]].\n\nIn the Middle Ages [[Ramon Llull]] flourished in Spain.\n\nHumanist [[Luis Vives]] worked in Spain during the [[Renaissance]], as did [[Francisco de Vitoria]] (creator of the [[School of Salamanca]] and scholar on [[international law]]) and [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]].\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain arrived later and was less strong than in other European countries, but during the [[XIX century]] liberal ideas arrived in Spanish society. At the end of the century, socialist and libertarian ideas also flourished, with thinkers such as [[Francisco Pi i Margall]], [[Ricardo Mella]] and [[Francisco Ferrer Guardia]].\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century among the most prominent philosophers were [[Maria Zambrano]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]].\n\nContemporary philosophers include [[Fernando Savater]] and [[Adela Cortina]], creator of the term ''[[aporophobia]]''.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Spanish art}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Las Meninas, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg\n| width1    = 126\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| footer    = ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]\n| footer_align = left\n| valign    = middle\n}}\nArtists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and [[Hispanic America|American]] [[art movement|artistic movements]]. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]], is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque|Spanish Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]], [[Herrerian]] architecture or the [[Isabelline Gothic]].\n\nDuring the [[Golden Age]] painters painters working in Spain included [[El Greco]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Ribera]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]]. Also in the Baroque period [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and ''[[Las Hilanderas (Vel\u00e1zquez)|Las Hilanderas]]''.\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] painted during a historical period that includes the [[Peninsular War|Spanish Independence War]], the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the rise of contemporary nations-states.\n\n[[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla]] is a well-known modern impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]].\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n[[File:Chillida-peine.jpg|thumb|''The Comb of the Wind'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]] in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]]]\n\nThe Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. [[Alonso Berruguete]] ([[Valladolid]] School) is called the \"Prince of Spanish sculpture\". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa \u00darsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolom\u00e9 Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], [[Diego de Silo\u00e9]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Dami\u00e0 Forment|Dami\u00e1n Forment]].\n\nThere were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]] belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.\n\nOther notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Rold\u00e1n]] and his daughter [[Luisa Rold\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]]. In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], and [[Pablo Serrano]].\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema of Spain}}\n[[File:Pedro Almodovar and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] and [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] in [[Oviedo]] ([[Princess of Asturias Awards]])]]\n\nSpanish cinema has achieved major international success including [[Academy Award|Oscars]] for recent films such as ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' and ''[[Volver]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Barry|first2=Rikki |last2=Morgan-Tamosunas|author-link2=Rikki Morgan-Tamosunas|title=Contemporary spanish cinema|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1998}}</ref> In the long history of Spanish cinema, the great filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] was the first to achieve world recognition, followed by [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] in the 1980s ([[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a]]). [[Mario Camus]] and [[Pilar Mir\u00f3]] worked together in [[Curro Jim\u00e9nez]].\n\nSpanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]], [[Flori\u00e1n Rey]], [[Luis Garc\u00eda Berlanga]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Julio Medem]], [[Isabel Coixet]], [[Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar]], [[Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn]] and brothers [[David Trueba]] and [[Fernando Trueba]].\n\nActresses [[Sara Montiel]] and [[Pen\u00e9lope Cruz]] or actor [[Antonio Banderas]] are among those who have become [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] stars.\n\nInternational Film Festivals of [[Seminci|Valladolid]] and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival|San Sebastian]] are the oldest and more relevant in Spain.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Spanish architecture}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Hemispheric - Valencia, Spain - Jan 2007.jpg\n| width1    = 230\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Casacolgantecuenca.jpg\n| width2    = 97\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| footer    = The modern Hemispheric at the [[Ciutat de les Arts i les Ci\u00e8ncies]] in Valencia and [[Hanging houses of Cuenca]]\n| footer_align = left\n| valign    = middle\n}}\n\nDue to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive [[Roman era]] infrastructure, [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic [[Umayyad dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Cruz|title=Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other|editor= David R. Blanks  |editor2=Michael Frassetto|location=New York|publisher=Saint Martin's Press|year=1999|page=56}}</ref> Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]], which built its famed palace complex in [[Granada]].\n\nSimultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a [[pre-Romanesque]] style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] streams. There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.\n\nThe arrival of [[Modernism]] in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in [[Barcelona]], known as [[modernisme]], produced a number of important architects, of which [[Gaud\u00ed]] is one. The [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] was led by groups like [[GATEPAC]]. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in [[contemporary architecture]] and [[:Category:Spanish architects|Spanish architects]] like [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Ricardo Bofill]] as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{Main|Music of Spain}}\n[[File:Belen maya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Flamenco]] is an Andalusian artistic form that evolved from the [[Seguidilla]].]]\n\nSpanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with [[flamenco]], a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of [[folk music]] abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.\n\nIn the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Enrique Granados]] and singers and performers such as [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]], [[Alicia de Larrocha]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Ricardo Vi\u00f1es]], [[Jos\u00e9 Iturbi]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Teresa Berganza]].

It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep [[Mediterranean]] roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:\n\n'''''Mediterranean''''' Spain \u2013 all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia \u2013 heavy use of seafood, such as ''pesca\u00edto frito'' (fried fish); several cold soups like ''[[gazpacho]]''; and many rice-based dishes like ''[[paella]]'' from Valencia<ref name=\"paella\" /> and ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'' (black rice) from Catalonia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |title=Spain Gain at Mercat Negre |work=The Village Voice |date=1 December 2009 |last=DiGregorio |first=Sarah |location=New York |accessdate=6 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208050334/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |archivedate=8 December 2009  }}</ref>\n\n'''''Inner''''' Spain \u2013 Castile \u2013 hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based ''Castilian soup'', along with substantial stews such as ''[[cocido madrile\u00f1o]]''.

Also, the lightly cured ''[[Lac\u00f3n Gallego|lac\u00f3n]]'' ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, as in the Basque-style [[cod]], [[albacore]] or [[anchovy]] or the Galician octopus-based ''[[polbo \u00e1 feira]]'' and shellfish dishes.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Spain}}\n[[File:Barcelona-1992-rr-800.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona]]\n\nWhile varieties of football have been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. [[Real Madrid C.F.]] and [[FC Barcelona]] are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. [[Spain national football team|The country's national football team]] won the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], and is the first team ever to win three back-to-back major international tournaments.\n\n[[Basketball]], [[tennis]], cycling, [[team handball|handball]], [[Spain national futsal team|futsal]], [[motorcycling]] and, lately, [[Formula One]] also can boast of Spanish champions. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] that were hosted in [[Barcelona]], which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for [[water sports]], [[golf]] and [[skiing]]. In their respective regions, the traditional games of [[Basque pelota]] and [[Valencian pilota]] both are popular.\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Spain|Fiestas of International Tourist Interest of Spain|Fiestas of National Tourist Interest of Spain}}\n[[File:Encierro en la calle Mercaderes.jpg|thumb|[[San Ferm\u00edn]] festival, [[Pamplona]]]]\n\nPublic holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious ([[Roman Catholic]]), national and regional observances.

Some of them are known worldwide, and every year millions of people from all over the world go to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is [[San Ferm\u00edn]], in [[Pamplona]]. While its most famous event is the ''encierro'', or the [[running of the bulls]], which happens at 8:00&nbsp;am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.\n\nOther festivals include: [[La Tomatina]] tomato festival in [[Bu\u00f1ol]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the carnivals in the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Falles]] in [[Valencia]] or the [[Holy Week]] in Andalusia and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Spain}}\n* [[Outline of Spain]]\n* {{Books-inline|Spain}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[[Raymond Carr|Carr, Raymond]], ed.
