(4549295140) 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|One child showing compassion for another child.]]\n'''Compassion''' motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical, mental, or emotional pains of another and themselves. Compassion is often regarded as having sensitivity, an emotional aspect to suffering, though when based on cerebral notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, it may be considered rational in nature and its application understood as an activity also based on sound judgment. There is also an aspect of equal dimension, such that an individual's compassion is often given a property of \"depth\", \"vigor\", or \"[[passion (emotion)|passion]]\". The etymology of \"compassion\" is Latin, meaning \"co-suffering.\" Compassion involves \"feeling for another\" and is a precursor to [[empathy]], the \"feeling as another\" capacity for better person-centered acts of active compassion; in common parlance active compassion is the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to alleviate another's suffering.<ref name=\"sjsl\">Sherlyn Jimenez, see article on ''Compassion'', The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology, Volume I, Editor: Shane Lopez, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6125-1}}</ref>\n\nCompassion involves allowing ourselves to be moved by suffering and experiencing the motivation to help alleviate and prevent it. An act of compassion is defined by its [[helpfulness]]. Qualities of compassion are patience and wisdom; kindness and perseverance; warmth and resolve. It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in what manifests in the social context as [[altruism]]. Expression of compassion is prone to be hierarchical, paternalistic and controlling in responses.<ref name=\"Gilbert2010\"/> Difference between sympathy and compassion is that the former responds to suffering from sorrow and concern while the latter responds with warmth and care.<ref name=\"CompInteg\"/>\n\nThe English [[noun]] ''compassion'', meaning ''to suffer together with'', comes from [[Latin]]. Its [[prefix]] ''com-'' comes directly from ''com'', an archaic version of the Latin [[preposition]] and affix [[wikt:cum|cum]] (= with); the ''-passion'' segment is derived from ''passus'', [[past participle]] of the [[deponent verb]] [[wikt:patior|patior, pat\u012b, passus sum]]. Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun [[patient]] (= one who suffers), from ''patiens'', [[present participle]] of the same [[wikt:patior|patior]], and is akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and to its [[cognate]] noun [[wikt:\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2]] (= [[pathos]]).<ref name=\"newSOED\">{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on

It is found that people only show less compassion for many victims than for single victims of disasters when they expect to incur a financial cost upon helping. This [[collapse of compassion]] depends on having the motivation and ability to regulate emotions.<ref>Cameron & Payne, 2011, JPSP</ref> In laboratory research, psychologists are exploring how concerns about becoming emotionally exhausted may motivate people to curb their compassion for\u2014and dehumanize\u2014members of stigmatized social groups, such as homeless individuals and drug addicts.<ref>Cameron, Harris, & Payne, in prep</ref>\n\nCompassion consists of three major requirements: People must feel that troubles that evoke their feelings are serious, the understanding that sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted, and ability to picture oneself with the same problems in a non-blaming and non-shaming manner.<ref name=\"Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology\" />\n\n===Neurobiology===\n{{Globalize|section|date=October 2019}}\nJorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, [[neuroscientists]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]].

Damasio]] and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] lack the ability to feel their way empathically to moral answers, and that when confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with \"end-justifies-the-means\" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue \u2014 in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city \u2014 these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse.

There are two forms of compassion: one for those who suffer even though they have done nothing wrong and one for those who suffer because they did something wrong. Absolute compassion applies to both, while relative compassion addresses the difference between the former and the latter. An example of the latter include those who plead guilty or are convicted of a crime such as murder; in these cases, the virtue of compassion must be balanced with the virtue of justice.<ref name=abde/>\n\nThe classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages.

Compassion is often regarded as having sensitivity, an emotional aspect to suffering, though when based on cerebral notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, it may be considered rational in nature and its application understood as an activity also based on sound judgment. There is also an aspect of equal dimension, such that an individual's compassion is often given a property of \"depth\", \"vigor\", or \"[[passion (emotion)|passion]]\". The etymology of \"compassion\" is Latin, meaning \"co-suffering.\" Compassion involves \"feeling for another\" and is a precursor to [[empathy]], the \"feeling as another\" capacity for better person-centered acts of active compassion; in common parlance active compassion is the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to alleviate another's suffering.<ref name=\"sjsl\">Sherlyn Jimenez, see article on ''Compassion'', The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology, Volume I, Editor: Shane Lopez, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6125-1}}</ref>\n\nCompassion involves allowing ourselves to be moved by suffering and experiencing the motivation to help alleviate and prevent it. An act of compassion is defined by its [[helpfulness]]. Qualities of compassion are patience and wisdom; kindness and perseverance; warmth and resolve. It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in what manifests in the social context as [[altruism]]. Expression of compassion is prone to be hierarchical, paternalistic and controlling in responses.<ref name=\"Gilbert2010\"/> Difference between sympathy and compassion is that the former responds to suffering from sorrow and concern while the latter responds with warmth and care.<ref name=\"CompInteg\"/>\n\nThe English [[noun]] ''compassion'', meaning ''to suffer together with'', comes from [[Latin]]. Its [[prefix]] ''com-'' comes directly from ''com'', an archaic version of the Latin [[preposition]] and affix [[wikt:cum|cum]] (= with); the ''-passion'' segment is derived from ''passus'', [[past participle]] of the [[deponent verb]] [[wikt:patior|patior, pat\u012b, passus sum]]. Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun [[patient]] (= one who suffers), from ''patiens'', [[present participle]] of the same [[wikt:patior|patior]], and is akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb \u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and to its [[cognate]] noun [[wikt:\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c0\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2]] (= [[pathos]]).<ref name=\"newSOED\">{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on

According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: \"Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets.

Though all life is considered sacred, human life is deemed the highest form of earthly existence. To kill any person, no matter their crime, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is the only substantial religious tradition that requires both monks and laity to be vegetarian. It is suggested that certain strains of the [[Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences.<ref>South India Handbook: The Travel Guide By Robert Bradnock, 2000 Footprint Travel Guides, p. 543, Vegetarianism: A History By Colin Spencer, 2002 Thunder's Mouth Press, p. 342</ref> The Jain tradition's stance on [[ahimsa|nonviolence]], however, goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice [[veganism]].  Jains run animal shelters all over India.

The house has a reputation for being haunted. Stories tell of a particularly large ghostly [[black cat]]. The best documented account occurred between 1968 and 1970 when the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and ''[[Evening Press]]'' newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs. Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]], who were converting the house into an arts centre. During the conversion, tradesmen employed on the work site began complaining of ghosts. One night, a friend of the O'Briens, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years afterwards. Although locals were skeptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably that of an Indian gentleman, and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Montpelier Hill. There were also reports of incorporeal ringing bells and [[poltergeist]] activity. In 1970, an [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television crew recorded a documentary about the house. In the documentary, a [[clairvoyant]] called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through [[automatic writing]]. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child or, perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Farrell |first=Padraic |title=Irish Ghost Stories |year=2004 |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |location=Dublin |isbn=978-0-7171-3633-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Walsh |first=Dave |title=Haunted Dublin |year=2008 |publisher=Nonsuch Publishing |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-84588-932-6 }}</ref><ref name=\"Walsh_21\">Walsh, p. 21.</ref>\n*'''[[Leap Castle]]''': Many people were imprisoned and executed in this castle, and it is supposedly haunted by several spirits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/Ireland/Leap/Leap.htm |title=The Reference of the Castle |accessdate=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505062516/http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/Ireland/Leap/Leap.htm |archivedate=5 May 2012  }}</ref> It was featured on ''Scariest Places on Earth'' and ''Most Haunted''.\n*'''Renyle House Hotel''' in [[Galway]]: Haunted by former anonymous remaining guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hauntedrooms.co.uk/renyle-house-hotel|title=Haunted Weekends, Haunted Hotels & Haunted Castles|work=Haunted Rooms|accessdate=4 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*'''[[Ross Castle]]''': Guests often wake at night hearing disembodied voices and doors banging and shutting on their own.

The house has a reputation for being haunted. Stories tell of a particularly large ghostly [[black cat]]. The best documented account occurred between 1968 and 1970 when the ''[[Evening Herald]]'' and ''[[Evening Press]]'' newspapers carried a number of reports regarding a Mrs. Margaret O'Brien and her husband Nicholas, a retired [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na|Garda]] [[superintendent (police)|superintendent]], who were converting the house into an arts centre. During the conversion, tradesmen employed on the work site began complaining of ghosts. One night, a friend of the O'Briens, artist Tom McAssey, and two workmen were confronted by a spectral figure and a black cat with glowing red eyes. McAssey painted a portrait of the cat which hung in the house for several years afterwards. Although locals were skeptical of the reports, further apparitions were reported, most notably that of an Indian gentleman, and of two nuns called Blessed Margaret and Holy Mary who had taken part in black masses on Montpelier Hill. There were also reports of incorporeal ringing bells and [[poltergeist]] activity. In 1970, an [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television crew recorded a documentary about the house. In the documentary, a [[clairvoyant]] called Sheila St. Clair communicated with the spirits of the house through [[automatic writing]]. In 1971, a plumber working in the house discovered a grave with a skeleton of a small figure, most likely that of a child or, perhaps, the body of the dwarf alleged to have been sacrificed by the members of the Hell Fire Club. The house operated as a restaurant in the 1990s before closing in 2001; it is now a private residence.<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Farrell |first=Padraic |title=Irish Ghost Stories |year=2004 |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |location=Dublin |isbn=978-0-7171-3633-9 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Walsh |first=Dave |title=Haunted Dublin |year=2008 |publisher=Nonsuch Publishing |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-84588-932-6 }}</ref><ref name=\"Walsh_21\">Walsh, p. 21.</ref>\n*'''[[Leap Castle]]''': Many people were imprisoned and executed in this castle, and it is supposedly haunted by several spirits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/Ireland/Leap/Leap.htm |title=The Reference of the Castle |accessdate=14 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505062516/http://www.castles.org/castles/Europe/Western_Europe/Ireland/Leap/Leap.htm |archivedate=5 May 2012  }}</ref> It was featured on ''Scariest Places on Earth'' and ''Most Haunted''.\n*'''Renyle House Hotel''' in [[Galway]]: Haunted by former anonymous remaining guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hauntedrooms.co.uk/renyle-house-hotel|title=Haunted Weekends, Haunted Hotels & Haunted Castles|work=Haunted Rooms|accessdate=4 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*'''[[Ross Castle]]''': Guests often wake at night hearing disembodied voices and doors banging and shutting on their own.

He was also a noted supporter of the cause of [[total abstinence]] from [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].\n\nHe was  born in [[Dublin]], the fourth son of the Reverend Cecil Crampton, vicar of  Headfort, [[County Galway]], and Nicola Mary Marsh, daughter of the Rev. Jeremy Marsh, rector of Athenry, aunt of [[Sir Henry Marsh]] and great-granddaughter of Archbishop [[Francis Marsh]]. His namesake, the celebrated doctor [[Sir Philip Crampton]], 1st Baronet, was a cousin, a fact which benefitted his career. He was educated at the [[University of Dublin]], where he was an outstanding student, and gold medallist; later becoming a Fellow of the University (1807\u201316) and  Regius Professor of Law in 1816. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1808. He was called to the [[Irish Bar]] in 1810.\n\nHe was appointed Solicitor-General in 1830. He was elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] in February 1831,<ref name=\"ray2\">{{Rayment-hc|S|2|date=March 2012}}</ref> and MP for [[Milborne Port (UK Parliament constituency)|Milborne Port]] in July 1831.<ref name=\"ray1\"/> He was judge of the [[Court of Queen's Bench (Ireland)]] 1834-1859.\n\nIn politics he was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and a strong  supporter of progressive Whig causes such as Parliamentary reform and [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of the slave trade]]. Though a fine academic lawyer and a \"pleasant and tactful\" advocate, he was not considered much of a politician. His various proposals to reform the Irish legal system met with little support, and he clashed repeatedly with [[Daniel O'Connell]] (he was to be one of the judges at O'Connell's trial in 1844).\n\nO'Connell opposed Crampton's appointment to the Bench, calling him \"utterly incompetent\", lacking in integrity, and chosen  only  due to  his friendships with senior judges. O'Connell  however disliked and despised nearly all the Irish judges of his time, and his low  opinion of Crampton was not generally shared: when he retired, it was said that no judge's reputation stood higher. Most contemporaries praised him as \"a true gentleman, a true Christian, and a noted philanthropist\".\n\nHe married firstly in 1817 Sidney Mary Browne, who died in 1839, and secondly Margaret Duffy. By his second marriage he had one son, Cecil, who died young.\n\nHe lived in considerable state at his home St. Valery, near [[Bray, County Wicklow]], but was not noted for hospitality. A strict advocate of [[temperance movement|temperance]], he refused to serve alcohol to his guests,  and according to a much repeated story, poured the entire contents of the St. Valery wine cellar into the nearby  River [[Dargle]].\n\nHe retired from the Bench in 1859 and died at St. Valery in 1862. Cecil, his only son,  died four years later while still in his teens. The estate passed to another branch of the Crampton family.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | mr-philip-crampton | Philip Cecil Crampton }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n\n{{s-bef| before = [[Henry Vane, 2nd Duke of Cleveland|Earl of Darlington]]<br />[[John Gregson (MP)|John Gregson]] }}\n{{s-ttl| title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]]\n       | with   = [[Henry Vane, 2nd Duke of Cleveland|Earl of Darlington]]\n       | years  = February 1831 \u2013 May 1831}}\n{{s-aft| after  = [[Frederick Villiers Meynell|Frederick Villiers]]<br />[[Bethell Walrond]] }}\n\n{{s-bef| before = [[Richard Lalor Sheil]]<br />[[George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford|George Byng]] }}\n{{s-ttl| title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Milborne Port (UK Parliament constituency)|Milborne Port]]\n       | with   = [[George Byng, 2nd Earl of Strafford|George Byng]]\n       | years  = July 1831\u20131832}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished }}\n\n{{s-legal}}\n{{succession box  | title  = [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]]  | years  = 1830\u20131834  | before = [[John Doherty (Irish politician)|John Doherty]]  | after  = [[Sir Michael O'Loghlen, 1st Baronet|Michael O'Loghlen]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crampton, Philip Cecil}}\n[[Category:1783 births]]\n[[Category:1862 deaths]]\n[[Category:Solicitors-General for Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Fellows of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Saltash]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Milborne Port]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1830\u20131831]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1831\u20131832]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Irish King's Bench]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2016}}\n'''Philip Cecil Crampton''' [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC]] (May 1783 in [[Dublin]] \u2013 29 December 1862)<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rqeSXWqKAD8C&lpg=RA1-PA347&dq=%22Philip%20Cecil%20Crampton%22&pg=RA1-PA347#v=onepage&q=%22Philip%20Cecil%20Crampton%22&f=false |title=The Judges in Ireland, 1221-1921 |publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|year=2005|author=F.
