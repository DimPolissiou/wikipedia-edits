When you have the talent to be able to write and to draw, it seems a shame to choose only one. I think it's better to do both\". Her first novel in this series, ''Persepolis: The Story of A Childhood,'' depicts her childhood experiences in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, while her subsequent novel, ''Persepolis 2: The Story of A Return,'' depicts her high school years in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. ''Persepolis 2'' also includes Satrapi's return to Iran where she attends college, marries, and later divorces before moving to France. Hence, the series is not only a [[memoir]], but a ''[[Bildungsroman]]''. Throughout both books, she focuses on the idea of \"witnessing\". Meaning, the motivation behind her writing involves describing her life from the viewpoint of someone viewing political and social chaos. This displays the \"survival\" aspect behind Satrapi as a young girl, and eventually young woman within this context.<ref>Nabizadeh, G. (2016). Vision and precarity in marjane satrapi's persepolis. ''Women's Studies Quarterly, 44''(1/2), 152-167. https://search.proquest.com/docview/1790692619</ref> The influences of Satrapi's past education in Iran and Europe, and specifically German impressionism, can be felt throughout her writings and drawings as well.

Set in 1980, the novel focuses on her experiences of growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Her story details the impact of war and religious extremism on Iranians, especially women. Belonging to an upper-middle class family, Marji has access to various educational materials, such as books and a radio, which expose her to Western political thought at a very young age. By discovering the ideas of numerous philosophers, Marji reflects on her class privilege and is eager to learn about her family's political background. This inquiry inspires her to participate in popular demonstrations against the Shah's regime in which people are asking for his exile as a way to safeguard their rights. Unfortunately, after the Shah's departure, Marji notices the rise of religious extremism in her society and is unhappy about it. Her uncle Anoosh's visit deepens her interest in politics when he tells her stories of being imprisoned as a communist revolutionary. His stories cause her to value ideas of equality and resistance. The new government then begins to reform Iranian society, especially having women cover themselves while out in public and putting restrictions on social freedoms. Marji's family begins to fear for their lives since many of their friends and thousands of Iranians had fled the new regime to Europe or the USA, but they resolve to stay. Anoosh is arrested again and accused for being a spy. He is executed for his political beliefs. Marji is upset that God didn't do anything to help her uncle and rejects her faith. \n\nAfter an abrupt family vacation to Europe, Marji returns to Iran where she learns from her grandmother that the government has [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|declared war against Iraq]]. As her hometown of Tehran comes under attack, she finds safety in her basement, which doubles as a bomb shelter. One night, the family hears the Iranian National Anthem play on the TV, moving them to tears. It is later revealed that the government released the soldiers and air pilots from prison who were in jail for protesting. The soldiers agreed to fight on the condition that the country's National Anthem be played on the public broadcasting. Amidst the chaos of an ongoing war, her family secretly revolts against the new regime by having parties and consuming alcohol, which is prohibited in the country. Two years of war force Marji to explore her rebellious side by skipping classes, obsessing over boys, and visiting the black market that has grown as a result of the shortages caused by war and repression.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Marji rushes home one day to find that a long-range ballistic missile has hit her street. Her family escapes the missile as it hit the neighboring building, which housed their (very rare) Jewish neighbors the Baba Levy's. Traumatized by the sight of her friend's dead body, she expresses her anger against the Iranian political system. Her family begins to worry about her safety and decides to send her off to Austria for further study and to escape the war. The novel ends with her departure to Europe.\n\n=== Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return===\nThe second part of the series takes place in Vienna where Marji starts her new life at a boarding house because her mother's friend has no room for her at her apartment. Since she cannot speak German upon arrival, Marji finds it hard to communicate but eventually overcomes it and makes friends. She assimilates into the culture by celebrating Christmas and going to mass with her roommate. Away from home, Marji's Iranian identity deepens and she is expelled from the school after a verbal altercation with a nun who makes xenophobic comments against Marji.\n\nNo longer in school, Marji starts living with her friend Julie and her mother. Here, she experiences more culture shock when Julie talks about her sexual endeavors given that such topics are prohibited in Iran. Soon enough, she undergoes a physical and ideological transformation by abusing drugs and changing her appearance while  continuing to move homes. Marji finally settles on a room with Frau Dr. Heller, but their relationship is unstable. Issues also arise in many of Marji's relationships, in which she finds comfort in drugs. She forms a relationship with Markus, but breaks up with him when she discovers that he has been cheating on her. Marji leaves Dr. Heller's house after she accuses Marji of stealing her brooch. She spends the day on the park bench and realizes that she has nowhere to go and ends up living on the streets for two months. When she catches bronchitis, she almost dies, but is rescued and taken to a hospital. Marji reaches out to her parents who arrange for her to move back and thus after living in Vienna for 4 years, she returns to Tehran.\n\nAt the airport, she recognizes how different Iran is from Austria. Donning her veil once more to go out, she takes in the 65-foot murals of martyrs, rebel slogans, and the streets renamed after the dead. At home, her father tells her the horrors of the war and they talk deep into the night about what she had missed. After hearing what her parents had gone through while she was away in Vienna, she resolves never to tell them of her time there. However, her trauma from Austria makes her fall into depression forcing her to attempt suicide twice. When she survives, she takes it as a sign to live and starts her process of recovery by looking after her health and taking up a job. She also takes up art classes at the local university. However, due to the restrictions of showing female nudity, Marji and her friends attend secret sessions and parties, away from the prying eyes of the religious police. \n\nFollowing her return to Iran Marji meets Reza, also a painter, and they soon begin to date, but this proves to be frowned upon by the religious police. They are caught holding hands and their families are forced to pay a fine to avoid their lashings. In 1991, Reza proposes marriage to Marji, and after some contemplation, she accepts. Her mother, Taji, warns her that she has gotten married too young and she soon realizes that she feels trapped in the role of a permanent wife. Later on in 1994, the marriage has dwindled and Marji confides in her friend, Farnaz, that she no longer loves Reza and wants a divorce. Farnaz advises her to stay together because divorced women are socially scorned, but her grandmother urges her to get a divorce. After much contemplation, Marji decides to separate with a reluctant Reza.  She goes to her parents and tells them about her and Reza's divorce and they comment on how proud they are of her and suggest that she should leave Iran permanently and live a better life back in Europe. Marji attends a party, but someone warns them about the religious police. They quickly discard the alcohol and the women cover themselves as the police enter the building. The men make their escape by jumping from the rooftop, but Marji's friend Nami hesitates and falls to his death.  \n\nIn late 1994 before her departure for Europe, Marji visits the countryside outside of Tehran. She also visits the [[Caspian Sea]], the grave of her grandfather, and the prison building where her uncle Anoosh is buried. In the autumn, Marji along with her parents and grandmother go to Mehrabad Airport for their final goodbye as she heads off to live in Paris. Marji then reveals that her grandmother died in 1996.\n\n==Character list==\n*''Persepolis: The Story of A Childhood''\n**'''Marjane''' (main character): nicknamed Marji, Marjane's life is depicted beginning with her early childhood.

They were divorced after two years of marriage.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Genre and style ==\n''Persepolis'' is an autobiography written as a [[graphic novel]] based on Satrapi's life. The genre of graphic novels can be traced back to 1986 with Art Spiegelman\u2019s depiction of the Holocaust through the use of cartoon images of mice and cats. Later, writers such as Aaron McGruder and Ho Che Anderson used graphic novels to discuss themes such as Sudanese orphans and civil rights movements. This genre has become an appropriate forum for examining critical matters by using illustrations to discuss foreign topics, such as those discussed in ''Persepolis''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|title=A Life in Graphic Detail; Iranian Exile's Memoirs Draw Readers into Her Experience: [Third Edition]|last=Jones|first=Vanessa E.|date=4 Oct 2004|work=Boston Globe|id = {{ProQuest|404932988}}}}</ref> The \u201cgraphic novel\u201d label is not so much a single mindset as a coalition of interests that happen to agree on one thing\u2014that comics deserve more respect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Keywords for Children's Literature|last=Nel|first=Philip|last2=Paul|first2=Lissa|publisher=New York University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Nima Naghibi and Andrew O'Malley, English Professors at Ryerson University, believe that ''Persepolis'' is part of a larger movement of autobiographical books by Iranian women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naghibi|first=Nima|last2=O'Malley|first2=Andrew|date=June\u2013September 2005|title=Estranging the familiar: \"East\" and \"West\" in Satrapi's Persepolis (1)|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=5&docId=GALE%7CA169595766&docType=Critical+essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CA169595766&searchId=R3&userGroupName=wash43584&inPS=true#|journal=English Studies in Canada.|volume=31.2-3|issue=2|pages=223\u2013247|via=Literature Resource Center|doi=10.1353/esc.2007.0026}}</ref> Satrapi wrote ''Persepolis'' in a black-and-white format: \"the dialogue, which has the rhythms of workaday family conversations and the bright curiosity of a child's questions, is often darkened by the heavy black-and-white drawings\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galelp/persepolis/0?institutionId=702|title=\"Persepolis.\" The Literature of Propaganda|last=Satrapi|first=Marjane|last2=Gard|first2=Daisy|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Riggs|editor-first=Thomas|edition=1st|location=|pages=}}</ref>  The use of a graphic novel has become much more predominant in the wake of events such as the Arab Spring and the Green Movement, as this genre employs both literature and imagery to discuss these historical movements.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Otsby|first=Marie|date=2017|title=Graphic and Global Dissent: Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, Persian Miniatures, and the Multifaceted Power of Comic Protest|journal= PMLA |volume=132|issue=3|pages=558\u2013579|doi=10.1632/pmla.2017.132.3.558}}</ref> In an interview titled \"Why I Wrote Persepolis\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatgraphicnovels.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/whyiwroteperspolis1.pdf|title=Why I Wrote Persepolis}}</ref> Marjane Satrapi said that \"graphic novels are not traditional literature, but that does not mean they are second-rate.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatgraphicnovels.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/whyiwroteperspolis1.pdf|title=Why I Wrote Persepolis|website=greatgraphicnovels.files.wordpress.com}}</ref>\n\n''Persepolis'' uses [[visual literacy]] through its comics to enhance the message of the text. Visual literacy stems from the belief that pictures can be \"read.\"  As defined by the Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education, \"Visual literacy traces its roots to linguistic literacy, based on the idea that educating people to understand the codes and contexts of language leads to an ability to read and comprehend written and spoken verbal communication.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Social and Cultural Foundations of Education|last=Provenzo|first=Eugene F.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nDue to the nature of artistic choices made in ''Persepolis'' by virtue of it being an illustrated memoir, readers have faced difficulty in placing it into a genre. The term \"novel\" most commonly refers to books that are fiction. Thus, there is some controversy surrounding how to classify the genre of ''Persepolis'', being that it is non-fiction.

When you have the talent to be able to write and to draw, it seems a shame to choose only one. I think it's better to do both\". Her first novel in this series, ''Persepolis: The Story of A Childhood,'' depicts her childhood experiences in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, while her subsequent novel, ''Persepolis 2: The Story of A Return,'' depicts her high school years in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. ''Persepolis 2'' also includes Satrapi's return to Iran where she attends college, marries, and later divorces before moving to France. Hence, the series is not only a [[memoir]], but a ''[[Bildungsroman]]''. Throughout both books, she focuses on the idea of \"witnessing\". Meaning, the motivation behind her writing involves describing her life from the viewpoint of someone viewing political and social chaos. This displays the \"survival\" aspect behind Satrapi as a young girl, and eventually young woman within this context.<ref>Nabizadeh, G. (2016). Vision and precarity in marjane satrapi's persepolis.

Set in 1980, the novel focuses on her experiences of growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Her story details the impact of war and religious extremism on Iranians, especially women. Belonging to an upper-middle class family, Marji has access to various educational materials, such as books and a radio, which expose her to Western political thought at a very young age. By discovering the ideas of numerous philosophers, Marji reflects on her class privilege and is eager to learn about her family's political background. This inquiry inspires her to participate in popular demonstrations against the Shah's regime in which people are asking for his exile as a way to safeguard their rights. Unfortunately, after the Shah's departure, Marji notices the rise of religious extremism in her society and is unhappy about it. Her uncle Anoosh's visit deepens her interest in politics when he tells her stories of being imprisoned as a communist revolutionary. His stories cause her to value ideas of equality and resistance. The new government then begins to reform Iranian society, especially having women cover themselves while out in public and putting restrictions on social freedoms. Marji's family begins to fear for their lives since many of their friends and thousands of Iranians had fled the new regime to Europe or the USA, but they resolve to stay. Anoosh is arrested again and accused for being a spy. He is executed for his political beliefs. Marji is upset that God didn't do anything to help her uncle and rejects her faith. \n\nAfter an abrupt family vacation to Europe, Marji returns to Iran where she learns from her grandmother that the government has [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|declared war against Iraq]]. As her hometown of Tehran comes under attack, she finds safety in her basement, which doubles as a bomb shelter. One night, the family hears the Iranian National Anthem play on the TV, moving them to tears. It is later revealed that the government released the soldiers and air pilots from prison who were in jail for protesting. The soldiers agreed to fight on the condition that the country's National Anthem be played on the public broadcasting. Amidst the chaos of an ongoing war, her family secretly revolts against the new regime by having parties and consuming alcohol, which is prohibited in the country. Two years of war force Marji to explore her rebellious side by skipping classes, obsessing over boys, and visiting the black market that has grown as a result of the shortages caused by war and repression.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Marji rushes home one day to find that a long-range ballistic missile has hit her street. Her family escapes the missile as it hit the neighboring building, which housed their (very rare) Jewish neighbors the Baba Levy's. Traumatized by the sight of her friend's dead body, she expresses her anger against the Iranian political system. Her family begins to worry about her safety and decides to send her off to Austria for further study and to escape the war. The novel ends with her departure to Europe.\n\n=== Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return===\nThe second part of the series takes place in Vienna where Marji starts her new life at a boarding house because her mother's friend has no room for her at her apartment. Since she cannot speak German upon arrival, Marji finds it hard to communicate but eventually overcomes it and makes friends. She assimilates into the culture by celebrating Christmas and going to mass with her roommate. Away from home, Marji's Iranian identity deepens and she is expelled from the school after a verbal altercation with a nun who makes xenophobic comments against Marji.\n\nNo longer in school, Marji starts living with her friend Julie and her mother. Here, she experiences more culture shock when Julie talks about her sexual endeavors given that such topics are prohibited in Iran. Soon enough, she undergoes a physical and ideological transformation by abusing drugs and changing her appearance while  continuing to move homes. Marji finally settles on a room with Frau Dr. Heller, but their relationship is unstable. Issues also arise in many of Marji's relationships, in which she finds comfort in drugs. She forms a relationship with Markus, but breaks up with him when she discovers that he has been cheating on her. Marji leaves Dr. Heller's house after she accuses Marji of stealing her brooch. She spends the day on the park bench and realizes that she has nowhere to go and ends up living on the streets for two months. When she catches bronchitis, she almost dies, but is rescued and taken to a hospital. Marji reaches out to her parents who arrange for her to move back and thus after living in Vienna for 4 years, she returns to Tehran.\n\nAt the airport, she recognizes how different Iran is from Austria. Donning her veil once more to go out, she takes in the 65-foot murals of martyrs, rebel slogans, and the streets renamed after the dead. At home, her father tells her the horrors of the war and they talk deep into the night about what she had missed. After hearing what her parents had gone through while she was away in Vienna, she resolves never to tell them of her time there. However, her trauma from Austria makes her fall into depression forcing her to attempt suicide twice. When she survives, she takes it as a sign to live and starts her process of recovery by looking after her health and taking up a job. She also takes up art classes at the local university. However, due to the restrictions of showing female nudity, Marji and her friends attend secret sessions and parties, away from the prying eyes of the religious police. \n\nFollowing her return to Iran Marji meets Reza, also a painter, and they soon begin to date, but this proves to be frowned upon by the religious police. They are caught holding hands and their families are forced to pay a fine to avoid their lashings. In 1991, Reza proposes marriage to Marji, and after some contemplation, she accepts. Her mother, Taji, warns her that she has gotten married too young and she soon realizes that she feels trapped in the role of a permanent wife. Later on in 1994, the marriage has dwindled and Marji confides in her friend, Farnaz, that she no longer loves Reza and wants a divorce. Farnaz advises her to stay together because divorced women are socially scorned, but her grandmother urges her to get a divorce. After much contemplation, Marji decides to separate with a reluctant Reza.  She goes to her parents and tells them about her and Reza's divorce and they comment on how proud they are of her and suggest that she should leave Iran permanently and live a better life back in Europe. Marji attends a party, but someone warns them about the religious police. They quickly discard the alcohol and the women cover themselves as the police enter the building. The men make their escape by jumping from the rooftop, but Marji's friend Nami hesitates and falls to his death.  \n\nIn late 1994 before her departure for Europe, Marji visits the countryside outside of Tehran. She also visits the [[Caspian Sea]], the grave of her grandfather, and the prison building where her uncle Anoosh is buried. In the autumn, Marji along with her parents and grandmother go to Mehrabad Airport for their final goodbye as she heads off to live in Paris. Marji then reveals that her grandmother died in 1996.\n\n==Character list==\n*''Persepolis: The Story of A Childhood''\n**'''Marjane''' (main character): nicknamed Marji, Marjane's life is depicted beginning with her early childhood. Growing up in Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, Marjane grows up in a family who is involved in the political unrest of Iran. This influences her world-view of oppression and its consequent rebellion. Eventually, her family sends her to Vienna in hopes of escaping the unrest of her home. Throughout her journey, she grows and matures while maintaining her rebellious nature, which sometimes get her into trouble. Her family decides that she should leave Iran permanently and she settles in Paris at the end of her story. <ref name=\":2\" />\n** '''Mrs. Satrapi''' (Marjane's mother): Taji is a passionate woman, who is upset with the way things are going in Iran, including the elimination of personal freedoms, and violent attacks on innocent people.

The genre of graphic novels can be traced back to 1986 with Art Spiegelman\u2019s depiction of the Holocaust through the use of cartoon images of mice and cats. Later, writers such as Aaron McGruder and Ho Che Anderson used graphic novels to discuss themes such as Sudanese orphans and civil rights movements. This genre has become an appropriate forum for examining critical matters by using illustrations to discuss foreign topics, such as those discussed in ''Persepolis''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|title=A Life in Graphic Detail; Iranian Exile's Memoirs Draw Readers into Her Experience: [Third Edition]|last=Jones|first=Vanessa E.|date=4 Oct 2004|work=Boston Globe|id = {{ProQuest|404932988}}}}</ref> The \u201cgraphic novel\u201d label is not so much a single mindset as a coalition of interests that happen to agree on one thing\u2014that comics deserve more respect.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Keywords for Children's Literature|last=Nel|first=Philip|last2=Paul|first2=Lissa|publisher=New York University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Nima Naghibi and Andrew O'Malley, English Professors at Ryerson University, believe that ''Persepolis'' is part of a larger movement of autobiographical books by Iranian women.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naghibi|first=Nima|last2=O'Malley|first2=Andrew|date=June\u2013September 2005|title=Estranging the familiar: \"East\" and \"West\" in Satrapi's Persepolis (1)|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=5&docId=GALE%7CA169595766&docType=Critical+essay&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=LitRC&contentSet=GALE%7CA169595766&searchId=R3&userGroupName=wash43584&inPS=true#|journal=English Studies in Canada.|volume=31.2-3|issue=2|pages=223\u2013247|via=Literature Resource Center|doi=10.1353/esc.2007.0026}}</ref> Satrapi wrote ''Persepolis'' in a black-and-white format: \"the dialogue, which has the rhythms of workaday family conversations and the bright curiosity of a child's questions, is often darkened by the heavy black-and-white drawings\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/galelp/persepolis/0?institutionId=702|title=\"Persepolis.\" The Literature of Propaganda|last=Satrapi|first=Marjane|last2=Gard|first2=Daisy|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Riggs|editor-first=Thomas|edition=1st|location=|pages=}}</ref>  The use of a graphic novel has become much more predominant in the wake of events such as the Arab Spring and the Green Movement, as this genre employs both literature and imagery to discuss these historical movements.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Otsby|first=Marie|date=2017|title=Graphic and Global Dissent: Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, Persian Miniatures, and the Multifaceted Power of Comic Protest|journal= PMLA |volume=132|issue=3|pages=558\u2013579|doi=10.1632/pmla.2017.132.3.558}}</ref> In an interview titled \"Why I Wrote Persepolis\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatgraphicnovels.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/whyiwroteperspolis1.pdf|title=Why I Wrote Persepolis}}</ref> Marjane Satrapi said that \"graphic novels are not traditional literature, but that does not mean they are second-rate.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatgraphicnovels.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/whyiwroteperspolis1.pdf|title=Why I Wrote Persepolis|website=greatgraphicnovels.files.wordpress.com}}</ref>\n\n''Persepolis'' uses [[visual literacy]] through its comics to enhance the message of the text.

The term \"novel\" most commonly refers to books that are fiction. Thus, there is some controversy surrounding how to classify the genre of ''Persepolis'', being that it is non-fiction.

When the series gained critical acclaim, it was translated into many different languages. In 2003, Pantheon Books published parts 1 and 2 in a single volume English translation (with new cover art) under the title ''Persepolis'' which was translated by  Blake Ferris and Mattias Ripa, Satrapi's husband; parts 3 and 4 (also with new cover art) followed in 2004 as ''Persepolis 2'',  translated by Anjali Singh. In October 2007, Pantheon repackaged the two English language volumes in a single volume (with film tie-in cover art) under the title ''The Complete Persepolis''.

In addition, the novel allows its student readers to critically think about the phenomenon of war, while also exploring the potentials of peace.\n\nAs a result of the simple language and images, and Satrapi's relatable character, ''Persepolis'' has become an easily attainable book for students to read, learn, and engage with. Like any adolescent, Marji gets into some trouble, yet she also is intelligent and eager to learn. She listens to music, reads, and idolizes celebrities, which allows teenage readers to instantly identify with her qualities.\n\nFriere and Macedo argue that teaching ''Persepolis'' in a middle school classroom has proved to be beneficial in the development of students' literacy and critical thinking skills, which are necessary to help them interpret the world around them.<ref name=\":03\"/> In a journal article on how to teach ''Persepolis'' in a post 9/11 classroom, Lisa Botshon and Melinda Plastas from the University of Illinois assert that ''Persepolis'' offers a platform for students to question Western stereotypes and fear surrounding the Middle East. Another study that was done also showed that ''Persepolis'' has greatly impacted the thinking skills of middle school students who were taught it in their ELA classroom. Despite the images and easy-to-read text, ''Persepolis'' is also often taught at the high school level because high-school aged students would be able to take the information learned and thoroughly discuss it to enhance their literary skills.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> From writing about her life and the people in it, Satrapi's writing also denies the typical assumptions made by the world about Western Iranian women.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Friere and Macedo believe that the way women and Iranian society in general are presented in the book can help students come to doubt their perceived sense of national insecurity when it comes to the Middle East.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Botshon|first=Lisa|last2=Plastas|first2=Melinda|date=2009|title=Homeland In/Security: A Discussion and Workshop on Teaching Marjane Satrapi's ''Persepolis''|journal=Feminist Teacher|volume=20|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1353/ftr.0.0068|issn=1934-6034}}</ref>\n\nDespite the positive reviews, ''Persepolis'' faced some attempts at censorship in school districts across the United States.

Hall helped Davis arrange ''[[The Man With The Horn]]'', and its title track featured lead vocals by Hall, who also played guitar, [[synthesizer]] and [[celesta]] on the track.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nRandy Hall grew up in [[Chicago]]. His first instrument was the [[piano]], but at the age of 13 he switched to guitar, taking lessons from British [[jazz guitar]]ist Peter Budd. Despite Budd's best efforts, Hall adopted a playing technique similar to [[Wes Montgomery]], whereby the thumb is used as a [[Guitar pick|pick]]. Hall can play fast and explosively, as in the opening number \"One Phone Call/Street Scenes\" on the ESP 2 DVD ''[[A Tribute to Miles]]''.\n\nHall met Miles's nephew (and future drummer) Vince Wilburn Jr in [[kindergarten]] and the two became lifelong friends. Wilburn's mother Dorothy, was Miles's sister. The two friends started playing together and at the age of 16 joined a local band called Time, Space and Distance.\n\nThat soon gained them a reputation around Chicago and they did session work for local groups, including [[the Dells]]. When Hall and Wilburn were around 17 years old, [[Pete Cosey]], who had played in Miles's band from 1973 to 1975, began giving them lessons. They did gigs with him, festivals, and other events. Pete played bass and Randy played guitar. In 1975, Hall went to study music at the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston. When Hall returned to Chicago, he joined a new band called [[Data (band)|Data]], which included Wilburn, bassist Richard Patterson, keyboardist [[Robert Irving III]], and saxophonist Glenn Burris. All of these musicians later worked with [[Miles Davis]], with Patterson becoming the last bassist in a Miles Davis band and the others working on Davis' comeback album ''[[The Man With The Horn]]''. Irving and Wilburn also joined Davis' band in the 1980s.\n\nHall, Irving and Wilburn performed with other local musicians, including bassist [[Darryl Jones]] (who joined Miles's band in 1983) and guitarist [[Jean-Paul Bourelly]], who played on the Amandla album. In 1979, [[Data (band)|Data]] disbanded and a new band was formed, AL7, which included Hall, Wilburn, Irving, Burris, bassist Felton Crews (who also joined Miles's band) and Hall's sister Saundra, a vocalist.\n\nAL7 performed part-time, their main preoccupation being rehearsing and writing material. They also worked with arranger Tom Washington (known as Tom Tom 84), who was connected with another local band, [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]. Tom Tom 84 recorded several demos with AL7, including a track called \"Space,\" which had been written by Robert Irving III.<ref>[http://www.thelastmiles.com/associates-randy-hall.php Cole, George (2006-07-17). \"Miles's Associates: Randy Hall\". The Last Miles.]</ref>\n\n===Collaboration with Miles Davis===\nMiles Davis's record label, [[Columbia Records]], flew four of the AL7 band members - Hall, Wilburn, Crews, and Irving - from Chicago to [[New York City]], booked them iton a top-flight hotel and arranged recording sessions. Glenn Burris later joined the four and although he was at many of the sessions, he did not play. Instead, the four Chicago musicians were joined by a young saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]], who had been recommended to Miles by ex-band member [[Dave Liebman]].\n\nThe musicians worked on the music at Miles's house most days and in the studio and recorded more than a dozen tracks, although Davis did not play on any of them at that stage. One of them was \"Shout,\" a disco-funk track written by Hall, Irving, and Burris. Another was \"The Man With The Horn,\" a tribute ballad to Miles written by Hall and Irving, which became the title track for Davis's comeback album. Randy Hall also played guitar, synthesiser and celeste on the track.\n\nThe release of ''The Man With the Horn'' gave Hall a lot of exposure and as a result of his singing on the title track, he was invited to join the soul/funk band [[Pleasure (American band)|Pleasure]]. Occasionally, Hall was asked by Miles Davis to compose some songs.<ref>Cole, George, ''The Last Miles'' (University of Michigan Press 2005)</ref>\n\n===Post-Miles Davis===\nAfter leaving Pleasure, Hall carved out a successful career as an artist/producer and in 1984, he released a solo album, ''I Belong to You'', produced by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]] (of [[Raydio]] and \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\" fame). The album included contributions from Irving, Wilburn, Crews and Burris. In 1985, Hall was in Ray Parker Jr's studio (Ameraycan) in [[Los Angeles]], recording a follow-up solo album, ''Love You Like A Stranger''. Once again, Crews and Irving were involved in the sessions. Meanwhile, Miles had left Columbia Records after almost thirty years and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], with Warner's head of jazz [[Tommy LiPuma]] given the responsibility of handling Miles's musical development. During the initial stages, LiPuma was happy for Miles to choose his own musical direction. Miles decided that he wanted Hall to produce his first album for Warner Bros.\n\nHall decided to work with a number of people from the ''Love You Like A Stranger'' sessions on the new Miles Davis album. One of these people was Atalla Zane Giles, who had played guitar, keyboards, bass and sang on the album. Giles was asked to compose, arrange and produce the new album with Hall. Engineer Reggie Dozier was asked to join the project, as were keyboardist Adam Holzman (who later joined Davis's band), bassist Cornelius Mims, percussionist [[Steve Reid]], Burris and Wilburn. More than a dozen tunes were recorded during the sessions, which took place between October 1985 and January 1986, and the plan was to release an album called ''Rubberband''. One of the tracks was called \"Give It Up,\" the same name as a hit tune for Pleasure.\n\nThe Rubberband material was never released. Davis later worked work with [[Marcus Miller]] to record ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]''. Davis's performances from a couple of the Rubberband sessions were used to create new tracks on the ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' album. Two tunes from the Rubberband sessions were due to appear on a retrospective set called ''The Last Word'', but were ultimately not included.\n\nIn more recent years Hall has been working with Elliott Small. Hall produced, wrote the music, and played piano and guitar on Small's album ''This Season's Collection''. Hall also wrote the lyrics for two songs on the album: \"Share Your Love\" and \"Delightful\".\n\nHall currently lives in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he has a production studio, and he performs locally, nationally, and internationally.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060103164835/http://www.thesoulofamsterdam.com/randy-hall-biography-discography.htm Hellingh, Andreas (2006-07-17). \"Randy Hall - Biography and Discography\".

Instead, the four Chicago musicians were joined by a young saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]], who had been recommended to Miles by ex-band member [[Dave Liebman]].\n\nThe musicians worked on the music at Miles's house most days and in the studio and recorded more than a dozen tracks, although Davis did not play on any of them at that stage. One of them was \"Shout,\" a disco-funk track written by Hall, Irving, and Burris. Another was \"The Man With The Horn,\" a tribute ballad to Miles written by Hall and Irving, which became the title track for Davis's comeback album. Randy Hall also played guitar, synthesiser and celeste on the track.\n\nThe release of ''The Man With the Horn'' gave Hall a lot of exposure and as a result of his singing on the title track, he was invited to join the soul/funk band [[Pleasure (American band)|Pleasure]]. Occasionally, Hall was asked by Miles Davis to compose some songs.<ref>Cole, George, ''The Last Miles'' (University of Michigan Press 2005)</ref>\n\n===Post-Miles Davis===\nAfter leaving Pleasure, Hall carved out a successful career as an artist/producer and in 1984, he released a solo album, ''I Belong to You'', produced by [[Ray Parker, Jr.]] (of [[Raydio]] and \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\" fame). The album included contributions from Irving, Wilburn, Crews and Burris. In 1985, Hall was in Ray Parker Jr's studio (Ameraycan) in [[Los Angeles]], recording a follow-up solo album, ''Love You Like A Stranger''. Once again, Crews and Irving were involved in the sessions. Meanwhile, Miles had left Columbia Records after almost thirty years and signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], with Warner's head of jazz [[Tommy LiPuma]] given the responsibility of handling Miles's musical development. During the initial stages, LiPuma was happy for Miles to choose his own musical direction. Miles decided that he wanted Hall to produce his first album for Warner Bros.\n\nHall decided to work with a number of people from the ''Love You Like A Stranger'' sessions on the new Miles Davis album. One of these people was Atalla Zane Giles, who had played guitar, keyboards, bass and sang on the album. Giles was asked to compose, arrange and produce the new album with Hall. Engineer Reggie Dozier was asked to join the project, as were keyboardist Adam Holzman (who later joined Davis's band), bassist Cornelius Mims, percussionist [[Steve Reid]], Burris and Wilburn. More than a dozen tunes were recorded during the sessions, which took place between October 1985 and January 1986, and the plan was to release an album called ''Rubberband''. One of the tracks was called \"Give It Up,\" the same name as a hit tune for Pleasure.\n\nThe Rubberband material was never released. Davis later worked work with [[Marcus Miller]] to record ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]''. Davis's performances from a couple of the Rubberband sessions were used to create new tracks on the ''[[Doo-Bop]]'' album. Two tunes from the Rubberband sessions were due to appear on a retrospective set called ''The Last Word'', but were ultimately not included.\n\nIn more recent years Hall has been working with Elliott Small. Hall produced, wrote the music, and played piano and guitar on Small's album ''This Season's Collection''. Hall also wrote the lyrics for two songs on the album: \"Share Your Love\" and \"Delightful\".\n\nHall currently lives in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he has a production studio, and he performs locally, nationally, and internationally.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060103164835/http://www.thesoulofamsterdam.com/randy-hall-biography-discography.htm Hellingh, Andreas (2006-07-17). \"Randy Hall - Biography and Discography\".

Many different [[university|college]]s from the [[United States of America|United States]] can be chosen. The game features an exhibition mode in addition to a season mode. The game uses 3D-like graphics to make the court seem realistic, though now this gives the game an overall poor presentation. [[Dick Vitale]], lent his voice to this game for the [[Sega Genesis]], with said voice clips becoming a main selling point of the game. The game also has an options mode, with a sound-test, and other options.<ref name=\"mobygames\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game plays in a pseudo-3D perspective similar to that of a game on the [[SNES]] utilising the [[SuperFX]] chip, the player can use offensive and defensive plays designed by former college and pro coach Dick Vitale.

In the video, Scott is sent through dimensions to an alternate time where no other sports video games, including franchises like [[Madden_NFL|Madden]], were ever made, including his favorite, [[Madden 08]] it is revealed that this is due to a shadowy figure who was angry that people were playing sports games other than ''Dick Vitale's \"Awesome Baby\" College Hoops''. Scott then chooses to protest and gets placed under [[house arrest]], as everything not about Dick Vitale is not allowed. In the end, Scott teams up with other friends of his to defeat the shadowy figure (who is revealed to be fellow YouTuber RelaxAlax) but ends up having to sacrifice the last copy of ''Madden 08'' to do so. This brings him back to a dimension where everything is back to normal, but ''Madden 08'' was never made. He then wins a [[sweepstake]] in which he can create any video game he wants.

Scott then chooses to protest and gets placed under [[house arrest]], as everything not about Dick Vitale is not allowed. In the end, Scott teams up with other friends of his to defeat the shadowy figure (who is revealed to be fellow YouTuber RelaxAlax) but ends up having to sacrifice the last copy of ''Madden 08'' to do so. This brings him back to a dimension where everything is back to normal, but ''Madden 08'' was never made. He then wins a [[sweepstake]] in which he can create any video game he wants.
