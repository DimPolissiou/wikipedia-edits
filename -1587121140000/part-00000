It was founded as a junction city between the main transfer arteries in [[Siberia]], the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and the [[Ob River]]. Thus, it was not a surprise that the city grew very quickly. Plans for a [[rapid transit]] system began to be formed in the late 1960s and on 12 May 1979 the first construction works began. With wide experience in metro construction from the other [[rapid transit|metro]]s of the [[USSR]], it took seven-and-a-half years to complete work on the five-station launch stage of the system which was triumphantly opened on 7 January 1986, becoming the eleventh Metro in the USSR and the fourth in Russia.  Work quickly expanded to meet the original plans for a four-line 62&nbsp;km network.

It was founded as a junction city between the main transfer arteries in [[Siberia]], the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and the [[Ob River]]. Thus, it was not a surprise that the city grew very quickly. Plans for a [[rapid transit]] system began to be formed in the late 1960s and on 12 May 1979 the first construction works began. With wide experience in metro construction from the other [[rapid transit|metro]]s of the [[USSR]], it took seven-and-a-half years to complete work on the five-station launch stage of the system which was triumphantly opened on 7 January 1986, becoming the eleventh Metro in the USSR and the fourth in Russia.  Work quickly expanded to meet the original plans for a four-line 62&nbsp;km network. However, the financial difficulties of the early 1990s meant that most of the work had to be frozen, and they have been resumed only recently.{{when|date=August 2018}}\n<gallery widths=\"194px\" heights=\"194px\">\nNovosibirsk Metro Bridge 07-2016.jpg|Metro Bridge over the [[Ob River|Ob]]\nFile:Metro_novosibirsk_berezevaya_rossha.jpg|Beryozovaya Roscha Station\nFile:Novosibirsk_Metro.png|Novosibirsk Metro map\n</gallery>\n\n== Facts ==   \nThe system contains 13 stations on two lines.

The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991. It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's [[Uncle Leo]] and Jerry's neighbor [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nFilming of the show moved from [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City, Los Angeles]]. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, [[Larry Charles]] and [[Peter Mehlman]], who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.\n\nA ''Seasons 1 and 2'' [[DVD]] box set was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features [[The Stranded|an episode from the third season that was held over]], bonus material, including [[deleted scene]]s, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries. Four million copies of the DVD were sold by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time.

The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991. It introduced a number of characters who played significant roles in later episodes, such as Jerry's [[Uncle Leo]] and Jerry's neighbor [[Newman (Seinfeld)|Newman]].\n\nFilming of the show moved from [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] to [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City, Los Angeles]]. One episode, \"The Bet\", remained unfilmed, as it was considered too provocative by the network, as well as several cast and crew members. Two new writers joined the writing staff, [[Larry Charles]] and [[Peter Mehlman]], who would continue to write for the show in later seasons. Even though season two started out with poor ratings, bringing the season to a two-month hiatus, the rest of the season was positively received by critics and was nominated for three [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s.\n\nA ''Seasons 1 and 2'' [[DVD]] box set was released by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] in the United States and Canada on November 23, 2004, 13 years after it completed broadcast on television. In addition to every episode from the two seasons, the DVD release features [[The Stranded|an episode from the third season that was held over]], bonus material, including [[deleted scene]]s, inside looks, bloopers, and commentaries. Four million copies of the DVD were sold by the end of the year, making it one of the best-selling DVDs of all time. ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it as the sixth-greatest TV season ever made.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Cast==\nThe show features an ensemble cast of four characters: [[Jerry Seinfeld]] stars as [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|a fictional version of himself]]; [[Jason Alexander]] portrays Seinfeld's neurotic friend [[George Costanza]]; [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] plays [[Elaine Benes]], Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend; and [[Michael Richards]] stars as Seinfeld's neighbor [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,309157,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Tucker, Ken|date=January 10, 1992|title=Seinfeld (1990\u20131998)|accessdate=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the characters' evolution during the season: \"As the seasons progress, you can see Michael Richards turn Kramer {{interp|...}} from a vague eccentric {{interp|...}} into a stylized creation who redefined TV's quirky-neighbor type with [[Danny Kaye]] accents.

The series is hosted by Wil Willis, with a three-judge panel consisting of J. Neilson (Jason Knight during portions of season 3 and 4; Ben Abbott during portions of season 4), David Baker, and Doug Marcaida, experts in weapon history and use.

The fifth season premiered on March 7, 2018. The sixth season premiered on February 6, 2019.\n\nOn April 17, 2018, a spin-off series titled ''[[Knife or Death|Forged in Fire: Knife or Death]]'' premiered on History. This series is hosted by [[Bill Goldberg]] and co-hosted by Tu Lam, a martial arts expert and retired member of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]].\n\n==Format==\nThe set, referred to as \"The Forge,\" is stocked with a wide range of metalworking equipment, including propane forges, coal forges, grinders, [[power hammer]]s and [[hydraulic press]]es. Medical personnel are present to treat any injuries or other health problems and may, at their discretion, disqualify smiths who are unable to continue safely. At the end of each round, the smith whose weapon is judged to be the least satisfactory must surrender it and leave the competition.\n\nIn a typical episode, the four smiths are presented with a starting material that they must use in the first round to forge a blade in a style of their choosing. In some episodes, they all begin with the same material; in others, they may choose from an assortment of metal objects or must salvage their material from a source such as a junked car or lawnmower. Willis states one set of criteria concerning blade or blade/[[Tang (tools)|tang]] length, and often a second set for a feature that must be incorporated, such as serrations or a [[fuller (weapon)|fuller]] groove. The smiths are given 10 minutes to sketch out their designs, followed by three hours to forge the blades; they are not required to adhere to their original designs. Once time expires, the judges evaluate the blades based on Willis' criteria and inspect their workmanship, quality, and design, then deliberate privately before announcing their decision. Any smiths who fail to meet the criteria, or who fail to turn in a blade at all, are subject to immediate elimination.\n\nFor the second round, the three remaining smiths are given an additional three hours to turn their blades into fully operational weapons. They must attach a handle, choosing from a range of provided materials, and incorporate any additional special features stated by Willis. They must also grind, sharpen, and polish the blades. and may address any flaws or issues pointed out by the judges in the first round, if they choose to do so. After the time expires, the judges put each weapon through a series of tests to gauge properties such as sharpness, durability, and ease of use. For these tests, the weapons are used to chop/slash/stab objects that include ropes, ice blocks, animal carcasses, and steel car doors. If one weapon suffers catastrophic failure, defined as damage that renders it unsafe or ineffective for further testing, its maker is immediately disqualified. In the case of catastrophic failure by multiple weapons, the worst performer is eliminated. The judges may, at their discretion, choose not to subject a weapon to a particular test if it is sufficiently cracked or flawed.\n\nIn the third round, the two remaining smiths are shown a historically significant (and technically difficult) weapon and are given five days to create a version of it. They return to their home forges to do the work and must comply with any specifications set by Willis. Afterwards, they return to the Forge and submit their weapons for testing against objects and environments similar to the historical scenarios in which they were typically used. Based on the test results, the judges select one smith to receive the $10,000 prize.\n\n===Rule changes===\nSome episodes have incorporated modifications to the rules, as follows:\n\n* Extension or omission of the 10-minute design period in the first round.\n* Omission of a required special feature in the first round.\n* Extension or shortening of the three-hour forging time in the first and/or second rounds, depending on the difficulty level of the blade design and any special features.\n* Requiring the smiths to forge a blade of a specific style in the first round.\n* Omission of the requirement to attach a handle in the second round.\n* Shortening of the working time from five days to four in the third round.\n\n===Special episodes===\nThe \"Master & Apprentice\" episode in Season 4 featured four master/apprentice pairs of smiths. Only one member of each pair was allowed to work at any time, trading off every 30 minutes in the first two rounds, and every day in the third. The non-working member was allowed to offer advice. For this episode, the forging time in the first round was extended to three and a half hours.\n\nThe \"Ultimate Champions Edition\" (season 4) and \"Rookies Edition\" (season 5) each featured five smiths instead of four. The smiths were required to forge a particular type of blade at their homes and bring those weapons to the studio for a preliminary test. One smith was eliminated based on the results of this test, after which the competition proceeded through the normal three rounds.\n\nOn October 3, 2018, a five-week Invitational Tournament premiered, consisting of four preliminary heats and a finale. Four smiths with a particular specialty (farrier, armorer, blacksmith, metalworker) competed in each preliminary heat, with the winners advancing to the finale for a $50,000 prize. Dave Parthemore of Connecticut won. A similar \"Battle of the Branches\" tournament began on May 8, 2019, with four smiths from a different branch of the United States armed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) competing in each preliminary heat.\n\n== Cast, judges, and producers ==\nWil Willis is a former [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]] and decorated Air Force para-rescue specialist.<ref name=\"1variety\" /><ref name=\"4esquire\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> Willis' previous television experience includes ''[[Special Ops Mission]]'' and ''[[Triggers: Weapons That Changed the World|Triggers]]'', two series that aired on the former [[American Heroes Channel|Military Channel]].<ref name=\"3channel\" />\n\n{{Vanchor|J.

He has over 20 years' experience in making knives and edged weapons.<ref name=\"3channel\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> He examines the weapons' technical qualities and tests their durability.<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> In Season 3, Neilson took a leave of absence in order to have surgery on his hand; Jason Knight, another ABS Master Smith, filled his seat on the judges' panel during that time. Neilson appeared alongside Knight for the Season 4 premiere, then resumed his seat in the eighth episode. Starting with the 21st episode of the fourth season, two-time ''Forged in Fire'' champion Ben Abbott would replace him in some episodes.\n\nDavid Baker, a Hollywood prop maker who has appeared on the [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]] series ''[[Deadliest Warrior]]'',<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> is an authority on weapons history<ref name=\"1variety\" /> and an expert on replicating period-accurate weapons for both museums and films.<ref name=\"3channel\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> He judges the weapons' historical accuracy and aesthetic beauty.<ref name=\"4esquire\" />\n\nDoug Marcaida, an edged-weapons specialist, is a U.S. military contractor, martial arts instructor and knife designer for FOX Knives Italy. Specializing in the Southeast Asian fighting style of [[Eskrima|Kali]], he has taught classes in weapon awareness and use for military, law enforcement, and security organizations. Marcaida evaluates the smiths' weapons to determine their effectiveness in combat.<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> When he cannot test the smiths' weapons himself due to injury, he has a co-worker or family member perform this task in his place.\n\nTim Healy and Steve Ascher are executive producers for History.<ref name=\"1variety\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> Jodi Flynn, [[Brent Montgomery]], David George, Shawn Witt and Simon Thomas are executive producers for Outpost Entertainment.<ref name=\"1variety\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" />  Healy observed the demonstration, and later the filming, from the sidelines.

The series is hosted by Wil Willis, with a three-judge panel consisting of J. Neilson (Jason Knight during portions of season 3 and 4; Ben Abbott during portions of season 4), David Baker, and Doug Marcaida, experts in weapon history and use. History ordered an initial eight episodes of the series <ref name=\"1variety\" /> with the first program premiering on Monday, June 22, 2015, at 10pm ET.<ref name=\"3channel\" /><ref name=\"4esquire\" /> \n\nSeason two premiered on February 16, 2016 and increased to 10 episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/forged-in-fire|title=Forged in Fire Full Episodes, Video & More|website=History}}</ref> The third season premiered with a \"Champion of Champions\" match on August 23, 2016, and was announced as having 16 episodes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://premieredate.tv/tv-series/2386-when-will-forged-in-fire-season-2-premiere-release-date.html |title=History Channel scheduled Forged in Fire Season 3 premiere date: The release date for Forged in Fire Season 3 \u2014 August 23, 2016 |website=premieredate.tv |access-date=2016-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601131030/http://premieredate.tv/tv-series/2386-when-will-forged-in-fire-season-2-premiere-release-date.html |archivedate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The fourth season premiered on April 11, 2017, with a \"Judges' Pick\" episode in which the four judges (Neilson, Knight, Baker, Marcaida) each selected one smith from past seasons to compete again.  The fifth season premiered on March 7, 2018. The sixth season premiered on February 6, 2019.\n\nOn April 17, 2018, a spin-off series titled ''[[Knife or Death|Forged in Fire: Knife or Death]]'' premiered on History. This series is hosted by [[Bill Goldberg]] and co-hosted by Tu Lam, a martial arts expert and retired member of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]].\n\n==Format==\nThe set, referred to as \"The Forge,\" is stocked with a wide range of metalworking equipment, including propane forges, coal forges, grinders, [[power hammer]]s and [[hydraulic press]]es. Medical personnel are present to treat any injuries or other health problems and may, at their discretion, disqualify smiths who are unable to continue safely. At the end of each round, the smith whose weapon is judged to be the least satisfactory must surrender it and leave the competition.\n\nIn a typical episode, the four smiths are presented with a starting material that they must use in the first round to forge a blade in a style of their choosing. In some episodes, they all begin with the same material; in others, they may choose from an assortment of metal objects or must salvage their material from a source such as a junked car or lawnmower. Willis states one set of criteria concerning blade or blade/[[Tang (tools)|tang]] length, and often a second set for a feature that must be incorporated, such as serrations or a [[fuller (weapon)|fuller]] groove. The smiths are given 10 minutes to sketch out their designs, followed by three hours to forge the blades; they are not required to adhere to their original designs. Once time expires, the judges evaluate the blades based on Willis' criteria and inspect their workmanship, quality, and design, then deliberate privately before announcing their decision. Any smiths who fail to meet the criteria, or who fail to turn in a blade at all, are subject to immediate elimination.\n\nFor the second round, the three remaining smiths are given an additional three hours to turn their blades into fully operational weapons. They must attach a handle, choosing from a range of provided materials, and incorporate any additional special features stated by Willis. They must also grind, sharpen, and polish the blades. and may address any flaws or issues pointed out by the judges in the first round, if they choose to do so. After the time expires, the judges put each weapon through a series of tests to gauge properties such as sharpness, durability, and ease of use. For these tests, the weapons are used to chop/slash/stab objects that include ropes, ice blocks, animal carcasses, and steel car doors. If one weapon suffers catastrophic failure, defined as damage that renders it unsafe or ineffective for further testing, its maker is immediately disqualified. In the case of catastrophic failure by multiple weapons, the worst performer is eliminated. The judges may, at their discretion, choose not to subject a weapon to a particular test if it is sufficiently cracked or flawed.\n\nIn the third round, the two remaining smiths are shown a historically significant (and technically difficult) weapon and are given five days to create a version of it. They return to their home forges to do the work and must comply with any specifications set by Willis. Afterwards, they return to the Forge and submit their weapons for testing against objects and environments similar to the historical scenarios in which they were typically used. Based on the test results, the judges select one smith to receive the $10,000 prize.\n\n===Rule changes===\nSome episodes have incorporated modifications to the rules, as follows:\n\n* Extension or omission of the 10-minute design period in the first round.\n* Omission of a required special feature in the first round.\n* Extension or shortening of the three-hour forging time in the first and/or second rounds, depending on the difficulty level of the blade design and any special features.\n* Requiring the smiths to forge a blade of a specific style in the first round.\n* Omission of the requirement to attach a handle in the second round.\n* Shortening of the working time from five days to four in the third round.\n\n===Special episodes===\nThe \"Master & Apprentice\" episode in Season 4 featured four master/apprentice pairs of smiths. Only one member of each pair was allowed to work at any time, trading off every 30 minutes in the first two rounds, and every day in the third. The non-working member was allowed to offer advice. For this episode, the forging time in the first round was extended to three and a half hours.\n\nThe \"Ultimate Champions Edition\" (season 4) and \"Rookies Edition\" (season 5) each featured five smiths instead of four. The smiths were required to forge a particular type of blade at their homes and bring those weapons to the studio for a preliminary test. One smith was eliminated based on the results of this test, after which the competition proceeded through the normal three rounds.\n\nOn October 3, 2018, a five-week Invitational Tournament premiered, consisting of four preliminary heats and a finale. Four smiths with a particular specialty (farrier, armorer, blacksmith, metalworker) competed in each preliminary heat, with the winners advancing to the finale for a $50,000 prize. Dave Parthemore of Connecticut won. A similar \"Battle of the Branches\" tournament began on May 8, 2019, with four smiths from a different branch of the United States armed services (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) competing in each preliminary heat.\n\n== Cast, judges, and producers ==\nWil Willis is a former [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]] and decorated Air Force para-rescue specialist.<ref name=\"1variety\" /><ref name=\"4esquire\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> Willis' previous television experience includes ''[[Special Ops Mission]]'' and ''[[Triggers: Weapons That Changed the World|Triggers]]'', two series that aired on the former [[American Heroes Channel|Military Channel]].<ref name=\"3channel\" />\n\n{{Vanchor|J. Neilson}}, a knife and sword expert,<ref name=\"1variety\" /> holds the rank of Master Smith within the [[American Bladesmith Society]]. He has over 20 years' experience in making knives and edged weapons.<ref name=\"3channel\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> He examines the weapons' technical qualities and tests their durability.<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> In Season 3, Neilson took a leave of absence in order to have surgery on his hand; Jason Knight, another ABS Master Smith, filled his seat on the judges' panel during that time. Neilson appeared alongside Knight for the Season 4 premiere, then resumed his seat in the eighth episode. Starting with the 21st episode of the fourth season, two-time ''Forged in Fire'' champion Ben Abbott would replace him in some episodes.\n\nDavid Baker, a Hollywood prop maker who has appeared on the [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]] series ''[[Deadliest Warrior]]'',<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> is an authority on weapons history<ref name=\"1variety\" /> and an expert on replicating period-accurate weapons for both museums and films.<ref name=\"3channel\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> He judges the weapons' historical accuracy and aesthetic beauty.<ref name=\"4esquire\" />\n\nDoug Marcaida, an edged-weapons specialist, is a U.S. military contractor, martial arts instructor and knife designer for FOX Knives Italy. Specializing in the Southeast Asian fighting style of [[Eskrima|Kali]], he has taught classes in weapon awareness and use for military, law enforcement, and security organizations. Marcaida evaluates the smiths' weapons to determine their effectiveness in combat.<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> When he cannot test the smiths' weapons himself due to injury, he has a co-worker or family member perform this task in his place.\n\nTim Healy and Steve Ascher are executive producers for History.<ref name=\"1variety\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" /> Jodi Flynn, [[Brent Montgomery]], David George, Shawn Witt and Simon Thomas are executive producers for Outpost Entertainment.<ref name=\"1variety\" /><ref name=\"2deadline\" />  Healy observed the demonstration, and later the filming, from the sidelines. Healy says that the inspiration for ''Forged in Fire'' came from his and other developers' love of food competition shows such as ''[[Chopped (TV series)|Chopped]]'' and ''[[Iron Chef]]''.<ref name=\"4esquire\" /> However, in order to appeal to the History channel's audience, they decided to have the competition focus on historical weaponry.<ref name=\"4esquire\" />\n\n== Influence ==\nIn the city of [[Cohoes, New York]] near Albany, a man, inspired by the series, tried to forge a piece of metal over a fire in a barrel near his home.

Cotton is thus of great importance for agriculture, industry and trade, especially for [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] countries in [[Africa]], [[South America]] and [[Asia]]. Consequently, the genus ''Gossypium'' has long attracted the attention of scientists.\n\nThe origin of the genus ''Gossypium'' is dated to around 5\u201310&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=\"senchina\">David S.

Generally [[shrubs]] or shrub-like plants, the species of this genus are extraordinarily diverse in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[adaptation]], ranging from fire-adapted, [[herbaceous]] [[perennials]] in [[Australia]] to [[trees]] in [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"wendel1\" />\n\nCultivated cottons are perennial shrubs most often grown as annuals. Plants are 1\u20132&nbsp;m high in modern cropping systems, sometimes higher in traditional, multiannual cropping systems, now largely disappearing. The leaves are broad and lobed, with three to five (or rarely seven) lobes. The seeds are contained in a [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] called a \"boll\", each seed surrounded by fibres of two types. These fibres are the more commercially interesting part of the plant and they are separated from the seed by a process called [[ginning]]. At the first ginning, the longer fibres, called staples, are removed and these are twisted together to form yarn for making thread and weaving into high quality textiles. At the second ginning, the shorter fibres, called \"linters\", are removed, and these are woven into lower quality textiles (which include the eponymous [[Lint (material)|Lint]]). Commercial species of cotton plant are ''[[Gossypium hirsutum|G. hirsutum]]'' (>90% of world production), ''[[Gossypium barbadense|G. barbadense]]'' (3\u20134%), ''[[Gossypium arboreum|G. arboreum]]'' and ''[[Gossypium herbaceum|G. herbaceum]]'' (together, 2%).{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Many varieties of cotton have been developed by selective breeding and hybridization of these species.  Experiments are ongoing to cross-breed various desirable traits of wild cotton species into the principal commercial species, such as resistance to insects and diseases, and drought tolerance. Cotton fibres occur naturally in colours of white, brown, green, and some mixing of these.\n\nMost wild cottons are [[ploidy|diploid]], but a group of five species from America and Pacific islands are tetraploid, apparently due to a single hybridization event around 1.5 to 2 million years ago.<ref name=\"senchina\" /> The tetraploid species are ''[[Gossypium hirsutum|G. hirsutum]]'', ''[[Gossypium tomentosum|G. tomentosum]]'', ''[[Gossypium mustelinum|G. mustelinum]]'', ''[[Gossypium barbadense|G. barbadense]]'', and ''[[Gossypium darwinii|G. darwinii]]''.\n\n== Selected species ==\n=== Subgenus ''Gossypium'' ===\n* ''[[Gossypium arboreum]]'' <small>[[Carl Linnaeus|L.]]</small> \u2013 tree cotton ([[India]] and [[Pakistan]])\n* ''[[Gossypium herbaceum]]'' <small>L.</small> \u2013 Levant cotton (southern [[Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]])\n\n=== Subgenus ''Houzingenia'' ===\n* ''[[Gossypium raimondii]]'' <small>Ulbr.</small> \u2013 one of the putative progenitor species of [[tetraploid]] cotton, alongside ''G. arboreum''\n* ''[[Gossypium thurberi]]'' <small>Tod.</small> \u2013 Arizona wild cotton ([[Arizona]] and northern [[Mexico]])\n\n=== Subgenus ''Karpas'' ===\n* ''[[Gossypium barbadense]]'' <small>L.</small> \u2013 Creole cotton/Sea Island Cotton (tropical [[South America]])\n* ''[[Gossypium darwinii]]'' <small>G.Watt</small> \u2013 Darwin's cotton ([[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]])\n* ''[[Gossypium hirsutum]]'' <small>L.</small> \u2013 upland cotton ([[Central America]], [[Mexico]], the [[Caribbean]] and southern [[Florida]])\n* ''[[Gossypium mustelinum]]'' <small>Miers ex G.Watt</small>\n* ''[[Gossypium tomentosum]]'' <small>[[Thomas Nuttall|Nutt.]] ex Seem</small> \u2013 ''Ma\u02bbo'' or Hawaiian cotton ([[Hawaii]])\n\n=== Subgenus ''Sturtia'' ===\n* ''[[Gossypium australe]]'' <small>[[Ferdinand von Mueller|F.Muell]]</small> (northwestern [[Australia]])\n* ''[[Gossypium sturtianum]]'' <small>[[James Hamlyn Willis|J.H.

They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, [[allotetraploidy|allotetraploid]] cotton. \"Allotetraploid\" means that the genomes of these cotton species comprise two distinct subgenomes, referred to as the At and Dt (the 't' for tetraploid, to distinguish them from the A and D genomes of the related diploid species). The strategy is to sequence first the D-genome relative of allotetraploid cottons, ''G. raimondii'', a wild South American ([[Peru]], [[Ecuador]]) cotton species, because of its smaller size due essentially to less repetitive DNA (retrotransposons mainly). It has nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} The A genome of ''G. arboreum'', the 'Old-World' cotton species (grown in [[India]] in particular), would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of ''G. raimondii'''s. Once both A and D genome sequences are assembled, then research could begin to sequence the actual genomes of tetraploid cultivated cotton varieties.  This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences, respectively.  Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.\n\nThe public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources.  The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads.  These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome.  In 2010, two companies ([[Monsanto]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]]), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of ''G. raimondii'' about 50x.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Monsanto and Illumina Reach Key Milestone in Cotton Genome Sequencing|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|website = www.monsanto.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|last = APPDMZ\\gyoung|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042838/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-01}}</ref> They announced they would donate their raw reads to the public.

In 2010, two companies ([[Monsanto]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]]), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of ''G. raimondii'' about 50x.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Monsanto and Illumina Reach Key Milestone in Cotton Genome Sequencing|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|website = www.monsanto.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|last = APPDMZ\\gyoung|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042838/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-01}}</ref> They announced they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but a lot of hard work remains.\n\n== Cotton pests and diseases ==\n[[File:Gorskii 04431u.jpg|250px|thumb|Cotton field in [[Sukhumi Botanical Garden]], photo ''circa'' 1912]]\n\n=== Pests ===\n* [[Boll weevil]], ''Anthonomus grandis''\n* [[Cotton aphid]], ''Aphis gossypii''\n* [[Cotton stainer]], ''Dysdercus koenigii''\n* [[Cotton bollworm]], ''Helicoverpa zea'', and [[native budworm]], ''Helicoverpa punctigera'', are caterpillars that damage cotton crops.\n*: Some other [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) [[larva]]e also feed on cotton \u2013 see [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on cotton plants]].\n* [[Green mirid]] (''Creontiades dilutus''), a sucking insect\n* [[Spider mite]]s, ''Tetranychus urticae'', ''T. ludeni'' and ''T. lambi''\n* [[Thrips]], ''Thrips tabaci'' and ''Frankliniella schultzei''\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{See also|List of cotton diseases}}\n* [[Alternaria]] leaf spot, caused by ''[[Alternaria macrospora]]'' and ''[[Alternaria alternata]]''\n* [[Anthracnose boll rot]], caused by ''[[Colletotrichum gossypii]]''\n* [[Thielaviopsis|Black root rot]], caused by the fungus ''[[Thielaviopsis basicola]]''\n* Blight caused by [[Xanthomonas campestris pv. malvacearum|''Xanthomonas campestris'' pv.

He went up to 5th in the first race, and in the next race he was battled with [[Marcus Armstrong]] for the victory, but at the final lap made contact.
