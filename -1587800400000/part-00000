Since the express tracks do not have platforms at several stations in central Tokyo, even the slowest services of the Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) skip such stations and are therefore called {{nihongo|\"Rapid\"|\u5feb\u901f}}. In addition to the basic type of \"Rapid\", there are some variations of the service types with fewer stops.\n\n===Rapid (\u5feb\u901f)===\n:This service is the most common on the Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) route. They stop at all stations west of {{STN|Nakano|Tokyo}}. After Nakano, it stops at Shinjuku, Yotsuya, Ochanomizu, and Kanda stations before arrival in T\u014dky\u014d Terminal. On weekends and holidays, trains do not stop at {{STN|Asagaya}}, {{STN|K\u014denji}}, and {{STN|Nishi-Ogikubo}} stations. \n:They run between Tokyo on the east side, and Takao/Otsuki on the west side, though some westbound services terminate at stations before Takao, such as Musashi-Koganei, Tachikawa, Toyoda and Hachioji.\n:Some trains operate through services to the [[\u014cme Line]] (to as far as \u014cme/from Okutama) , [[Itsukaichi Line]] (to/from Musashi-Itsukaichi, via Haijima on the \u014cme Line), [[Hachik\u014d Line|Hachiko Line]] (to/from as far as Komagawa, via Haijima on the \u014cme Line) or the [[Fujikyuko Line|Fuji Kyuko Line]] (to/from Kawguchiko, via \u014ctsuki).  \n:The service's signature color on service diagrams is orange (<span style=\"color:#F15A22;\">\u25a0</span>).\n<gallery>\nFile:Chuuohkaisoku.jpg|Rapid LED Display\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u016b\u014d Special Rapid (\u4e2d\u592e\u7279\u5feb) {{\u2022}}\u014cme Special Rapid (\u9752\u6885\u7279\u5feb)===\n:Four services per hour in off-peak hours make limited stops between Tokyo and {{STN|Tachikawa}}. These two services stop at the same stations that Rapid services would stop between Tokyo and Nakano. After Nakano, these services only stop at Mitaka, Kokubunji and Tachikawa, and stop at all stations west of Tachikawa. Eastbound services continue from Nakano as a rapid service.\n:Ch\u016b\u014d Special Rapid stays on the Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line to Takao and \u014ctsuki, and some services operate beyond \u014ctsuki to the Fuji Kyuko Line towards Kawaguchiko.\n:\u014cme Special Rapid spurs to the [[\u014cme Line]] towards \u014cme, stopping at all stations within the line. \n:The service's signature color on service diagrams is blue (<span style=\"color:blue\">\u25a0</span>) for Ch\u016b\u014d Special Rapid and green (<span style=\"color:green\">\u25a0</span>) for \u014cme Special Rapid. \n<gallery>\nFile:JR East E233-0 Series T42 Chuo Special Rapid.jpg|Ch\u016b\u014d Special Rapid\nFile:Chuuohtokkai.jpg|Ch\u016b\u014d Special Rapid LED Display\nFile:JR East E233-0 Series T3 Oume Special Rapid.jpg|\u014cme Special Rapid\nFile:Oumetokkai.jpg|\u014cme Special Rapid LED Display\n</gallery>\n\n===Commuter Rapid (\u901a\u52e4\u5feb\u901f)===\n:Commuter Rapid services operates weekday evening. It starts service in Tokyo heading west, and stops at Ogikubo and Kichij\u014dji in addition to the stops of the two Special Rapids. They mostly terminate at Takao, though a few trains go further to \u014ctsuki, or operate through services to Kawaguchiko on the Fuji Kyuko Line, or to \u014cme on the \u014cme Line. Again, through services to the \u014cme Line or the Fuji Kyuko Line stops at all stations on their respective lines.\n:The service's signature color on service diagrams is purple (<span style=\"color:#6600CC\">\u25a0</span>).\n<gallery>\nFile:JR East E233-0 set H43 Commuter Rapid.jpg|Commuter Rapid\nFile:Tsuukinkaisoku.jpg|Commuter Rapid LED Display\n</gallery>\n\n===Commuter Special Rapid (\u901a\u52e4\u7279\u5feb)===\n:This service only operates on weekday towards Tokyo, where two originates from \u014ctsuki, two from \u014cme on the \u014cme Line, and one from Takao. It stops at all stations until Takao, Hachi\u014dji, Tachikawa, Kokubunji, and Shinjuku and continues as a rapid service from Shinjuku.

By 1930, the EMU service had reached Tokyo to the east and Asakawa (now Takao) to the west. In 1933, two tracks were added to the existing double-tracked section between Ochanomizu and Iidamachi stations (later closed) to complete the four-track line between Ochanomizu and Nakano. On these additional tracks, {{nihongo|express trains|\u6025\u884c\u96fb\u8eca|ky\u016bk\u014d densha}}, which skipped all stations except Yotsuya and Shinjuku, were introduced the same year. The express service was renamed {{nihongo|\"Rapid\"|\u5feb\u901f|kaisoku}} service in March 1961.\n\nInitially, the operation of express/rapid services was limited to weekday peak periods only. Express service began on weekends on March 5, 1944; daytime non-peak operation began on November 9, 1959, but it was limited to weekdays only until April 28, 1966. All day rapid service trains are available since March 14, 2020, when early morning and late night rapid operations began.<ref name=\"no_local\"/>\n\nManseibashi Station, located between Kanda and Ochanomizu, was closed in 1943. On the section east of Takao, only Nishi-Kokubunji Station (opened in 1973) and Nishi-Hachi\u014dji Station (opened in 1939) were opened after the start of rapid services.\n\n*August 20, 1979: [[201 series]] EMUs introduced\n*March 16, 1991: ''Ohay\u014d Liner Takao/\u014cme'' and ''Home Liner Takao/\u014cme'' begin operation\n*April 10, 1993: Kokubunji Station added to \u014cme Special Rapid stops; Commuter Special Rapid begins operation\n*December 1, 1997: [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line]]-bound [[115 series]] EMUs no longer service Shinjuku Station\n*October 5, 2005: [[Women-only passenger car|Women-only cars]] introduced\n*December 26, 2006: [[E233 series]] EMUs introduced\n*March 16, 2019: [[209 series#209-1000 series|209-1000 series]] EMUs commence service.\n\n==Future developments==\nJR East plans to introduce Green (first class) cars on Chuo Line (Rapid) and Ome Line services from fiscal 2021 or later.<ref name=\"sankei20170324\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sankei.com/economy/news/170324/ecn1703240001-n1.html |script-title=ja: \uff2a\uff32\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u3001\u4e2d\u592e\u7dda\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u8eca\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u5ef6\u671f |trans-title=JR East to postpone Chuo Line Green car plans |date= 24 March 2017 |work= Sankei News |publisher= The Sankei Shimbun & Sankei Digital |location= Japan|language= Japanese|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170324015739/http://www.sankei.com/economy/news/170324/ecn1703240001-n1.html |archive-date= 24 March 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate= 24 March 2017}}</ref> This will involve adding two bilevel Green cars to 10-car and 6-car E233 series EMU sets, forming 12-car and 8-car sets.

The official map shows services travel as far as [[\u014ctsuki Station|Otsuki]].\n\n==Basic data==\n*Operator: [[East Japan Railway Company]] (Services and tracks)\n**Tokyo &ndash; Takao: {{convert|53.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n*Double-tracked section: Entire line\n*[[Railway signalling]]: [[Automatic Train Stop|ATS]]\n*[[Centralized traffic control|CTC]] center: Tokyo Operations Control Center\n\n==Services==\n[[File:ChuoRapidLineStops 20200314.svg|1350x1350px]]\n\nAlthough the Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) designation only refers to the section between Tokyo and Takao stations, many trains continue on past Takao to \u014ctsuki, with some trains operating through services to other lines. These include both limited express and various special rapid services. For details, see the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line]] article. In addition, Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) trains do not stop at some stations between Ochanomizu and Nakano stations; for information on those services, see the [[Ch\u016b\u014d-S\u014dbu Line]] article.\n\nThe Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) uses the two express tracks on the four-track section between Ochanomizu and Mitaka stations. Past Mitaka, trains use both tracks on the remaining double-track section. Since the express tracks do not have platforms at several stations in central Tokyo, even the slowest services of the Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) skip such stations and are therefore called {{nihongo|\"Rapid\"|\u5feb\u901f}}. In addition to the basic type of \"Rapid\", there are some variations of the service types with fewer stops.\n\n===Rapid (\u5feb\u901f)===\n:This service is the most common on the Ch\u016b\u014d Line (Rapid) route. They stop at all stations west of {{STN|Nakano|Tokyo}}. After Nakano, it stops at Shinjuku, Yotsuya, Ochanomizu, and Kanda stations before arrival in T\u014dky\u014d Terminal. On weekends and holidays, trains do not stop at {{STN|Asagaya}}, {{STN|K\u014denji}}, and {{STN|Nishi-Ogikubo}} stations. \n:They run between Tokyo on the east side, and Takao/Otsuki on the west side, though some westbound services terminate at stations before Takao, such as Musashi-Koganei, Tachikawa, Toyoda and Hachioji.\n:Some trains operate through services to the [[\u014cme Line]] (to as far as \u014cme/from Okutama) , [[Itsukaichi Line]] (to/from Musashi-Itsukaichi, via Haijima on the \u014cme Line), [[Hachik\u014d Line|Hachiko Line]] (to/from as far as Komagawa, via Haijima on the \u014cme Line) or the [[Fujikyuko Line|Fuji Kyuko Line]] (to/from Kawguchiko, via \u014ctsuki).  \n:The service's signature color on service diagrams is orange (<span style=\"color:#F15A22;\">\u25a0</span>).\n<gallery>\nFile:Chuuohkaisoku.jpg|Rapid LED Display\n</gallery>\n\n===Ch\u016b\u014d Special Rapid (\u4e2d\u592e\u7279\u5feb) {{\u2022}}\u014cme Special Rapid (\u9752\u6885\u7279\u5feb)===\n:Four services per hour in off-peak hours make limited stops between Tokyo and {{STN|Tachikawa}}.

By 1930, the EMU service had reached Tokyo to the east and Asakawa (now Takao) to the west. In 1933, two tracks were added to the existing double-tracked section between Ochanomizu and Iidamachi stations (later closed) to complete the four-track line between Ochanomizu and Nakano. On these additional tracks, {{nihongo|express trains|\u6025\u884c\u96fb\u8eca|ky\u016bk\u014d densha}}, which skipped all stations except Yotsuya and Shinjuku, were introduced the same year. The express service was renamed {{nihongo|\"Rapid\"|\u5feb\u901f|kaisoku}} service in March 1961.\n\nInitially, the operation of express/rapid services was limited to weekday peak periods only. Express service began on weekends on March 5, 1944; daytime non-peak operation began on November 9, 1959, but it was limited to weekdays only until April 28, 1966. All day rapid service trains are available since March 14, 2020, when early morning and late night rapid operations began.<ref name=\"no_local\"/>\n\nManseibashi Station, located between Kanda and Ochanomizu, was closed in 1943. On the section east of Takao, only Nishi-Kokubunji Station (opened in 1973) and Nishi-Hachi\u014dji Station (opened in 1939) were opened after the start of rapid services.\n\n*August 20, 1979: [[201 series]] EMUs introduced\n*March 16, 1991: ''Ohay\u014d Liner Takao/\u014cme'' and ''Home Liner Takao/\u014cme'' begin operation\n*April 10, 1993: Kokubunji Station added to \u014cme Special Rapid stops; Commuter Special Rapid begins operation\n*December 1, 1997: [[Ch\u016b\u014d Main Line]]-bound [[115 series]] EMUs no longer service Shinjuku Station\n*October 5, 2005: [[Women-only passenger car|Women-only cars]] introduced\n*December 26, 2006: [[E233 series]] EMUs introduced\n*March 16, 2019: [[209 series#209-1000 series|209-1000 series]] EMUs commence service.\n\n==Future developments==\nJR East plans to introduce Green (first class) cars on Chuo Line (Rapid) and Ome Line services from fiscal 2021 or later.<ref name=\"sankei20170324\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sankei.com/economy/news/170324/ecn1703240001-n1.html |script-title=ja: \uff2a\uff32\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u3001\u4e2d\u592e\u7dda\u306e\u30b0\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u8eca\u8a08\u753b\u3092\u5ef6\u671f |trans-title=JR East to postpone Chuo Line Green car plans |date= 24 March 2017 |work= Sankei News |publisher= The Sankei Shimbun & Sankei Digital |location= Japan|language= Japanese|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170324015739/http://www.sankei.com/economy/news/170324/ecn1703240001-n1.html |archive-date= 24 March 2017 |url-status=live |accessdate= 24 March 2017}}</ref> This will involve adding two bilevel Green cars to 10-car and 6-car E233 series EMU sets, forming 12-car and 8-car sets.

M\u00e1el Coluim's [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] name could indicate that he was born during either an era of amiable relations with the Scots, or else during a period of Scottish overlordship. In 945, the [[Edmund I, King of the English]] invaded the kingdom, and appears to have granted the Scots permission to dominate the Cumbrians. The English king is further reported to have blinded several of M\u00e1el Coluim's brothers in an act that could have been an attempt to deprive Dyfnwal of an heir.\n\nIt is unknown when Dyfnwal's reign came to an end. There is reason to suspect that a certain [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]] was a son of his, and that this man ruled when he assassinated the reigning [[King of Alba]] in 971. Certainly by 973, M\u00e1el Coluim was associated with the kingship, as both he and his father are recorded to have been participated in a remarkable meeting of kings assembled by [[Edgar, King of the English]]. The context of this assembly is not entirely clear. It could have concerned the stability of the border between the [[Kingdom of England|English realm]] and that of the [[Kingdom of Alba|Scots]] and Cumbrians. It could have also focused upon lurking threat of [[Vikings]] based in [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] and [[Kingdom of the Isles|the Isles]].\n\nM\u00e1el Coluim's father died in 975, having set off upon a pilgrimage to Rome. Quite when M\u00e1el Coluim succeeded Dyfnwal is uncertain. It could have been before, during, or after the assembly of 973. In any case, M\u00e1el Coluim's reign was evidently unremarkable, although the tenth-century ''[[Saltair na Rann]]'' preserves several lines of verse in his praise. M\u00e1el Coluim appears to have been succeeded by a brother, [[Owain ap Dyfnwal (died 1015)|Owain]].

Strathclyde]], and thus a member of the Cumbrian dynasty that had ruled the kingdom for generations. M\u00e1el Coluim's [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] name could indicate that he was born during either an era of amiable relations with the Scots, or else during a period of Scottish overlordship. In 945, the [[Edmund I, King of the English]] invaded the kingdom, and appears to have granted the Scots permission to dominate the Cumbrians. The English king is further reported to have blinded several of M\u00e1el Coluim's brothers in an act that could have been an attempt to deprive Dyfnwal of an heir.\n\nIt is unknown when Dyfnwal's reign came to an end. There is reason to suspect that a certain [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]] was a son of his, and that this man ruled when he assassinated the reigning [[King of Alba]] in 971. Certainly by 973, M\u00e1el Coluim was associated with the kingship, as both he and his father are recorded to have been participated in a remarkable meeting of kings assembled by [[Edgar, King of the English]]. The context of this assembly is not entirely clear. It could have concerned the stability of the border between the [[Kingdom of England|English realm]] and that of the [[Kingdom of Alba|Scots]] and Cumbrians. It could have also focused upon lurking threat of [[Vikings]] based in [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]] and [[Kingdom of the Isles|the Isles]].\n\nM\u00e1el Coluim's father died in 975, having set off upon a pilgrimage to Rome. Quite when M\u00e1el Coluim succeeded Dyfnwal is uncertain. It could have been before, during, or after the assembly of 973. In any case, M\u00e1el Coluim's reign was evidently unremarkable, although the tenth-century ''[[Saltair na Rann]]'' preserves several lines of verse in his praise.

{"title_page": "Circle of fifths", "text_new": "{{short description|Relationship among the 12 tones of the chromatic scale, their corresponding key signatures, and the associated major and minor keys;geometrical representation of relationships among the 12 pitch classes of the chromatic scale in pitch class space}}\n[[Image:Circle of fifths deluxe 4.svg|thumb|right|400px|Circle of fifths showing major and minor keys]]\n[[Image:Diletsky circle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nikolay Diletsky]]'s circle of fifths in ''Idea grammatiki musikiyskoy'' (Moscow, 1679)]]\n\nIn [[music theory]], the '''circle of fifths''' (or '''[[Circle of fifths#Structure and use|circle of fourths]]''') is the relationship among the 12 tones (or [[Pitch (music)|pitches]]) of the [[chromatic scale]], their corresponding [[key signature]]s, and the associated [[major and minor]] keys. More specifically, it is a [[Geometry|geometrical]] representation of relationships among the 12 [[pitch class]]es of the chromatic scale in [[pitch class space]].\n\n== Definition ==\nThe term \"[[Perfect fifth|fifth]]\" defines an interval or mathematical ratio, which is the closest and most [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] non-octave interval. The circle of fifths is a sequence of pitches or key tonalities, represented as a circle, in which the next pitch (turning clockwise) is found seven [[semitone]]s higher than the last. [[Musician]]s and [[composer]]s use the circle of fifths to understand and describe the musical relationships among some selection of those pitches. The circle's design is helpful in [[Musical composition|composing]] and [[Harmony|harmonizing]] [[melodies]], building [[chord (music)|chords]], and modulating to different [[key (music)|keys]] within a composition.<ref>Michael Pilhofer and Holly Day (23 Feb 2009). [http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-circle-of-fifths-a-brief-history.html \"The Circle of Fifths: A Brief History\"], www.dummies.com.</ref>\n\nAt the top of the circle, the [[Key (music)|key]] of C Major has no [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] or [[Flat (music)|flats]].  Starting from the apex and proceeding clockwise by ascending [[Perfect fifth|fifths]], the key of G has one sharp, the key of D has 2 sharps, and so on. Similarly, proceeding counterclockwise from the apex by descending fifths, the key of F has one flat, the key of B{{music|flat}} has 2 flats, and so on. At the bottom of the circle, the sharp and flat keys overlap, showing pairs of [[enharmonically equivalent]] key signatures.\n\nStarting at any [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], ascending by the [[interval (music)|interval]] of an [[Equal temperament|equal tempered]] [[perfect fifth|fifth]], one passes all twelve tones clockwise, to return to the beginning pitch class. To pass the twelve tones counterclockwise, it is necessary to ascend by [[perfect fourth]]s, rather than fifths. (To the ear, the sequence of fourths gives an impression of settling, or resolution; see [[Cadence (music)|cadence]].)\n\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"50px\" perrow=\"1\">\nImage:Circle of fifths ascending within octave.svg|{{audio|Circle of fifths ascending within octave.mid|Play circle of fifths clockwise within one octave}}\nImage:Circle of fifths descending within octave.png|{{audio|Circle of fifths descending within octave.mid|Play circle of fifths counterclockwise within one octave}}\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure and use==\nPitches within the chromatic scale are related not only by the number of semitones between them within the chromatic scale, but also related harmonically within the circle of fifths. Moving counterclockwise the direction of the circle of fifths gives the '''circle of fourths'''.  Typically the \"circle of fifths\" is used in the analysis of classical music, whereas the \"circle of fourths\" is used in the analysis of jazz music, but this distinction is not exclusive. The \"circle of fifths\" is a requirement in the barbershop style as the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s Contest and Judging Handbook says the barbershop style consists of  \"seventh chords that often resolve around the circle of fifths, while also making use of other resolutions\", among other requirements.\n\n===Diatonic key signatures===\nThe circle is commonly used to represent the relationship between [[diatonic scale]]s. Here, the letters on the circle are taken to represent the major scale with that note as tonic. The numbers on the inside of the circle show how many sharps or flats the [[key signature]] for this scale has. Thus a major scale built on A has 3 sharps in its key signature. The major scale built on F has 1 flat.\n\nFor [[minor scale]]s, rotate the letters counter-clockwise by 3, so that, e.g., A minor has 0 sharps or flats and E minor has 1 sharp. (See [[relative key]] for details.) A way to describe this phenomenon is that, for any major key [e.g. G major, with one sharp (F{{music|sharp}}) in its diatonic scale], a scale can be built beginning on the sixth (VI) degree (relative minor key, in this case, E) containing the same notes, but from E\u2013E as opposed to G\u2013G. Or, G-major scale (G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013G) is enharmonic (harmonically equivalent) to the e-minor scale (E\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E).\n\nWhen notating the key signatures, the order of sharps that are found at the beginning of the staff line follows the circle of fifths from F through B. The order is F, C, G, D, A, E, B. If there is only one sharp, such as in the key of G major, then the one sharp is F sharp. If there are two sharps, the two are F and C, and they appear in that order in the key signature. The order of sharps goes clockwise around the circle of fifths. (For major keys, the last sharp is on the seventh scale degree. The tonic (key note) is one half-step above the last sharp.)\n\nFor notating flats, the order is reversed: B, E, A, D, G, C, F. This order runs counter-clockwise along the circle of fifths; in other words they progress by fourths. Following the major keys from the key of F to the key of C flat (B) counter-clockwise around the circle of fifths, as each key signature adds a flat, the flats always occur in this order. (For major keys, the penultimate (second to last) flat in the key signature is on the tonic. With only one flat, the key of F does not follow this pattern.)\n\n===Modulation and chord progression===\n[[Tonality|Tonal music]] often [[modulation (music)|modulates]] by moving between adjacent scales on the circle of fifths. This is because diatonic scales contain seven pitch classes that are contiguous on the circle of fifths. It follows that diatonic scales a perfect fifth apart share six of their seven notes. Furthermore, the notes not held in common differ by only a semitone. Thus modulation by perfect fifth can be accomplished in an exceptionally smooth fashion. For example, to move from the C major scale F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B to the G major scale C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B\u2013F{{music|sharp}}, one need only move the C major scale's \"F\" to \"F{{music|sharp}}\".\n\nThe circle can be easily used to find out the common chord progression for basic keys. The circle of fifths shows every major key with its corresponding minor key (of the Aeolian mode). This can be used as the vi chord in a progression. The V and IV chord can be found by moving clockwise and counterclockwise from the root chord respectively. The corresponding minor keys of the V and IV are the iii and ii respectively.\n\nThe major and minor chords in each major key:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" {{diagonal split header|Key|&nbsp; Chord}}\n! scope=\"col\" | I\n! scope=\"col\" | ii\n! scope=\"col\" | iii\n! scope=\"col\" | IV\n! scope=\"col\" | V\n! scope=\"col\" | vi\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C major\n|C || Dm || Em || F || G || Am\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G major\n|G || Am || Bm || C || D || Em\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D major\n|D || Em || F{{music|#}}m || G || A || Bm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A major\n|A || Bm || C{{music|#}}m || D || E || F{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E major\n|E || F{{music|#}}m || G{{music|#}}m || A || B || C{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B major\n|B || C{{music|#}}m || D{{music|#}}m || E || F{{music|#}} || G{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F{{music|#}} major\n|F{{music|#}} || G{{music|#}}m || A{{music|#}}m || B || C{{music|#}} || D{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C{{music|#}} major\n|C{{music|#}} || D{{music|#}}m || E{{music|#}}m || F{{music|#}} || G{{music|#}} || A{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C{{music|b}} major\n|C{{music|b}} || D{{music|b}}m || E{{music|b}}m || F{{music|b}} || G{{music|b}} || A{{music|b}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G{{music|b}} major\n|G{{music|b}} || A{{music|b}}m || B{{music|b}}m || C{{music|b}} || D{{music|b}} || E{{music|b}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D{{music|b}} major\n|D{{music|b}} || E{{music|b}}m || Fm || G{{music|b}} || A{{music|b}} || B{{music|b}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A{{music|b}} major\n|A{{music|b}} || B{{music|b}}m || Cm || D{{music|b}} || E{{music|b}} || Fm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E{{music|b}} major\n|E{{music|b}} || Fm || Gm || A{{music|b}} || B{{music|b}} || Cm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B{{music|b}} major\n|B{{music|b}} || Cm || Dm || E{{music|b}} || F || Gm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F major\n|F || Gm || Am || B{{music|b}} || C || Dm\n|}\n\nIn Western tonal music, one also finds [[chord progression]]s between chords whose roots are related by perfect fifth. For instance, root progressions such as D\u2013G\u2013C are common. For this reason, the circle of fifths can often be used to represent \"harmonic distance\" between chords.\n\n[[File:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|left|IV\u2013V\u2013I, in C {{audio|IV-V-I in C.mid|Play}}]]\nAccording to theorists including [[Richard Franko Goldman|Goldman]], [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] (the use, role, and relation of [[chord (music)|chords]] in [[harmony]]), including \"functional succession\", may be \"explained by the circle of fifths (in which, therefore, [[scale degree]] II is closer to the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] than scale degree IV)\".{{sfn|Nattiez|1990|p=225}} In this view the tonic is considered the end of the line towards which a [[chord progression]] derived from the circle of fifths progresses.\n\n[[File:Ii-V-I turnaround in C.png|thumb|right|[[ii\u2013V\u2013I progression]], in C {{audio|Ii-V-I turnaround in C.mid|Play subdominant, supertonic seventh, and supertonic chords}} illustrating the similarity between them.]]\nAccording to Goldman's ''Harmony in Western Music'', \"the IV chord is actually, in the simplest mechanisms of diatonic relationships, at the greatest distance from I. In terms of the [descending] circle of fifths, it leads away from I, rather than toward it.\"<ref name=\"Goldman 68\">{{harvnb|Goldman|1965|p=68}}.</ref> Thus the progression I\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I (an [[authentic cadence]]) would feel more final or [[resolution (music)|resolved]] than I\u2013IV\u2013I (a [[plagal cadence]]). Goldman<ref>{{harvnb|Goldman|1965|loc=chapter 3}}.</ref> concurs with Nattiez, who argues that \"the chord on the fourth degree appears long before the chord on II, and the subsequent final I, in the progression I\u2013IV\u2013vii<sup>o</sup>\u2013iii\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I\", and is farther from the tonic there as well.<ref name=\"Nattiez 226\">{{harvnb|Nattiez|1990|p=226}}.</ref> (In this and related articles, upper-case Roman numerals indicate major triads while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads.)\n\n[[File:IV frente ii7 sin raiz.png|thumb|left|IV vs. ii<sup>7</sup> with root in parenthesis, in C {{audio|Subdominant and supertonic similarity.mid|Play}}.]]\nGoldman argues that \"historically the use of the IV chord in harmonic design, and especially in [[cadence (music)|cadences]], exhibits some curious features. By and large, one can say that the use of IV in final cadences becomes more common in the nineteenth century than it was in the eighteenth, but that it may also be understood as a substitute for the ii chord when it precedes V. It may also be quite logically construed as an incomplete ii7 chord (lacking root).\"<ref name=\"Goldman 68\" /> The delayed acceptance of the IV\u2013I in final cadences is explained aesthetically by its lack of closure, caused by its position in the circle of fifths. The earlier use of IV\u2013V\u2013I is explained by proposing a relation between IV and ii, allowing IV to substitute for or serve as ii. However, Nattiez calls this latter argument \"a narrow escape: only the theory of a ii chord without a [[root (chord)|root]] allows Goldman to maintain that the circle of fifths is completely valid from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]\", or the entire [[common practice period]].<ref name=\"Nattiez 226\" />\n\n===Circle closure in non-equal tuning systems===\nWhen an instrument is tuned with the [[equal temperament]] system, the width of the fifths is such that the circle \"closes\". This means that ascending by twelve fifths from any pitch, one returns to a tone exactly in the same pitch class as the initial tone, and exactly seven [[octave]]s above it. To obtain such a perfect circle closure, the fifth is slightly flattened with respect to its [[just intonation]] (3:2 [[interval ratio]]).\n\nThus, ascending by justly tuned fifths fails to close the circle by an excess of approximately 23.46 [[Cent (music)|cents]], roughly a quarter of a [[semitone]], an interval known as the [[Pythagorean comma]]. In Pythagorean tuning, this problem is solved by markedly shortening the [[interval (music)|width]] of one of the twelve fifths, which makes it severely [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]]. This anomalous fifth is called [[wolf fifth]] as a humorous metaphor of the unpleasant sound of the note (like a wolf trying to howl an off-pitch note). The [[quarter-comma meantone]] tuning system uses eleven fifths slightly narrower than the equally tempered fifth, and requires a much wider and even more dissonant wolf fifth to close the circle. More complex tuning systems based on [[just intonation]], such as [[5-limit tuning]], use at most eight justly tuned fifths and at least three non-just fifths (some slightly narrower, and some slightly wider than the just fifth) to close the circle. Other tuning systems use up to [[53 equal temperament|53&nbsp;tones]] (the original 12&nbsp;tones and 42&nbsp;more between them) in order to close the circle of fifths.\n\n===In lay terms===\n{{infobox|bodyclass=collapsible collapsed\n|above = Playing the circle of fifths\n|abovestyle = font-size:100%\n|image1 =\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=none|width=220\n| image1 = Circle of fifths within oc.png|caption1=1 octave, fourths, descending\n| image2 = Circle of fifths ascend wi.png|caption2=1 octave, fifths, ascending\n| image3 = Circle of fifths a 2 octave.png|caption3=2 octave, fifths, ascending\n| image4 = Circle of fifths d 2 octave.png|caption4=2 octave, fourths, descending\n| image5 = Circle of fourths 2 octave.png|caption5=2 octave, fourths, ascending\n| image6 = Circle of fourths d 2 octa.png|caption6=2 octave, fifths, descending\n| image7 = Circle of fifths on A.png|caption7=multi octave, fifths, ascending\n| image8 = Circle of fifths d on A.png|caption8=multi octave, fourths, descending\n| image9 = Circle of fourths on A.png|caption9=multi octave, fourths, ascending\n}}\n}}\nA simple way to see the [[Interval (music)|musical interval]] known as a [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] is by looking at a [[Musical keyboard|piano keyboard]], and, starting at any key, counting seven keys to the right (both black and white, not including the first) to get to the next note on the circle shown above. Seven [[half step]]s, the distance from the 1st to the 8th key on a piano is a \"perfect fifth\", called 'perfect' because it is neither major nor minor, but applies to both major and minor scales and chords, and a 'fifth' because, although it is a distance of seven semitones on a keyboard, it spans five adjacent notes in the major or minor scale.\n\nA simple way to hear the relationship between these notes is by playing them on a piano keyboard. When traversing the circle of fifths backwards, the notes will feel as though they fall into each other{{clarify|date=March 2018}}. This aural relationship is what the mathematics describe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nPerfect fifths may be [[Just intonation|justly tuned]] or [[Musical temperament|tempered]]. Two notes whose frequencies differ by a ratio of 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does not return to the original [[pitch class]] after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly detuned, or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]], or played in any [[Key (music)|key]] on a piano or other fixed-pitch instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] and [[fret]]ted) instruments today, twelve-tone [[equal temperament]], uses an irrational multiplier, 2<sup>1/12</sup>, to calculate the frequency difference of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a frequency ratio of 2<sup>7/12</sup>:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Heinichen musicalischer circul.png|thumb|[[Johann David Heinichen|Heinichen]]'s musical circle (German: ''musicalischer circul'')(1711)]]\n\nIn the late 1670s a [[treatise]] called ''Grammatika'' was written by the Ukrainian composer and theorist [[Nikolay Diletsky|Mykola Dylets'kiy]]. Diletskii\u2019s ''Grammatika'' is a treatise on composition, \"the first of its kind, aimed at teaching a Russian audience how to write Western-style polyphonic compositions.\" It taught how to write ''kontserty'', [[polyphonic]] [[a cappella]] works normally based on [[liturgical]] texts and created by putting together musical sections that have contrasting [[rhythm]], meters, [[melodic]] material and [[vocal]] groupings. Diletskii intended his treatise to be a guide to composition but pertaining to the rules of [[music theory]].

A key difference between the two circles is that the [[chromatic circle]] can be understood as a continuous space where every point on the circle corresponds to a conceivable [[pitch class]], and every conceivable pitch class corresponds to a point on the circle.  By contrast, the circle of fifths is fundamentally a ''discrete'' structure, and there is no obvious way to assign pitch classes to each of its points.  In this sense, the two circles are mathematically quite different.\n\nHowever, the twelve equal-tempered [[pitch class]]es can be represented by the [[cyclic group]] of order twelve, or equivalently, the [[modular arithmetic|residue classes]] modulo twelve, <math> \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} </math>.  The group <math> \\mathbb{Z}_{12} </math> has four generators, which can be identified with the ascending and descending semitones and the ascending and descending perfect fifths.  The semitonal generator gives rise to the [[chromatic circle]] while the perfect fifth gives rise to the circle of fifths.\n\n===Relation with chromatic scale===\n{{Main|Chromatic scale}}\n\n[[Image:Pitch class space star.svg|thumb|right|The circle of fifths drawn within the chromatic circle as a [[star polygon|star]] [[dodecagram]].{{sfn|McCartin|1998|p=364}}]]\nThe circle of fifths, or fourths, may be mapped from the [[chromatic scale]] by [[multiplication]], and vice versa. To map between the circle of fifths and the chromatic scale (in [[integer notation]]) multiply by 7 ([[twelve-tone technique|M7]]), and for the circle of fourths multiply by 5 (P5).\n\nHere is a demonstration of this procedure.  Start off with an [[order theory|ordered]] 12-tuple ([[tone row]]) of integers\n: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\nrepresenting the notes of the chromatic scale: 0 = C, 2 = D, 4 = E, 5 = F, 7 = G, 9 = A, 11 = B, 1 = C{{music|sharp}}, 3 = D{{music|sharp}}, 6 = F{{music|sharp}}, 8 = G{{music|sharp}}, 10 = A{{music|sharp}}.  Now multiply the entire 12-tuple by 7:\n: (0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77)\nand then apply a [[modulo operation|modulo]] 12 reduction to each of the numbers (subtract 12 from each number as many times as necessary until the number becomes smaller than 12):\n: (0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11, 6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5)\nwhich is equivalent to\n: (C, G, D, A, E, B, F{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}, A{{music|sharp}}, F)\nwhich is the circle of fifths.\nNote that this is [[enharmonic]]ally equivalent to:\n: (C, G, D, A, E, B, G{{music|flat}}, D{{music|flat}}, A{{music|flat}}, E{{music|flat}}, B{{music|flat}}, F).\n\n===Enharmonic equivalents and theoretical keys===\n{{main|Theoretical key}}\nThe key signatures found on the bottom of the circle of fifths diagram, such as D{{music|flat}} major, are often written one way in flats and in another way using sharps. These keys are easily interchanged using enharmonic equivalents. Enharmonic means that the notes sound the same, but are written differently. For example, the key signature of D{{Music|flat}} major, with five flats, contains the same sounding notes, enharmonically, as C{{music|sharp}} major (seven sharps).\n\nAfter C{{music|sharp}} comes the key of G{{music|sharp}} (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A{{music|flat}}). The \u201ceighth sharp\u201d is placed on the F{{music|sharp}}, to make it F{{music|doublesharp}}. The key of D{{music|sharp}}, with nine sharps, has another sharp placed on the C{{music|sharp}}, making it C{{music|doublesharp}}. The same is true for key signatures with flats; The key of E (four sharps) is equivalent to the key of F{{music|flat}} (again, one fifth below the key of C{{music|flat}}, following the pattern of flat key signatures). The last flat is placed on the B{{music|flat}}, making it B{{music|doubleflat}}. Such keys with double accidentals in the key signatures are called [[theoretical key]]s: the appearance of their key signatures is extremely rare, but they are sometimes tonicised in the course of a work (particularly if the home key was already heavily sharped or flatted).\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\relative c' {\n  \\key gis \\major\n\\set Staff.printKeyCancellation = ##f\n <gis' bis dis>\n\\bar \"||\"\n  \\key dis \\major\n <dis fisis ais>\n\\bar \"||\"\n  \\key fes \\major\n <fes as ces>\n\\bar \"||\"\n  \\key beses \\major\n <beses des fes>\n}\n</score>\n\nThere does not appear to be a standard on how to notate theoretical key signatures:\n\n*The default behaviour of [[LilyPond]] (pictured above) writes all single sharps (flats) in the circle-of-fifths order, before proceeding to the double sharps. This is the format used in [[John Foulds]]' ''A World Requiem'', Op. 60, which ends with the key signature of G{{music|#}} major (exactly as displayed above, [https://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/5/59/IMSLP527245-PMLP756657-JFoulds_A_World_Requiem,_Op.60_vocalscore.pdf pp. 153ff.]) The sharps in the key signature of G{{music|#}} major here proceed C{{music|#}}, G{{music|#}}, D{{music|#}}, A{{music|#}}, E{{music|#}}, B{{music|#}}, F{{music|x}}.\n*The single sharps or flats at the beginning are sometimes repeated as a courtesy, e.g. [[Max Reger]]'s ''Supplement to the Theory of Modulation'', which contains D{{music|b}} minor key signatures on [https://archive.org/details/supplementtotheo00rege/page/42/mode/2up pp. 42\u201345]. These have a B{{music|b}} at the start and also a B{{music|bb}} at the end (with a double-flat symbol), going B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, F{{music|b}}, B{{music|bb}}. The convention of LilyPond and Foulds would suppress the initial B{{music|b}}.\n*Sometimes the double signs are written at the beginning of the key signature, followed by the single signs. For example, the F{{music|b}} key signature is notated as B{{music|bb}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, F{{music|b}}.

More specifically, it is a [[Geometry|geometrical]] representation of relationships among the 12 [[pitch class]]es of the chromatic scale in [[pitch class space]].\n\n== Definition ==\nThe term \"[[Perfect fifth|fifth]]\" defines an interval or mathematical ratio, which is the closest and most [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] non-octave interval. The circle of fifths is a sequence of pitches or key tonalities, represented as a circle, in which the next pitch (turning clockwise) is found seven [[semitone]]s higher than the last. [[Musician]]s and [[composer]]s use the circle of fifths to understand and describe the musical relationships among some selection of those pitches. The circle's design is helpful in [[Musical composition|composing]] and [[Harmony|harmonizing]] [[melodies]], building [[chord (music)|chords]], and modulating to different [[key (music)|keys]] within a composition.<ref>Michael Pilhofer and Holly Day (23 Feb 2009). [http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-circle-of-fifths-a-brief-history.html \"The Circle of Fifths: A Brief History\"], www.dummies.com.</ref>\n\nAt the top of the circle, the [[Key (music)|key]] of C Major has no [[Sharp (music)|sharps]] or [[Flat (music)|flats]].  Starting from the apex and proceeding clockwise by ascending [[Perfect fifth|fifths]], the key of G has one sharp, the key of D has 2 sharps, and so on. Similarly, proceeding counterclockwise from the apex by descending fifths, the key of F has one flat, the key of B{{music|flat}} has 2 flats, and so on. At the bottom of the circle, the sharp and flat keys overlap, showing pairs of [[enharmonically equivalent]] key signatures.\n\nStarting at any [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], ascending by the [[interval (music)|interval]] of an [[Equal temperament|equal tempered]] [[perfect fifth|fifth]], one passes all twelve tones clockwise, to return to the beginning pitch class. To pass the twelve tones counterclockwise, it is necessary to ascend by [[perfect fourth]]s, rather than fifths. (To the ear, the sequence of fourths gives an impression of settling, or resolution; see [[Cadence (music)|cadence]].)\n\n<gallery widths=\"250px\" heights=\"50px\" perrow=\"1\">\nImage:Circle of fifths ascending within octave.svg|{{audio|Circle of fifths ascending within octave.mid|Play circle of fifths clockwise within one octave}}\nImage:Circle of fifths descending within octave.png|{{audio|Circle of fifths descending within octave.mid|Play circle of fifths counterclockwise within one octave}}\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure and use==\nPitches within the chromatic scale are related not only by the number of semitones between them within the chromatic scale, but also related harmonically within the circle of fifths. Moving counterclockwise the direction of the circle of fifths gives the '''circle of fourths'''.  Typically the \"circle of fifths\" is used in the analysis of classical music, whereas the \"circle of fourths\" is used in the analysis of jazz music, but this distinction is not exclusive. The \"circle of fifths\" is a requirement in the barbershop style as the [[Barbershop Harmony Society]]'s Contest and Judging Handbook says the barbershop style consists of  \"seventh chords that often resolve around the circle of fifths, while also making use of other resolutions\", among other requirements.\n\n===Diatonic key signatures===\nThe circle is commonly used to represent the relationship between [[diatonic scale]]s. Here, the letters on the circle are taken to represent the major scale with that note as tonic. The numbers on the inside of the circle show how many sharps or flats the [[key signature]] for this scale has. Thus a major scale built on A has 3 sharps in its key signature. The major scale built on F has 1 flat.\n\nFor [[minor scale]]s, rotate the letters counter-clockwise by 3, so that, e.g., A minor has 0 sharps or flats and E minor has 1 sharp. (See [[relative key]] for details.) A way to describe this phenomenon is that, for any major key [e.g. G major, with one sharp (F{{music|sharp}}) in its diatonic scale], a scale can be built beginning on the sixth (VI) degree (relative minor key, in this case, E) containing the same notes, but from E\u2013E as opposed to G\u2013G. Or, G-major scale (G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013G) is enharmonic (harmonically equivalent) to the e-minor scale (E\u2013F{{music|sharp}}\u2013G\u2013A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E).\n\nWhen notating the key signatures, the order of sharps that are found at the beginning of the staff line follows the circle of fifths from F through B. The order is F, C, G, D, A, E, B. If there is only one sharp, such as in the key of G major, then the one sharp is F sharp. If there are two sharps, the two are F and C, and they appear in that order in the key signature. The order of sharps goes clockwise around the circle of fifths. (For major keys, the last sharp is on the seventh scale degree. The tonic (key note) is one half-step above the last sharp.)\n\nFor notating flats, the order is reversed: B, E, A, D, G, C, F. This order runs counter-clockwise along the circle of fifths; in other words they progress by fourths. Following the major keys from the key of F to the key of C flat (B) counter-clockwise around the circle of fifths, as each key signature adds a flat, the flats always occur in this order. (For major keys, the penultimate (second to last) flat in the key signature is on the tonic. With only one flat, the key of F does not follow this pattern.)\n\n===Modulation and chord progression===\n[[Tonality|Tonal music]] often [[modulation (music)|modulates]] by moving between adjacent scales on the circle of fifths. This is because diatonic scales contain seven pitch classes that are contiguous on the circle of fifths. It follows that diatonic scales a perfect fifth apart share six of their seven notes. Furthermore, the notes not held in common differ by only a semitone. Thus modulation by perfect fifth can be accomplished in an exceptionally smooth fashion. For example, to move from the C major scale F\u2013C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B to the G major scale C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E\u2013B\u2013F{{music|sharp}}, one need only move the C major scale's \"F\" to \"F{{music|sharp}}\".\n\nThe circle can be easily used to find out the common chord progression for basic keys. The circle of fifths shows every major key with its corresponding minor key (of the Aeolian mode). This can be used as the vi chord in a progression. The V and IV chord can be found by moving clockwise and counterclockwise from the root chord respectively. The corresponding minor keys of the V and IV are the iii and ii respectively.\n\nThe major and minor chords in each major key:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" {{diagonal split header|Key|&nbsp; Chord}}\n! scope=\"col\" | I\n! scope=\"col\" | ii\n! scope=\"col\" | iii\n! scope=\"col\" | IV\n! scope=\"col\" | V\n! scope=\"col\" | vi\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C major\n|C || Dm || Em || F || G || Am\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G major\n|G || Am || Bm || C || D || Em\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D major\n|D || Em || F{{music|#}}m || G || A || Bm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A major\n|A || Bm || C{{music|#}}m || D || E || F{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E major\n|E || F{{music|#}}m || G{{music|#}}m || A || B || C{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B major\n|B || C{{music|#}}m || D{{music|#}}m || E || F{{music|#}} || G{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F{{music|#}} major\n|F{{music|#}} || G{{music|#}}m || A{{music|#}}m || B || C{{music|#}} || D{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C{{music|#}} major\n|C{{music|#}} || D{{music|#}}m || E{{music|#}}m || F{{music|#}} || G{{music|#}} || A{{music|#}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C{{music|b}} major\n|C{{music|b}} || D{{music|b}}m || E{{music|b}}m || F{{music|b}} || G{{music|b}} || A{{music|b}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | G{{music|b}} major\n|G{{music|b}} || A{{music|b}}m || B{{music|b}}m || C{{music|b}} || D{{music|b}} || E{{music|b}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | D{{music|b}} major\n|D{{music|b}} || E{{music|b}}m || Fm || G{{music|b}} || A{{music|b}} || B{{music|b}}m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A{{music|b}} major\n|A{{music|b}} || B{{music|b}}m || Cm || D{{music|b}} || E{{music|b}} || Fm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | E{{music|b}} major\n|E{{music|b}} || Fm || Gm || A{{music|b}} || B{{music|b}} || Cm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B{{music|b}} major\n|B{{music|b}} || Cm || Dm || E{{music|b}} || F || Gm\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | F major\n|F || Gm || Am || B{{music|b}} || C || Dm\n|}\n\nIn Western tonal music, one also finds [[chord progression]]s between chords whose roots are related by perfect fifth. For instance, root progressions such as D\u2013G\u2013C are common. For this reason, the circle of fifths can often be used to represent \"harmonic distance\" between chords.\n\n[[File:IV-V-I in C.png|thumb|left|IV\u2013V\u2013I, in C {{audio|IV-V-I in C.mid|Play}}]]\nAccording to theorists including [[Richard Franko Goldman|Goldman]], [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] (the use, role, and relation of [[chord (music)|chords]] in [[harmony]]), including \"functional succession\", may be \"explained by the circle of fifths (in which, therefore, [[scale degree]] II is closer to the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] than scale degree IV)\".{{sfn|Nattiez|1990|p=225}} In this view the tonic is considered the end of the line towards which a [[chord progression]] derived from the circle of fifths progresses.\n\n[[File:Ii-V-I turnaround in C.png|thumb|right|[[ii\u2013V\u2013I progression]], in C {{audio|Ii-V-I turnaround in C.mid|Play subdominant, supertonic seventh, and supertonic chords}} illustrating the similarity between them.]]\nAccording to Goldman's ''Harmony in Western Music'', \"the IV chord is actually, in the simplest mechanisms of diatonic relationships, at the greatest distance from I. In terms of the [descending] circle of fifths, it leads away from I, rather than toward it.\"<ref name=\"Goldman 68\">{{harvnb|Goldman|1965|p=68}}.</ref> Thus the progression I\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I (an [[authentic cadence]]) would feel more final or [[resolution (music)|resolved]] than I\u2013IV\u2013I (a [[plagal cadence]]). Goldman<ref>{{harvnb|Goldman|1965|loc=chapter 3}}.</ref> concurs with Nattiez, who argues that \"the chord on the fourth degree appears long before the chord on II, and the subsequent final I, in the progression I\u2013IV\u2013vii<sup>o</sup>\u2013iii\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I\", and is farther from the tonic there as well.<ref name=\"Nattiez 226\">{{harvnb|Nattiez|1990|p=226}}.</ref> (In this and related articles, upper-case Roman numerals indicate major triads while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads.)\n\n[[File:IV frente ii7 sin raiz.png|thumb|left|IV vs. ii<sup>7</sup> with root in parenthesis, in C {{audio|Subdominant and supertonic similarity.mid|Play}}.]]\nGoldman argues that \"historically the use of the IV chord in harmonic design, and especially in [[cadence (music)|cadences]], exhibits some curious features. By and large, one can say that the use of IV in final cadences becomes more common in the nineteenth century than it was in the eighteenth, but that it may also be understood as a substitute for the ii chord when it precedes V. It may also be quite logically construed as an incomplete ii7 chord (lacking root).\"<ref name=\"Goldman 68\" /> The delayed acceptance of the IV\u2013I in final cadences is explained aesthetically by its lack of closure, caused by its position in the circle of fifths. The earlier use of IV\u2013V\u2013I is explained by proposing a relation between IV and ii, allowing IV to substitute for or serve as ii. However, Nattiez calls this latter argument \"a narrow escape: only the theory of a ii chord without a [[root (chord)|root]] allows Goldman to maintain that the circle of fifths is completely valid from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] to [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]\", or the entire [[common practice period]].<ref name=\"Nattiez 226\" />\n\n===Circle closure in non-equal tuning systems===\nWhen an instrument is tuned with the [[equal temperament]] system, the width of the fifths is such that the circle \"closes\". This means that ascending by twelve fifths from any pitch, one returns to a tone exactly in the same pitch class as the initial tone, and exactly seven [[octave]]s above it. To obtain such a perfect circle closure, the fifth is slightly flattened with respect to its [[just intonation]] (3:2 [[interval ratio]]).\n\nThus, ascending by justly tuned fifths fails to close the circle by an excess of approximately 23.46 [[Cent (music)|cents]], roughly a quarter of a [[semitone]], an interval known as the [[Pythagorean comma]]. In Pythagorean tuning, this problem is solved by markedly shortening the [[interval (music)|width]] of one of the twelve fifths, which makes it severely [[consonance and dissonance|dissonant]]. This anomalous fifth is called [[wolf fifth]] as a humorous metaphor of the unpleasant sound of the note (like a wolf trying to howl an off-pitch note). The [[quarter-comma meantone]] tuning system uses eleven fifths slightly narrower than the equally tempered fifth, and requires a much wider and even more dissonant wolf fifth to close the circle. More complex tuning systems based on [[just intonation]], such as [[5-limit tuning]], use at most eight justly tuned fifths and at least three non-just fifths (some slightly narrower, and some slightly wider than the just fifth) to close the circle. Other tuning systems use up to [[53 equal temperament|53&nbsp;tones]] (the original 12&nbsp;tones and 42&nbsp;more between them) in order to close the circle of fifths.\n\n===In lay terms===\n{{infobox|bodyclass=collapsible collapsed\n|above = Playing the circle of fifths\n|abovestyle = font-size:100%\n|image1 =\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=none|width=220\n| image1 = Circle of fifths within oc.png|caption1=1 octave, fourths, descending\n| image2 = Circle of fifths ascend wi.png|caption2=1 octave, fifths, ascending\n| image3 = Circle of fifths a 2 octave.png|caption3=2 octave, fifths, ascending\n| image4 = Circle of fifths d 2 octave.png|caption4=2 octave, fourths, descending\n| image5 = Circle of fourths 2 octave.png|caption5=2 octave, fourths, ascending\n| image6 = Circle of fourths d 2 octa.png|caption6=2 octave, fifths, descending\n| image7 = Circle of fifths on A.png|caption7=multi octave, fifths, ascending\n| image8 = Circle of fifths d on A.png|caption8=multi octave, fourths, descending\n| image9 = Circle of fourths on A.png|caption9=multi octave, fourths, ascending\n}}\n}}\nA simple way to see the [[Interval (music)|musical interval]] known as a [[Perfect fifth|fifth]] is by looking at a [[Musical keyboard|piano keyboard]], and, starting at any key, counting seven keys to the right (both black and white, not including the first) to get to the next note on the circle shown above. Seven [[half step]]s, the distance from the 1st to the 8th key on a piano is a \"perfect fifth\", called 'perfect' because it is neither major nor minor, but applies to both major and minor scales and chords, and a 'fifth' because, although it is a distance of seven semitones on a keyboard, it spans five adjacent notes in the major or minor scale.\n\nA simple way to hear the relationship between these notes is by playing them on a piano keyboard. When traversing the circle of fifths backwards, the notes will feel as though they fall into each other{{clarify|date=March 2018}}. This aural relationship is what the mathematics describe.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nPerfect fifths may be [[Just intonation|justly tuned]] or [[Musical temperament|tempered]]. Two notes whose frequencies differ by a ratio of 3:2 make the interval known as a justly tuned perfect fifth. Cascading twelve such fifths does not return to the original [[pitch class]] after going round the circle, so the 3:2 ratio may be slightly detuned, or tempered. Temperament allows perfect fifths to cycle, and allows pieces to be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]], or played in any [[Key (music)|key]] on a piano or other fixed-pitch instrument without distorting their harmony. The primary tuning system used for Western (especially [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] and [[fret]]ted) instruments today, twelve-tone [[equal temperament]], uses an irrational multiplier, 2<sup>1/12</sup>, to calculate the frequency difference of a semitone. An equal-tempered fifth, at a frequency ratio of 2<sup>7/12</sup>:1 (or about 1.498307077:1) is approximately two cents narrower than a justly tuned fifth at a ratio of 3:2.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Heinichen musicalischer circul.png|thumb|[[Johann David Heinichen|Heinichen]]'s musical circle (German: ''musicalischer circul'')(1711)]]\n\nIn the late 1670s a [[treatise]] called ''Grammatika'' was written by the Ukrainian composer and theorist [[Nikolay Diletsky|Mykola Dylets'kiy]]. Diletskii\u2019s ''Grammatika'' is a treatise on composition, \"the first of its kind, aimed at teaching a Russian audience how to write Western-style polyphonic compositions.\" It taught how to write ''kontserty'', [[polyphonic]] [[a cappella]] works normally based on [[liturgical]] texts and created by putting together musical sections that have contrasting [[rhythm]], meters, [[melodic]] material and [[vocal]] groupings. Diletskii intended his treatise to be a guide to composition but pertaining to the rules of [[music theory]].  Within the Grammatika treatise is where the first circle of fifths appeared and was used for students as a composer's tool.<ref name=\"Jensen\">{{harvnb|Jensen|1992||pp=306\u2013307}}.</ref>\n\n==Use==\nIn musical pieces from the [[Baroque music]] era and the [[Classical era of music]] and in Western [[popular music]], [[traditional music]] and [[folk music]], when pieces or songs modulate to a new key, these modulations are often associated with the circle of fifths.\n\nIn practice, compositions rarely make use of the entire circle of fifths.  More commonly, composers make use of \u201cthe compositional idea of the \u2018cycle\u2019 of 5ths, when music moves consistently through a smaller or larger segment of the tonal structural resources which the circle abstractly represents.\u201d<ref>Whittall, A. (2002, p. 259) \u201cCircle of Fifths\u201d, article in Latham, E. (ed.) The Oxford Companion to Music.  Oxford University Press.</ref> The usual practice is to derive the circle of fifths progression from the seven tones of the diatonic scale, rather from the full range of twelve tones present in the chromatic scale.  Here is how the circle of fifths derives, through [[permutation]] from the diatonic major scale:[[File:Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it - major.wav|thumb|Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it \u2013 major]] [[File:Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it - major.png|thumb|center|500px|Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it \u2013 major]]\n\nAnd from the (natural) minor scale:[[File:Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it - minor.wav|thumb|Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it \u2013 minor]] [[File:Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it - minor.png|thumb|center|500px|Diatonic scale and the circle of fifths derived from it \u2013 minor]]\n\nThe following is the basic sequence of chords that can be built over the major bass-line:[[File:Circle of fifths chord progression - major.wav|thumb|Circle of fifths chord progression \u2013 major]] [[File:Circle of fifths chord progression - major.png|thumb|center|500px|Circle of fifths chord progression \u2013 major]]\n\nAnd over the minor:[[File:Circle of fifths chord progression - minor.wav|thumb|Circle of fifths chord progression \u2013 minor]] [[File:Circle of fifths chord progression - minor.png|thumb|center|500px|Circle of fifths chord progression \u2013 minor]]\n\nAdding sevenths to the chords creates a greater sense of forward momentum to the harmony:[[File:Circle of fifths chord progression - minor with added sevenths.wav|thumb|Circle of fifths chord progression \u2013 minor with added sevenths]] [[File:Circle of fifths chord progression - minor with added sevenths.png|thumb|center|500px|Circle of fifths chord progression \u2013 minor with added sevenths]]\n\n===Baroque era===\nAccording to [[Richard Taruskin]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]] was the most influential composer to establish the pattern as a standard harmonic [[Trope (literature)|\u201dtrope\u201d]]: \u201cIt was precisely in Corelli\u2019s time, the late seventeenth century, that the circle of fifths was being \u2018theorized\u2019 as the main propellor of harmonic motion, and it was Corelli more than any one composer who put that new idea into telling practice.\u201d<ref>Taruskin, R. (2010, p. 184) ''The Oxford History of Western Music: Music in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries''.  Oxford University Press.</ref>\nThe circle of fifths progression occurs frequently in the music of [[J. S. Bach]].  In the following, from [[Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen, BWV 51|''Jauchzet Gott in allen Landen'', BWV 51]], even when the solo bass line implies rather than states the chords involved:[[File:Bach from Cantata 51 bass line.wav|thumb|Bach from Cantata 51 bass line]][[File:Bach from Cantata 51 bass line.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach from Cantata 51 ]] [[Handel]] uses a circle of fifths progression as the basis for the [[Passacaglia]] movement from his Harpsichord suite No. 6 in G minor.[[File:Handel Passacaille from Suite in G minor bars 1-4.wav|thumb|Handel Passacaille from Suite in G minor bars 1-4]][[File:Handel Passacaille from Suite in G minor bars 1-4.png|thumb|center|500px|Handel Passacaille from Suite in G minor bars 1-4]][[Baroque music|Baroque]] composers learnt to enhance the \u201cpropulsive force\u201d of the harmony engendered by the circle of fifths \u201cby adding sevenths to most of the constituent chords.\u201d   \u201cThese sevenths, being dissonances, create the need for resolution, thus turning each progression of the circle into a simultaneous reliever and re-stimulator of harmonic tension\u2026.

[[Franz Schubert]]\u2019s poignant Impromptu in E flat major, D899, contains such a passage:[[File:Schubert Impromptu in E flat 01.wav|thumb|Schubert Impromptu in E flat]] [[File:Schubert Impromptu in E flat 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Schubert Impromptu in E flat]] - as does the [[Intermezzo]] movement from [[Mendelssohn]]\u2019s [[String Quartet No. 2 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No.2]]:[[File:Mendelssohn String Quartet 2, 3rd movement (Intermezzo).wav|thumb|Mendelssohn String Quartet 2, 3rd movement (Intermezzo)]][[File:Mendelssohn String Quartet 2, 3rd movement (Intermezzo).png|thumb|center|450px|Mendelssohn String Quartet 2, 3rd movement (Intermezzo)]]Robert Schumann\u2019s evocative \u201cChild falling asleep\u201d from his ''[[Kinderszenen]]'' springs a surprise at the end of the progression: the piece ends on an A minor chord, instead of the expected [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] E minor.[[File:Schumann, Kind im Einschlummern (Child falling asleep) 01.wav|thumb|Schumann, Kind im Einschlummern (Child falling asleep)]] [[File:Schumann, Kind im Einschlummern.png|thumb|center|500px|Schumann, Kind im Einschlummern]]In [[Wagner]]\u2019s opera, [[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]], a cycle of fifths progression occurs in the music which transitions from the end of the prologue into the first scene of Act 1, set in the imposing hall of the wealthy Gibichungs. \u201cStatus and reputation are written  all over the motifs assigned to Gunther\u201d,<ref>Scruton, R.

Therefore, it contains a diminished fifth, in C major between B and F. See [[structure implies multiplicity]].\n\nThe [[circle progression]] is commonly a circle of fifths through the diatonic chords, including one [[Diminished triad|diminished chord]]. A circle progression in C major with chords I\u2013IV\u2013vii<sup>o</sup>\u2013iii\u2013vi\u2013ii\u2013V\u2013I is shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\clef treble \\time 4/4\n                \\stemUp e2 f d e c d b c\n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown c2 c b b a a g g\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\clef bass \\time 4/4\n                \\stemUp g2 a f g e f d e \n                }\n            \\new Voice \\relative c {\n                \\stemDown c f, b e, a d, g c,\n                }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n\n===Chromatic circle===\n{{Main|Chromatic circle}}\nThe circle of fifths is closely related to the [[chromatic circle]], which also arranges the twelve equal-tempered pitch classes in a circular ordering.  A key difference between the two circles is that the [[chromatic circle]] can be understood as a continuous space where every point on the circle corresponds to a conceivable [[pitch class]], and every conceivable pitch class corresponds to a point on the circle.  By contrast, the circle of fifths is fundamentally a ''discrete'' structure, and there is no obvious way to assign pitch classes to each of its points.  In this sense, the two circles are mathematically quite different.\n\nHowever, the twelve equal-tempered [[pitch class]]es can be represented by the [[cyclic group]] of order twelve, or equivalently, the [[modular arithmetic|residue classes]] modulo twelve, <math> \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} </math>.  The group <math> \\mathbb{Z}_{12} </math> has four generators, which can be identified with the ascending and descending semitones and the ascending and descending perfect fifths.  The semitonal generator gives rise to the [[chromatic circle]] while the perfect fifth gives rise to the circle of fifths.\n\n===Relation with chromatic scale===\n{{Main|Chromatic scale}}\n\n[[Image:Pitch class space star.svg|thumb|right|The circle of fifths drawn within the chromatic circle as a [[star polygon|star]] [[dodecagram]].{{sfn|McCartin|1998|p=364}}]]\nThe circle of fifths, or fourths, may be mapped from the [[chromatic scale]] by [[multiplication]], and vice versa. To map between the circle of fifths and the chromatic scale (in [[integer notation]]) multiply by 7 ([[twelve-tone technique|M7]]), and for the circle of fourths multiply by 5 (P5).\n\nHere is a demonstration of this procedure.  Start off with an [[order theory|ordered]] 12-tuple ([[tone row]]) of integers\n: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\nrepresenting the notes of the chromatic scale: 0 = C, 2 = D, 4 = E, 5 = F, 7 = G, 9 = A, 11 = B, 1 = C{{music|sharp}}, 3 = D{{music|sharp}}, 6 = F{{music|sharp}}, 8 = G{{music|sharp}}, 10 = A{{music|sharp}}.  Now multiply the entire 12-tuple by 7:\n: (0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77)\nand then apply a [[modulo operation|modulo]] 12 reduction to each of the numbers (subtract 12 from each number as many times as necessary until the number becomes smaller than 12):\n: (0, 7, 2, 9, 4, 11, 6, 1, 8, 3, 10, 5)\nwhich is equivalent to\n: (C, G, D, A, E, B, F{{music|sharp}}, C{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}}, D{{music|sharp}}, A{{music|sharp}}, F)\nwhich is the circle of fifths.\nNote that this is [[enharmonic]]ally equivalent to:\n: (C, G, D, A, E, B, G{{music|flat}}, D{{music|flat}}, A{{music|flat}}, E{{music|flat}}, B{{music|flat}}, F).\n\n===Enharmonic equivalents and theoretical keys===\n{{main|Theoretical key}}\nThe key signatures found on the bottom of the circle of fifths diagram, such as D{{music|flat}} major, are often written one way in flats and in another way using sharps. These keys are easily interchanged using enharmonic equivalents. Enharmonic means that the notes sound the same, but are written differently. For example, the key signature of D{{Music|flat}} major, with five flats, contains the same sounding notes, enharmonically, as C{{music|sharp}} major (seven sharps).\n\nAfter C{{music|sharp}} comes the key of G{{music|sharp}} (following the pattern of being a fifth higher, and, coincidentally, enharmonically equivalent to the key of A{{music|flat}}). The \u201ceighth sharp\u201d is placed on the F{{music|sharp}}, to make it F{{music|doublesharp}}. The key of D{{music|sharp}}, with nine sharps, has another sharp placed on the C{{music|sharp}}, making it C{{music|doublesharp}}. The same is true for key signatures with flats; The key of E (four sharps) is equivalent to the key of F{{music|flat}} (again, one fifth below the key of C{{music|flat}}, following the pattern of flat key signatures). The last flat is placed on the B{{music|flat}}, making it B{{music|doubleflat}}. Such keys with double accidentals in the key signatures are called [[theoretical key]]s: the appearance of their key signatures is extremely rare, but they are sometimes tonicised in the course of a work (particularly if the home key was already heavily sharped or flatted).\n<score vorbis=\"1\">\n\\relative c' {\n  \\key gis \\major\n\\set Staff.printKeyCancellation = ##f\n <gis' bis dis>\n\\bar \"||\"\n  \\key dis \\major\n <dis fisis ais>\n\\bar \"||\"\n  \\key fes \\major\n <fes as ces>\n\\bar \"||\"\n  \\key beses \\major\n <beses des fes>\n}\n</score>\n\nThere does not appear to be a standard on how to notate theoretical key signatures:\n\n*The default behaviour of [[LilyPond]] (pictured above) writes all single sharps (flats) in the circle-of-fifths order, before proceeding to the double sharps. This is the format used in [[John Foulds]]' ''A World Requiem'', Op. 60, which ends with the key signature of G{{music|#}} major (exactly as displayed above, [https://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/5/59/IMSLP527245-PMLP756657-JFoulds_A_World_Requiem,_Op.60_vocalscore.pdf pp. 153ff.]) The sharps in the key signature of G{{music|#}} major here proceed C{{music|#}}, G{{music|#}}, D{{music|#}}, A{{music|#}}, E{{music|#}}, B{{music|#}}, F{{music|x}}.\n*The single sharps or flats at the beginning are sometimes repeated as a courtesy, e.g. [[Max Reger]]'s ''Supplement to the Theory of Modulation'', which contains D{{music|b}} minor key signatures on [https://archive.org/details/supplementtotheo00rege/page/42/mode/2up pp. 42\u201345]. These have a B{{music|b}} at the start and also a B{{music|bb}} at the end (with a double-flat symbol), going B{{music|b}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, F{{music|b}}, B{{music|bb}}. The convention of LilyPond and Foulds would suppress the initial B{{music|b}}.\n*Sometimes the double signs are written at the beginning of the key signature, followed by the single signs. For example, the F{{music|b}} key signature is notated as B{{music|bb}}, E{{music|b}}, A{{music|b}}, D{{music|b}}, G{{music|b}}, C{{music|b}}, F{{music|b}}. This convention is used by Victor Ewald, by the program [[Finale (software)]],<ref>https://www.hickeys.com/music/brass/brass_ensembles/brass_quintets/products/sku035994-ewald-victor-quintet-no-4-in-ab-op-8.php</ref> and by some theoretical works.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Approach chord]]\n* [[Sonata form]]\n* [[Well temperament]]\n* [[Circle of fifths text table]]\n* [[Pitch constellation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Goldman|first=Richard Franko|year=1965|title=Harmony in Western Music|url=https://archive.org/details/harmonyinwestern00gold|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=W.

At some point in the ninth- or tenth century, the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] expanded substantially southwards. As a result of this extension far beyond the valley of the [[River Clyde]], the realm became known as the [[Kingdom of Cumbria]]. By 927, the kingdom seems to have reached as far south as the [[River Eamont]].\n\nDyfnwal appears to have reigned between the 930s and the 970s. He is first attested in the 940s, when he is recorded associated with the ecclesiast [[Cathr\u00f3e of Metz|Cathr\u00f3e]] on the latter's journey to [[Continental Europe]]. At the midpoint of the decade, the Cumbrian kingdom was ravaged by the forces of [[Edmund, King of the English]]. Two of Dyfnwal's sons are said to have been blinded by the English, which could indicate that Dyfnwal had broken a pledge to his southern counterpart. One possibility is that he had harboured insular Scandinavian opponents of Edmund. The latter is recorded to have handed over control of the Cumbrian realm to [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill, King of Alba]]. How much authority the Scots enjoyed over the Cumbrian realm is uncertain.\n\nIn 971, the reigning [[Cuil\u00e9n|Cuil\u00e9n mac Illuilb, King of Alba]] was slain by [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]]. At some point after this act, Cuil\u00e9n's eventual successor, [[Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim, King of Alba]], is recorded to have penetrated deep into Cumbrian territory, possibly as a retaliatory act. The following year, the reigning [[Edgar, King of the English]] held a remarkable assembly at [[Chester]] which numerous northern kings seem to have attended. Both Dyfnwal and his son, [[M\u00e1el Coluim, King of Strathclyde|M\u00e1el Coluim]], appear to have attended this assembly. The latter is styled King of the Cumbrians in the context of this meeting, which might indicate that Dyfnwal had previously abdicated the throne.\n\nDyfnwal is recorded to have died in 975 whilst undertaking a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. Quite when he gave up the throne is unknown. One possibility is that Rhydderch had succeeded him before the killing of Cuil\u00e9n. Another possibility is that the apparent retaliatory raid by Cin\u00e1ed marked the end of Dyfnwal's kingship. It is also possible that he held on to power until 973 or 975. In any event, M\u00e1el Coluim appears to have been succeeded by another son of Dyfnwal named [[Owain ap Dyfnwal (died 1015)|Owain]], who is recorded to have died in 1015. The later [[Owain Foel, King of Strathclyde]], who is attested in 1018, may well be a grandson of Dyfnwal. Dyfnwal is likely the [[eponym]] of [[Dunmail Raise]] in England, and possibly [[Cardonald]], [[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]]/[[Dundonald Castle]] in Scotland.\n\n==Background: the tenth century Cumbrian realm==\n\n[[File:Dyfnwal ab Owain (map).png|thumb|upright|alt=Map of northern Britain |Locations relating to the life and times of Dyfnwal.]]\n\nFor hundreds of years until the late ninth century, the power centre of the [[Kingdom of Al Clud]] was the fortress of [[Al Clud (fortress)|Al Clud]] (\"Rock of the Clyde\").<ref>[[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] p. 8; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]].</ref> In 870, this [[Celtic Britons|British]] stronghold was [[Siege of Dumbarton|seized]] by Irish-based [[Vikings|Scandinavians]],<ref>[[#E2|Edmonds (2015)]] p. 44; [[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] pp. 9, 480; [[#C7|Clarkson (2012a)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 21; [[#C3|Clarkson (2010)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 20; [[#D4|Davies (2009)]] p. 73; [[#DZZ1|Downham (2007)]] pp. 66, 142, 162; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]]; [[#E5|Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

At some point in the ninth- or tenth century, the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] expanded substantially southwards. As a result of this extension far beyond the valley of the [[River Clyde]], the realm became known as the [[Kingdom of Cumbria]]. By 927, the kingdom seems to have reached as far south as the [[River Eamont]].\n\nDyfnwal appears to have reigned between the 930s and the 970s. He is first attested in the 940s, when he is recorded associated with the ecclesiast [[Cathr\u00f3e of Metz|Cathr\u00f3e]] on the latter's journey to [[Continental Europe]]. At the midpoint of the decade, the Cumbrian kingdom was ravaged by the forces of [[Edmund, King of the English]]. Two of Dyfnwal's sons are said to have been blinded by the English, which could indicate that Dyfnwal had broken a pledge to his southern counterpart. One possibility is that he had harboured insular Scandinavian opponents of Edmund. The latter is recorded to have handed over control of the Cumbrian realm to [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill, King of Alba]]. How much authority the Scots enjoyed over the Cumbrian realm is uncertain.\n\nIn 971, the reigning [[Cuil\u00e9n|Cuil\u00e9n mac Illuilb, King of Alba]] was slain by [[Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal]]. At some point after this act, Cuil\u00e9n's eventual successor, [[Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Choluim, King of Alba]], is recorded to have penetrated deep into Cumbrian territory, possibly as a retaliatory act. The following year, the reigning [[Edgar, King of the English]] held a remarkable assembly at [[Chester]] which numerous northern kings seem to have attended. Both Dyfnwal and his son, [[M\u00e1el Coluim, King of Strathclyde|M\u00e1el Coluim]], appear to have attended this assembly. The latter is styled King of the Cumbrians in the context of this meeting, which might indicate that Dyfnwal had previously abdicated the throne.\n\nDyfnwal is recorded to have died in 975 whilst undertaking a pilgrimage to [[Rome]]. Quite when he gave up the throne is unknown. One possibility is that Rhydderch had succeeded him before the killing of Cuil\u00e9n. Another possibility is that the apparent retaliatory raid by Cin\u00e1ed marked the end of Dyfnwal's kingship. It is also possible that he held on to power until 973 or 975. In any event, M\u00e1el Coluim appears to have been succeeded by another son of Dyfnwal named [[Owain ap Dyfnwal (died 1015)|Owain]], who is recorded to have died in 1015. The later [[Owain Foel, King of Strathclyde]], who is attested in 1018, may well be a grandson of Dyfnwal. Dyfnwal is likely the [[eponym]] of [[Dunmail Raise]] in England, and possibly [[Cardonald]], [[Dundonald, South Ayrshire|Dundonald]]/[[Dundonald Castle]] in Scotland.\n\n==Background: the tenth century Cumbrian realm==\n\n[[File:Dyfnwal ab Owain (map).png|thumb|upright|alt=Map of northern Britain |Locations relating to the life and times of Dyfnwal.]]\n\nFor hundreds of years until the late ninth century, the power centre of the [[Kingdom of Al Clud]] was the fortress of [[Al Clud (fortress)|Al Clud]] (\"Rock of the Clyde\").<ref>[[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] p. 8; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]].</ref> In 870, this [[Celtic Britons|British]] stronghold was [[Siege of Dumbarton|seized]] by Irish-based [[Vikings|Scandinavians]],<ref>[[#E2|Edmonds (2015)]] p. 44; [[#C10|Charles-Edwards (2013b)]] pp. 9, 480; [[#C7|Clarkson (2012a)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 21; [[#C3|Clarkson (2010)]] ch. 8 \u00b6 20; [[#D4|Davies (2009)]] p. 73; [[#DZZ1|Downham (2007)]] pp. 66, 142, 162; [[#C11|Clancy (2006)]]; [[#E5|Ewart; Pringle; Caldwell et al.

Originally known by its Roman name ''Pons Aelius'', the name \"Newcastle\" has been used since the [[Norman conquest of England]]. Due to its prime location on the [[River Tyne]], the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], being granted city status in 1882. Today, the city is a major retail, commercial and cultural centre.\n\n==Roman settlement==\n{{Main article|Pons Aelius}}\n\nThe history of Newcastle dates from about AD&nbsp;120, when the Romans built the first bridge to cross the River Tyne at that point. The bridge was called [[Pons Aelius]] or 'Bridge of Aelius', Aelius being the family name of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlecastle.co.uk/roman-and-anglo-saxon|title=Roman and Anglo-Saxon|publisher=Newcastle.co.uk}}</ref> who was responsible for the Roman wall built across northern England along the Tyne\u2013Solway gap. [[Hadrian's Wall]] ran through present-day Newcastle, with stretches of wall and turrets visible along the West Road, and at a temple in [[Benwell]]. Traces of a [[milecastle]] were found on Westgate Road, midway between Clayton Street and Grainger Street, and it is likely that the course of the wall corresponded to present-day Westgate Road. The course of the wall can be traced eastwards to the [[Segedunum]] [[castra|Roman fort]] at [[Wallsend]], with the fort of [[Arbeia]] down-river at the mouth of the Tyne, on the south bank in what is now [[South Shields]]. The Tyne was then a wider, shallower river at this point and it is thought that the bridge was probably about {{convert|700|ft|m}} long, made of wood and supported on stone piers. It is probable that it was sited near the current [[Swing Bridge, River Tyne|Swing Bridge]], due to the fact that Roman artefacts were found there during the building of the latter bridge. Hadrian himself probably visited the site in 122. A shrine was set up on the completed bridge in 123 by the [[Legio VI Victrix|6th Legion]], with two altars to Neptune and Oceanus respectively. The two altars were subsequently found in the river and are on display in the [[Great North Museum]] in Newcastle.<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{cite book |author=Marshall, Michael W |year=1997 |title=Turning Tides |publisher=Keepgate Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-899506-35-7}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans built a stone-walled fort in 150 to protect the river crossing which was at the foot of the Tyne Gorge, and this took the name of the bridge so that the whole settlement was known as ''Pons Aelius''. The fort was situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge, on the site of the present [[Newcastle Castle Keep|Castle Keep]]. Pons Aelius is last mentioned in 400, in a Roman document listing all of the Roman military outposts. It is likely that nestling in the shadow of the fort would have been a small ''vicus'', or village. Unfortunately, no buildings have been detected; only a few pieces of flagging. It is clear that there was a Roman cemetery near Clavering Place, behind the [[Newcastle railway station|Central station]], as a number of Roman coffins and sarcophagi have been unearthed there.<ref name=\"Winter\">{{cite book |author1=David Winter |author2=Peter Milne |author3=Jonathan Brown |author4=Alan Rushworth |year=1989 |title=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=Northern Heritage Consultancy Ltd |isbn=1-872346-00-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newcastleupontyn0000unse_f8l9 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the presence of the bridge, the settlement of Pons Aelius was not particularly important among the northern Roman settlements. The most important stations were those on the highway of [[Dere Street]] running from [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) through [[Corstopitum]] ([[Corbridge]]) and to the lands north of the Wall. Corstopitum, being a major arsenal and supply centre, was much larger and more populous than Pons Aelius.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\">{{cite book |author=Middlebrook, Sydney |year=1950 |title=Newcastle upon Tyne, Its Growth and Achievement |publisher=SR Publishers Ltd |isbn=0-85409-523-3}}</ref>\n\n==Anglo-Saxon development==\nThe [[Angles]] arrived in the North-East of England in about 500 and may have landed on the Tyne. There is no evidence of an Anglo-Saxon settlement on or near the site of Pons Aelius during the Anglo-Saxon age. The bridge probably survived and there may well have been a small village at the northern end, but no evidence survives. At that time the region was dominated by two kingdoms, [[Bernicia]], north of the [[River Tees|Tees]] and ruled from [[Bamburgh]], and [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]], south of the Tees and ruled from [[York]]. Bernicia and Deira combined to form the kingdom of Northanhymbra ([[Northumbria]]) early in the 7th century. There were three local kings who held the title of [[Bretwalda]] \u2013 'Lord of Britain', [[Edwin of Deira]] (627\u2013632), [[Oswald of Bernicia]] (633\u2013641) and [[Oswy of Northumbria]] (641\u2013658). The 7th century became known as the 'Golden Age of Northumbria', when the area was a beacon of culture and learning in Europe. The greatness of this period was based on its generally Christian culture and resulted in the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] amongst other treasures. The Tyne valley was dotted with monasteries, with those at [[Monkwearmouth]], [[Hexham]] and [[Jarrow]] being the most famous. [[Bede]], who was based at Jarrow, wrote of a royal estate, known as ''Ad Murum'', 'at the Wall', {{convert|12|mi|km}} from the sea. It is thought that this estate may have been in what is now Newcastle. At some unknown time, the site of Newcastle came to be known as Monkchester.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp1-22|title=Historical events: To 1584 &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The reason for this title is unknown, as we are unaware of any specific monasteries at the site, and [[Bede]] made no reference to it. In 875 [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], the Danish Viking conqueror of York, led an army that attacked and pillaged various monasteries in the area, and it is thought that Monkchester was also pillaged at this time. Little more was heard of it until the coming of the [[Normans]].<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n==Norman period==\n[[File:Newcastle schloss.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Castle, Newcastle|The Castle Keep]]]]\nAfter the arrival of [[William the Conqueror]] in England in 1066, the whole of England was quickly subjected to [[Normans|Norman]] rule. However, in Northumbria there was great resistance to the Normans, and in 1069 the newly appointed Norman Earl of Northumbria, [[Robert de Comines]] and 700 of his men were killed by the local population at [[Durham, England|Durham]]. The Northumbrians then marched on [[York]], but William was able to suppress the uprising. That same year, a second uprising occurred when a [[Danish people|Danish]] fleet landed in the [[Humber]]. The Northumbrians again attacked York and destroyed the garrison there. William was again able to suppress the uprising, but this time he took revenge. He laid waste to the whole of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the land from York to the [[River Tees|Tees]]. In 1080, [[William Walcher]], the Norman bishop of Durham and his followers were brutally murdered at [[Gateshead]]. This time [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], bishop of [[Bayeux]], William's half brother, devastated the land between the Tees and the [[River Tweed|Tweed]]. This was known as the \u2018[[Harrying of the North]]\u2019. This devastation is reflected in the [[Domesday Book]]. The destruction had such an effect that the North remained poor and backward at least until [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times and perhaps until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Newcastle suffered in this respect with the rest of the North.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\nIn 1080 William sent his eldest son, [[Robert Curthose]], north to defend the kingdom against the [[Scotland|Scots]]. After his campaign, he moved to Monkchester and began the building of a 'New Castle'. This was of the \"[[motte-and-bailey]]\" type of construction, a wooden tower on top of an earthen mound (motte), surrounded by a moat and wooden stockade (bailey). It was this castle that gave Newcastle its name. In 1095 the Earl of Northumbria, [[Robert de Mowbray]], rose up against the king, [[William Rufus]] and Rufus sent an army north to recapture the castle. From then on the castle became crown property and was an important base from which the king could control the northern barons. The Northumbrian earldom was abolished and a Sheriff of Northumberland was appointed to administer the region. In 1091 the parish church of [[St Nicholas]] was consecrated on the site of the present [[Newcastle Cathedral|Anglican cathedral]], close by the bailey of the new castle. The church is believed to have been a wooden building on stone footings.<ref name=\"Moffat\">{{cite book |author=Moffat and Rosie |year=2005 |title=Tyneside |publisher=Mainstream Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-84596-119-6}}</ref>\n\nNot a trace of the tower or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] replaced it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of \u00a31,444. A stone bailey, in the form of a triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The great outer gateway to the castle, called 'the [[The Black Gate (The Castle, Newcastle)|Black Gate]]\u2019, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. There were at that time no town walls and when attacked by the Scots, the townspeople had to crowd into the bailey for safety. It is probable that the new castle acted as a magnet for local merchants because of the safety it provided. This in turn would help to expand trade in the town. At this time wool, skins and lead were being exported, whilst alum, pepper and ginger were being imported from France and Flanders.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n==Middle Ages==\nThroughout the [[Middle Ages]], Newcastle was England's northern fortress, the centre for assembled armies. The [[Border country|Border]] war against [[Scotland]] lasted intermittently for several centuries \u2013 possibly the longest border war ever waged. During the civil war between [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and [[Matilda of Boulogne|Matilda]], [[David I of Scotland|David 1st of Scotland]] and his son were granted Cumbria and Northumberland respectively, so that for a period from 1139 to 1157, Newcastle was effectively in Scottish hands. It is believed that during this period, King David may have built the church of St Andrew and the Benedictine nunnery in Newcastle. However, King Stephen's successor, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] was strong enough to take back the Earldom of Northumbria from [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]].<ref name=\"Winter\"/>\n\nThe Scots king [[William the Lion]] was imprisoned in Newcastle, in 1174, after being captured at the [[Battle of Alnwick (1174)|Battle of Alnwick]]. [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] brought the [[Stone of Scone]] and [[William Wallace]] south through the town and Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deremilitari.org/2014/05/william-wallaces-invasion-of-northern-england-in-1297/|title=William Wallace's Invasion of Northern England in 1297|date=30 May 2014|publisher=De Re Militari|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAround 1200, stone-faced, clay-filled jetties were starting to project into the river, an indication that trade was increasing in Newcastle. As the Roman roads continued to deteriorate, sea travel was gaining in importance. By 1275 Newcastle was the sixth largest wool exporting port in England. The principal exports at this time were wool, timber, coal, millstones, dairy produce, fish, salt and hides. Much of the developing trade was with the [[Baltic Countries|Baltic]] countries and Germany. Most of the Newcastle merchants were situated near the river, below the Castle. The earliest known charter was dated 1175 in the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], giving the townspeople some control over their town. In 1216 [[John of England|King John]] granted Newcastle a mayor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-celebrates-800-years-mayors-10822604|date=2 February 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Newcastle celebrates 800 years of mayors and Freemen at St Nicholas Cathedral|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> and also allowed the formation of guilds (known as Mysteries). These were cartels formed within different trades, which restricted trade to guild members. There were initially twelve guilds. Coal was being exported from Newcastle by 1250, and by 1350 the burgesses received a royal licence to export coal. This licence to export coal was jealously guarded by the Newcastle burgesses, and they tried to prevent any one else on the Tyne from exporting coal except through Newcastle. The burgesses similarly tried to prevent fish from being sold anywhere else on the Tyne except Newcastle. This led to conflicts with [[Gateshead]] and [[South Shields]].<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1265, the town was granted permission to impose a 'Wall Tax' or Murage,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp601-611|title=The Corporation: Grants and charters &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> to pay for the construction of a fortified wall to enclose the town and protect it from Scottish invaders. The [[Newcastle town wall|town walls]] were not completed until early in the 14th century. They were two miles (3&nbsp;km) long, {{convert|9|ft|m}} thick and {{convert|25|ft|m}} high. They had six main gates, as well as some smaller gates, and had 17 towers.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1019278 |desc=Newcastle upon Tyne town defences: Gunner Tower, Newcastle upon Tyne |accessdate=2019-10-01}}</ref> The land within the walls was divided almost equally by the Lort Burn, which flowed southwards and joined the Tyne to the east of the Castle. The town began to expand north of the Castle and west of the Lort Burn with various markets being set up within the walls.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1400 [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] granted a new charter, creating a [[County corporate]] which separated the town, but not the Castle, from the county of Northumberland and recognised it as a \"county of itself\" with a right to have a [[Sheriff of Newcastle upon Tyne|sheriff of its own]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The burgesses were now allowed to choose six aldermen who, with the mayor would be justices of the peace. The mayor and sheriff were allowed to hold borough courts in the [[Guildhall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Guildhall]].<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n===Religious houses===\nDuring the Middle Ages a number of religious houses were established within the walls: the first of these was the [[Benedictine]] [[nunnery]] of [[St Bartholomew]] founded in 1086 near the present-day Nun Street. Both [[David I of Scotland]] and [[Henry I of England]] were benefactors of the religious house. Nothing of the nunnery remains now.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eneas |last=Mackenzie|title= 'Religious houses: Nunnery of St Bartholomew', in Historical Account of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Including the Borough of Gateshead (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1827)|pages= 118\u2013123|publisher= British History Online|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp118-123 |accessdate= 25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[friar]]y of [[Blackfriars, Newcastle]] ([[Dominican Order|Dominican]]) was established in 1239. These were also known as the Preaching Friars or Shod Friars, because they wore sandals, as opposed to other orders. The friary was situated in the present-day Friars Street. In 1280 the order was granted royal permission to make a [[postern]] in the [[Newcastle town wall|town walls]] to communicate with their gardens outside the walls. On 19 June 1334, Edward Baliol, King of Scotland, did homage to King Edward III, on behalf of the kingdom of Scotland, in the church of the friary. Much of the original buildings of the friary still exist, mainly because, after the dissolution of the monasteries the friary of Blackfriars was rented out by the corporation to nine of the local trade guilds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twsitelines.info/smr/1433 |title=Newcastle, Dominican Friary (Blackfriars) &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk |publisher=Twsitelines.info |date= |accessdate=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nThe friary of Whitefriars ([[Carmelite]]) was established in 1262. The order was originally housed on the Wall Knoll in Pandon, but in 1307 it took over the buildings of another order, which went out of existence, the Friars of the Sac. The land, which had originally been given by [[Robert the Bruce]], was situated in the present-day Hanover Square, behind the [[Newcastle railway station|Central station]]. Nothing of the friary remains now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/smr/11101 |title=Newcastle, medieval town &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk |publisher=Twsitelines.info |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Austin Friars, Newcastle-upon-Tyne|friary of Austinfriars]] ([[Augustinian]]) was established in 1290. The friary was on the site where the [[Holy Jesus Hospital]] was built in 1682. The friary was traditionally the lodging place of English kings whenever they visited or passed through Newcastle. In 1503 [[Margaret Tudor|Princess Margaret]], eldest daughter of [[Henry VII of England]] stayed two days at the friary on her way to join her new husband [[James IV of Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-holyjesushospital/w-holyjesushospital-seeanddo.htm |title=National Trust &#124; Holy Jesus Hospital &#124; What to see & do |publisher=Nationaltrust.org.uk |accessdate=2008-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021002416/http://nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-holyjesushospital/w-holyjesushospital-seeanddo.htm |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Front of Holy Jesus Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|Front of the Holy Jesus Hospital]]\n\nThe friary of [[GreyFriars, Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Greyfriars]] ([[Franciscans]]) was established in 1274.

Nothing of the original buildings remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/kinggeorge/t/003ktop00000032u057y0000.html|title=This house was originally the monastery of Grey Friars, Newcastle-upon-Tyne|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe friary of the [[Trinitarian Order|Order of the Holy Trinity]], also known as the Trinitarians, was established in 1360. The order devoted a third of its income to buying back captives of the [[Saracens]], during the [[Crusades]]. Their house was on the Wall Knoll, in Pandon, to the east of the city, but within the walls. Wall Knoll had previously been occupied by the White Friars until they moved to new premises in 1307.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004893459.0001.000/1:13..8?rgn=div3;view=fulltext|title=Cowgate, Trinity House, Broad Chare|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll of the above religious houses were closed in about 1540, when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries.<ref name=\"Bean\">{{cite book |author=Bean, David |year=1971 |title=Tyneside: a Biography |publisher=Macmillan London Ltd |isbn=0-333-08655-4}}</ref>\n\nAn important street running through Newcastle at the time was Pilgrim Street, running northwards inside the walls and leading to the Pilgrim Gate on the north wall. The street still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/history-of-pilgrim-street/|title=History of Pilgrim Street|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tudor period==\nThe Scottish border wars continued for much of the 16th century, so that during that time, Newcastle was often threatened with invasion by the Scots, but also remained important as a border stronghold against them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://englandsnortheast.co.uk/BorderReivers.html|title=Border Reivers|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] begun by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1536, the five Newcastle friaries and the single nunnery were dissolved and the land was sold to the Corporation and to rich merchants. At this time there were fewer than 60 inmates of the religious houses in Newcastle. The convent of Blackfriars was leased to nine craft guilds to be used as their headquarters. This probably explains why it is the only one of the religious houses whose building survives to the present day. The priories at [[Tynemouth]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were also dissolved, thus ending the long-running rivalry between Newcastle and the church for control of trade on the Tyne. A little later, the property of the nunnery of St Bartholomew and of Grey Friars were bought by Robert Anderson, who had the buildings demolished to build his grand Newe House (also known as Anderson Place).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/SMR/4931|title=Anderson Place|publisher=TW Sitelines|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the gradual decline of the Scottish border wars the town walls were allowed to decline as well as the castle. By 1547, about 10,000 people were living in Newcastle. At the beginning of the 16th century exports of wool from Newcastle were more than twice the value of exports of coal, but during the century coal exports continued to increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/01/create-global-north-making-north-england-giant-free-trade-zone/|title=Let's create a 'Global North' by making the north of England a giant free trade zone|date=1 June 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[John Dudley]], Duke of Northumberland, sponsored an act allowing Newcastle to annexe [[Gateshead]] as its suburb. The main reason for this was to allow the Newcastle [[Hostmen of Newcastle upon Tyne|Hostmen]], who controlled the export of Tyne coal, to get their hands on the Gateshead coal mines, previously controlled by the Bishop of Durham. However, when [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories and as a result coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twsitelines.info/industrial-period|title=Industrial Period (1750 - 1950)|publisher=TW Sitelines|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe plague visited Newcastle four times during the 16th century, in 1579 when 2,000 people died,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/how-plague-wiped-out-nearly-12121647|date=3 November 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|title=How plague wiped out nearly half the population of 17th century Newcastle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> in 1589 when 1700 died, in 1595 and finally in 1597.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp23-46 |title=Historical events: 1585 - 1676 &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1600 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted Newcastle a charter for an exclusive body of electors, the right to elect the mayor and burgesses. The charter also gave the Hostmen exclusive rights to load coal at any point on the Tyne. The Hostmen developed as an exclusive group within the Merchant Adventurers who had been incorporated by a charter in 1547.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n==Stuart period==\nIn 1636 there was a serious outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Newcastle. There had been several previous outbreaks of the disease over the years, but this was the most serious. It is thought to have arrived from the Netherlands via ships that were trading between the Tyne and that country. It first appeared in the lower part of the town near the docks but gradually spread to all parts of the town.<ref>{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Tony |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/professor-keith-wrightson-give-talk-7252657 |title=Professor Keith Wrightson to give talk on new book detailing the plague in Newcastle |publisher=The Journal |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> As the disease gained hold the authorities took measures to control it by boarding up any properties that contained infected persons, meaning that whole families were locked up together with the infected family members.

This caused outrage amongst the London importers and the East Anglian shippers. Both groups decided to boycott Tyne coal and as a result forced Charles to reverse his decision in 1638.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1640 during the Second [[Bishops' Wars|Bishops' War]], the Scots successfully invaded Newcastle. The occupying army demanded \u00a3850 per day from the Corporation to billet the Scottish troops. Trade from the Tyne ground to a halt during the occupation. The Scots left in 1641 after receiving a Parliamentary pardon and a \u00a34,000,000 loan from the town.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1642 the [[English Civil War]] began. King Charles realised the value of the Tyne coal trade and therefore garrisoned Newcastle. A Royalist was appointed as governor. At that time, Newcastle and King's Lynn were the only important seaports to support the crown. In 1644 Parliament blockaded the Tyne to prevent the king from receiving revenue from the Tyne coal trade. Coal exports fell from 450,000 to 3,000 tons and London suffered a hard winter without fuel. Parliament encouraged the coal trade from the Wear to try to replace that lost from Newcastle but that was not enough to make up for the lost Tyneside tonnage.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1644 the Scots crossed the border. Newcastle strengthened its defences in preparation. The Scottish army, with 40,000 troops, besieged Newcastle for three months until the garrison of 1,500 surrendered. During the siege, the Scots bombarded the walls with their artillery, situated in Gateshead and Castle Leazes. The Scottish commander threatened to destroy the steeple of [[Newcastle Cathedral|St Nicholas church]] by gunfire if the mayor, [[John Marlay (MP)|Sir John Marley]], did not surrender the town. The mayor responded by placing Scottish prisoners that they had captured in the steeple, so saving it from destruction. The town walls were finally breached by a combination of artillery and [[sapping]].<ref name=\"Winter\"/> In gratitude for this defence, Charles gave Newcastle the motto 'Fortiter Defendit Triumphans' to be added to its coat of arms. The Scottish army occupied Northumberland and Durham for two years. The coal taxes had to pay for the Scottish occupation. In 1645 Charles surrendered to the Scots and was imprisoned in Newcastle for nine months. After the Civil War the coal trade on the Tyne soon picked up and exceeded its pre-war levels.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nA new [[Guildhall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Guildhall]] was completed on the Sandhill next to the river in 1655,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101120877-the-guildhall-and-merchants-court-westgate-ward#.WdAFXGhSwdU|title=The Guildhall and Merchants' Court|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> replacing an earlier facility damaged by fire in 1639,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twfire.gov.uk/about/history/timeline/#.WrdnBYjwYdU|title=Timeline: 1248 to 1967|publisher=Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> and became the meeting place of [[Newcastle City Council|Newcastle Town Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/caf-newcastles-guildhall-could-horizon-10832797|title=Caf\u00e9 at Newcastle's Guildhall could be on the horizon as leisure entrepreneur makes plans|first=Coreena |last=Ford|date=3 February 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> In 1681 the Hospital of the Holy Jesus was built partly on the site of the Austin Friars.

Charles died before the charter came into effect. In 1685, [[James II of England|James II]] tried to replace Corporation members with named Catholics. However, James' mandate was suspended in 1689 after the [[Glorious Revolution]] welcoming [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. In 1689, after the fall of James II, the people of Newcastle tore down his bronze equestrian statue in Sandhill and tossed it into the Tyne. The bronze was later used to make bells for All Saints Church.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1689 the Lort Burn was covered over. At this time it was an open sewer. The channel followed by the Lort Burn became the present day Dean Street. At that time, the centre of Newcastle was still the Sandhill area, with many merchants living along the Close or on the Side. The path of the main road through Newcastle ran from the single Tyne bridge, through Sandhill to the Side, a narrow street which climbed steeply on the north-east side of the castle hill until it reached the higher ground alongside St Nicholas' Church. As Newcastle developed, the Side became lined with buildings with projecting upper stories, so that the main street through Newcastle was a narrow, congested, steep thoroughfare.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\nIn 1701 the Keelmen's Hospital was built in the Sandgate area of the city, using funds provided by the keelmen.

Many of the Northumbrian gentry joined the rebels. The citizens prepared for its arrival by arresting Jacobite supporters and accepting 700 extra recruits into the local militia. The gates of the city were closed against the rebels. This proved enough to delay an attack until reinforcements arrived forcing the rebel army to move across to the west coast. The rebels finally surrendered at Preston.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1745, during a second Jacobite rising in favour of the [[Young Pretender]], a Scottish army crossed the border led by [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]. Once again Newcastle prepared by arresting Jacobite supporters and inducting 800 volunteers into the local militia. The town walls were strengthened, most of the gates were blocked up and some 200 cannon were deployed. 20,000 regulars were billeted on the Town Moor. These preparations were enough to force the rebel army to travel south via the west coast. They were eventually defeated at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] in 1746.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nNewcastle's actions during the 1715 rising in resisting the rebels and declaring for [[George I of England|George I]], in contrast to the rest of the region, is the most likely source of the nickname 'Geordie', applied to people from Tyneside, or more accurately Newcastle. Another theory, however, is that the name 'Geordie' came from the inventor of the [[Geordie lamp]], George Stephenson. It was a type of safety lamp used in mining, but was not invented until 1815. Apparently the term 'German Geordie' was in common use during the 18th century.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/> A [[Princess Mary Maternity Hospital|lying-in hospital]] was established in Newcastle in 1760.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1273|title=Princess Mary Maternity Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1771 a flood swept away much of the bridge at Newcastle. The bridge had been built in 1250 and repaired after a flood in 1339. The bridge supported various houses and three towers and an old chapel. A blue stone was placed in the middle of the bridge to mark the boundary between Newcastle and the Palatinate of Durham. A temporary wooden bridge had to be built, and this remained in use until 1781, when a new stone bridge was completed. The new bridge consisted of nine arches.

In 1834 Grainger won a competition to produce a new plan for central Newcastle. He put this plan into effect using the above architects as well as architects employed in his own office. Grainger and Oliver  had already built Leazes Terrace, Leazes Crescent and Leazes Place between 1829 and 1834. Grainger and Dobson had also built the Royal Arcade at the foot of Pilgrim Street between 1830 and 1832. The most ambitious project covered 12 acres {{convert|12|acre|m2}} in central Newcastle, on the site of Newe House (also called Anderson Place).  Grainger built three new thoroughfares, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street with many connecting streets, as well as the Central Exchange and the Grainger Market. John Wardle and George Walker, working in Grainger's  office, designed  Clayton Street, Grainger Street and most of Grey Street. Dobson designed the Grainger Market and much of the east side of Grey Street. John and Benjamin Green designed the [[Theatre Royal, Newcastle|Theatre Royal]] at the top of Grey Street, where Grainger placed the column of [[Grey's Monument]] as a focus for the whole scheme. Grey Street is considered to be one of the finest streets in the country, with its elegant curve. Unfortunately most of old Eldon Square was demolished in the 1960s in the name of progress. The Royal Arcade met a similar fate.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n[[File:B\u00e2timent Armstrong Newcastle Tyne 3.jpg|thumb|The Armstrong Building, now part of [[Newcastle University|Newcastle University.]]]]\nIn 1849 a new bridge was built across the river at Newcastle. This was the High Level Bridge, designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], and slightly up river from the existing bridge. The bridge was designed to carry road and rail traffic across the Tyne Gorge on two decks with rail traffic on the upper deck and road traffic on the lower. The new bridge meant that traffic could pass through Newcastle without having to negotiate the steep, narrow Side, as had been necessary for centuries. The bridge was opened by [[Queen Victoria]], who one year later opened the new Central Station, designed by John Dobson. Trains were now able to cross the river, directly into the centre of Newcastle and carry on up to Scotland.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/> The [[Army Riding School, Newcastle upon Tyne|Army Riding School]] was also completed in 1849.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/SMR/6251|title=Newcastle, Northumberland Road, Army Riding School|publisher=Site Lines|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 a [[Great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead|large fire]] started on the Gateshead quayside and an explosion caused it to spread across the river to the Newcastle quayside. A huge conflagration amongst the narrow alleys, or 'chares', destroyed the homes of 800 families as well as many business premises. The narrow alleys that had been destroyed were replaced by streets containing blocks of modern offices.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\nIn 1863 the [[Newcastle Town Hall|Town Hall]] in St Nicholas Square replaced the Guildhall as the meeting place of Newcastle Town Council.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.builderindex.org/?q=node/1629|title=Town Hall & Corn Market, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England|publisher=Civil Engineer and Architect's Journal|volume=21|date=1 October 1858|page=331}}</ref>\n\nIn 1876 the low level bridge was replaced by a new bridge known as the Swing Bridge, so called because the bridge was able to swing horizontally on a central axis and allow ships to pass on either side. This meant that for the first time sizeable ships could pass up-river beyond Newcastle. The bridge was built and paid for by [[William George Armstrong|William Armstrong]], a local arms manufacturer, who needed to have warships access his Elswick arms factory to fit armaments to them. The Swing Bridge's rotating mechanism is adapted from the cannon mounts developed in Armstrong's arms works.

Newcastle's development as a major city owed most to its central role in the production and export of coal. The phrase \"[[Selling coal to Newcastle|taking coals to Newcastle]]\" was first recorded in 1538; it proverbially denotes bringing a particular commodity to a place that has more than enough of it already.<ref>[http://www.northeasthistory.co.uk/the_north_east/history/coal/1100_1500/index.html \"Early Coal Mining 1100- 1500\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000000/http://www.northeasthistory.co.uk/the_north_east/history/coal/1100_1500/index.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}, ''[[The Northern Echo]]'s History Pages''</ref>\n\n===Local innovation===\nInnovation in Newcastle and surrounding areas included the following:\n* [[George Stephenson]] developed a miner's safety lamp at the same time that [[Humphry Davy]] developed a rival design.

In 1615 restrictions were put on the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found that glass could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. [[Huguenot]] glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up glasshouses in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the [[Ouseburn Valley|Ouseburn]] area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, [[Sephardic Jewish]] emigrants from [[Altare]], arrived in Newcastle from [[Stourbridge]] and established glasshouses along the Close, to manufacture high quality [[flint glass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twsitelines.info/SMR/5069 |title=Newcastle, Closegate Glasshouses &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk |publisher=Twsitelines.info |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in [[collier brig]]s. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light [[Baluster]]'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livingnorth.com/northeast/interiors/meet-glassmaker-jane-charles|title=Meet the glassmaker: Jane Charles|publisher=Living North|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Locomotive manufacture===\nIn 1823 George Stephenson and his son Robert established the world's first locomotive factory near [[Robert Stephenson and Company|Forth Street]] in Newcastle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/ITnewcastle.htm |title=Newcastle |publisher=Spartacus-educational.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> Here they built locomotives for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], as well as many others. It was here that the famous locomotive [[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]] was designed and manufactured in preparation for the [[Rainhill Trials]]. Apart from building locomotives for the British market, the Newcastle works also produced locomotives for Europe and America. The Forth Street works continued to build locomotives until 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/9e1d799c-07ce-3765-8653-c5062745aa7c|title=Records of Robert Stephenson & Company, Locomotive Manufacturers, Newcastle Upon Tyne (later Darlington, Durham)|publisher=National Railway Museum Archive|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\nIn 1296 a wooden, {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} long [[galley]] was constructed at the mouth of the Lort Burn in Newcastle, as part of a twenty-ship order from the king. The ship cost \u00a3205, and is the earliest record of shipbuilding in Newcastle. However the rise of the Tyne as a shipbuilding area was due to the need for collier [[brig]]s for the coal export trade. These wooden sailing ships were usually built locally, establishing local expertise in building ships. As ships changed from wood to steel, and from sail to steam, the local shipbuilding industry changed to build the new ships. Although shipbuilding was carried out up and down both sides of the river, the two main areas for building ships in Newcastle were Elswick, to the west, and Walker, to the east. By 1800 Tyneside was the third largest producer of ships in Britain. Unfortunately, after the Second World War, lack of modernisation and competition from abroad gradually caused the local industry to decline and die.<ref name=\"Winter\"/>\n\n===Armaments===\nIn 1847 [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] established a huge factory in Elswick, west of Newcastle. This was initially used to produce hydraulic cranes but subsequently began also to produce guns for both the army and the navy. After the Swing Bridge was built in 1876 allowing ships to pass up river, warships could have their armaments fitted alongside the Elswick works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/features/2002/07/bridges.shtml |title=Tyne Features - Bridges over the Tyne |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> Armstrong's company took over its industrial rival, [[Joseph Whitworth]] of Manchester in 1897.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Armstrong_Whitworth|title=Armstrong Whitworth|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Steam turbines===\n[[Charles Algernon Parsons]] invented the steam turbine and, in 1889, founded his own company [[C. A. Parsons and Company]] in [[Heaton, Newcastle]] to make steam turbines. Shortly after this, he realised that steam turbines could be used to propel ships and, in 1897, he founded a second company, [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company]] in [[Wallsend]]. It is there that he designed and manufactured [[Turbinia]]. Parsons turbines were initially used in warships but soon came to be used in merchant and passenger vessels, including the liner ''Mauretania'' which held the blue riband for the Atlantic crossing until 1929. Parsons' company in Heaton began to make turbo-generators for power stations and supplied power stations all over the world. The Heaton works, reduced in size, remains as part of the [[Siemens AG]] industrial giant.<ref name=\"Winter\"/>\n\n===Pottery===\nIn 1762 the [[Maling pottery]] was founded in Sunderland by French Huguenots, but transferred to Newcastle in 1817. A factory was built in the [[Ouseburn Valley|Ouseburn]] area of the city. The factory was rebuilt twice, finally occupying a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site that was claimed to be the biggest pottery in the world and which had its own railway station. The pottery pioneered use of machines in making potteries as opposed to hand production. In the 1890s the company went up-market and employed in-house designers. The period up to the Second World War was the most profitable with a constant stream of new designs being introduced. However, after the war, production gradually declined and the company closed in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/memories-historic-pottery-disappear-1423146|date=25 November 2010|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Memories of historic pottery may disappear|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion of the city==\nNewcastle was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]: the reformed [[municipal borough]] included the parishes of [[Byker]], [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], [[Heaton, Newcastle|Heaton]], [[Jesmond]], Newcastle All Saints, Newcastle St Andew, Newcastle St John, Newcastle St Nicholas, and [[Westgate, Newcastle upon Tyne|Westgate]]. The urban districts of [[Benwell]] and [[Fenham]] and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]] were added in 1904. In 1935, Newcastle gained [[Kenton, Newcastle upon Tyne|Kenton]] and parts of the parishes of [[West Brunton]], [[East Denton]], [[Fawdon]], [[Longbenton]]. The most recent expansion in Newcastle's boundaries took place under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974, when Newcastle became a [[metropolitan borough]], also including the urban districts of [[Gosforth]] and [[Newburn]], and the parishes of [[Brunswick (parish)|Brunswick]], [[Dinnington, Tyne and Wear|Dinnington]], [[Hazlerigg]], [[North Gosforth]] and [[Woolsington]] from the [[Castle Ward Rural District]], and the village of [[Westerhope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/7|title=Local Government Act 1974|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile [[Northumberland County Council]] was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1888]] and benefited from a dedicated meeting place when [[County Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|County Hall]] was completed in the Castle Garth area of Newcastle in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101024938-county-hall-westgate-ward#.WuWlu8gvwdU|title=County Hall|publisher=British listed buildings|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref> Following the [[Local Government Act 1972]] County Hall relocated to [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] in April 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/Northumberland-County-Council-to-spend-17m-on-HQ-revamp-e986a131-fc67-45c8-9502-691b9b6d8099-ds|title=Northumberland County Council to spend \u00a317m on HQ revamp|date=25 January 2018|publisher=Hexham Courant|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century==\n[[File:Tyne bridge 1928.jpg|thumb|The construction of the [[Tyne Bridge]] in the 1920s]]\nIn 1925 work began on a new high-level road bridge to span the Tyne Gorge between Newcastle and Gateshead. The capacity of the existing High-Level Bridge and Swing Bridge were being strained to the limit, and an additional bridge had been discussed for a long time. The contract was awarded to the Dorman Long Company and the bridge was finally opened by [[George V of England|King George V]] in 1928. The road deck was {{convert|84|ft|m}} above the river and was supported by a {{convert|531|ft|m}} steel arch. The new [[Tyne Bridge]] quickly became a symbol for Newcastle and Tyneside, and remains so today.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/>\n\nDuring the Second World War, Newcastle was largely spared the horrors inflicted upon other British cities bombed during [[the Blitz]]. Although the armaments factories and shipyards along the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]] were targeted by the German airforce, they largely escaped unscathed. Manors goods yard and [[Manors railway station|railway terminal]], to the east of the city centre, and the suburbs of [[Jesmond]] and [[Heaton, Newcastle|Heaton]] suffered bombing during 1941.

A School of Medicine and Surgery had been established in Newcastle in 1834. This eventually developed into a college of medicine attached to [[Durham University]]. A college of physical science was also founded and became Armstrong College in 1904. In 1934 the two colleges merged to become King's College, Durham. This remained as part of Durham University until the new university was created in 1963.

The leading political figure in the city during the 1960s was [[T. Dan Smith]] who oversaw a massive building programme of highrise housing estates and authorised the demolition of a quarter of the Georgian [[Grainger Town]] to make way for [[Eldon Square Shopping Centre]]. Smith's control in Newcastle collapsed when it was exposed that he had used public contracts to advantage himself and his business associates<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/stories-shocked-tyneside-high-rise-7236347|date=9 June 2014|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Stories that shocked Tyneside: The high rise and fall of a leader who got greedy|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> and for a time Newcastle became a byword for civic corruption as depicted in the films ''[[Get Carter]]'' and ''[[Stormy Monday (film)|Stormy Monday]]'' and in the television series ''[[Our Friends in the North]]''. However, much of the historic Grainger Town area survived and was, for the most part, fully restored in the late 1990s. [[Northumberland Street]], initially the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], was gradually closed to traffic from the 1970s and completely pedestrianised by 1998.<ref>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Ray |date=13 August 2011 |title=Crowds flock to road opening |work=[[Evening Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Young |first=Peter |date=10 June 1998 |title=No through road - work begins to ban traffic from city centre's flagship shopping street |work=[[Evening Chronicle]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978 a new rapid transport system, the Metro, was built, linking the Tyneside area.

This was the [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] Bridge, commonly known as the Metro Bridge. Eventually the Metro system was extended to reach Newcastle Airport in 1991, and in 2002 the Metro system was extended to the nearby city of [[Sunderland]].<ref name=\"nexus.org.uk\"/>\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, trade on the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides gradually declined, until by the 1980s both sides of the river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. Local government produced a master plan to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed in the space of a few years into a vibrant area, partially returning the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/remember-when-changing-newcastle-quayside-7059215|title=Remember When: A changing Newcastle Quayside - now and then|date=5 May 2014|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Millennium Bridge, Newcastle to Gateshead - geograph.org.uk - 1052003.jpg|thumb|Millennium Bridge, Newcastle to Gateshead]]\nThe [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge]], a foot and cycle bridge, {{convert|26|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|413|ft|m}} long, was completed in 2001.

To allow ships to pass, the whole structure, both arch and road-deck, rotates on huge bearings at either end so that the road deck is lifted. The bridge can be said to open and shut like a human eye. It is an important addition to the re-developed quayside area, providing a vital link between the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nToday the city is a vibrant centre for office and retail employment, but just a short distance away there are impoverished inner-city [[housing estate]]s, in areas originally built to provide affordable housing for employees of the [[shipyard]]s and other heavy industries that lined the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]].

Originally known by its Roman name ''Pons Aelius'', the name \"Newcastle\" has been used since the [[Norman conquest of England]]. Due to its prime location on the [[River Tyne]], the town developed greatly during the Middle Ages and it was to play a major role in the [[Industrial Revolution]], being granted city status in 1882. Today, the city is a major retail, commercial and cultural centre.\n\n==Roman settlement==\n{{Main article|Pons Aelius}}\n\nThe history of Newcastle dates from about AD&nbsp;120, when the Romans built the first bridge to cross the River Tyne at that point. The bridge was called [[Pons Aelius]] or 'Bridge of Aelius', Aelius being the family name of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlecastle.co.uk/roman-and-anglo-saxon|title=Roman and Anglo-Saxon|publisher=Newcastle.co.uk}}</ref> who was responsible for the Roman wall built across northern England along the Tyne\u2013Solway gap. [[Hadrian's Wall]] ran through present-day Newcastle, with stretches of wall and turrets visible along the West Road, and at a temple in [[Benwell]]. Traces of a [[milecastle]] were found on Westgate Road, midway between Clayton Street and Grainger Street, and it is likely that the course of the wall corresponded to present-day Westgate Road. The course of the wall can be traced eastwards to the [[Segedunum]] [[castra|Roman fort]] at [[Wallsend]], with the fort of [[Arbeia]] down-river at the mouth of the Tyne, on the south bank in what is now [[South Shields]]. The Tyne was then a wider, shallower river at this point and it is thought that the bridge was probably about {{convert|700|ft|m}} long, made of wood and supported on stone piers. It is probable that it was sited near the current [[Swing Bridge, River Tyne|Swing Bridge]], due to the fact that Roman artefacts were found there during the building of the latter bridge. Hadrian himself probably visited the site in 122. A shrine was set up on the completed bridge in 123 by the [[Legio VI Victrix|6th Legion]], with two altars to Neptune and Oceanus respectively. The two altars were subsequently found in the river and are on display in the [[Great North Museum]] in Newcastle.<ref name=\"Marshall\">{{cite book |author=Marshall, Michael W |year=1997 |title=Turning Tides |publisher=Keepgate Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-899506-35-7}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans built a stone-walled fort in 150 to protect the river crossing which was at the foot of the Tyne Gorge, and this took the name of the bridge so that the whole settlement was known as ''Pons Aelius''. The fort was situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge, on the site of the present [[Newcastle Castle Keep|Castle Keep]]. Pons Aelius is last mentioned in 400, in a Roman document listing all of the Roman military outposts. It is likely that nestling in the shadow of the fort would have been a small ''vicus'', or village. Unfortunately, no buildings have been detected; only a few pieces of flagging. It is clear that there was a Roman cemetery near Clavering Place, behind the [[Newcastle railway station|Central station]], as a number of Roman coffins and sarcophagi have been unearthed there.<ref name=\"Winter\">{{cite book |author1=David Winter |author2=Peter Milne |author3=Jonathan Brown |author4=Alan Rushworth |year=1989 |title=Newcastle upon Tyne |publisher=Northern Heritage Consultancy Ltd |isbn=1-872346-00-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/newcastleupontyn0000unse_f8l9 }}</ref>\n\nDespite the presence of the bridge, the settlement of Pons Aelius was not particularly important among the northern Roman settlements. The most important stations were those on the highway of [[Dere Street]] running from [[Eboracum]] ([[York]]) through [[Corstopitum]] ([[Corbridge]]) and to the lands north of the Wall. Corstopitum, being a major arsenal and supply centre, was much larger and more populous than Pons Aelius.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\">{{cite book |author=Middlebrook, Sydney |year=1950 |title=Newcastle upon Tyne, Its Growth and Achievement |publisher=SR Publishers Ltd |isbn=0-85409-523-3}}</ref>\n\n==Anglo-Saxon development==\nThe [[Angles]] arrived in the North-East of England in about 500 and may have landed on the Tyne. There is no evidence of an Anglo-Saxon settlement on or near the site of Pons Aelius during the Anglo-Saxon age. The bridge probably survived and there may well have been a small village at the northern end, but no evidence survives. At that time the region was dominated by two kingdoms, [[Bernicia]], north of the [[River Tees|Tees]] and ruled from [[Bamburgh]], and [[Deira (kingdom)|Deira]], south of the Tees and ruled from [[York]]. Bernicia and Deira combined to form the kingdom of Northanhymbra ([[Northumbria]]) early in the 7th century. There were three local kings who held the title of [[Bretwalda]] \u2013 'Lord of Britain', [[Edwin of Deira]] (627\u2013632), [[Oswald of Bernicia]] (633\u2013641) and [[Oswy of Northumbria]] (641\u2013658). The 7th century became known as the 'Golden Age of Northumbria', when the area was a beacon of culture and learning in Europe. The greatness of this period was based on its generally Christian culture and resulted in the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] amongst other treasures. The Tyne valley was dotted with monasteries, with those at [[Monkwearmouth]], [[Hexham]] and [[Jarrow]] being the most famous. [[Bede]], who was based at Jarrow, wrote of a royal estate, known as ''Ad Murum'', 'at the Wall', {{convert|12|mi|km}} from the sea. It is thought that this estate may have been in what is now Newcastle. At some unknown time, the site of Newcastle came to be known as Monkchester.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp1-22|title=Historical events: To 1584 &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The reason for this title is unknown, as we are unaware of any specific monasteries at the site, and [[Bede]] made no reference to it. In 875 [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]], the Danish Viking conqueror of York, led an army that attacked and pillaged various monasteries in the area, and it is thought that Monkchester was also pillaged at this time. Little more was heard of it until the coming of the [[Normans]].<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n==Norman period==\n[[File:Newcastle schloss.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Castle, Newcastle|The Castle Keep]]]]\nAfter the arrival of [[William the Conqueror]] in England in 1066, the whole of England was quickly subjected to [[Normans|Norman]] rule. However, in Northumbria there was great resistance to the Normans, and in 1069 the newly appointed Norman Earl of Northumbria, [[Robert de Comines]] and 700 of his men were killed by the local population at [[Durham, England|Durham]]. The Northumbrians then marched on [[York]], but William was able to suppress the uprising. That same year, a second uprising occurred when a [[Danish people|Danish]] fleet landed in the [[Humber]]. The Northumbrians again attacked York and destroyed the garrison there. William was again able to suppress the uprising, but this time he took revenge. He laid waste to the whole of the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and the land from York to the [[Tees]]. In 1080, [[William Walcher]], the Norman bishop of Durham and his followers were brutally murdered at [[Gateshead]]. This time [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], bishop of [[Bayeux]], William's half brother, devastated the land between the Tees and the [[River Tweed|Tweed]]. This was known as the \u2018[[Harrying of the North]]\u2019. This devastation is reflected in the [[Domesday Book]]. The destruction had such an effect that the North remained poor and backward at least until [[Tudor period|Tudor]] times and perhaps until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Newcastle suffered in this respect with the rest of the North.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\nIn 1080 William sent his eldest son, [[Robert Curthose]], north to defend the kingdom against the [[Scotland|Scots]]. After his campaign, he moved to Monkchester and began the building of a 'New Castle'. This was of the \"[[motte-and-bailey]]\" type of construction, a wooden tower on top of an earthen mound (motte), surrounded by a moat and wooden stockade (bailey). It was this castle that gave Newcastle its name. In 1095 the Earl of Northumbria, [[Robert de Mowbray]], rose up against the king, [[William Rufus]] and Rufus sent an army north to recapture the castle. From then on the castle became crown property and was an important base from which the king could control the northern barons. The Northumbrian earldom was abolished and a Sheriff of Northumberland was appointed to administer the region. In 1091 the parish church of [[St Nicholas]] was consecrated on the site of the present [[Newcastle Cathedral|Anglican cathedral]], close by the bailey of the new castle. The church is believed to have been a wooden building on stone footings.<ref name=\"Moffat\">{{cite book |author=Moffat and Rosie |year=2005 |title=Tyneside |publisher=Mainstream Publishing Ltd |isbn=1-84596-119-6}}</ref>\n\nNot a trace of the tower or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] replaced it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of \u00a31,444. A stone bailey, in the form of a triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The great outer gateway to the castle, called 'the [[The Black Gate (The Castle, Newcastle)|Black Gate]]\u2019, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. There were at that time no town walls and when attacked by the Scots, the townspeople had to crowd into the bailey for safety. It is probable that the new castle acted as a magnet for local merchants because of the safety it provided. This in turn would help to expand trade in the town. At this time wool, skins and lead were being exported, whilst alum, pepper and ginger were being imported from France and Flanders.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n==Middle Ages==\nThroughout the [[Middle Ages]], Newcastle was England's northern fortress, the centre for assembled armies. The [[Border country|Border]] war against [[Scotland]] lasted intermittently for several centuries \u2013 possibly the longest border war ever waged. During the civil war between [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and [[Matilda of Boulogne|Matilda]], [[David I of Scotland|David 1st of Scotland]] and his son were granted Cumbria and Northumberland respectively, so that for a period from 1139 to 1157, Newcastle was effectively in Scottish hands. It is believed that during this period, King David may have built the church of St Andrew and the Benedictine nunnery in Newcastle. However, King Stephen's successor, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] was strong enough to take back the Earldom of Northumbria from [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]].<ref name=\"Winter\"/>\n\nThe Scots king [[William the Lion]] was imprisoned in Newcastle, in 1174, after being captured at the [[Battle of Alnwick (1174)|Battle of Alnwick]]. [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] brought the [[Stone of Scone]] and [[William Wallace]] south through the town and Newcastle was successfully defended against the Scots three times during the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deremilitari.org/2014/05/william-wallaces-invasion-of-northern-england-in-1297/|title=William Wallace's Invasion of Northern England in 1297|date=30 May 2014|publisher=De Re Militari|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAround 1200, stone-faced, clay-filled jetties were starting to project into the river, an indication that trade was increasing in Newcastle. As the Roman roads continued to deteriorate, sea travel was gaining in importance. By 1275 Newcastle was the sixth largest wool exporting port in England. The principal exports at this time were wool, timber, coal, millstones, dairy produce, fish, salt and hides. Much of the developing trade was with the [[Baltic Countries|Baltic]] countries and Germany. Most of the Newcastle merchants were situated near the river, below the Castle. The earliest known charter was dated 1175 in the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], giving the townspeople some control over their town. In 1216 [[John of England|King John]] granted Newcastle a mayor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-celebrates-800-years-mayors-10822604|date=2 February 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Newcastle celebrates 800 years of mayors and Freemen at St Nicholas Cathedral|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> and also allowed the formation of guilds (known as Mysteries). These were cartels formed within different trades, which restricted trade to guild members. There were initially twelve guilds. Coal was being exported from Newcastle by 1250, and by 1350 the burgesses received a royal licence to export coal. This licence to export coal was jealously guarded by the Newcastle burgesses, and they tried to prevent any one else on the Tyne from exporting coal except through Newcastle. The burgesses similarly tried to prevent fish from being sold anywhere else on the Tyne except Newcastle. This led to conflicts with [[Gateshead]] and [[South Shields]].<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1265, the town was granted permission to impose a 'Wall Tax' or Murage,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp601-611|title=The Corporation: Grants and charters &#124; British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> to pay for the construction of a fortified wall to enclose the town and protect it from Scottish invaders. The [[Newcastle town wall|town walls]] were not completed until early in the 14th century. They were two miles (3&nbsp;km) long, {{convert|9|ft|m}} thick and {{convert|25|ft|m}} high. They had six main gates, as well as some smaller gates, and had 17 towers.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1019278 |desc=Newcastle upon Tyne town defences: Gunner Tower, Newcastle upon Tyne |accessdate=2019-10-01}}</ref> The land within the walls was divided almost equally by the Lort Burn, which flowed southwards and joined the Tyne to the east of the Castle. The town began to expand north of the Castle and west of the Lort Burn with various markets being set up within the walls.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1400 [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] granted a new charter, creating a [[County corporate]] which separated the town, but not the Castle, from the county of Northumberland and recognised it as a \"county of itself\" with a right to have a [[Sheriff of Newcastle upon Tyne|sheriff of its own]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> The burgesses were now allowed to choose six aldermen who, with the mayor would be justices of the peace. The mayor and sheriff were allowed to hold borough courts in the [[Guildhall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Guildhall]].<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n===Religious houses===\nDuring the Middle Ages a number of religious houses were established within the walls: the first of these was the [[Benedictine]] [[nunnery]] of [[St Bartholomew]] founded in 1086 near the present-day Nun Street. Both [[David I of Scotland]] and [[Henry I of England]] were benefactors of the religious house. Nothing of the nunnery remains now.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eneas |last=Mackenzie|title= 'Religious houses: Nunnery of St Bartholomew', in Historical Account of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Including the Borough of Gateshead (Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1827)|pages= 118\u2013123|publisher= British History Online|url= http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp118-123 |accessdate= 25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[friar]]y of [[Blackfriars, Newcastle]] ([[Dominican Order|Dominican]]) was established in 1239. These were also known as the Preaching Friars or Shod Friars, because they wore sandals, as opposed to other orders. The friary was situated in the present-day Friars Street. In 1280 the order was granted royal permission to make a [[postern]] in the [[Newcastle town wall|town walls]] to communicate with their gardens outside the walls. On 19 June 1334, Edward Baliol, King of Scotland, did homage to King Edward III, on behalf of the kingdom of Scotland, in the church of the friary. Much of the original buildings of the friary still exist, mainly because, after the dissolution of the monasteries the friary of Blackfriars was rented out by the corporation to nine of the local trade guilds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twsitelines.info/smr/1433 |title=Newcastle, Dominican Friary (Blackfriars) &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk |publisher=Twsitelines.info |date= |accessdate=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nThe friary of Whitefriars ([[Carmelite]]) was established in 1262. The order was originally housed on the Wall Knoll in Pandon, but in 1307 it took over the buildings of another order, which went out of existence, the Friars of the Sac. The land, which had originally been given by [[Robert the Bruce]], was situated in the present-day Hanover Square, behind the [[Newcastle railway station|Central station]]. Nothing of the friary remains now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/smr/11101 |title=Newcastle, medieval town &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk |publisher=Twsitelines.info |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Austin Friars, Newcastle-upon-Tyne|friary of Austinfriars]] ([[Augustinian]]) was established in 1290. The friary was on the site where the [[Holy Jesus Hospital]] was built in 1682. The friary was traditionally the lodging place of English kings whenever they visited or passed through Newcastle. In 1503 [[Margaret Tudor|Princess Margaret]], eldest daughter of [[Henry VII of England]] stayed two days at the friary on her way to join her new husband [[James IV of Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-holyjesushospital/w-holyjesushospital-seeanddo.htm |title=National Trust &#124; Holy Jesus Hospital &#124; What to see & do |publisher=Nationaltrust.org.uk |accessdate=2008-10-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021002416/http://nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-holyjesushospital/w-holyjesushospital-seeanddo.htm |archivedate = 21 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Front of Holy Jesus Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|Front of the Holy Jesus Hospital]]\n\nThe friary of [[GreyFriars, Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Greyfriars]] ([[Franciscans]]) was established in 1274.

The order devoted a third of its income to buying back captives of the [[Saracens]], during the [[Crusades]]. Their house was on the Wall Knoll, in Pandon, to the east of the city, but within the walls. Wall Knoll had previously been occupied by the White Friars until they moved to new premises in 1307.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004893459.0001.000/1:13..8?rgn=div3;view=fulltext|title=Cowgate, Trinity House, Broad Chare|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll of the above religious houses were closed in about 1540, when Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries.<ref name=\"Bean\">{{cite book |author=Bean, David |year=1971 |title=Tyneside: a Biography |publisher=Macmillan London Ltd |isbn=0-333-08655-4}}</ref>\n\nAn important street running through Newcastle at the time was Pilgrim Street, running northwards inside the walls and leading to the Pilgrim Gate on the north wall. The street still exists today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://co-curate.ncl.ac.uk/history-of-pilgrim-street/|title=History of Pilgrim Street|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Tudor period==\nThe Scottish border wars continued for much of the 16th century, so that during that time, Newcastle was often threatened with invasion by the Scots, but also remained important as a border stronghold against them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://englandsnortheast.co.uk/BorderReivers.html|title=Border Reivers|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] begun by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1536, the five Newcastle friaries and the single nunnery were dissolved and the land was sold to the Corporation and to rich merchants. At this time there were fewer than 60 inmates of the religious houses in Newcastle. The convent of Blackfriars was leased to nine craft guilds to be used as their headquarters. This probably explains why it is the only one of the religious houses whose building survives to the present day. The priories at [[Tynemouth]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] were also dissolved, thus ending the long-running rivalry between Newcastle and the church for control of trade on the Tyne. A little later, the property of the nunnery of St Bartholomew and of Grey Friars were bought by Robert Anderson, who had the buildings demolished to build his grand Newe House (also known as Anderson Place).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/SMR/4931|title=Anderson Place|publisher=TW Sitelines|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the gradual decline of the Scottish border wars the town walls were allowed to decline as well as the castle. By 1547, about 10,000 people were living in Newcastle. At the beginning of the 16th century exports of wool from Newcastle were more than twice the value of exports of coal, but during the century coal exports continued to increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/01/create-global-north-making-north-england-giant-free-trade-zone/|title=Let's create a 'Global North' by making the north of England a giant free trade zone|date=1 June 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], [[John Dudley]], Duke of Northumberland, sponsored an act allowing Newcastle to annexe [[Gateshead]] as its suburb. The main reason for this was to allow the Newcastle [[Hostmen of Newcastle upon Tyne|Hostmen]], who controlled the export of Tyne coal, to get their hands on the Gateshead coal mines, previously controlled by the Bishop of Durham. However, when [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories and as a result coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twsitelines.info/industrial-period|title=Industrial Period (1750 - 1950)|publisher=TW Sitelines|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe plague visited Newcastle four times during the 16th century, in 1579 when 2,000 people died,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/how-plague-wiped-out-nearly-12121647|date=3 November 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|title=How plague wiped out nearly half the population of 17th century Newcastle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> in 1589 when 1700 died, in 1595 and finally in 1597.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/no-series/newcastle-historical-account/pp23-46 |title=Historical events: 1585 - 1676 &#124; British History Online |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1600 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] granted Newcastle a charter for an exclusive body of electors, the right to elect the mayor and burgesses. The charter also gave the Hostmen exclusive rights to load coal at any point on the Tyne. The Hostmen developed as an exclusive group within the Merchant Adventurers who had been incorporated by a charter in 1547.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\n==Stuart period==\nIn 1636 there was a serious outbreak of [[bubonic plague]] in Newcastle. There had been several previous outbreaks of the disease over the years, but this was the most serious. It is thought to have arrived from the Netherlands via ships that were trading between the Tyne and that country. It first appeared in the lower part of the town near the docks but gradually spread to all parts of the town.<ref>{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Tony |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/professor-keith-wrightson-give-talk-7252657 |title=Professor Keith Wrightson to give talk on new book detailing the plague in Newcastle |publisher=The Journal |date=2014-06-11 |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> As the disease gained hold the authorities took measures to control it by boarding up any properties that contained infected persons, meaning that whole families were locked up together with the infected family members.

This caused outrage amongst the London importers and the East Anglian shippers. Both groups decided to boycott Tyne coal and as a result forced Charles to reverse his decision in 1638.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1640 during the Second [[Bishops' Wars|Bishops' War]], the Scots successfully invaded Newcastle. The occupying army demanded \u00a3850 per day from the Corporation to billet the Scottish troops. Trade from the Tyne ground to a halt during the occupation. The Scots left in 1641 after receiving a Parliamentary pardon and a \u00a34,000,000 loan from the town.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1642 the [[English Civil War]] began. King Charles realised the value of the Tyne coal trade and therefore garrisoned Newcastle. A Royalist was appointed as governor. At that time, Newcastle and King's Lynn were the only important seaports to support the crown. In 1644 Parliament blockaded the Tyne to prevent the king from receiving revenue from the Tyne coal trade. Coal exports fell from 450,000 to 3,000 tons and London suffered a hard winter without fuel. Parliament encouraged the coal trade from the Wear to try to replace that lost from Newcastle but that was not enough to make up for the lost Tyneside tonnage.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1644 the Scots crossed the border. Newcastle strengthened its defences in preparation. The Scottish army, with 40,000 troops, besieged Newcastle for three months until the garrison of 1,500 surrendered. During the siege, the Scots bombarded the walls with their artillery, situated in Gateshead and Castle Leazes. The Scottish commander threatened to destroy the steeple of [[Newcastle Cathedral|St Nicholas church]] by gunfire if the mayor, [[John Marlay (MP)|Sir John Marley]], did not surrender the town. The mayor responded by placing Scottish prisoners that they had captured in the steeple, so saving it from destruction. The town walls were finally breached by a combination of artillery and [[sapping]].<ref name=\"Winter\"/> In gratitude for this defence, Charles gave Newcastle the motto 'Fortiter Defendit Triumphans' to be added to its coat of arms. The Scottish army occupied Northumberland and Durham for two years. The coal taxes had to pay for the Scottish occupation. In 1645 Charles surrendered to the Scots and was imprisoned in Newcastle for nine months. After the Civil War the coal trade on the Tyne soon picked up and exceeded its pre-war levels.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nA new [[Guildhall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Guildhall]] was completed on the Sandhill next to the river in 1655,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101120877-the-guildhall-and-merchants-court-westgate-ward#.WdAFXGhSwdU|title=The Guildhall and Merchants' Court|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref> replacing an earlier facility damaged by fire in 1639,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twfire.gov.uk/about/history/timeline/#.WrdnBYjwYdU|title=Timeline: 1248 to 1967|publisher=Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> and became the meeting place of [[Newcastle City Council|Newcastle Town Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/caf-newcastles-guildhall-could-horizon-10832797|title=Caf\u00e9 at Newcastle's Guildhall could be on the horizon as leisure entrepreneur makes plans|first=Coreena |last=Ford|date=3 February 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref> In 1681 the Hospital of the Holy Jesus was built partly on the site of the Austin Friars.

Charles died before the charter came into effect. In 1685, [[James II of England|James II]] tried to replace Corporation members with named Catholics. However, James' mandate was suspended in 1689 after the [[Glorious Revolution]] welcoming [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. In 1689, after the fall of James II, the people of Newcastle tore down his bronze equestrian statue in Sandhill and tossed it into the Tyne. The bronze was later used to make bells for All Saints Church.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1689 the Lort Burn was covered over. At this time it was an open sewer. The channel followed by the Lort Burn became the present day Dean Street. At that time, the centre of Newcastle was still the Sandhill area, with many merchants living along the Close or on the Side. The path of the main road through Newcastle ran from the single Tyne bridge, through Sandhill to the Side, a narrow street which climbed steeply on the north-east side of the castle hill until it reached the higher ground alongside St Nicholas' Church. As Newcastle developed, the Side became lined with buildings with projecting upper stories, so that the main street through Newcastle was a narrow, congested, steep thoroughfare.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n\nIn 1701 the Keelmen's Hospital was built in the Sandgate area of the city, using funds provided by the keelmen.

Many of the Northumbrian gentry joined the rebels. The citizens prepared for its arrival by arresting Jacobite supporters and accepting 700 extra recruits into the local militia. The gates of the city were closed against the rebels. This proved enough to delay an attack until reinforcements arrived forcing the rebel army to move across to the west coast. The rebels finally surrendered at Preston.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nIn 1745, during a second Jacobite rising in favour of the [[Young Pretender]], a Scottish army crossed the border led by [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]. Once again Newcastle prepared by arresting Jacobite supporters and inducting 800 volunteers into the local militia. The town walls were strengthened, most of the gates were blocked up and some 200 cannon were deployed. 20,000 regulars were billeted on the Town Moor. These preparations were enough to force the rebel army to travel south via the west coast. They were eventually defeated at [[Battle of Culloden|Culloden]] in 1746.<ref name=\"Marshall\"/>\n\nNewcastle's actions during the 1715 rising in resisting the rebels and declaring for [[George I of England|George I]], in contrast to the rest of the region, is the most likely source of the nickname 'Geordie', applied to people from Tyneside, or more accurately Newcastle. Another theory, however, is that the name 'Geordie' came from the inventor of the [[Geordie lamp]], George Stephenson. It was a type of safety lamp used in mining, but was not invented until 1815. Apparently the term 'German Geordie' was in common use during the 18th century.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/> A [[Princess Mary Maternity Hospital|lying-in hospital]] was established in Newcastle in 1760.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1273|title=Princess Mary Maternity Hospital, Newcastle Upon Tyne|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1771 a flood swept away much of the bridge at Newcastle. The bridge had been built in 1250 and repaired after a flood in 1339. The bridge supported various houses and three towers and an old chapel. A blue stone was placed in the middle of the bridge to mark the boundary between Newcastle and the Palatinate of Durham. A temporary wooden bridge had to be built, and this remained in use until 1781, when a new stone bridge was completed. The new bridge consisted of nine arches.

In 1834 Grainger won a competition to produce a new plan for central Newcastle. He put this plan into effect using the above architects as well as architects employed in his own office. Grainger and Oliver  had already built Leazes Terrace, Leazes Crescent and Leazes Place between 1829 and 1834. Grainger and Dobson had also built the Royal Arcade at the foot of Pilgrim Street between 1830 and 1832. The most ambitious project covered 12 acres {{convert|12|acre|m2}} in central Newcastle, on the site of Newe House (also called Anderson Place).  Grainger built three new thoroughfares, Grey Street, Grainger Street and Clayton Street with many connecting streets, as well as the Central Exchange and the Grainger Market. John Wardle and George Walker, working in Grainger's  office, designed  Clayton Street, Grainger Street and most of Grey Street. Dobson designed the Grainger Market and much of the east side of Grey Street. John and Benjamin Green designed the [[Theatre Royal, Newcastle|Theatre Royal]] at the top of Grey Street, where Grainger placed the column of [[Grey's Monument]] as a focus for the whole scheme. Grey Street is considered to be one of the finest streets in the country, with its elegant curve. Unfortunately most of old Eldon Square was demolished in the 1960s in the name of progress. The Royal Arcade met a similar fate.<ref name=\"Middlebrook\"/>\n[[File:B\u00e2timent Armstrong Newcastle Tyne 3.jpg|thumb|The Armstrong Building, now part of [[Newcastle University|Newcastle University.]]]]\nIn 1849 a new bridge was built across the river at Newcastle. This was the High Level Bridge, designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], and slightly up river from the existing bridge. The bridge was designed to carry road and rail traffic across the Tyne Gorge on two decks with rail traffic on the upper deck and road traffic on the lower. The new bridge meant that traffic could pass through Newcastle without having to negotiate the steep, narrow Side, as had been necessary for centuries. The bridge was opened by [[Queen Victoria]], who one year later opened the new Central Station, designed by John Dobson. Trains were now able to cross the river, directly into the centre of Newcastle and carry on up to Scotland.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/> The [[Army Riding School, Newcastle upon Tyne|Army Riding School]] was also completed in 1849.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twsitelines.info/SMR/6251|title=Newcastle, Northumberland Road, Army Riding School|publisher=Site Lines|accessdate=4 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 a [[Great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead|large fire]] started on the Gateshead quayside and an explosion caused it to spread across the river to the Newcastle quayside. A huge conflagration amongst the narrow alleys, or 'chares', destroyed the homes of 800 families as well as many business premises.

This meant that for the first time sizeable ships could pass up-river beyond Newcastle. The bridge was built and paid for by [[William George Armstrong|William Armstrong]], a local arms manufacturer, who needed to have warships access his Elswick arms factory to fit armaments to them.

In 1615 restrictions were put on the use of wood for manufacturing glass. It was found that glass could be manufactured using the local coal, and so a glassmaking industry grew up on Tyneside. [[Huguenot]] glassmakers came over from France as refugees from persecution and set up glasshouses in the Skinnerburn area of Newcastle. Eventually, glass production moved to the [[Ouseburn Valley|Ouseburn]] area of Newcastle. In 1684 the Dagnia family, [[Sephardic Jewish]] emigrants from [[Altare]], arrived in Newcastle from [[Stourbridge]] and established glasshouses along the Close, to manufacture high quality [[flint glass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.twsitelines.info/SMR/5069 |title=Newcastle, Closegate Glasshouses &#124; sitelines.newcastle.gov.uk |publisher=Twsitelines.info |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> The glass manufacturers used sand ballast from the boats arriving in the river as the main raw material. The glassware was then exported in [[collier brig]]s. The period from 1730 to 1785 was the highpoint of Newcastle glass manufacture, when the local glassmakers produced the 'Newcastle Light [[Baluster]]'. The glassmaking industry still exists in the west end of the city with local Artist and Glassmaker Jane Charles carrying on over four hundred years of hot glass blowing in Newcastle upon Tyne.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livingnorth.com/northeast/interiors/meet-glassmaker-jane-charles|title=Meet the glassmaker: Jane Charles|publisher=Living North|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Locomotive manufacture===\nIn 1823 George Stephenson and his son Robert established the world's first locomotive factory near [[Robert Stephenson and Company|Forth Street]] in Newcastle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/ITnewcastle.htm |title=Newcastle |publisher=Spartacus-educational.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> Here they built locomotives for the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], as well as many others. It was here that the famous locomotive [[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]] was designed and manufactured in preparation for the [[Rainhill Trials]]. Apart from building locomotives for the British market, the Newcastle works also produced locomotives for Europe and America. The Forth Street works continued to build locomotives until 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/9e1d799c-07ce-3765-8653-c5062745aa7c|title=Records of Robert Stephenson & Company, Locomotive Manufacturers, Newcastle Upon Tyne (later Darlington, Durham)|publisher=National Railway Museum Archive|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\nIn 1296 a wooden, {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} long [[galley]] was constructed at the mouth of the Lort Burn in Newcastle, as part of a twenty-ship order from the king. The ship cost \u00a3205, and is the earliest record of shipbuilding in Newcastle. However the rise of the Tyne as a shipbuilding area was due to the need for collier [[brig]]s for the coal export trade. These wooden sailing ships were usually built locally, establishing local expertise in building ships. As ships changed from wood to steel, and from sail to steam, the local shipbuilding industry changed to build the new ships. Although shipbuilding was carried out up and down both sides of the river, the two main areas for building ships in Newcastle were Elswick, to the west, and Walker, to the east. By 1800 Tyneside was the third largest producer of ships in Britain. Unfortunately, after the Second World War, lack of modernisation and competition from abroad gradually caused the local industry to decline and die.<ref name=\"Winter\"/>\n\n===Armaments===\nIn 1847 [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] established a huge factory in Elswick, west of Newcastle. This was initially used to produce hydraulic cranes but subsequently began also to produce guns for both the army and the navy. After the Swing Bridge was built in 1876 allowing ships to pass up river, warships could have their armaments fitted alongside the Elswick works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/features/2002/07/bridges.shtml |title=Tyne Features - Bridges over the Tyne |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref> Armstrong's company took over its industrial rival, [[Joseph Whitworth]] of Manchester in 1897.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Armstrong_Whitworth|title=Armstrong Whitworth|publisher=Grace's Guide|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Steam turbines===\n[[Charles Algernon Parsons]] invented the steam turbine and, in 1889, founded his own company [[C. A. Parsons and Company]] in [[Heaton, Newcastle]] to make steam turbines. Shortly after this, he realised that steam turbines could be used to propel ships and, in 1897, he founded a second company, [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company]] in [[Wallsend]]. It is there that he designed and manufactured [[Turbinia]]. Parsons turbines were initially used in warships but soon came to be used in merchant and passenger vessels, including the liner ''Mauretania'' which held the blue riband for the Atlantic crossing until 1929. Parsons' company in Heaton began to make turbo-generators for power stations and supplied power stations all over the world. The Heaton works, reduced in size, remains as part of the [[Siemens AG]] industrial giant.<ref name=\"Winter\"/>\n\n===Pottery===\nIn 1762 the [[Maling pottery]] was founded in Sunderland by French Huguenots, but transferred to Newcastle in 1817. A factory was built in the [[Ouseburn Valley|Ouseburn]] area of the city. The factory was rebuilt twice, finally occupying a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} site that was claimed to be the biggest pottery in the world and which had its own railway station. The pottery pioneered use of machines in making potteries as opposed to hand production. In the 1890s the company went up-market and employed in-house designers. The period up to the Second World War was the most profitable with a constant stream of new designs being introduced. However, after the war, production gradually declined and the company closed in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/memories-historic-pottery-disappear-1423146|date=25 November 2010|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Memories of historic pottery may disappear|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Expansion of the city==\nNewcastle was one of the boroughs reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]: the reformed [[municipal borough]] included the parishes of [[Byker]], [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], [[Heaton, Newcastle|Heaton]], [[Jesmond]], Newcastle All Saints, Newcastle St Andew, Newcastle St John, Newcastle St Nicholas, and [[Westgate, Newcastle upon Tyne|Westgate]]. The urban districts of [[Benwell]] and [[Fenham]] and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]] were added in 1904. In 1935, Newcastle gained [[Kenton, Newcastle upon Tyne|Kenton]] and parts of the parishes of [[West Brunton]], [[East Denton]], [[Fawdon]], [[Longbenton]]. The most recent expansion in Newcastle's boundaries took place under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974, when Newcastle became a [[metropolitan borough]], also including the urban districts of [[Gosforth]] and [[Newburn]], and the parishes of [[Brunswick (parish)|Brunswick]], [[Dinnington, Tyne and Wear|Dinnington]], [[Hazlerigg]], [[North Gosforth]] and [[Woolsington]] from the [[Castle Ward Rural District]], and the village of [[Westerhope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/7|title=Local Government Act 1974|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile [[Northumberland County Council]] was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1888]] and benefited from a dedicated meeting place when [[County Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|County Hall]] was completed in the Castle Garth area of Newcastle in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101024938-county-hall-westgate-ward#.WuWlu8gvwdU|title=County Hall|publisher=British listed buildings|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref> Following the [[Local Government Act 1972]] County Hall relocated to [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]] in April 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hexham-courant.co.uk/news/Northumberland-County-Council-to-spend-17m-on-HQ-revamp-e986a131-fc67-45c8-9502-691b9b6d8099-ds|title=Northumberland County Council to spend \u00a317m on HQ revamp|date=25 January 2018|publisher=Hexham Courant|accessdate=29 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Twentieth century==\n[[File:Tyne bridge 1928.jpg|thumb|The construction of the [[Tyne Bridge]] in the 1920s]]\nIn 1925 work began on a new high-level road bridge to span the Tyne Gorge between Newcastle and Gateshead. The capacity of the existing High-Level Bridge and Swing Bridge were being strained to the limit, and an additional bridge had been discussed for a long time. The contract was awarded to the Dorman Long Company and the bridge was finally opened by [[George V of England|King George V]] in 1928. The road deck was {{convert|84|ft|m}} above the river and was supported by a {{convert|531|ft|m}} steel arch. The new [[Tyne Bridge]] quickly became a symbol for Newcastle and Tyneside, and remains so today.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/>\n\nDuring the Second World War, Newcastle was largely spared the horrors inflicted upon other British cities bombed during [[the Blitz]]. Although the armaments factories and shipyards along the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]] were targeted by the German airforce, they largely escaped unscathed. Manors goods yard and [[Manors railway station|railway terminal]], to the east of the city centre, and the suburbs of [[Jesmond]] and [[Heaton, Newcastle|Heaton]] suffered bombing during 1941. There were 141 deaths and 587 injuries, a relatively small figure compared to the casualties in other industrial centres of Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/75-years-ago-world-war-11225614|title=75 years ago: World War II bombs rained down on Newcastle killing 47 people|date=24 April 2016|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the city gained its own university, the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], by act of parliament. A School of Medicine and Surgery had been established in Newcastle in 1834. This eventually developed into a college of medicine attached to [[Durham University]]. A college of physical science was also founded and became Armstrong College in 1904. In 1934 the two colleges merged to become King's College, Durham. This remained as part of Durham University until the new university was created in 1963. In 1992 the city gained its second university when Newcastle Polytechnic was granted university status as [[Northumbria University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/northumbria-university-459006.html |title=Northumbria University |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-08-01 |accessdate=2018-03-25}}</ref>\n[[File:Newcastle Civic Centre, 1969 (15673552462).jpg|left|thumb|Newcastle Civic Centre, 1969]]\nNewcastle City Council moved to the new [[Newcastle Civic Centre]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|author=Keiran Southern |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-civic-centre-history-one-9659364 |title=Newcastle Civic Centre: A history of one of the city's most recognised buildings |publisher=Chronicle Live |date=2015-07-15 |accessdate=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n\nAs heavy industries declined in the second half of the 20th century, large sections of the city centre were demolished along with many areas of slum housing. The leading political figure in the city during the 1960s was [[T. Dan Smith]] who oversaw a massive building programme of highrise housing estates and authorised the demolition of a quarter of the Georgian [[Grainger Town]] to make way for [[Eldon Square Shopping Centre]]. Smith's control in Newcastle collapsed when it was exposed that he had used public contracts to advantage himself and his business associates<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/stories-shocked-tyneside-high-rise-7236347|date=9 June 2014|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Stories that shocked Tyneside: The high rise and fall of a leader who got greedy|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref> and for a time Newcastle became a byword for civic corruption as depicted in the films ''[[Get Carter]]'' and ''[[Stormy Monday (film)|Stormy Monday]]'' and in the television series ''[[Our Friends in the North]]''. However, much of the historic Grainger Town area survived and was, for the most part, fully restored in the late 1990s. [[Northumberland Street]], initially the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]], was gradually closed to traffic from the 1970s and completely pedestrianised by 1998.<ref>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Ray |date=13 August 2011 |title=Crowds flock to road opening |work=[[Evening Chronicle]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Young |first=Peter |date=10 June 1998 |title=No through road - work begins to ban traffic from city centre's flagship shopping street |work=[[Evening Chronicle]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978 a new rapid transport system, the Metro, was built, linking the Tyneside area.

This was the [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] Bridge, commonly known as the Metro Bridge. Eventually the Metro system was extended to reach Newcastle Airport in 1991, and in 2002 the Metro system was extended to the nearby city of [[Sunderland]].<ref name=\"nexus.org.uk\"/>\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, trade on the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides gradually declined, until by the 1980s both sides of the river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. Local government produced a master plan to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed in the space of a few years into a vibrant area, partially returning the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/remember-when-changing-newcastle-quayside-7059215|title=Remember When: A changing Newcastle Quayside - now and then|date=5 May 2014|publisher=The Chronicle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Millennium Bridge, Newcastle to Gateshead - geograph.org.uk - 1052003.jpg|thumb|Millennium Bridge, Newcastle to Gateshead]]\nThe [[Gateshead Millennium Bridge]], a foot and cycle bridge, {{convert|26|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|413|ft|m}} long, was completed in 2001. The road deck is in the form of a curve and is supported by a steel arch. To allow ships to pass, the whole structure, both arch and road-deck, rotates on huge bearings at either end so that the road deck is lifted. The bridge can be said to open and shut like a human eye. It is an important addition to the re-developed quayside area, providing a vital link between the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides.<ref name=\"Moffat\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nToday the city is a vibrant centre for office and retail employment, but just a short distance away there are impoverished inner-city [[housing estate]]s, in areas originally built to provide affordable housing for employees of the [[shipyard]]s and other heavy industries that lined the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]]. In the 2010s Newcastle City Council began implementing plans to regenerate these depressed areas, such as those along the [[Ouseburn|Ouseburn Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/ouseburn-regeneration-project-gathers-worldwide-8476111|date=19 January 2015|publisher=The Chronicle|title=Ouseburn regeneration project gathers worldwide attention for Newcastle|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|North East England}}\n*[[Trolleybuses in Newcastle upon Tyne]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Published in the 19th century\n* {{Citation |publisher = J.

The tail and wings are olive-green with flashes of yellow. There is a broad, black stripe running from the behind the beak to the back, and a yellow streak immediately below this from the eye. The bird's song ranges from scratchy to melodious. The song also varies according to where they live. The singing honeyeater has close relatives that have a similar general appearance, or some details in common, with overlapping ranges and similar voices, so a bird identification guide with clear visuals may be essential to attain the correct identity.\n\n==Ecology==\nSinging honeyeaters eat a variety of foods, including [[nectar]], small insects, fruits, [[Larva|grubs]], and berries. This makes them [[omnivorous]] creatures.\n\nSinging honeyeaters breed between July and February. They are capable of forming longtime relationships with partners. When they are breeding, they show aggressive actions. Their nest is a cup of grass, plant stems, and spider webs. The eggs are a light cream-brown with some darker spots. \n\nSinging honeyeaters live in families. They will attack larger animals, if they feel threatened by them, or if they enter their territory. They have been known to attack intruders in mobs, thus showing they are a community-like bird.\n\nThey associate with other species of birds, such as the [[brown honeyeater]] and the [[red wattlebird]]. They are different from many birds, however, because they lack the ability to communicate with isolated birds of the same species. As a study by M.C. Baker (1996) showed, the birds of the mainland did not respond to the songs of singing honeyeaters found on an island off Australia's west coast. The study showed that the songs of the birds on the island were shorter, had less song and syllable types, and had fewer syllables and notes per song.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"240\" heights=\"180\">\nFile: Singing honeyeater Rottnest.jpg\nFile: Singing honeyeater.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Birds in Backyards - Singing Honeyeater (''Lichenostomus virescens'') Fact sheet.\" Birds in Backyards.[http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder/display.cfm?id=289]\n* Baker, M.C..

It does not occur in other countries.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe singing honeyeater was originally described as ''Meliphaga virescens lipferti''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/catalogues/digitised-types/meliphaga-virescens-lipferti | title=Meliphaga virescens lipferti | publisher=Western Australian Museum | accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> It was previously placed in the genus ''[[Lichenostomus]]'', but was moved to ''[[Gavicalis]]'' after a [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis, published in 2011, showed that the original genus was [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]].<ref name=\"Nyari\">{{cite journal | last=Ny\u00e1ri | first=\u00c1.S. | last2=Joseph | first2=L. | year= 2011 |title= Systematic dismantlement of ''Lichenostomus'' improves the basis for understanding relationships within the honeyeaters (Meliphagidae) and historical development of Australo\u2013Papuan bird communities |journal= Emu | volume= 111 |issue= | pages=202\u2013211 | url= |doi=10.1071/mu10047}}</ref><ref name=ioc>{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | title=Honeyeaters | work= World Bird List Version 6.1 | url= http://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/honeyeaters/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union| accessdate= 28 January 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nSinging honeyeaters can vary in length from {{convert|17|\u2013|22|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Simpson |first1=K. |last2=Day |first2=N. |date=2010 |title=Field Guide to the Birds of Australia|location=Melbourne |publisher=Penguin Books |page= |isbn=9780670072316}}</ref> Their overall appearance is grey-brown. The tail and wings are olive-green with flashes of yellow. There is a broad, black stripe running from the behind the beak to the back, and a yellow streak immediately below this from the eye. The bird's song ranges from scratchy to melodious. The song also varies according to where they live. The singing honeyeater has close relatives that have a similar general appearance, or some details in common, with overlapping ranges and similar voices, so a bird identification guide with clear visuals may be essential to attain the correct identity.\n\n==Ecology==\nSinging honeyeaters eat a variety of foods, including [[nectar]], small insects, fruits, [[Larva|grubs]], and berries. This makes them [[omnivorous]] creatures.\n\nSinging honeyeaters breed between July and February. They are capable of forming longtime relationships with partners. When they are breeding, they show aggressive actions. Their nest is a cup of grass, plant stems, and spider webs. The eggs are a light cream-brown with some darker spots. \n\nSinging honeyeaters live in families. They will attack larger animals, if they feel threatened by them, or if they enter their territory. They have been known to attack intruders in mobs, thus showing they are a community-like bird.\n\nThey associate with other species of birds, such as the [[brown honeyeater]] and the [[red wattlebird]]. They are different from many birds, however, because they lack the ability to communicate with isolated birds of the same species. As a study by M.C. Baker (1996) showed, the birds of the mainland did not respond to the songs of singing honeyeaters found on an island off Australia's west coast. The study showed that the songs of the birds on the island were shorter, had less song and syllable types, and had fewer syllables and notes per song.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"240\" heights=\"180\">\nFile: Singing honeyeater Rottnest.jpg\nFile: Singing honeyeater.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \"Birds in Backyards - Singing Honeyeater (''Lichenostomus virescens'') Fact sheet.\" Birds in Backyards.[http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder/display.cfm?id=289]\n* Baker, M.C..

{"title_page": "Norilsk uprising", "text_new": "'''The Norilsk uprising''' was a major [[Prison strike|strike]] by [[Gulag]] inmates in [[Gorlag]], a special camp mostly for [[political prisoner]]s, and later in the two camps of [[Norillag]] [ITL], [[Norilsk]], [[USSR]], now [[Russia]], in the summer of 1953, shortly after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death. About 70% of inmates were [[Ukrainians]], many of whom had been sentenced for 25 years to the so-called ''\"[[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]] Standard\"''.

This was the longest uprising in the history of the Gulag. According to Soviet archives, there were up to 16,378 inmates on strike at the same time. It is significant that the uprising took place before the arrest of [[Lavrentiy Beria]] and its suppression coincided with news of his arrest. The preconditions for the uprising can be seen as the following: the arrival of waves of prisoners to the Gorlag, who had participated in the uprisings of 1952, the death of Stalin on March 5, 1953 and the fact that the amnesty that followed his death only applied to (non-political) criminals and convicts with short prison terms, the percentage of which was very low in Gorlag. There were two camp systems in vicinity of [[Norilsk]]. The majority of inmates in special camp Gorlag had been convicted for political crimes. The majority of prisoners in Norillag belonged to non-political criminals, so called ''bytoviki''. The uprising was provoked by the shooting of several prisoners on the orders of the camp administration. All categories of inmates took part in the uprising, with the leading roles played by former military men and participants of national liberation movements of western [[Ukraine]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the [[Baltics]].\n\nThe inmates did not have any weapons, although initially during the inquest it was suggested by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] to classify the uprising as \"an [[anti-Soviet]] armed [[counter-revolutionary]] uprising\". (Eventually the Soviet court used the term \"mass insubordination of the inmates to the camp administration\".) The action was not simply a strike: actions included a wide spectrum of nonviolent forms of protest within the [[Soviet law]]: meetings, letters to government,  [[hunger strike]]s. For this reason, the term \"Uprising of the Spirit\"<ref>Makarova, Alla. ''Norilsk uprising''. Volya. A  Journal of prisoners of totalitarian systems. 1993. # 1. p. 68-104.

William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires using [[scorched earth]] tactics, especially in the city of [[York]], before relieving the English aristocracy of their positions, and installing Norman aristocrats throughout the region.\n\nContemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a [[genocide]], although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and have suggested that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted. Records from the [[Domesday Book]] show that 75% of the population died or never returned. \n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages#Mathrafal ascendency and English alliances; 1063\u20131081|l1=Gwynedd's alliance with Mercia and Northumbria}}\nAt the time of the Norman Conquest ''the North'' consisted of what became [[Yorkshire]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], and [[Northumberland]] in the east and [[Lancashire]] with the southern parts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] in the west.<ref name=kapell5>William E.

Copsi had fought in [[Harald Hardrada]]'s army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat.

Evidence suggests that such barons were willing to rent lands to any men not obviously disloyal.

However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors [[economies of scale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|title=Paul Krugman, Nobel|author=Arvind Panagariya|date=October 13, 2008|work=Forbes|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107033738/https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of [[Volvo]]s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.\n\n[[File:Distribution of Manufacturing between Two Regions.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graph illustrating Krugman's 'core-periphery' model.

So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of good, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033145/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== International finance ===\nKrugman has also been influential in the field of [[international finance]].

In ''Conscience'', Krugman argues that government policies played a much greater role than commonly thought both in reducing inequality in the 1930s through 1970s and in increasing it in the 1980s through the present, and criticizes the Bush administration for implementing policies that Krugman believes widened the gap between the rich and poor.\n\nKrugman also argued that [[US Republican Party|Republicans]] owed their electoral successes to their ability to exploit the race issue to win political dominance of the South.<ref name=\"tomaskyconlibrev\">[[Michael Tomasky]], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', November 22, 2007, [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 \"The Partisan\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307063147/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/20813 |date=March 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>Krugman, Paul.

In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published ''[[End This Depression Now!]]'', a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy \u2013 people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Krugman's Prescription For A 'Depression'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|work=NPR Books|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=May 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509153543/http://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|archive-date=May 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Commentator ==\n[[Martin Wolf]] has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|title= Lunch with the FT: Paul Krugman|newspaper= Financial Times|author= Martin Wolf|date= May 24, 2012|accessdate= 2012-05-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120528173702/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date= May 28, 2012|url-status= live|author-link= Martin Wolf}}</ref>\nEconomist [[J.

However, in the 20th century, an ever-larger share of trade occurred between countries with similar characteristics, which is difficult to explain by comparative advantage. Krugman's explanation of trade between similar countries was proposed in a 1979 paper in the ''[[Journal of International Economics]]'', and involves two key assumptions: that consumers prefer a diverse choice of brands, and that production favors [[economies of scale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|title=Paul Krugman, Nobel|author=Arvind Panagariya|date=October 13, 2008|work=Forbes|access-date=September 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107033738/https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/13/krugman-nobel-economics-oped-cx_ap_1013panagariya.html|archive-date=November 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Consumers' preference for diversity explains the survival of different versions of cars like Volvo and BMW. However, because of economies of scale, it is not profitable to spread the production of [[Volvo]]s all over the world; instead, it is concentrated in a few factories and therefore in a few countries (or maybe just one). This logic explains how each country may specialize in producing a few brands of any given type of product, instead of specializing in different types of products.\n\n[[File:Distribution of Manufacturing between Two Regions.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graph illustrating Krugman's 'core-periphery' model.

So, geographically where can manufacturing be predicted to develop? Krugman states that manufacturing's geographical range is inherently limited by economies of scale, but also that manufacturing will establish and accrue itself in an area of high demand. Production that occurs adjacent to demand will result in lower transportation costs, but demand, as a result, will be greater due to concentrated nearby production. These forces act upon one another simultaneously, producing manufacturing and population agglomeration. Population will increase in these areas due to the more highly developed infrastructure and nearby production, therefore lowering the expense of good, while economies of scale provide varied choices of goods and services. These forces will feed into each other until the greater portion of the urban population and manufacturing hubs are concentrated into a relatively insular geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 22, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033145/http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Matthew_Turner/ec2410/readings/Krugman_JPE1991.pdf |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== International finance ===\nKrugman has also been influential in the field of [[international finance]].

In the book, he discusses the failure of the United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published ''[[End This Depression Now!]]'', a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy \u2013 people cannot spend, and markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Krugman's Prescription For A 'Depression'|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|work=NPR Books|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=May 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509153543/http://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/151473654/paul-krugmans-prescription-for-a-depression|archive-date=May 9, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Commentator ==\n[[Martin Wolf]] has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\".<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|title= Lunch with the FT: Paul Krugman|newspaper= Financial Times|author= Martin Wolf|date= May 24, 2012|accessdate= 2012-05-29|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120528173702/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/022acf50-a4d1-11e1-9a94-00144feabdc0.html|archive-date= May 28, 2012|url-status= live|author-link= Martin Wolf}}</ref>\nEconomist [[J.

Part of one of the major trunk lines in the country, it passes through an industrial-mining area and handles high volumes of freight, particularly coal and iron ore.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Tatanagar\u2013Bilaspur section of Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line passes through the [[Saranda forest]] on the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] in southern [[Jharkhand]]. The area through which it passes includes portions of northern [[Odisha]] and northern [[Chhattisgarh]], with topography similar to that of the Chota Nagpur Plateau. It is generally forested area amidst hills alternating with valleys. The major rivers flowing through the area are: [[Subarnarekha River|Subarnarekha]], [[Kharkai River|Kharkai]], [[South Karo River|South Karo]], [[South Koel River|South Koel]], [[Sankh River|Sankh]], [[Brahmani River|Brahmani]], [[Ib River|Ib]], [[Mand River|Mand]] and [[Hasdeo River|Hasdeo]]. While the eastern portion of this line connects to iron ore mines spread on both sides of the Jharkhand\u2013Odisha border, the western portion caters to the [[Ib Valley Coalfield]] in Odisha and the [[Korba Coalfield]] in Chhattisgarh. There are three steel plants in the area: the [[Jamshedpur]] Works of [[Tata Steel]], [[Rourkela Steel Plant]] of [[Steel Authority of India Limited|SAIL]] and [[Jindal Steel and Power]] at [[Raigarh]]. [[Bharat Aluminium Company]] has its plant at Korba. There are several engineering units on this line, as for example [[Tata Motors]] at Jamshedpur, Tata Growth Shop and [[Tayo Rolls]] at [[Adityapur]], and [[Larsen & Toubro]] at [[Kansbahal]]. The line extends support to numerous cement plants, power plants, refractory units, ferro alloy plants and a paper mill.<ref name=bondamunda>{{cite web| url = http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,6,400,659 |title = Chakradharpur Division| publisher= South Eastern Railway| accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://bilaspur.nic.in/Glance.html |title =Bilaspur - the pride of Chhattisgarh |work= |last= |first=| publisher= Bilaspur district administration | accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://korba.gov.in/ataglancefs.htm | title = Korba - the Power Hub of Chhattisgarh | publisher = Korba district administration | accessdate = 2012-11-10 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017233743/http://korba.gov.in/ataglancefs.htm | archivedate = 17 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.orissatourism.gov.in/rourkela.html| title = Explore Orissa \u2013 the soul of India| publisher = Orissa Tourism| accessdate = 2012-11-10| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121104080743/http://www.orissatourism.gov.in/rourkela.html| archivedate = 4 November 2012| df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://ordistricts.nic.in/district_home.php?did=kjr |title = The District Portal of Kendujhar| publisher=Kendujhar district administration | accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://sundergarh.nic.in/geography.html |title =Sundergarh District |work= Geography and Physical Features| publisher= Sundergarh district  administration| accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Kalinganagar]] is an upcoming industrial hub in [[Odisha]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-12-24/news/27604436_1_steel-units-iron-ore-orissa-mining-corporation  |title = Orissa promises New Year bailout package to steel units in Kalinga Nagar|last=Patnaik|first= Nageshwar| publisher=  The Economic Times, 24 December 2010| accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.orissalinks.com/orissagrowth/archives/4020 |title = Vision Kalinganagar : To be developed for a population of 10 lakhs by 2025| accessdate = 2012-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Howrah\u2013Allahabad\u2013Mumbai line]], a joint effort of [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] and [[East Indian Railway Company]] came up in 1870.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html | title = IR History: Early Days \u2013 II | work = Chronology of railways in India, Part 2 (1870 - 1899)| publisher = | accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref> The [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]] was formed in 1887 for the purpose of upgrading the [[Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway]] and then extending it via [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh|Bilaspur]] to [[Asansol Junction|Asansol]], in order to develop a shorter Howrah-Mumbai route than the one via Allahabad.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://railwaysofraj.blogspot.in/2011/08/number-1-down-mail.html |title = Number 1 Down Mail| publisher= Railways of the Raj| accessdate = 2012-11-10 }}</ref> The Bengal Nagpur Railway main line from Nagpur to [[Asansol Junction|Asansol]], on the [[Howrah-Delhi main line]], was opened for goods traffic on 1 February 1891.<ref name=ser>{{cite web|url=http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1|title=Major Events in the Formation of S.E.

New lines were laid and connections made to facilitate the movement of iron ore to the new steel plants - TISCO and IISCO at Tatanagar and Burnpur respectively. To tap the coal reserves in Jharia, a 115-mile-long (184 km) line connecting Midnapore with Bhojudih was set up in 1903 and extended to Gomoh in 1907. In 1922, the Talcher coalfields were linked by a rail line taking off from Nergundi on the East Coast. The Raipur-Vizianagaram link was completed in 1931, connecting the East Coast with the Central Province. Following these developments, the BNR Company owned the largest narrow gauge network in the country\u2026 \n\"As independent India embarked on a policy of rapid industrialisation, the SER took upon the task of moving raw materials by constructing new lines from plants to the mine heads at Dallhirajra, Ahiwara, Barsuan, Kiriburu and Meghataburu.

Brazilian music developed some unique and original styles such as [[forr\u00f3]], [[repente]], [[coco de roda]], [[ax\u00e9]], [[sertanejo music|sertanejo]], [[samba]], [[bossa nova]], [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira|MPB]], [[Brazilian gaucho music|m\u00fasica nativista]], [[pagode]], [[tropic\u00e1lia]], [[choro]], [[maracatu]], embolada (coco de repente), [[funk carioca]], [[frevo]], [[brega (music)|brega]], [[modinha]] and Brazilian versions of foreign musical styles, such as [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[hip-hop]], [[disco music]], [[country music]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] music, [[Rapping|rap]], [[classical music]], [[fado]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]].\n\nSamba has become the best known form of Brazilian music worldwide, especially because of the country's [[brazilian carnival|carnival]], although [[bossa nova]], which had [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] as one of its most acclaimed composers and performers, have received much attention abroad since the 1950s, when the song \"[[Desafinado]]\", interpreted by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], was first released.\n\nThe first four winners of the Shell Brazilian Music prize<ref>{{cite web|title=Pr\u00eamio Shell de M\u00fasica \u2013 Shell Brasil|url=http://www.shell.com/bra/environment-society/brazil-social-investments/music-awards.html|accessdate=13 February 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224022549/http://www.shell.com/bra/environment-society/brazil-social-investments/music-awards.html|archivedate=24 February 2014}}</ref> have each left a legacy on Brazilian music and are among the representatives of Brazilian popular music: [[Pixinguinha]] (choro), [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim]] (bossa nova), [[Dorival Caymmi]] (samba and samba-can\u00e7\u00e3o).\n\nInstrumental music is also largely practiced in Brazil, with styles ranging from [[Classical music|classical]] to [[Popular music|popular]] and [[jazz]] influenced forms. Among the later, [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]], [[Pixinguinha]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]] and [[Egberto Gismonti]] are significant figures. Notable classical composers include [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] and [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]]. The country also has a growing community of modern/experimental composition, including [[electroacoustic music]].\n\n== Art music ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nLittle is known of the music of Brazil before the area's first encounter with Portuguese explorers on 22 April 1500. During the colonial period, documents detail the musical activities of the major Roman Catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes, but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse. Some information is available in writings left by such travellers as [[Jean de L\u00e9ry]], who lived in Brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native American music: two chants of the Tupinamb\u00e1, near Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olsen|first1=D.A. |last2=Sheehy |first2=D.E. |date=1998 |title=Brazil:Central and Southern Areas in Garland Encyclopedia of World Music Volume 2 |trans-title= |url=https://search-alexanderstreet-com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/view/work/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223340#page/320/mode/1/chapter/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223481 |url-status=live |format=digital |language=english |location=Retrieved from Music Online: The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music database |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415994047 |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFurther registration of musical activity in Brazil came from the activities of two [[Jesuit]] priests in 1549. Ten years later, they had already founded settlements for indigenous people (the ''[[Jesuit reduction|Redu\u00e7\u00f5es]]''), with a musical-educational structure.\n\nOne century later, the Redu\u00e7\u00f5es of the southern Brazil, which were founded by Spaniard Jesuits, had a strong cultural development, where some music schools were founded. Some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for European music.<ref>apud Padre Noel Berthold, in: \"Trevisan, Armindo\", in ''A Escultura dos Sete Povos''. Bras\u00edlia: Editora Movimento / Instituto Nacional do Livro, 1978. (Portuguese)</ref> The indigenous people also took part in the music, with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance.\n\n=== The 18th-century school ===\n[[File:OuroPreto1-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ouro Preto]], in [[Minas Gerais]]: one of the most important musical centers in Brazil during the 18th century]]\nIn the 18th century, there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of Brazil, with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures. The previously few private orchestras became more common and the churches presented a great variety of music.\n\nIn the first half of this century, the most outstanding works were composed by [[Lu\u00eds \u00c1lvares Pinto]], [[Caetano de Mello de Jesus]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 da Silva]] (\"the Jew\"), who became successful in [[Lisbon]] writing [[libretto]]s for comedies, which were performed also in Brazil with music by  [[Ant\u00f3nio Teixeira]].\n\nIn the second part of the 18th century, there was a great flourishing in [[Minas Gerais]], mostly in the regions of ''Vila Rica'' (currently [[Ouro Preto]]), [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]] and ''Arraial do Tejuco'' (currently [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]]), where the mining of gold and diamonds for the Portuguese metropolis attracted a sizable population. At this time, the first outstanding Brazilian composers were revealed, most of them [[mulatto]]es. The musical pieces were mostly sacred music. Some of the noteworthy composers of this period were [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita|Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Manoel Dias de Oliveira]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], [[Marcos Coelho Neto]] and [[Marcos Coelho Neto Filho]]. All of them were very active, but in many cases few pieces have survived until the present day. Some of the most famous pieces of this period are the ''Magnificat'' by Manoel Dias de Oliveira and the ''Our Lady's Antiphon'' by Lobo de Mesquita. In the city of Arraial do Tejuco, nowadays [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], there were ten conductors in activity. In [[Ouro Preto]] about 250 musicians were active, and in all of the territory of Minas Gerais almost a thousand musicians were active.<ref>Mariz, Vasco. ''Hist\u00f3ria da M\u00fasica no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005. 6\u00aa ed. (Portuguese)</ref>\n\nWith the impoverishment of the mines at the end of the century, the focus of the musical activity changed to other centers, specially [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where [[Andr\u00e9 da Silva Gomes]], a composer of Portuguese origin, released a great number of works and dynamized the musical life of the city.\n\n=== The Classical period ===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Nunes Garcia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]]]]\nA crucial factor for the changes in the musical life was the arrival of the Portuguese Royal family to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1808. Until then, Rio de Janeiro was musically similar to other cultural centers of Brazil but was even less important than Minas Gerais. The presence of the Portuguese Royal family, in exile, radically changed this situation, as the [[Capela Real of Rio de Janeiro]] was established.\n\nThe king [[John VI of Portugal]] brought with him to Brazil the great musical library from the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], one of the best of Europe at that time, and ordered the arrival of musicians from [[Lisbon]] and the ''[[castrati]]'' from [[Italy]], re-ordering the Royal Chapel. Later, John VI ordered the construction of a sumptuous theater, called the Royal Theater of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o. The secular music had the presence of [[Marcos Portugal]], who was designated as the official composer of the household, and of [[Sigismund von Neukomm]], who contributed with his own work and brought the works of the Austrian composers [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn]]. The works of these composers strongly influenced the Brazilian music of this time.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]], the first of the great Brazilian composers, emerged at this time. With a large culture for his origin \u2013 he was poor and mulatto \u2013 he was one of the founders of the [[Irmandade de Santa Cec\u00edlia]], in Rio de Janeiro, teacher and [[mestre de capela]] of the Royal Chapel during the presence of John VI in Brazil. Nunes Garcia was the most prolific Brazilian composer of this time. He also composed the first opera written in Brazil, ''Le Due Gemelle'' (''The Two Twins''), with text in Italian, but the music is now lost.\n\nOther important composers of this period are [[Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade]], who composed the only Brazilian [[chamber music]] from the 19th century which has survived to the present times,<ref>'''Castagna, Paulo.''' Encarte do CD ''Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade \u2013 Duetos Concertantes''. S\u00e3o Paulo: Paulus, 1995. (Portuguese)</ref> and [[Jo\u00e3o de Deus de Castro Lobo]], who lived in the cities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, which were decadent at this time.\n\nThis period, however, was brief. In 1821, John VI went back to Lisbon, taking with him the household, and the cultural life in Rio de Janeiro became empty. And, despite the love of [[Peter I of Brazil]] for the music \u2013 he was also author of some musical pieces like the [[Brazilian Independence Anthem]] \u2013 the difficult financial situation didn't allow many luxuries. The conflagration of the Royal Theater in 1824 was another symbol of decadence, which reached the most critical point when Peter I renounced the throne, going back to Portugal.\n\n=== The Romantic period ===\n[[File:Carlos Gomes (fototipia).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]]]]\nThe only composer who had a relevant work in this period was [[Francisco Manuel da Silva]], disciple of Nunes Garcia, who succeeded him as kapellmeister. In spite of his few resources, he founded the Musical Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro. He was the author of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]]'s melody. His work reflected the musical transition for the [[Romanticism]], when the interest of the national composers was focused in the [[opera]]. The most outstanding Brazilian composer of this period was [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]], who composed Italian-styled operas with national themes, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]'' (based on [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]]'s novel ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'') and ''[[Lo Schiavo]]''. These operas were very successful in European theaters, like the [[Teatro alla Scala]], in [[Milan]]. Other important composer of this time is [[Elias \u00c1lvares Lobo]], who wrote the opera ''[[A Noite de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]]'', the first Brazilian opera with text in Portuguese.\n\nThe opera in Brazil was very popular until the middle of the 20th century, and many opera houses were built at this time, like [[Teatro Amazonas]] in [[Manaus]], [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro]], [[Theatro Municipal (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Municipal Theater of S\u00e3o Paulo]] do Rio, and many others.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the greatest composers for the symphonic music were revealed. One of the most outstanding name of this period was [[Leopoldo Miguez]], who followed the [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] style and [[Henrique Oswald]], who incorporated elements of the French [[Impressionism]].\n\n=== Nationalism ===\n[[File:Heitor Vila-Lobos (c. 1922).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]]]\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, there was a movement for creating an authentically Brazilian music, with less influences of the European culture. In this sense, the [[folklore]] was the major font of inspiration for the composers. Some composers like [[Bras\u00edlio Itiber\u00ea da Cunha]], [[Luciano Gallet]] and [[Alexandre Levy]], despite having a European formation, included some typically Brazilian elements in their works. This trend reached the highest point with [[Alberto Nepomuceno]], who used largely the rhythms and melodies from the Brazilian folklore.\n\nAn important event, later, was the [[Modern Art Week]], in 1922, which had a large impact on concepts of national art. In this event the composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], regarded as the most outstanding name of the Brazilian nationalism, was revealed.\n\nVilla-Lobos did researches about the musical folklore of Brazil, and mixed elements both from classical and popular music. He explored many musical genres such as [[concerto]]s, [[symphony|symphonies]], [[modinha]]s, [[Fado]]s, and other symphonic, vocal and chamber music. Some of his masterworks are the ballet ''[[Uirapuru (Villa-Lobos)|Uirapuru]]'' and the two series of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'' and ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]''.\n\nOther composers of Brazilian national music of this era include [[Oscar Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Radam\u00e9s Gnattali]], [[Camargo Guarnieri]], [[Osvaldo Lacerda]], [[Francisco Mignone]], and [[Ernesto Nazareth]].\n\n=== The avant-garde movement ===\n{{see also|Tropicalia}}\nAs a reaction against the nationalist school, who was identified as \"servile\" to the centralizing politics of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], in 1939 the ''Movimento M\u00fasica Viva'' (Living Music Movement) appeared, led by [[Hans Joachim Koellreutter]] and by [[Eg\u00eddio de Castro e Silva]], defending the adoption of an international style, derived from the [[dodecaphonism]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. This group was integrated by composers like [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]], [[C\u00e9sar Guerra-Peixe]], [[Eunice Catunda]] and [[Edino Krieger]]. Koellreutter adopted revolutionary methodes, in respect to the individuality of each student and giving to the students the freedom of creativity before the knowledge of the traditional rules for composition. The movement edited a magazine and presented a series of [[radio]] programs showing their fundaments and works of contemporary music. Later, Guerra-Peixe and Santoro followed an independent way, centered in the regional music. Other composers, who used freely the previous styles were [[Marlos Nobre]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Rezende de Almeida Prado|Almeida Prado]], and [[Armando Albuquerque]], who created their own styles.\n\nAfter 1960, the Brazilian avant-garde movement received a new wave, focusing on [[serial music]], [[microtonal music]], [[concrete music]] and [[electronic music]], employing a completely new language. This movement was called ''M\u00fasica Nova'' (New Music) and was led by [[Gilberto Mendes]] and [[Willy Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira]].\n\n=== Brazilian Opera ===\n[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] was the first composer on non-European origin to achieve wide recognition in the classical music environment of the Golden age of Opera in Italy. [[Bossa Nova]] was created as anti-opera in a time when opera seemed to represent the art-form of the elite. [5] In recent years the style has been revived with works by [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Flo Menezes]], and others.\n\nSince 2014 the [[International Brazilian Opera (IBOC)]] has been producing new works, most notably by its Artistic Director and resident composer [[Joao MacDowell]].\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nNowadays, Brazilian music follows the guidelines of both experimentalism and traditional music. Some of the contemporary Brazilian composers are [[Amaral Vieira]], [[S\u00edlvio Ferraz]], [[Flo Menezes]], [[Marcos Balter]], [[Alexandre Lunsqui]], [[Rodolfo Caesar]], [[Felipe Lara]], [[Edson Zampronha]], [[Marcus Siqueira]], [http://www.rodrigolimacomposer.com/ Rodrigo Lima], [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Roberto Victorio]] and [[Jo\u00e3o MacDowell]]. From the new generation of Brazilian composers, [[Caio Fac\u00f3]] has achieved international recognition for his work.\n\nBrazil has a large number of internationally recognized orchestras and performers, despite the relatively low support of the government. The most famous Brazilian orchestra is probably the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony Orchestra]], currently under conductor [[Thierry Fischer]]. Other Brazilian orchestras worthy of note are the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo University Symphony]], the [[Brazilian Symphony Orchestra|Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica Brasileira]], Orquestra Filarm\u00f4nica de Minas Gerais and the [[Petrobras Sinf\u00f4nica]], supported by the Brazilian state oil company [[Petrobras]].\n\nThere are also regular operas scheduled every year in cities such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The [[state of S\u00e3o Paulo]] also hosts the Winter Festival in the city of [[Campos do Jord\u00e3o]].\n\nSome of the most famous Brazilian conductors are  [[Roberto Minczuk]], [[John Neschling]] and [[Isaac Karabtchevsky]]. The instrumentalists include, among others: [[Roberto Szidon]], [[Antonio Meneses]], [[Cussy de Almeida]], [[Gilberto Tinetti]], [[Arnaldo Cohen]], [[Nelson Freire]], [[Eud\u00f3xia de Barros]], [[Guiomar Novaes]] and [[Magda Tagliaferro]]. And some of the most famous Brazilian singers were, historically, [[Zola Amaro]], [[Constantina Ara\u00fajo]] and [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]]; living singers include [[Eliane Coelho]], [[Kismara Pessatti]], [[Maria L\u00facia Godoy]], [[Sebasti\u00e3o Teixeira]], and others.\n\nIn the 1980s, a wave of Brazilian heavy metal bands gained public attention. The most commercially successful of these was [[Sepultura]], founded in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1983, preceded by [[Dorsal Atlantica]] and followed by [[Sarcofago]].\n\nThe intrusion of alien elements into Brazil's cultural system is not a destructive process. The return of a democratic government allowed for freedom of expression. The Brazilian music industry opened up to international styles and this has allowed for both foreign and local genres to co-exist and identify people. Each different style relates to the people socially, politically, and economically. \"Brazil is a regionally divided country with a rich cultural and musical diversity among states. As such, musicians in the country choose to define their local heritage differently depending on where they come from.\" This shows how globalization has not robbed Brazil of its identity but instead given it the ability to represent its people both in Brazil and the rest of the world.\n\nIn recent years Brazilian artists have become more interested in Africa, the Caribbean and their own indigenous and folk music. While there are some artists who continue to perform rock and Western pop, there are now just as many contemporaries playing a fusion of African and European influences with those from across The Americas. Some artists have even become influenced by Asian music, noticing some parallels between music from the North-East of Brazil and music from India.\n\n== Indigenous and folk music ==\nThe native peoples of the Brazilian [[rainforest]] play instruments including [[whistle]]s, [[flute]]s, [[French horn|horn]]s, [[drum (musical instrument)|drum]]s and [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s.  Much of the area's folk music imitates the sounds of the [[Amazon Rainforest]].  When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the first natives they met played an array of reed [[flute]]s and other [[wind instrument|wind]] and [[percussion instrument]]s.  The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] introduced songs which used the [[Tupi language]] with Christian lyrics, an attempt to convert the people to Christianity,<ref>[http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm Music].

Retrieved on 2011-11-23. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310092423/http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm |date=March 10, 2005 }}</ref> and also introduced [[Gregorian chant]] and the flute, [[bow (musical instrument)|bow]], and the [[clavichord]].\n\n[[File:Ilus Abertura Religiosa.jpg|thumb|right|Drum known as Il\u00fa used in Xamb\u00e1 religion in Pernambuco]]\nThe earliest music in what is now Brazil must have been that of the native peoples of the area.  Little is known about their music, since no written records exist of this era.  With the arrival of Europeans, Brazilian culture began to take shape as a synthesis of native musical styles with Portuguese music and African music.\n[[File:Negro fandango scene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jongo]], a dance and musical genre of African origin, c. 1822]]\n[[File:Rugendas lundu 1835.jpg|thumb|Brazilian dance-song ''[[Lundu (dance)|lundu]]'', c. 1835]]\n\n=== Capoeira music ===\n{{main|Capoeira music}}\n\n[[File:Capoeira-three-berimbau-one-pandeiro.jpg|thumb|right|Three berimbau players]]\nThe [[Afro-Brazilian]] sport of [[capoeira]] is never played without its own music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music. The main instruments of capoeira music include the ''[[berimbau]]'', the ''[[atabaque]]'' and the ''[[pandeiro]]''. [[Capoeira songs]] may be improvised on the spot, or they may be popular songs written by older, and ancient ''mestres'' (teachers), and often include accounts of the history of capoeira, or the doings of great mestres.\n\n=== Maracatu ===\n{{main|Maracatu}}\n\n[[File:Caboclos de lan\u00e7a.jpg|thumb|Maracatu.]]\nThis type of music is played primarily in the [[Recife]] and [[Olinda]] regions during Carnaval. It is an [[Afro-Brazilian]] tradition. The music serves as the backdrop for parade groups that evolved out of ceremonies conducted during colonial times in honour of the Kings of Congo, who were African slaves occupying symbolic leadership positions among the slave population. The music is played on large [[alfaia]] drums, large metal gongu\u00ea bells, snare drums and shakers.  An important variant is found in and around Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1 (called maracatu cearense), which is different from the Recife/Olinda tradition in many respects: triangles are used instead of gongu\u00eas, [[surdo]]s or [[zabumba]]s instead of alfaias.  Also, important female characters are performed by cross-dressed male performers, and all African and Afrobrazilian personages are performed using blackface makeup.\n\n=== Afox\u00e9 ===\n{{main|Afox\u00e9}}\n\nAfox\u00e9 is the name given to a group dedicated to playing ijex\u00e1, which is a kind of [[religious music]], part of the [[Candombl\u00e9]] tradition.  In 1949, a group called [[Filhos de Gandhi]] began playing afox\u00e9 during [[Brazilian Carnival|carnaval]] parades in Salvador; their name translates as ''Sons of Gandhi'', associating black Brazilian activism with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s Indian independence movement.  The Filhos de Gandhi's 1949 appearance was also revolutionary because, until then, the Carnaval parades in Salvador were meant only for light-skinned people.\n\n=== Repente ===\n[[File:De repente, um repentista! (165251858).jpg|thumb|Repentista.]]\n[[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] is known for a distinctive form of literature called [[cordel literature|literatura de cordel]], which are a type of [[ballad]]s that include elements incorporated into music as \"[[repentismo]]\", an improvised lyrical contest on themes suggested by the audience.\n\nSimilar to Repentismo, appears among the [[Caipira]] culture a musical form derived from [[viola caipira]], which is called ''cururu''.\n\n== Popular music ==\n\n=== Choro ===\n{{main|Choro}}\n[[File:Violao choro.jpg|thumb|left|Choro guitar.]]\n{{Listen|filename=Pixinguinha- O Urubu e o Gaviao 1930.ogg|title=Urubu Malandro|description=\"Urubu Malandro\", recorded in 1930 by Pixinguinha in the flute}}\n{{Listen|filename=003-harmonia_selvagem_-_dante_santoro_1938.ogg|title=Harmonia Selvagem|description=Choro \"Harmonia Selvagem\" composed by Dante Santoro.

Instrumental, its origins are in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Originally ''choro'' was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). The young pianist [[Ernesto Nazareth]] published his first choro (''N\u00e3o Caio Noutra'') in 1878 at the age of 14.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070709135551/http://www.bn.br/fbn/musica/enzinfa.htm Childhood Secrets *]. bn.br</ref> Nazareth's choros are often listed as ''polkas'';<ref>[http://www.chiquinhagonzaga.com/nazareth/ Ernesto Nazareth \u2013 Rei do Choro].

[[Chiquinha Gonzaga]] composed her first success, the polka-choro \"Atraente\", in 1877.

The mainstream success of this style of music (By the 1930s) came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by [[samba]] and [[Bossa Nova]] and other styles of Brazilian popular music, but was still alive in amateur circles called \"rodas de choro\" (informal choro gatherings in residences and [[botecos]]). However, in the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre carried out by some famous artists: [[Pixinguinha]], [[Waldir Azevedo]] and [[Jacob do Bandolim]].\n\n=== Samba ===\n{{main|Samba}}\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Singer and actress [[Carmen Miranda]].]]\nIn 1929, prompted by the opening of the first radio station in Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ''radio era'' began spreading songs \u2013 especially the novelty Samba in its current format \u2013 to larger masses. This period was dominated by few male interpreters \u2013 notably Almirante, [[Braguinha (composer)|Braguinha]], [[M\u00e1rio Reis]], [[S\u00edlvio Caldas]], [[Francisco Alves]] and singer/composer [[Noel Rosa]] and even fewer chanteuses such as [[Aracy de Almeida]] and sisters [[Aurora Miranda]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], who eventually came to [[Hollywood]] becoming a movie star.<ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/110407/p_120.shtml A na\u00e7\u00e3o das cantoras].

Noteworthy Samba composers at this early stage included said [[Noel Rosa]] plus [[Lamartine Babo]] and, around [[World War II]] time, [[Ary Barroso]].\n\n=== MPB (Popular Brazilian Music) ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica popular brasileira}}\n[[File:Brazil.GilbertoGil.01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gilberto Gil]]]]\n\nMPB's early stage (from World War II to the mid-1960s) was populated by male singers such as Orlando Silva, [[Nelson Gon\u00e7alves]], [[Jamel\u00e3o]], [[Agostinho dos Santos]], [[An\u00edsio Silva]], Ataulfo Alves, [[Carlos Galhardo]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Ismael Silva]], [[Jo\u00e3o Dias]], [[Jorge Goulart]], [[Miltinho]], [[Jorge Veiga]] and [[Francisco Eg\u00eddio]] and female singers started to mushroom: [[Nora Ney]], [[Dolores Duran]], [[\u00c2ngela Maria]], [[Emilinha Borba]], Marlene, [[Dalva de Oliveira]], [[Maysa Matarazzo]], sisters [[Linda Batista]] and [[Dircinha Batista]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nMPB's second stage \u2013 after the split [[Bossa Nova]] (1959) / [[Jovem Guarda]] (1965) / [[Tropicalismo]] (both 1967) \u2013 refers to mainstream Brazilian pop music. Well-known MPB artists include, among many others, singers such as [[Elis Regina]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Nara Le\u00e3o]], [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]], [[M\u00f4nica da Silva]], [[Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira|Simone]], [[Chico Buarque]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Jorge Ben Jor]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Jo\u00e3o Bosco]], [[Ivan Lins]], [[Djavan]].\n\n=== Bossa nova ===\n{{main|Bossa nova}}\nThe first [[bossa nova]] records by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], in the last years of the 1950s, quickly became huge hits in Brazil. [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]] and other [[composer]]s helped further develop this fusion of [[jazz]] harmonies and a smoother, often slower, samba beat, which developed at the beach neighborhoods of [[Ipanema]] and, later, the [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] nightclubs. Bossa nova was introduced to the rest of the world by American jazz musicians in the early 1960s, and song \"[[The Girl from Ipanema]]\" remains probably the best known Brazilian musical export, eventually becoming a jazz standard.\n\n=== Brazilian gospel ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n[[File:Diante do Trono - Grava\u00e7\u00e3o Creio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diante do Trono]], the main worship ministry in Latin America.]]\n[[Gospel music]] emerged in Brazil before the 1960s with hymnals that were brought and translated into Portuguese by American missionaries. From the late 1960s the first singers of Christian music groups emerged in Brazil, but the songs were not highly valued. Gospel music became popular in Brazil in the late 1990s, with the emergence of congregational singing and bands such as [[Diante do Trono]], led by [[Ana Paula Valad\u00e3o]]. Diante do Trono has become the largest [[contemporary worship music]] ministry in Latin America.\n\n=== Brazilian rock ===\n{{main|Brazilian rock|samba rock}}\n[[File:Rita Lee in Aracatuba-08, by Marco Senche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rita Lee]]]]\nThe musical style known in Brazil as \"Brazilian [[rock n' roll]]\" dates back to a Portuguese-version cover{{which|date=June 2014}} of \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" in 1954. In the 1960s, young singers like [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] and the [[Jovem Guarda]] movement were very popular. The 1960s also saw the rise of bands such as the \"[[Tropicalismo|tropicalistas]]\" [[Os Mutantes]] and the experimental (mixing [[progressive rock]], [[jazz]] and [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]]) Som Imagin\u00e1rio.\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of many [[progressive rock]] and/or [[hard rock]] bands such as [[O Ter\u00e7o]], [[A Bolha]], [[A Barca do Sol]], [[Som Nosso de Cada Dia]], [[V\u00edmana]] and [[Bacamarte]], some of which attained some recognition internationally; [[Rita Lee]], in her solo career after [[Os Mutantes]], championed the glam-rock aesthetics in Brazil; [[Casa das M\u00e1quinas]] and [[Patrulha do Espa\u00e7o]] were more bona-fide [[hard rock]] bands, and the likes of ([[Raul Seixas]], [[Secos & Molhados|Secos e Molhados]], [[Novos Baianos]] and [[A Cor do Som]]) mixed the genre with traditional Brazilian music. In the late 1970s, the Brazilian [[punk rock]] scene kicked off mainly in S\u00e3o Paulo and in Bras\u00edlia, booming in the 1980s, with [[Inocentes]], [[C\u00f3lera]], [[Ratos de Por\u00e3o]], [[Garotos Podres]], etc.\n\nThe real commercial boom of Brazilian rock was in the 1980s, with many bands and artists like [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Gang 90]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Lob\u00e3o]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], and many others, and festivals like [[Rock in Rio]] and [[Hollywood Rock]]. The late 1980s and early 1990s also witnessed the beginnings of an electronica-inspired scene, with a lot more limited commercial potential but achieving some critical acclaim: [[Suba (musician)|Suba]], [[Loop B]], [[Harry (Brazilian musician)|Harry]], etc.\n\n[[File:FTakai.jpg|thumb|[[Fernanda Takai]], singer [[Pato Fu]]]]\nIn the 1990s, the meteoric rise of [[Mamonas Assassinas]], which sold more than 3 million copies of its only CD (a record, by Brazilian standards) came to a tragic end when the band's plane crashed, killing all five members of the band, the pilot and the co-pilot. Other commercially successful bands included [[Jota Quest]], [[Raimundos]] and [[Skank (band)|Skank]], while [[Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]] and the whole [[Mangue Bit]] movement received much critical attention and accolades, but very little commercial success \u2013 success that declined after the death of one of its founders, [[Chico Science]]. It was also in the 1990s that the first seeds of what would grow into being the Brazilian indie scene were planted, with the creation of indie festivals such as [[Abril Pro Rock]] and, later in the decade, [[Por\u00e3o do Rock]]. The band [[Pato Fu]] was considered by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine one of the ten best bands in the world outside the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000784,00.html | work=Time | first=Rhett | last=Butler | title=Best Bands: And Our Winners Are | date=September 15, 2001}}</ref> It is also known to re-record hits Brazilian and international versions of toy instruments.\n\nFemale singer [[Pitty]] is also very popular. The indie scene has been growing exponentially since the early 2000s, with more and more festivals taking place all around the country. However, due to several factors including but not limited to the worldwide collapse of the music industry, all the agitation in the indie scene has so far failed in translating into international success, but in Brazil they developed a real, substantial cultural movement. That scene is still much of a ghetto, with bands capturing the attention of international critics, but many playing again in Brazil when they become popular in the exterior, due to the lack of financial and material support which would allow for careers to be developed. One notable exception is [[CSS (band)|CSS]], an alternative [[Electronic rock|electro rock]] outfit that has launched a successful international career, performing in festivals and venues in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Other unique example of success through independent music scene that made to the mainstream is the band [[M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju]]. The band has its own style, somewhere between rock and folk, and is recognized as the most important independent band in Brazil. The record company Trama [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123211659/http://trama.uol.com.br/portalv2/home/index.jsp] tries to support some bands with structure and exposure, and can be credited with early support to [[CSS (band)|CSS]] and later to M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju.\n\n==== Brazilian heavy metal ====\n{{see also|Brazilian thrash metal}}\n[[File:Sepultura @ Maquin\u00e1ria Festival 02.jpg|thumb|[[Sepultura]].]]\nBrazilian [[Heavy metal music|metal]] originated in the mid 1980s with three prominent scenes: Belo Horizonte, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The most famous Brazilian metal bands are [[Sepultura]], [[Angra (band)|Angra]], [[Krisiun]], [[Rebaelliun]], [[Nephasth]], [[Dr. Sin]], [[Shaaman]], [[Violator (band)|Violator]] and the singer [[Andre Matos]]. Sepultura is considered an influential [[Brazilian thrash metal|thrash metal]] band, influencing the development of [[death metal]].\n\nFamous bands of the 1980s include [[Korzus]], [[Sarc\u00f3fago]], [[Overdose (band)|Overdose]],<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r206736|pure_url=yes}}|title=Progress of Decadence > Review|last=Jeffries|first=Vincent|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|accessdate=12 April 2009 |quote=One of the best-known, if not the premier, metal bands in Brazil, Overdose had actually released several discs during the eight years prior to ''Progress of Decadence''\u2014the group's first record to receive international distribution.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r413357|pure_url=yes}}|title=Circus of Death > Review|last=Jeffries|first=Vincent|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|accessdate=12 April 2009 |quote=On 1999's ''Circus of Death'', Brazil's second most famous metal band try again to emerge from beneath the shadow of Sepultura with their neo-prog thrash.}}</ref> [[Dorsal Atl\u00e2ntica]], [[Viper (band)|Viper]], [[MX (band)|MX]], [[PUS (band)|PUS]], [[Mutilator]], [[Chakal (band)|Chakal]], [[Vulcano (band)|Vulcano]] and [[Attomica]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p884193|pure_url=yes}}|title=Attomica > Biography|last=Rivadavia|first=Eduardo|work=Allmusic|publisher=Macrovision|accessdate=12 April 2009 |quote=Arriving in stores in 1991, the LP's [the band's third album, ''Disturbing the Noise''] \"ultra-speed\" style cemented Attomica's standing as one of Brazil's top thrash acts; the promo clip for single \"Deathraiser\" was showcased on several TV video shows, including the Brazilian MTV affiliate.}}</ref> Bands from the 1990s include [[Andralls]], MQN, Macaco Bong, [[Black Drawing Chalks]], Superguidis, [[Mental Hor]], [[The Mist (band)|The Mist]], [[Scars (band)|Scars]], [[Distraught]], [[Torture Squad]], [[Eterna (band)|Eterna]] and [[Silent Cry (band)|Silent Cry]]. Bands from the 2000s include  [[It's All Red]], [[Eyes of Shiva]], [[Autoramas]], [[Tuatha de Danann (band)|Tuatha de Danann]],  [[Claustrofobia (band)|Claustrofobia]], [[Quimere]], [[Apokalyptic Raids]], [[Project46]], [[Wizards (band)|Wizards]] and [[Andragonia (band)|Andragonia]].\n\n==== Brazilian folk/folk-rock ====\nThe new Brazilian folk scene is not to be mistaken with folkloric Brazilian music. The first to break into the mainstream was internet phenomenon [[Mallu Magalh\u00e3es]], who played covers of her favourite artists in English and her own songs in both English and Portuguese (as well as other languages).  Magalh\u00e3es only released her first album in 2008, though by then she was already widely recognised as the voice of this sudden new Brazilian folk scene.  Her ex-boyfriend [[H\u00e9lio Flanders]] is the lead singer of another Brazilian folk group called [[Vanguart]].  Though Vanguart had an album released before Mallu Magalh\u00e3es, it was her emergence that consolidated them both and others as a fully recognised mainstream scene, topping charts and being featured in prime time television and advertising.  Other acts emerged after the market was opened up to folk. Writing in English is more and more common among Brazilian rock and folk artists.  This has been highly criticised by Portuguese language purists, though it has helped to promote Brazilian artists in other countries ([[CSS (band)|CSS]] is a perfect example).  The new Brazilian folk scene has just come to the public's attention and it continues to thrive.\n[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|Os Mutantes, 1969. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\n\n==== Brazilian psychedelic rock ====\n{{main|Mangue Bit}}\nBrazil has a long tradition of psychedelic music since artists like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Ronnie Von]] and other rock bands from the late 60s. Nowadays, there exists a revival of this psychedelic/vintage inspired music represented by artists like [[Jupiter Apple]], [[Violeta de Outono]], [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], [[Mundo Livre S/A]], [[:pt:Cidad\u00e3o Instigado|Cidad\u00e3o Instigado]], [[Otto (singer)|Otto]], China, Kassin, [[:pt:Pata de Elefante|Pata de Elefante]], [[Orquestra Abstrata]], among others.\n\n=== Sertanejo ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica sertaneja}}\n[[File:Ch&xr.jpg|thumb|[[Chit\u00e3ozinho & Xoror\u00f3]].]]\nM\u00fasica sertaneja or Sertanejo is a term for Brazilian [[country music]]. It originally referred to music originating among [[Sert\u00e3o]] and musica [[caipira]]. (Caipira music appeared in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and some the regions of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Goi\u00e1s]]  [[Minas Gerais]], [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] and [[Mato Grosso]]. Musical rhythm is very spread out in the Southeastern and southern regions of Brazil.)\n\n=== Northeastern Music ===\n[[File:Luiz-Gonzaga-Est\u00e1tua-de-bronze.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Luiz Gonzaga]]]]\nNorth eastern music is a generic term for any popular music from the large region of Northeastern Brazil, including both coastal and inland areas.  Rhythms are slow and plodding, and are derived from [[guitar]]s instead of [[percussion instrument]]s like in the rest of Brazil\u2014in this region, African rhythms and Portuguese melodies combined to form [[maracatu]].  Most influentially, however, the area around the state of [[Pernambuco]], the home of [[frevo]] and [[maracatu]].\n\n=== [[Brazilian gaucho music|Gaucho music]] (Southern music) ===\nSouthern music ({{lang-pt|'''M\u00fasica ga\u00facha'''}}) is a general term used for the music originally from the [[Rio Grande do Sul]] state, in [[Southern Brazil]]. Some of the most famous musicians of this genre are [[Renato Borghetti]], [[Yamandu Costa]], [[Jayme Caetano Braun]] and [[Luiz Marenco]], among others.\n\n=== Music of Salvador: Late 60s to mid-70s ===\nIn the latter part of the 1960s, a group of black Bahians began dressing as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] during the Salvadoran Carnaval, identifying with their shared struggles through history.  These groups included [[Comanches do Pel\u00f4]] and [[Apaches de Toror\u00f3]] and were known for a forceful and powerful style of percussion, and frequent violent encounters with the police.  Starting in 1974, a group of black Bahians called [[Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea]] became prominent, identifying with the [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]].  Along with a policy of loosening restrictions by the Brazilian government, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea's sound and message spread to groups like [[Olodum|Grupo Cultural do Olodum]], who established community centers and other philanthropic efforts.\n\n=== Frevo ===\n{{main|Frevo}}\n\n[[Frevo]] is a style of music from [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]]. Frevo bands always play during the Carnival.\n\n=== Sambass ===\n{{main|Sambass}}\n\nSambass is a fusion of samba and [[Drum & Bass]]. The most famous sambass musicians are [[DJ Marky]] and [[DJ Patife]] whose hit ''Sambassim'' might be the most known sambass track.\n\n=== Funk Carioca ===\n{{main|Funk Carioca}}\n\nFunk Carioca is a type of dance music from Rio de Janeiro, derived from and was until the late 1990s, superficially similar to [[Miami Bass]]. In Rio it is most often simply known as Funk, although it is very different musically from what [[Funk]] means in most other places and contexts.  Funk Carioca, like other types of hip-hop lifts heavily from samples such as international rips or from previous funk music.  Many popular funk songs sampled music from the movie ''[[Rocky]]''.<ref name=\"Funk Carioca\">{{cite web|url=http://sheepish.org/itp/funk/ |title=Funk Carioca |publisher=Sheepish.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> Funk was introduced to Brazil in a systematic way in the 1980s.

Among the later, [[Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos]], [[Pixinguinha]], [[Hermeto Pascoal]] and [[Egberto Gismonti]] are significant figures. Notable classical composers include [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] and [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]]. The country also has a growing community of modern/experimental composition, including [[electroacoustic music]].\n\n== Art music ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nLittle is known of the music of Brazil before the area's first encounter with Portuguese explorers on 22 April 1500. During the colonial period, documents detail the musical activities of the major Roman Catholic cathedrals and the parlors of the upper classes, but data about musical life outside these domains are sparse. Some information is available in writings left by such travellers as [[Jean de L\u00e9ry]], who lived in Brazil from 1557 to 1558 and produced the first known transcriptions of native American music: two chants of the Tupinamb\u00e1, near Rio de Janeiro.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Olsen|first1=D.A. |last2=Sheehy |first2=D.E. |date=1998 |title=Brazil:Central and Southern Areas in Garland Encyclopedia of World Music Volume 2 |trans-title= |url=https://search-alexanderstreet-com.dclibrary.idm.oclc.org/view/work/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223340#page/320/mode/1/chapter/bibliographic_entity%7Creference_article%7C1000223481 |url-status=live |format=digital |language=english |location=Retrieved from Music Online: The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music database |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0415994047 |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nFurther registration of musical activity in Brazil came from the activities of two [[Jesuit]] priests in 1549. Ten years later, they had already founded settlements for indigenous people (the ''[[Jesuit reduction|Redu\u00e7\u00f5es]]''), with a musical-educational structure.\n\nOne century later, the Redu\u00e7\u00f5es of the southern Brazil, which were founded by Spaniard Jesuits, had a strong cultural development, where some music schools were founded. Some of the reports of that time show the fascination of the indigenous people for European music.<ref>apud Padre Noel Berthold, in: \"Trevisan, Armindo\", in ''A Escultura dos Sete Povos''. Bras\u00edlia: Editora Movimento / Instituto Nacional do Livro, 1978. (Portuguese)</ref> The indigenous people also took part in the music, with both the construction of musical instruments and practice of vocal and instrumental performance.\n\n=== The 18th-century school ===\n[[File:OuroPreto1-CCBYSA.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ouro Preto]], in [[Minas Gerais]]: one of the most important musical centers in Brazil during the 18th century]]\nIn the 18th century, there was intense musical activity in all the more developed regions of Brazil, with their moderately stable institutional and educational structures. The previously few private orchestras became more common and the churches presented a great variety of music.\n\nIn the first half of this century, the most outstanding works were composed by [[Lu\u00eds \u00c1lvares Pinto]], [[Caetano de Mello de Jesus]] and [[Ant\u00f4nio Jos\u00e9 da Silva]] (\"the Jew\"), who became successful in [[Lisbon]] writing [[libretto]]s for comedies, which were performed also in Brazil with music by  [[Ant\u00f3nio Teixeira]].\n\nIn the second part of the 18th century, there was a great flourishing in [[Minas Gerais]], mostly in the regions of ''Vila Rica'' (currently [[Ouro Preto]]), [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]] and ''Arraial do Tejuco'' (currently [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]]), where the mining of gold and diamonds for the Portuguese metropolis attracted a sizable population. At this time, the first outstanding Brazilian composers were revealed, most of them [[mulatto]]es. The musical pieces were mostly sacred music. Some of the noteworthy composers of this period were [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita|Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Manoel Dias de Oliveira]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]], [[Marcos Coelho Neto]] and [[Marcos Coelho Neto Filho]]. All of them were very active, but in many cases few pieces have survived until the present day. Some of the most famous pieces of this period are the ''Magnificat'' by Manoel Dias de Oliveira and the ''Our Lady's Antiphon'' by Lobo de Mesquita. In the city of Arraial do Tejuco, nowadays [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], there were ten conductors in activity. In [[Ouro Preto]] about 250 musicians were active, and in all of the territory of Minas Gerais almost a thousand musicians were active.<ref>Mariz, Vasco. ''Hist\u00f3ria da M\u00fasica no Brasil''. Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, 2005. 6\u00aa ed. (Portuguese)</ref>\n\nWith the impoverishment of the mines at the end of the century, the focus of the musical activity changed to other centers, specially [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where [[Andr\u00e9 da Silva Gomes]], a composer of Portuguese origin, released a great number of works and dynamized the musical life of the city.\n\n=== The Classical period ===\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Mauricio Nunes Garcia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]]]]\nA crucial factor for the changes in the musical life was the arrival of the Portuguese Royal family to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1808. Until then, Rio de Janeiro was musically similar to other cultural centers of Brazil but was even less important than Minas Gerais. The presence of the Portuguese Royal family, in exile, radically changed this situation, as the [[Capela Real of Rio de Janeiro]] was established.\n\nThe king [[John VI of Portugal]] brought with him to Brazil the great musical library from the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], one of the best of Europe at that time, and ordered the arrival of musicians from [[Lisbon]] and the ''[[castrati]]'' from [[Italy]], re-ordering the Royal Chapel. Later, John VI ordered the construction of a sumptuous theater, called the Royal Theater of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o. The secular music had the presence of [[Marcos Portugal]], who was designated as the official composer of the household, and of [[Sigismund von Neukomm]], who contributed with his own work and brought the works of the Austrian composers [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Joseph Haydn]]. The works of these composers strongly influenced the Brazilian music of this time.\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia]], the first of the great Brazilian composers, emerged at this time. With a large culture for his origin \u2013 he was poor and mulatto \u2013 he was one of the founders of the [[Irmandade de Santa Cec\u00edlia]], in Rio de Janeiro, teacher and [[mestre de capela]] of the Royal Chapel during the presence of John VI in Brazil. Nunes Garcia was the most prolific Brazilian composer of this time. He also composed the first opera written in Brazil, ''Le Due Gemelle'' (''The Two Twins''), with text in Italian, but the music is now lost.\n\nOther important composers of this period are [[Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade]], who composed the only Brazilian [[chamber music]] from the 19th century which has survived to the present times,<ref>'''Castagna, Paulo.''' Encarte do CD ''Gabriel Fernandes da Trindade \u2013 Duetos Concertantes''. S\u00e3o Paulo: Paulus, 1995. (Portuguese)</ref> and [[Jo\u00e3o de Deus de Castro Lobo]], who lived in the cities of Mariana and Ouro Preto, which were decadent at this time.\n\nThis period, however, was brief. In 1821, John VI went back to Lisbon, taking with him the household, and the cultural life in Rio de Janeiro became empty. And, despite the love of [[Peter I of Brazil]] for the music \u2013 he was also author of some musical pieces like the [[Brazilian Independence Anthem]] \u2013 the difficult financial situation didn't allow many luxuries. The conflagration of the Royal Theater in 1824 was another symbol of decadence, which reached the most critical point when Peter I renounced the throne, going back to Portugal.\n\n=== The Romantic period ===\n[[File:Carlos Gomes (fototipia).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]]]]\nThe only composer who had a relevant work in this period was [[Francisco Manuel da Silva]], disciple of Nunes Garcia, who succeeded him as kapellmeister. In spite of his few resources, he founded the Musical Conservatory of Rio de Janeiro. He was the author of the [[Brazilian National Anthem]]'s melody. His work reflected the musical transition for the [[Romanticism]], when the interest of the national composers was focused in the [[opera]]. The most outstanding Brazilian composer of this period was [[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes]], who composed Italian-styled operas with national themes, such as ''[[Il Guarany]]'' (based on [[Jos\u00e9 de Alencar]]'s novel ''[[The Guarani|O Guarani]]'') and ''[[Lo Schiavo]]''. These operas were very successful in European theaters, like the [[Teatro alla Scala]], in [[Milan]]. Other important composer of this time is [[Elias \u00c1lvares Lobo]], who wrote the opera ''[[A Noite de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]]'', the first Brazilian opera with text in Portuguese.\n\nThe opera in Brazil was very popular until the middle of the 20th century, and many opera houses were built at this time, like [[Teatro Amazonas]] in [[Manaus]], [[Teatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro]], [[Theatro Municipal (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Municipal Theater of S\u00e3o Paulo]] do Rio, and many others.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the greatest composers for the symphonic music were revealed. One of the most outstanding name of this period was [[Leopoldo Miguez]], who followed the [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] style and [[Henrique Oswald]], who incorporated elements of the French [[Impressionism]].\n\n=== Nationalism ===\n[[File:Heitor Vila-Lobos (c. 1922).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]]]\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, there was a movement for creating an authentically Brazilian music, with less influences of the European culture. In this sense, the [[folklore]] was the major font of inspiration for the composers. Some composers like [[Bras\u00edlio Itiber\u00ea da Cunha]], [[Luciano Gallet]] and [[Alexandre Levy]], despite having a European formation, included some typically Brazilian elements in their works. This trend reached the highest point with [[Alberto Nepomuceno]], who used largely the rhythms and melodies from the Brazilian folklore.\n\nAn important event, later, was the [[Modern Art Week]], in 1922, which had a large impact on concepts of national art. In this event the composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], regarded as the most outstanding name of the Brazilian nationalism, was revealed.\n\nVilla-Lobos did researches about the musical folklore of Brazil, and mixed elements both from classical and popular music. He explored many musical genres such as [[concerto]]s, [[symphony|symphonies]], [[modinha]]s, [[Fado]]s, and other symphonic, vocal and chamber music. Some of his masterworks are the ballet ''[[Uirapuru (Villa-Lobos)|Uirapuru]]'' and the two series of ''[[Ch\u00f4ros]]'' and ''[[Bachianas Brasileiras]]''.\n\nOther composers of Brazilian national music of this era include [[Oscar Lorenzo Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Radam\u00e9s Gnattali]], [[Camargo Guarnieri]], [[Osvaldo Lacerda]], [[Francisco Mignone]], and [[Ernesto Nazareth]].\n\n=== The avant-garde movement ===\n{{see also|Tropicalia}}\nAs a reaction against the nationalist school, who was identified as \"servile\" to the centralizing politics of [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], in 1939 the ''Movimento M\u00fasica Viva'' (Living Music Movement) appeared, led by [[Hans Joachim Koellreutter]] and by [[Eg\u00eddio de Castro e Silva]], defending the adoption of an international style, derived from the [[dodecaphonism]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. This group was integrated by composers like [[Cl\u00e1udio Santoro]], [[C\u00e9sar Guerra-Peixe]], [[Eunice Catunda]] and [[Edino Krieger]]. Koellreutter adopted revolutionary methodes, in respect to the individuality of each student and giving to the students the freedom of creativity before the knowledge of the traditional rules for composition. The movement edited a magazine and presented a series of [[radio]] programs showing their fundaments and works of contemporary music. Later, Guerra-Peixe and Santoro followed an independent way, centered in the regional music. Other composers, who used freely the previous styles were [[Marlos Nobre]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f4nio Rezende de Almeida Prado|Almeida Prado]], and [[Armando Albuquerque]], who created their own styles.\n\nAfter 1960, the Brazilian avant-garde movement received a new wave, focusing on [[serial music]], [[microtonal music]], [[concrete music]] and [[electronic music]], employing a completely new language. This movement was called ''M\u00fasica Nova'' (New Music) and was led by [[Gilberto Mendes]] and [[Willy Corr\u00eaa de Oliveira]].\n\n=== Brazilian Opera ===\n[[Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]] was the first composer on non-European origin to achieve wide recognition in the classical music environment of the Golden age of Opera in Italy. [[Bossa Nova]] was created as anti-opera in a time when opera seemed to represent the art-form of the elite. [5] In recent years the style has been revived with works by [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Flo Menezes]], and others.\n\nSince 2014 the [[International Brazilian Opera (IBOC)]] has been producing new works, most notably by its Artistic Director and resident composer [[Joao MacDowell]].\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nNowadays, Brazilian music follows the guidelines of both experimentalism and traditional music. Some of the contemporary Brazilian composers are [[Amaral Vieira]], [[S\u00edlvio Ferraz]], [[Flo Menezes]], [[Marcos Balter]], [[Alexandre Lunsqui]], [[Rodolfo Caesar]], [[Felipe Lara]], [[Edson Zampronha]], [[Marcus Siqueira]], [http://www.rodrigolimacomposer.com/ Rodrigo Lima], [[Jorge Antunes (composer)|Jorge Antunes]], [[Roberto Victorio]] and [[Jo\u00e3o MacDowell]]. From the new generation of Brazilian composers, [[Caio Fac\u00f3]] has achieved international recognition for his work.\n\nBrazil has a large number of internationally recognized orchestras and performers, despite the relatively low support of the government. The most famous Brazilian orchestra is probably the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony Orchestra]], currently under conductor [[Thierry Fischer]]. Other Brazilian orchestras worthy of note are the [[Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo University Symphony]], the [[Brazilian Symphony Orchestra|Orquestra Sinf\u00f4nica Brasileira]], Orquestra Filarm\u00f4nica de Minas Gerais and the [[Petrobras Sinf\u00f4nica]], supported by the Brazilian state oil company [[Petrobras]].\n\nThere are also regular operas scheduled every year in cities such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The [[state of S\u00e3o Paulo]] also hosts the Winter Festival in the city of [[Campos do Jord\u00e3o]].\n\nSome of the most famous Brazilian conductors are  [[Roberto Minczuk]], [[John Neschling]] and [[Isaac Karabtchevsky]]. The instrumentalists include, among others: [[Roberto Szidon]], [[Antonio Meneses]], [[Cussy de Almeida]], [[Gilberto Tinetti]], [[Arnaldo Cohen]], [[Nelson Freire]], [[Eud\u00f3xia de Barros]], [[Guiomar Novaes]] and [[Magda Tagliaferro]]. And some of the most famous Brazilian singers were, historically, [[Zola Amaro]], [[Constantina Ara\u00fajo]] and [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]]; living singers include [[Eliane Coelho]], [[Kismara Pessatti]], [[Maria L\u00facia Godoy]], [[Sebasti\u00e3o Teixeira]], and others.\n\nIn the 1980s, a wave of Brazilian heavy metal bands gained public attention. The most commercially successful of these was [[Sepultura]], founded in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1983, preceded by [[Dorsal Atlantica]] and followed by [[Sarcofago]].\n\nThe intrusion of alien elements into Brazil's cultural system is not a destructive process. The return of a democratic government allowed for freedom of expression. The Brazilian music industry opened up to international styles and this has allowed for both foreign and local genres to co-exist and identify people. Each different style relates to the people socially, politically, and economically. \"Brazil is a regionally divided country with a rich cultural and musical diversity among states. As such, musicians in the country choose to define their local heritage differently depending on where they come from.\" This shows how globalization has not robbed Brazil of its identity but instead given it the ability to represent its people both in Brazil and the rest of the world.\n\nIn recent years Brazilian artists have become more interested in Africa, the Caribbean and their own indigenous and folk music. While there are some artists who continue to perform rock and Western pop, there are now just as many contemporaries playing a fusion of African and European influences with those from across The Americas. Some artists have even become influenced by Asian music, noticing some parallels between music from the North-East of Brazil and music from India.\n\n== Indigenous and folk music ==\nThe native peoples of the Brazilian [[rainforest]] play instruments including [[whistle]]s, [[flute]]s, [[French horn|horn]]s, [[drum (musical instrument)|drum]]s and [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s.  Much of the area's folk music imitates the sounds of the [[Amazon Rainforest]].  When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil, the first natives they met played an array of reed [[flute]]s and other [[wind instrument|wind]] and [[percussion instrument]]s.  The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] introduced songs which used the [[Tupi language]] with Christian lyrics, an attempt to convert the people to Christianity,<ref>[http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm Music]. Fmpsd.ab.ca. Retrieved on 2011-11-23. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310092423/http://www.fmpsd.ab.ca/schools/df/Brazil/mmusic.htm |date=March 10, 2005 }}</ref> and also introduced [[Gregorian chant]] and the flute, [[bow (musical instrument)|bow]], and the [[clavichord]].\n\n[[File:Ilus Abertura Religiosa.jpg|thumb|right|Drum known as Il\u00fa used in Xamb\u00e1 religion in Pernambuco]]\nThe earliest music in what is now Brazil must have been that of the native peoples of the area.  Little is known about their music, since no written records exist of this era.  With the arrival of Europeans, Brazilian culture began to take shape as a synthesis of native musical styles with Portuguese music and African music.\n[[File:Negro fandango scene.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jongo]], a dance and musical genre of African origin, c. 1822]]\n[[File:Rugendas lundu 1835.jpg|thumb|Brazilian dance-song ''[[Lundu (dance)|lundu]]'', c. 1835]]\n\n=== Capoeira music ===\n{{main|Capoeira music}}\n\n[[File:Capoeira-three-berimbau-one-pandeiro.jpg|thumb|right|Three berimbau players]]\nThe [[Afro-Brazilian]] sport of [[capoeira]] is never played without its own music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music. The main instruments of capoeira music include the ''[[berimbau]]'', the ''[[atabaque]]'' and the ''[[pandeiro]]''. [[Capoeira songs]] may be improvised on the spot, or they may be popular songs written by older, and ancient ''mestres'' (teachers), and often include accounts of the history of capoeira, or the doings of great mestres.\n\n=== Maracatu ===\n{{main|Maracatu}}\n\n[[File:Caboclos de lan\u00e7a.jpg|thumb|Maracatu.]]\nThis type of music is played primarily in the [[Recife]] and [[Olinda]] regions during Carnaval. It is an [[Afro-Brazilian]] tradition. The music serves as the backdrop for parade groups that evolved out of ceremonies conducted during colonial times in honour of the Kings of Congo, who were African slaves occupying symbolic leadership positions among the slave population. The music is played on large [[alfaia]] drums, large metal gongu\u00ea bells, snare drums and shakers.  An important variant is found in and around Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1 (called maracatu cearense), which is different from the Recife/Olinda tradition in many respects: triangles are used instead of gongu\u00eas, [[surdo]]s or [[zabumba]]s instead of alfaias.  Also, important female characters are performed by cross-dressed male performers, and all African and Afrobrazilian personages are performed using blackface makeup.\n\n=== Afox\u00e9 ===\n{{main|Afox\u00e9}}\n\nAfox\u00e9 is the name given to a group dedicated to playing ijex\u00e1, which is a kind of [[religious music]], part of the [[Candombl\u00e9]] tradition.  In 1949, a group called [[Filhos de Gandhi]] began playing afox\u00e9 during [[Brazilian Carnival|carnaval]] parades in Salvador; their name translates as ''Sons of Gandhi'', associating black Brazilian activism with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s Indian independence movement.  The Filhos de Gandhi's 1949 appearance was also revolutionary because, until then, the Carnaval parades in Salvador were meant only for light-skinned people.\n\n=== Repente ===\n[[File:De repente, um repentista! (165251858).jpg|thumb|Repentista.]]\n[[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] is known for a distinctive form of literature called [[cordel literature|literatura de cordel]], which are a type of [[ballad]]s that include elements incorporated into music as \"[[repentismo]]\", an improvised lyrical contest on themes suggested by the audience.\n\nSimilar to Repentismo, appears among the [[Caipira]] culture a musical form derived from [[viola caipira]], which is called ''cururu''.\n\n== Popular music ==\n\n=== Choro ===\n{{main|Choro}}\n[[File:Violao choro.jpg|thumb|left|Choro guitar.]]\n{{Listen|filename=Pixinguinha- O Urubu e o Gaviao 1930.ogg|title=Urubu Malandro|description=\"Urubu Malandro\", recorded in 1930 by Pixinguinha in the flute}}\n{{Listen|filename=003-harmonia_selvagem_-_dante_santoro_1938.ogg|title=Harmonia Selvagem|description=Choro \"Harmonia Selvagem\" composed by Dante Santoro.

Instrumental, its origins are in 19th century Rio de Janeiro. Originally ''choro'' was played by a trio of flute, guitar and cavaquinho (a small chordophone with four strings). The young pianist [[Ernesto Nazareth]] published his first choro (''N\u00e3o Caio Noutra'') in 1878 at the age of 14.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070709135551/http://www.bn.br/fbn/musica/enzinfa.htm Childhood Secrets *]. bn.br</ref> Nazareth's choros are often listed as ''polkas'';<ref>[http://www.chiquinhagonzaga.com/nazareth/ Ernesto Nazareth \u2013 Rei do Choro].

[[Chiquinha Gonzaga]] composed her first success, the polka-choro \"Atraente\", in 1877. In the beginning, the success of choro came from informal groups of friends which played in parties, pubs ([[boteco]]s), streets, home balls (forrobod\u00f3s), and also the musical scores published by print houses.<ref>{{cite book |last=Livingston-Isenhour |first=T. |last2=Garcia |first2=T.

The mainstream success of this style of music (By the 1930s) came from the early days of radio, when bands performed live on the air. By the 1950s and 1960s it was replaced by [[samba]] and [[Bossa Nova]] and other styles of Brazilian popular music, but was still alive in amateur circles called \"rodas de choro\" (informal choro gatherings in residences and [[botecos]]). However, in the late 1970s there was a successful effort to revitalize the genre carried out by some famous artists: [[Pixinguinha]], [[Waldir Azevedo]] and [[Jacob do Bandolim]].\n\n=== Samba ===\n{{main|Samba}}\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Singer and actress [[Carmen Miranda]].]]\nIn 1929, prompted by the opening of the first radio station in Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ''radio era'' began spreading songs \u2013 especially the novelty Samba in its current format \u2013 to larger masses. This period was dominated by few male interpreters \u2013 notably Almirante, [[Braguinha (composer)|Braguinha]], [[M\u00e1rio Reis]], [[S\u00edlvio Caldas]], [[Francisco Alves]] and singer/composer [[Noel Rosa]] and even fewer chanteuses such as [[Aracy de Almeida]] and sisters [[Aurora Miranda]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], who eventually came to [[Hollywood]] becoming a movie star.<ref>[http://veja.abril.com.br/110407/p_120.shtml A na\u00e7\u00e3o das cantoras].

Noteworthy Samba composers at this early stage included said [[Noel Rosa]] plus [[Lamartine Babo]] and, around [[World War II]] time, [[Ary Barroso]].\n\n=== MPB (Popular Brazilian Music) ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica popular brasileira}}\n[[File:Brazil.GilbertoGil.01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gilberto Gil]]]]\n\nMPB's early stage (from World War II to the mid-1960s) was populated by male singers such as Orlando Silva, [[Nelson Gon\u00e7alves]], [[Jamel\u00e3o]], [[Agostinho dos Santos]], [[An\u00edsio Silva]], Ataulfo Alves, [[Carlos Galhardo]], [[Ciro Monteiro]], [[Ismael Silva]], [[Jo\u00e3o Dias]], [[Jorge Goulart]], [[Miltinho]], [[Jorge Veiga]] and [[Francisco Eg\u00eddio]] and female singers started to mushroom: [[Nora Ney]], [[Dolores Duran]], [[\u00c2ngela Maria]], [[Emilinha Borba]], Marlene, [[Dalva de Oliveira]], [[Maysa Matarazzo]], sisters [[Linda Batista]] and [[Dircinha Batista]], among others.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nMPB's second stage \u2013 after the split [[Bossa Nova]] (1959) / [[Jovem Guarda]] (1965) / [[Tropicalismo]] (both 1967) \u2013 refers to mainstream Brazilian pop music. Well-known MPB artists include, among many others, singers such as [[Elis Regina]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Nara Le\u00e3o]], [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]], [[M\u00f4nica da Silva]], [[Simone Bittencourt de Oliveira|Simone]], [[Chico Buarque]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Jorge Ben Jor]], [[Milton Nascimento]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Jo\u00e3o Bosco]], [[Ivan Lins]], [[Djavan]].\n\n=== Bossa nova ===\n{{main|Bossa nova}}\nThe first [[bossa nova]] records by [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]], in the last years of the 1950s, quickly became huge hits in Brazil. [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]] and other [[composer]]s helped further develop this fusion of [[jazz]] harmonies and a smoother, often slower, samba beat, which developed at the beach neighborhoods of [[Ipanema]] and, later, the [[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)|Copacabana]] nightclubs. Bossa nova was introduced to the rest of the world by American jazz musicians in the early 1960s, and song \"[[The Girl from Ipanema]]\" remains probably the best known Brazilian musical export, eventually becoming a jazz standard.\n\n=== Brazilian gospel ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n[[File:Diante do Trono - Grava\u00e7\u00e3o Creio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diante do Trono]], the main worship ministry in Latin America.]]\n[[Gospel music]] emerged in Brazil before the 1960s with hymnals that were brought and translated into Portuguese by American missionaries. From the late 1960s the first singers of Christian music groups emerged in Brazil, but the songs were not highly valued. Gospel music became popular in Brazil in the late 1990s, with the emergence of congregational singing and bands such as [[Diante do Trono]], led by [[Ana Paula Valad\u00e3o]]. Diante do Trono has become the largest [[contemporary worship music]] ministry in Latin America.\n\n=== Brazilian rock ===\n{{main|Brazilian rock|samba rock}}\n[[File:Rita Lee in Aracatuba-08, by Marco Senche.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rita Lee]]]]\nThe musical style known in Brazil as \"Brazilian [[rock n' roll]]\" dates back to a Portuguese-version cover{{which|date=June 2014}} of \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" in 1954. In the 1960s, young singers like [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] and the [[Jovem Guarda]] movement were very popular. The 1960s also saw the rise of bands such as the \"[[Tropicalismo|tropicalistas]]\" [[Os Mutantes]] and the experimental (mixing [[progressive rock]], [[jazz]] and [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]]) Som Imagin\u00e1rio.\n\nThe 1970s saw the emergence of many [[progressive rock]] and/or [[hard rock]] bands such as [[O Ter\u00e7o]], [[A Bolha]], [[A Barca do Sol]], [[Som Nosso de Cada Dia]], [[V\u00edmana]] and [[Bacamarte]], some of which attained some recognition internationally; [[Rita Lee]], in her solo career after [[Os Mutantes]], championed the glam-rock aesthetics in Brazil; [[Casa das M\u00e1quinas]] and [[Patrulha do Espa\u00e7o]] were more bona-fide [[hard rock]] bands, and the likes of ([[Raul Seixas]], [[Secos & Molhados|Secos e Molhados]], [[Novos Baianos]] and [[A Cor do Som]]) mixed the genre with traditional Brazilian music. In the late 1970s, the Brazilian [[punk rock]] scene kicked off mainly in S\u00e3o Paulo and in Bras\u00edlia, booming in the 1980s, with [[Inocentes]], [[C\u00f3lera]], [[Ratos de Por\u00e3o]], [[Garotos Podres]], etc.\n\nThe real commercial boom of Brazilian rock was in the 1980s, with many bands and artists like [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Gang 90]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Lob\u00e3o]], [[Engenheiros do Hawaii]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Kid Abelha]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], and many others, and festivals like [[Rock in Rio]] and [[Hollywood Rock]]. The late 1980s and early 1990s also witnessed the beginnings of an electronica-inspired scene, with a lot more limited commercial potential but achieving some critical acclaim: [[Suba (musician)|Suba]], [[Loop B]], [[Harry (Brazilian musician)|Harry]], etc.\n\n[[File:FTakai.jpg|thumb|[[Fernanda Takai]], singer [[Pato Fu]]]]\nIn the 1990s, the meteoric rise of [[Mamonas Assassinas]], which sold more than 3 million copies of its only CD (a record, by Brazilian standards) came to a tragic end when the band's plane crashed, killing all five members of the band, the pilot and the co-pilot. Other commercially successful bands included [[Jota Quest]], [[Raimundos]] and [[Skank (band)|Skank]], while [[Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]] and the whole [[Mangue Bit]] movement received much critical attention and accolades, but very little commercial success \u2013 success that declined after the death of one of its founders, [[Chico Science]]. It was also in the 1990s that the first seeds of what would grow into being the Brazilian indie scene were planted, with the creation of indie festivals such as [[Abril Pro Rock]] and, later in the decade, [[Por\u00e3o do Rock]]. The band [[Pato Fu]] was considered by [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine one of the ten best bands in the world outside the United States.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000784,00.html | work=Time | first=Rhett | last=Butler | title=Best Bands: And Our Winners Are | date=September 15, 2001}}</ref> It is also known to re-record hits Brazilian and international versions of toy instruments.\n\nFemale singer [[Pitty]] is also very popular. The indie scene has been growing exponentially since the early 2000s, with more and more festivals taking place all around the country. However, due to several factors including but not limited to the worldwide collapse of the music industry, all the agitation in the indie scene has so far failed in translating into international success, but in Brazil they developed a real, substantial cultural movement. That scene is still much of a ghetto, with bands capturing the attention of international critics, but many playing again in Brazil when they become popular in the exterior, due to the lack of financial and material support which would allow for careers to be developed. One notable exception is [[CSS (band)|CSS]], an alternative [[Electronic rock|electro rock]] outfit that has launched a successful international career, performing in festivals and venues in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Other unique example of success through independent music scene that made to the mainstream is the band [[M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju]]. The band has its own style, somewhere between rock and folk, and is recognized as the most important independent band in Brazil. The record company Trama [https://web.archive.org/web/20090123211659/http://trama.uol.com.br/portalv2/home/index.jsp] tries to support some bands with structure and exposure, and can be credited with early support to [[CSS (band)|CSS]] and later to M\u00f3veis Coloniais de Acaju.\n\n==== Brazilian heavy metal ====\n{{see also|Brazilian thrash metal}}\n[[File:Sepultura @ Maquin\u00e1ria Festival 02.jpg|thumb|[[Sepultura]].]]\nBrazilian [[Heavy metal music|metal]] originated in the mid 1980s with three prominent scenes: Belo Horizonte, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

The first to break into the mainstream was internet phenomenon [[Mallu Magalh\u00e3es]], who played covers of her favourite artists in English and her own songs in both English and Portuguese (as well as other languages).  Magalh\u00e3es only released her first album in 2008, though by then she was already widely recognised as the voice of this sudden new Brazilian folk scene.  Her ex-boyfriend [[H\u00e9lio Flanders]] is the lead singer of another Brazilian folk group called [[Vanguart]].  Though Vanguart had an album released before Mallu Magalh\u00e3es, it was her emergence that consolidated them both and others as a fully recognised mainstream scene, topping charts and being featured in prime time television and advertising.  Other acts emerged after the market was opened up to folk. Writing in English is more and more common among Brazilian rock and folk artists.  This has been highly criticised by Portuguese language purists, though it has helped to promote Brazilian artists in other countries ([[CSS (band)|CSS]] is a perfect example).  The new Brazilian folk scene has just come to the public's attention and it continues to thrive.\n[[File:Os Mutantes.tif|thumb|Os Mutantes, 1969. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\n\n==== Brazilian psychedelic rock ====\n{{main|Mangue Bit}}\nBrazil has a long tradition of psychedelic music since artists like [[Os Mutantes]], [[Ronnie Von]] and other rock bands from the late 60s. Nowadays, there exists a revival of this psychedelic/vintage inspired music represented by artists like [[Jupiter Apple]], [[Violeta de Outono]], [[Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi]], [[Mundo Livre S/A]], [[:pt:Cidad\u00e3o Instigado|Cidad\u00e3o Instigado]], [[Otto (singer)|Otto]], China, Kassin, [[:pt:Pata de Elefante|Pata de Elefante]], [[Orquestra Abstrata]], among others.\n\n=== Sertanejo ===\n{{main|M\u00fasica sertaneja}}\n[[File:Ch&xr.jpg|thumb|[[Chit\u00e3ozinho & Xoror\u00f3]].]]\nM\u00fasica sertaneja or Sertanejo is a term for Brazilian [[country music]]. It originally referred to music originating among [[Sert\u00e3o]] and musica [[caipira]]. (Caipira music appeared in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], and some the regions of [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Goi\u00e1s]]  [[Minas Gerais]], [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] and [[Mato Grosso]].

Rhythms are slow and plodding, and are derived from [[guitar]]s instead of [[percussion instrument]]s like in the rest of Brazil\u2014in this region, African rhythms and Portuguese melodies combined to form [[maracatu]].

Some of the most famous musicians of this genre are [[Renato Borghetti]], [[Yamandu Costa]], [[Jayme Caetano Braun]] and [[Luiz Marenco]], among others.\n\n=== Music of Salvador: Late 60s to mid-70s ===\nIn the latter part of the 1960s, a group of black Bahians began dressing as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] during the Salvadoran Carnaval, identifying with their shared struggles through history.  These groups included [[Comanches do Pel\u00f4]] and [[Apaches de Toror\u00f3]] and were known for a forceful and powerful style of percussion, and frequent violent encounters with the police.  Starting in 1974, a group of black Bahians called [[Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea]] became prominent, identifying with the [[Yoruba people]] of [[West Africa]].  Along with a policy of loosening restrictions by the Brazilian government, Il\u00ea Aiy\u00ea's sound and message spread to groups like [[Olodum|Grupo Cultural do Olodum]], who established community centers and other philanthropic efforts.\n\n=== Frevo ===\n{{main|Frevo}}\n\n[[Frevo]] is a style of music from [[Olinda]] and [[Recife]].

In Rio it is most often simply known as Funk, although it is very different musically from what [[Funk]] means in most other places and contexts.  Funk Carioca, like other types of hip-hop lifts heavily from samples such as international rips or from previous funk music.
