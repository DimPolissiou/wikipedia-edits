However, white smokers correspond mostly to waning stages of such hydrothermal fields, as magmatic heat sources become progressively more distant from the source (due to magma crystallization) and hydrothermal fluids become dominated by seawater instead of magmatic water. Mineralizing fluids from this type of vents are rich in calcium and they form dominantly sulfate-rich (i.e., [[barite]] and anhydrite) and carbonate deposits.<ref name=\"Col\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2016\"/>\n\n==Biology of hydrothermal vents==\n\nLife has traditionally been seen as driven by energy from the sun, but deep-sea organisms have no access to sunlight, so biological communities around hydrothermal vents must depend on nutrients found in the dusty chemical deposits and hydrothermal fluids in which they live. Previously, benthic oceanographers assumed that vent organisms were dependent on [[marine snow]], as deep-sea organisms are. This would leave them dependent on plant life and thus the sun. Some hydrothermal vent organisms do consume this \"rain\", but with only such a system, life forms would be sparse. Compared to the surrounding sea floor, however, hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10,000 to 100,000 times greater.\n\nHydrothermal vent communities are able to sustain such vast amounts of life because vent organisms depend on chemosynthetic bacteria for food. The water from the hydrothermal vent is rich in dissolved minerals and supports a large population of chemoautotrophic bacteria. These bacteria use sulfur compounds, particularly [[hydrogen sulfide]], a chemical highly toxic to most known organisms, to produce organic material through the process of [[chemosynthesis]].\n\n===Biological communities===\n{{Main|Deep sea communities|Earliest known life forms|Geyser#Biology of geysers|Hot spring#Biota in hot springs|Hydrothermal Vent Microbial Communities}}\n{{further|Hyperthermophile|Thermophile}}\n\nThe ecosystem so formed is reliant upon the continued existence of the hydrothermal vent field as the primary source of energy, which differs from most surface life on Earth, which is based on [[solar energy]]. However, although it is often said that these communities exist independently of the sun, some of the organisms are actually dependent upon oxygen produced by photosynthetic organisms, while others are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].\n\n[[File:Dense mass of anomuran crab Kiwa around deep-sea hydrothermal vent.jpg|thumb|left|A dense fauna (''[[Kiwaidae|Kiwa]]'' anomurans and ''[[Vulcanolepas osheai|Vulcanolepas]]''-like stalked barnacles) near [[East Scotia Ridge]] vents]]\n[[File:Riftia tube worm colony Galapagos 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') cluster around vents in the [[Galapagos Rift]] ]]\n\nThe chemosynthetic bacteria grow into a thick mat which attracts other organisms, such as [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] and [[copepod]]s, which graze upon the bacteria directly. Larger organisms, such as [[snail]]s, [[shrimp]], [[crab]]s, [[Siboglinidae|tube worms]], [[fish]] (especially [[eelpout]], [[cutthroat eel]], [[Ophidiiformes|ophidiiforms]] and ''[[Symphurus thermophilus]]''), and [[octopuses]] (notably ''[[Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis]]''), form a [[food chain]] of predator and prey relationships above the primary consumers. The main families of organisms found around seafloor vents are [[annelid]]s, [[Siboglinidae|pogonophorans]], [[gastropod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, with large [[bivalves]], vestimentiferan worms, and \"eyeless\" shrimp making up the bulk of nonmicrobial organisms.\n\n[[Siboglinidae|Siboglinid tube worm]]s, which may grow to over {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in the largest species, often form an important part of the community around a hydrothermal vent. They have no mouth or digestive tract, and like parasitic worms, absorb nutrients produced by the bacteria in their tissues. About 285 billion bacteria are found per ounce of tubeworm tissue. Tubeworms have red plumes which contain [[hemoglobin]]. [[Hemoglobin]] combines with hydrogen sulfide and transfers it to the bacteria living inside the worm. In return, the bacteria nourish the worm with carbon compounds. Two of the species that inhabit a hydrothermal vent are ''[[Tevnia]] jerichonana'', and ''[[Riftia pachyptila]]''. One discovered community, dubbed \"[[Eel City]]\", consists predominantly of the eel ''[[Dysommina rugosa]]''. Though eels are not uncommon, invertebrates typically dominate hydrothermal vents.

Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems differ from their shallow-water and terrestrial hydrothermal counterparts due to the symbiosis that occurs between macro invertebrate hosts and chemoautotrophic microbial symbionts in the former.<ref>Van Dover 2000{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref> Since sunlight does not reach deep-sea hydrothermal vents, organisms in deep-sea hydrothermal vents cannot obtain energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis. Instead, the microbial life found at hydrothermal vents are chemosynthetic; they fix carbon by using energy from chemicals such as sulfide, as opposed to light energy from the sun. In other words, the symbiont converts inorganic molecules (H<sub>2</sub>S, CO<sub>2</sub>, O) to organic molecules that the host then uses as nutrition. However, sulfide is an extremely toxic substance to most life on Earth. For this reason, scientists were astounded when they first found hydrothermal vents teeming with life in 1977. What was discovered was the ubiquitous symbiosis of chemoautotrophs living in (endosymbiosis) the vent animals' gills; the reason why multicellular life is capable to survive the toxicity of vent systems. Scientists are therefore now studying how the microbial symbionts aid in sulfide detoxification (therefore allowing the host to survive the otherwise toxic conditions). Work on microbiome function shows that host-associated microbiomes are also important in host development, nutrition, defense against predators, and detoxification. In return, the host provides the symbiont with chemicals required for chemosynthesis, such as carbon, sulfide, and oxygen.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of studying life at hydrothermal vents, there were differing theories regarding the mechanisms by which multicellular organisms were able to acquire nutrients from these environments, and how they were able to survive in such extreme conditions. In 1977, it was hypothesized that the chemoautotrophic bacteria at hydrothermal vents might be responsible for contributing to the diet of suspension feeding bivalves.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0146-6291(77)90478-7 |title=Clustering of suspension-feeding macrobenthos near abyssal hydrothermal vents at oceanic spreading centers |journal=Deep Sea Research |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=857\u2013863 |year=1977 |last1=Lonsdale |first1=Peter |bibcode=1977DSR....24..857L }}</ref>\n\nFinally, in 1981, it was understood that giant tubeworm nutrition acquisition occurred as a result of chemoautotrophic bacterial endosymbionts.<ref>Cavanaug eta al 1981{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref><ref>Felback 1981{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref><ref>Rau 1981{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref> As scientists continued to study life at hydrothermal vents, it was understood that symbiotic relationships between chemoautotrophs and macrofauna invertebrate species was ubiquitous.

For instance, tubeworms have no mouth and no gut, but they do have a \"trophosome\", which is where they deal with nutrition and where their endosymbionts are found. They also have a bright red plume, which they use to uptake compounds such as O, H<sub>2</sub>S, and CO<sub>2</sub>, which feed the endosymbionts in their trophosome. Remarkably, the tubeworms hemoglobin (which incidentally is the reason for the bright red color of the plume) is capable of carrying oxygen without interference or inhibition from sulfide, despite the fact that oxygen and sulfide are typically very reactive. In 2005, it was discovered that this is possible due to zinc ions that bind the hydrogen sulfide in the tubeworms hemoglobin, therefore preventing the sulfide from reacting with the oxygen. It also reduces the tubeworms tissue from exposure to the sulfide and provides the bacteria with the sulfide to perform chemoautotrophy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407455102 |pmid=15710902 |pmc=549462 |title=Sulfide binding is mediated by zinc ions discovered in the crystal structure of a hydrothermal vent tubeworm hemoglobin |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=8 |pages=2713\u20132718 |year=2005 |last1=Flores |first1=J.

However, white smokers correspond mostly to waning stages of such hydrothermal fields, as magmatic heat sources become progressively more distant from the source (due to magma crystallization) and hydrothermal fluids become dominated by seawater instead of magmatic water. Mineralizing fluids from this type of vents are rich in calcium and they form dominantly sulfate-rich (i.e., [[barite]] and anhydrite) and carbonate deposits.<ref name=\"Col\u00edn-Garc\u00eda 2016\"/>\n\n==Biology of hydrothermal vents==\n\nLife has traditionally been seen as driven by energy from the sun, but deep-sea organisms have no access to sunlight, so biological communities around hydrothermal vents must depend on nutrients found in the dusty chemical deposits and hydrothermal fluids in which they live. Previously, benthic oceanographers assumed that vent organisms were dependent on [[marine snow]], as deep-sea organisms are. This would leave them dependent on plant life and thus the sun. Some hydrothermal vent organisms do consume this \"rain\", but with only such a system, life forms would be sparse. Compared to the surrounding sea floor, however, hydrothermal vent zones have a density of organisms 10,000 to 100,000 times greater.\n\nHydrothermal vent communities are able to sustain such vast amounts of life because vent organisms depend on chemosynthetic bacteria for food. The water from the hydrothermal vent is rich in dissolved minerals and supports a large population of chemoautotrophic bacteria. These bacteria use sulfur compounds, particularly [[hydrogen sulfide]], a chemical highly toxic to most known organisms, to produce organic material through the process of [[chemosynthesis]].\n\n===Biological communities===\n{{Main|Deep sea communities|Earliest known life forms|Geyser#Biology of geysers|Hot spring#Biota in hot springs|Hydrothermal Vent Microbial Communities}}\n{{further|Hyperthermophile|Thermophile}}\n\nThe ecosystem so formed is reliant upon the continued existence of the hydrothermal vent field as the primary source of energy, which differs from most surface life on Earth, which is based on [[solar energy]]. However, although it is often said that these communities exist independently of the sun, some of the organisms are actually dependent upon oxygen produced by photosynthetic organisms, while others are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].\n\n[[File:Dense mass of anomuran crab Kiwa around deep-sea hydrothermal vent.jpg|thumb|left|A dense fauna (''[[Kiwaidae|Kiwa]]'' anomurans and ''[[Vulcanolepas osheai|Vulcanolepas]]''-like stalked barnacles) near [[East Scotia Ridge]] vents]]\n[[File:Riftia tube worm colony Galapagos 2011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') cluster around vents in the [[Galapagos Rift]] ]]\n\nThe chemosynthetic bacteria grow into a thick mat which attracts other organisms, such as [[Amphipoda|amphipods]] and [[copepod]]s, which graze upon the bacteria directly. Larger organisms, such as [[snail]]s, [[shrimp]], [[crab]]s, [[Siboglinidae|tube worms]], [[fish]] (especially [[eelpout]], [[cutthroat eel]], [[Ophidiiformes|ophidiiforms]] and ''[[Symphurus thermophilus]]''), and [[octopuses]] (notably ''[[Vulcanoctopus hydrothermalis]]''), form a [[food chain]] of predator and prey relationships above the primary consumers. The main families of organisms found around seafloor vents are [[annelid]]s, [[Siboglinidae|pogonophorans]], [[gastropod]]s, and [[crustacean]]s, with large [[bivalves]], vestimentiferan worms, and \"eyeless\" shrimp making up the bulk of nonmicrobial organisms.\n\n[[Siboglinidae|Siboglinid tube worm]]s, which may grow to over {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in the largest species, often form an important part of the community around a hydrothermal vent. They have no mouth or digestive tract, and like parasitic worms, absorb nutrients produced by the bacteria in their tissues. About 285 billion bacteria are found per ounce of tubeworm tissue. Tubeworms have red plumes which contain [[hemoglobin]]. [[Hemoglobin]] combines with hydrogen sulfide and transfers it to the bacteria living inside the worm. In return, the bacteria nourish the worm with carbon compounds. Two of the species that inhabit a hydrothermal vent are ''[[Tevnia]] jerichonana'', and ''[[Riftia pachyptila]]''. One discovered community, dubbed \"[[Eel City]]\", consists predominantly of the eel ''[[Dysommina rugosa]]''. Though eels are not uncommon, invertebrates typically dominate hydrothermal vents.

Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems differ from their shallow-water and terrestrial hydrothermal counterparts due to the symbiosis that occurs between macro invertebrate hosts and chemoautotrophic microbial symbionts in the former.<ref>Van Dover 2000{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref> Since sunlight does not reach deep-sea hydrothermal vents, organisms in deep-sea hydrothermal vents cannot obtain energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis. Instead, the microbial life found at hydrothermal vents are chemosynthetic; they fix carbon by using energy from chemicals such as sulfide, as opposed to light energy from the sun. In other words, the symbiont converts inorganic molecules (H<sub>2</sub>S, CO<sub>2</sub>, O) to organic molecules that the host then uses as nutrition. However, sulfide is an extremely toxic substance to most life on Earth. For this reason, scientists were astounded when they first found hydrothermal vents teeming with life in 1977. What was discovered was the ubiquitous symbiosis of chemoautotrophs living in (endosymbiosis) the vent animals' gills; the reason why multicellular life is capable to survive the toxicity of vent systems. Scientists are therefore now studying how the microbial symbionts aid in sulfide detoxification (therefore allowing the host to survive the otherwise toxic conditions). Work on microbiome function shows that host-associated microbiomes are also important in host development, nutrition, defense against predators, and detoxification. In return, the host provides the symbiont with chemicals required for chemosynthesis, such as carbon, sulfide, and oxygen.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of studying life at hydrothermal vents, there were differing theories regarding the mechanisms by which multicellular organisms were able to acquire nutrients from these environments, and how they were able to survive in such extreme conditions. In 1977, it was hypothesized that the chemoautotrophic bacteria at hydrothermal vents might be responsible for contributing to the diet of suspension feeding bivalves.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0146-6291(77)90478-7 |title=Clustering of suspension-feeding macrobenthos near abyssal hydrothermal vents at oceanic spreading centers |journal=Deep Sea Research |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=857\u2013863 |year=1977 |last1=Lonsdale |first1=Peter |bibcode=1977DSR....24..857L }}</ref>\n\nFinally, in 1981, it was understood that giant tubeworm nutrition acquisition occurred as a result of chemoautotrophic bacterial endosymbionts.<ref>Cavanaug eta al 1981{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref><ref>Felback 1981{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref><ref>Rau 1981{{full|date=August 2019}}</ref> As scientists continued to study life at hydrothermal vents, it was understood that symbiotic relationships between chemoautotrophs and macrofauna invertebrate species was ubiquitous.

For instance, tubeworms have no mouth and no gut, but they do have a \"trophosome\", which is where they deal with nutrition and where their endosymbionts are found. They also have a bright red plume, which they use to uptake compounds such as O, H<sub>2</sub>S, and CO<sub>2</sub>, which feed the endosymbionts in their trophosome. Remarkably, the tubeworms hemoglobin (which incidentally is the reason for the bright red color of the plume) is capable of carrying oxygen without interference or inhibition from sulfide, despite the fact that oxygen and sulfide are typically very reactive. In 2005, it was discovered that this is possible due to zinc ions that bind the hydrogen sulfide in the tubeworms hemoglobin, therefore preventing the sulfide from reacting with the oxygen. It also reduces the tubeworms tissue from exposure to the sulfide and provides the bacteria with the sulfide to perform chemoautotrophy.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0407455102 |pmid=15710902 |pmc=549462 |title=Sulfide binding is mediated by zinc ions discovered in the crystal structure of a hydrothermal vent tubeworm hemoglobin |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=102 |issue=8 |pages=2713\u20132718 |year=2005 |last1=Flores |first1=J.
