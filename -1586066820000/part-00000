Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction.

It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda.

(February, 2020)]]\n\nLocals in the town hope that an ongoing pagoda project of '''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' will change visitors\u2019 perceptions of their hometown and will become the landmark and symbol of the religion. \n'''Aungchanthar Pagoda''' is a 162-foot (48.5-meter) replica of '''[[Yangon]]''''s '''[[Shwedagon Pagoda]]'''. It was founded on July 20th, 2005 \u2013 the full moon day of [[Waso]], (1367 in the '''[[Myanmar]]''' calendar). Its name literally means \u201cVictory and Prosperity\u201d.\n\nLeading the project is U Pyinnya Wunsa (68 years old), the abbot of Aungchanthar monastery and a member of the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, locally known as Aungchanthar Sayadaw. \n\n[[File: Aung Chan Thar Pagoda2.jpg|thumb|left|Aung Chan Thar Pagoda under construction. (February, 2020)]]\n \nThere is still a lot of work to do until the Pagoda is complete.\nHe decided to build the Pagoda because '''Aungpan''' is at the center of several famous places in the region, such as '''[[Inle Lake]]''' and '''[[Pindaya Caves]]''', and visitors frequently ask him why the town doesn't have any sacred pagoda. \n\nIt has been under construction for about fifteen years. It had been spent about [[Kyat]] six billion (about [[US$]] 6 million) on the pagoda and it's about two-third finished. In 2005, it was estimated to cost about [[Kyat]] 7.6 billion. \n\nThe project has been really quite slow in the past ten years but visitors to the region often want to donate after hearing about the project. Now the project is moving much faster.\n\n[[File:Interior structure of pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The interior structure of pagoda. (February, 2020)]]\n\nWhen completed, the pagoda will be encircled by 107 smaller stupas, ranging in height from 6 feet (1.8 meters) to 12 feet (3.6 meters). \nWhile Aungchanthar Pagoda will replicate '''[[Shwedagon Pagoda]]''', it will also incorporate a hollow interior.\n\nLocals are very pleased that they would soon have a major religious site in their town and it would improve the town's image.\n\n==References==\n<ref>mmtimes.com/national-news/4539-aungban-builds-shwedagon-replica.html</ref>\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.maplandia.com/burma/shan/kalaw/aungban/ Satellite map at Maplandia.com]\n\n{{Kalaw Township}}\n{{Shan State}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Taunggyi District]]\n[[Category:Kalaw Township]]\n", "name_user": "Kmthu.ytu", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aungban"}

When the ladies meet at the diner to discuss how to pay the gang back, Rio tells them they have until the next day to pay them. Ruby comes up with a plan to ransom Boomer and get his wealthy grandmother Marion to pay. They attempt to break in, but discover that she is home.

The 11th century poet [[Bilhana]] describes both the spiritual and academic elements of Sharada Peeth, referring to it as the source of Kashmir's reputation as a centre of learning.

Three princes, Lothana, Vigraharaja and Bhoja, rebelled against [[Lohara dynasty#Jayasimha|King Jayasimha of Kashmir]]. These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u20131202\" />[[File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|299x299px|Adi Shankara, who opened Sharada Peeth's south door]]In the 14th century text ''Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam'', there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the ''Sarvajna Peetham'', or Throne of Omniscience.

He was said to be welcomed by the common people, but challenged by the scholars of the region. As he approached the southern door, he was stopped by various learned men from the [[Nyaya]] school of philosophy, Buddhists, [[Digambara|Digambara Jains]], and the followers of [[Jaimini]]. Engaging with them, he managed to persuade all of them of his proficiency in philosophy, and they stood aside to let him open the entrance. Finally, as he was about to ascend the throne, he heard the voice of the goddess Sharada challenging him. The voice said that omniscience was not enough if one was impure, and that Shankara, who lived in the palace of King Amaruka, could not be pure.

According to the script, the ''[[rishi]]'' Sh\u0101ndilya performed [[Tapas (Indian religions)|''tapasya'']] (or strict meditation with austerities) at the base of the mountain [[Harmukh]], to win the favour of the gods. In this period, he was served by local [[Siddha|''siddhas'']] and [[Gandharva|''gandharvas'']]. He attained desirelessness, and acquired control of his senses and body through strict meditation. To please the gods, he performed a grand ''[[Yajna]]'', or ritual offering, in the Sharda area, involving the local men, women and children. Hundreds of worthy priests were invited to participate in reciting the Vedas and performing the offerings in the sacrificial fire. In the middle of the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared and approached him, and introduced herself as a [[Brahmin]]i, who had accepted his invitation to participate in the ''Yajna''. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and wished for food. Shandilya welcomed her and bowed apologetically, saying that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first to sanctify the food. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and Divine Mother, and said that it was she that the offerings were being made to. She told him that the [[Paramatman]] (or Supreme Soul) he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons and clouds in the form of a blue lotus, and declared that she would absorb the world, the humans, forests, trees and everything in the ''Yajna''. In shock, remorse and fear, Shandilya collapsed and died. Seeing his remorse, the goddess asked her companion to revive him with ''[[Amrita]]'', the elixir of life. Shandilya awoke and looked around at the destruction wrought from the goddess's fury sorrowfully, and believed himself to be responsible. The goddess transformed into a different, graceful form of Saraswati. Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to restore revive the dead and restore the village and forest. Saraswati accepted, and instructed him to build his [[ashram]] at the base of the hill near the Madhumati river (present-day Neelum River). She took her abode there at ''Sharada Peeth'' and blessed Shandilya.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tikkoo|first=Brij Nath|url=https://archive.org/details/ShriSharadaMahatmyaBrijNathTikkoo|title=Shri Sharada Mahatmya|publisher=Vikas Printing Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ajmer|pages=(ii), 1, 7\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative account holds that Shandilya prayed to the goddess Sharada with great devotion, and was rewarded when she appeared to him and promised to show him her real, divine form. She advised him to look for the Sharada forest. His journey was filled with miraculous experiences. On his way, he had a vision of the god [[Ganesha]] on the eastern side of a hill. When he reached the Neelum river, he bathed in it and saw half his body turn golden. Eventually, goddess revealed herself to him in her triple form of Sharada, Saraswati and Vagdevi, and invited him to her abode. As he was preparing for a ritual, he drew water from the ''Mah\u0101sindhu''. Half of this water transformed into honey, and became a stream, now known as the ''Madhumati'' stream.<ref name=\":32\" />[[File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|thumb|A photograph of Sharada Peeth in 1893 by [[Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]|alt=|280x280px]]A third account holds that during a fight between good and evil, the goddess Sharada saved a mythical container of knowledge and hid it in a hole in the ground.

In her fury, she summoned them and ordered them to build her a tomb, which became Sharada Peeth. The second legend says that there one was a giant who loved a princess.

It sits on a hill, and is approached via a stone stairway to the remains of a thick stone wall and ruined gateway. The ruins appear to enclose a rectangular area, which at one point would have had its corners aligned with the cardinal points of the compass. The temple is square in plan, and sits on a square plinth, with its doorway facing west. There are five steps between the ground and the entrance, which at one point would have had a half-vaulted ceiling, behind which lay a [[Trefoil arch]] leading to the inner sanctum. Today, this area is exposed to the sky. The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. Possibly, the simplicity of the design means that the temple was designed (or more likely, later reconstructed) as a plainer architectural second to the Martand Sun Temple for local worshippers. Both the Martand Sun Temple and the [[Malot]] Fort are designed similarly, but more ornately.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Rashid|first=Salman|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1398483/heritage-goddess-of-the-mountains|title=Heritage: Goddess of the Mountains|date=1 April 2018|work=Dawn|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-protected|reason=Persistent [[WP:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Pakistani English|date=March 2018}}\n\n{{Infobox religious building\n| name                  = Sharada Peeth\n| native_name           = {{plainlist}}\n* {{nq|\u0634\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0679\u06be}}\n* \u0936\u093e\u0930\u0926\u093e \u092a\u0940\u0920\n* \ud804\uddaf\ud804\uddb3\ud804\uddab\ud804\udda2\ud804\uddb3 \ud804\udda5\ud804\uddb5\ud804\udd9c\n{{endplainlist}}\n| native_name_lang      = Kashmiri\n| image                 = [[File:Sharda Fort, Azad Jammu & Kashmir.jpg|centre|frameless|350x350px]]\n| image_upright         = \n| alt                   = \n| caption               = Ruins of Sharada Peeth\n| image2                = \n| caption2              =\n| map_type              = Kashmir#Pakistan\n| map_size              =  \n| map_alt               = \n| map_relief            = \n| map_caption           = Sharada Peeth\n| coordinates           = {{coord|34|47|31|N|74|11|24|E|display=inline}}\n| coordinates_footnotes =\n| religious_affiliation = [[Hinduism]]\n| locale                = \n| location              = [[Sharda, Azad Kashmir|Sharda]], [[Azad Kashmir]]\n| deity                 = [[Saraswati|Sharada]]\n| rite                  = [[Shaktism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Vedism]] \n| sect                  = \n| tradition             = \n| festival              = <!-- or | festivals = -->\n| cercle                = \n| sector                = \n| municipality          = \n| district              = [[Neelam Valley]]\n| territory             = [[Azad Kashmir]]\n| prefecture            = \n| state                 = \n| province              = \n| region                = \n| country               = [[Pakistan]]\n| administration        = \n| consecration_year     = \n| organisational_status = <!-- or | organizational_status = -->\n| functional_status     = \n| heritage_designation  = Undesignated\n| ownership             = \n| governing_body        = \n| leadership            = \n| bhattaraka            = \n| patron                = \n| website               = \n| architect             = \n| architecture_type     = \n| architecture_style    = Kashmiri<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heritage-india.com/medieval-stone-temples-of-kashmir/|title=The Unexplored Medieval Stone Temples of Kashmir|last=Singh|first=Rajesh|website=Heritage India Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925035448/https://heritage-india.com/medieval-stone-temples-of-kashmir/|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=|access-date=25 September 2018|quote=However, a few still stand in different states of preservation at places like Martand, Avantipur, Pattan, Buniar, Pandrethan and Payar, reflecting not only the remarkable temple construction activity that once existed in Kashmir but also showcasing a distinct architectural style.

These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u20131202\" />[[File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|299x299px|Adi Shankara, who opened Sharada Peeth's south door]]In the 14th century text ''Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam'', there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the ''Sarvajna Peetham'', or Throne of Omniscience.

Engaging with them, he managed to persuade all of them of his proficiency in philosophy, and they stood aside to let him open the entrance. Finally, as he was about to ascend the throne, he heard the voice of the goddess Sharada challenging him. The voice said that omniscience was not enough if one was impure, and that Shankara, who lived in the palace of King Amaruka, could not be pure.

According to the script, the ''[[rishi]]'' Sh\u0101ndilya performed [[Tapas (Indian religions)|''tapasya'']] (or strict meditation with austerities) at the base of the mountain [[Harmukh]], to win the favour of the gods. In this period, he was served by local [[Siddha|''siddhas'']] and [[Gandharva|''gandharvas'']]. He attained desirelessness, and acquired control of his senses and body through strict meditation. To please the gods, he performed a grand ''[[Yajna]]'', or ritual offering, in the Sharda area, involving the local men, women and children. Hundreds of worthy priests were invited to participate in reciting the Vedas and performing the offerings in the sacrificial fire. In the middle of the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared and approached him, and introduced herself as a [[Brahmin]]i, who had accepted his invitation to participate in the ''Yajna''. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and wished for food. Shandilya welcomed her and bowed apologetically, saying that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first to sanctify the food. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and Divine Mother, and said that it was she that the offerings were being made to. She told him that the [[Paramatman]] (or Supreme Soul) he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons and clouds in the form of a blue lotus, and declared that she would absorb the world, the humans, forests, trees and everything in the ''Yajna''. In shock, remorse and fear, Shandilya collapsed and died. Seeing his remorse, the goddess asked her companion to revive him with ''[[Amrita]]'', the elixir of life. Shandilya awoke and looked around at the destruction wrought from the goddess's fury sorrowfully, and believed himself to be responsible. The goddess transformed into a different, graceful form of Saraswati. Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to restore revive the dead and restore the village and forest. Saraswati accepted, and instructed him to build his [[ashram]] at the base of the hill near the Madhumati river (present-day Neelum River). She took her abode there at ''Sharada Peeth'' and blessed Shandilya.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tikkoo|first=Brij Nath|url=https://archive.org/details/ShriSharadaMahatmyaBrijNathTikkoo|title=Shri Sharada Mahatmya|publisher=Vikas Printing Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ajmer|pages=(ii), 1, 7\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative account holds that Shandilya prayed to the goddess Sharada with great devotion, and was rewarded when she appeared to him and promised to show him her real, divine form. She advised him to look for the Sharada forest. His journey was filled with miraculous experiences. On his way, he had a vision of the god [[Ganesha]] on the eastern side of a hill. When he reached the Neelum river, he bathed in it and saw half his body turn golden. Eventually, goddess revealed herself to him in her triple form of Sharada, Saraswati and Vagdevi, and invited him to her abode. As he was preparing for a ritual, he drew water from the ''Mah\u0101sindhu''.

It sits on a hill, and is approached via a stone stairway to the remains of a thick stone wall and ruined gateway. The ruins appear to enclose a rectangular area, which at one point would have had its corners aligned with the cardinal points of the compass. The temple is square in plan, and sits on a square plinth, with its doorway facing west. There are five steps between the ground and the entrance, which at one point would have had a half-vaulted ceiling, behind which lay a [[Trefoil arch]] leading to the inner sanctum. Today, this area is exposed to the sky. The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. Possibly, the simplicity of the design means that the temple was designed (or more likely, later reconstructed) as a plainer architectural second to the Martand Sun Temple for local worshippers. Both the Martand Sun Temple and the [[Malot]] Fort are designed similarly, but more ornately.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Rashid|first=Salman|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1398483/heritage-goddess-of-the-mountains|title=Heritage: Goddess of the Mountains|date=1 April 2018|work=Dawn|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "name_user": "Vami IV", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a quick wl", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharada_Peeth"}

For water, however, this is not true because the melting point of ordinary ice decreases as a function of pressure, as shown by the dashed green line in the [[phase diagram]].

For exacting work, triple-point cells are typically filled with a highly pure chemical substance such as hydrogen, argon, mercury, or water (depending on the desired temperature).  The purity of these substances can be such that only one part in a million is a contaminant, called \"six nines\" because it is 99.9999% pure.  When it is a water-based cell, a specific [[isotope|isotopic]] composition called [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|VSMOW]] is used because variations in isotopic composition cause small changes in the triple point.  Triple-point cells are so effective at achieving highly precise, reproducible temperatures, that an international calibration standard for thermometers called [[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS\u201390]] relies upon triple-point cells of [[hydrogen]], [[neon]], [[oxygen]], [[argon]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[water (molecule)|water]] for delineating six of its defined temperature points.\n\n==Table of triple points==\nThis table lists the gas\u2013liquid\u2013solid triple points of several substances.

For exacting work, triple-point cells are typically filled with a highly pure chemical substance such as hydrogen, argon, mercury, or water (depending on the desired temperature).  The purity of these substances can be such that only one part in a million is a contaminant, called \"six nines\" because it is 99.9999% pure.  When it is a water-based cell, a specific [[isotope|isotopic]] composition called [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water|VSMOW]] is used because variations in isotopic composition cause small changes in the triple point.  Triple-point cells are so effective at achieving highly precise, reproducible temperatures, that an international calibration standard for thermometers called [[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS\u201390]] relies upon triple-point cells of [[hydrogen]], [[neon]], [[oxygen]], [[argon]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[water (molecule)|water]] for delineating six of its defined temperature points.\n\n==Table of triple points==\nThis table lists the gas\u2013liquid\u2013solid triple points of several substances.
