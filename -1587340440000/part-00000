The Haisla and their language, along with that of the neighbouring [[Heiltsuk people|Heiltsuk]] and [[Wuikinuxv people|Wuikinuxv]] peoples, were in the past incorrectly called \"Northern Kwakiutl\".\n\nThe name ''Haisla'' is derived from the Haisla word ''x&#803;\u00e0\u02bcisla'' or ''x&#803;\u00e0\u02bcis\u0259la'', meaning 'dwellers downriver'.\n\nHaisla is a [[Wakashan languages|Northern Wakashan]] language spoken by several hundred people. Haisla is geographically the northernmost Wakashan language. Its nearest Wakashan neighbor is [[Oowekyala dialect|Oowekyala]].\n\n==Dialects==\n\nThe present-day population of Kitamaat developed from multiple sources, meaning there are language differences that go with these different sources. The two most prominent are Kitimaat (''X\u0305a\u02bcislak\u02bcala'') and Kitlope (''X\u0305enaksialak\u02bcala''). Pronunciation, grammar, and word choice depend on which dialect is being spoken.\n\nHaisla is still used to refer to the language as a whole, similar to how English encompasses multiple dialects.\n\n==Phonology==\n\nHaisla is closely related to the other North Wakashan languages, [[Oowekyala dialect|Oowekyala]], [[Heiltsuk dialect|Heiltsuk]], [[Kwak'wala language|Kwak'wala]], and to a lesser extent Nuuchahnulth (Nootka), Nitinat, and Makah. Typical of languages spoken on the Northwest Coast, these languages consist of multiple consonants with limited allophonic variation.  The phonological inventory is familiar to other Northern Wakashan languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+[[Consonant]]s<ref>{{Cite book|title=Phonology, dictionary and listing of roots and lexical derivatives of the Haisla language of Kitlope and Kitimaat, B.

Similar to the other Wakashan languages, Haisla does not have large vowel systems. The vowels seen in the language are {{IPA|/i/, /a/, /u/, /o/, /e/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/. /\u0259/}} also exists in Kwakwala, and absent from Southern Wakashan languages. The two languages are also characterized by their open {{IPA|/i u/}}.\n\nDorsals can either be front {{IPA|/k \u0261 x/}} or back, {{IPA|/q \u0262 \u03c7/}}, and can also be rounded. Plosives can be further altered by aspiration, glottalization, and voicing. Resonants also experience further augmentation through glottalization. Fricatives and plain plosives are generally aspirated within Northern Wakashan languages, whereas the voiced plosives can be either phonetically voiced or voiceless un-aspirated.\n\nVoicing and glottalization are active components, seen in consonant mutations, while aspiration is not. Aspirated plosives, alongside fricatives, have  \nAll aspirated and glottalized plosives in Haisla are voiceless. All fricatives are voiceless as well.\n\n==Morphology==\n\nHaisla is a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object|VSO (verb-initial) language]], with \"highly polysynthetic, suffixing, [and] possibly with no (lexical) N\u2013V distinction\".<ref name=\"A Note on Quantification and Blankets in Haisla\">{{cite journal|last=Emmon|first=Bach|author2=E.

Stem = [Ext](Root)(-LexSuf)*(-GramSuf)*\n\nB. Word = Stem(Ending)*\n\nThe majority of roots cannot function as independent words; those that can often take on different meanings. One example of this can be seen with the root ''bek\u02b7'', when combined with the stems ''-es'' or ''-ala'', mean either 'Sasquatch' or 'talk', respectively.\n\nSeen in all Wakashan languages, Haisla has a variety of common, clause-level clitics which contain inflection-like semantics. Seen also in Spair in Swadesh where they are identified as \"incremental suffixes\", these contain markers of tense, aspect, and modality. These clitics are non-obligatory outside of the perfective vs. imperfective aspect, and do not form paradigms, while having a set order.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fortescue|first=Michael|title=Drift and the Grammaticalization Divide between Northern and Southern Wakashan|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=July 2006|volume=72|issue=3|pages=295\u2013324|doi=10.1086/509488}}<!--|accessdate=February 6, 2014--></ref>\n\nHaisla has a wide range of classificatory roots, something shared with its fellow Northern Wakashan languages.

Haisla does not have a large focus on number, with the word for ''beg\u02b7\u00e1nem'' standing for both 'people' and 'person' depending on its context. Haisla also has inclusive and exclusive endings, in reference to if \"we\" or \"us\" includes the person being spoken to. Haisla has gender-neutral pronouns, with no distinction between 'him' and 'her'.\n\nAll Northern Wakashan languages display elaborate systems of third-person pronominal clitics. These usually include distinct case forms for object, subject, and instrument or possessor. Unlike Kwakw'ala, Haisla and the other Northern Wakashan languages  lack prenominal elements. Haisla, however, does make use of the independent demonstrative forms ''qi'', ''qu'', etc., which serve as optional yet frequently occurring first elements in nominal groups.\n\nThe subject endings can be seen in the two charts below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, the sentence \"The chief sees the grizzly\", literally translates as \"see the chief the grizzly\". When expressing negation in Haisla, the helping verb ''k\u0315uus-/k\u0315uu-'' would occur at the beginning of the sentence. This root is then modified with the proper ending reflecting the subject of the verb, e.g. ''K\u0313un duq\u02b7el qi s\u00e1akax\u0304i'' \"I don't see the grizzly\".\n\n==Possessives==\nWhen expressing possession in Haisla, endings that are used to indicated to the possessor are also used with objects of some special verbs. The majority of these verbs tend to express emotions or psychological states.\n\nPossessive endings in Haisla sometimes bear a resemblance to those used in English. ''-nis'' can be used similarly to the English \"my\" when placed before a possessed object. Outside of using separated words to express possession, endings can also be used on individual words, e.g. ''g\u00fax\u02b7genc'' \"my house here\". The set of suffixes in Haisla that reflect possession is quite extensive. Haisla, however, does use the independent demonstrative forms ''qi'', ''qu'', etc., which serve as optional and frequently occurring first elements in nominal groups.\n\nThird Person Possessive Forms:\nPossessed things near me:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! item !!

Similar to the use of 'of' in English, some verbs require their objects to be marked by either the expression 'his' or the ending '-s' on the previous word. Possession in Haisla is expressed through pronouns, making use of the same endings that are used for oblique objects.\n\n==Deixis==\n\nIn Haisla, the location of a conversation directly impacts the use of the language. Depending if something occurred at the site of the conversation or far away, verb endings express where the action took place. There are four possible locations within the language: here (near the speaker), there (near you, the hearer), there (near neither the speaker nor the hearer), and just gone. These concepts help form the \"spatial and tempora\" aspects of Haisla.<ref name=Bach /> The language also distinguishes between things that are seen and known, which are classified as visible. Things that are not visible, instead being imagined or potential, are defined as invisible.\n\nUnique to Haisla is the addition of the optional demonstrative clitics ''qu'' and ''qi'', which help make the spatial explicitness of a clause more vivid.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other words, such as ''lepl\u00e1it ~ lilepl\u00e1it'', meaning 'minister, priest', reflect how contact with missionaries affected the language as a whole. The majority of adopted words were for 'new' objects, pre-existing words such as gewed\u00e9n, or horse, were not overwritten.\n\n==Arguments==\nWithin the Wakashan language family, \"core arguments are identified only by pronominal enclitics attached to the initial predicate.

The Haisla and their language, along with that of the neighbouring [[Heiltsuk people|Heiltsuk]] and [[Wuikinuxv people|Wuikinuxv]] peoples, were in the past incorrectly called \"Northern Kwakiutl\".\n\nThe name ''Haisla'' is derived from the Haisla word ''x&#803;\u00e0\u02bcisla'' or ''x&#803;\u00e0\u02bcis\u0259la'', meaning 'dwellers downriver'.\n\nHaisla is a [[Wakashan languages|Northern Wakashan]] language spoken by several hundred people.

Pronunciation, grammar, and word choice depend on which dialect is being spoken.\n\nHaisla is still used to refer to the language as a whole, similar to how English encompasses multiple dialects.\n\n==Phonology==\n\nHaisla is closely related to the other North Wakashan languages, [[Oowekyala dialect|Oowekyala]], [[Heiltsuk dialect|Heiltsuk]], [[Kwak'wala language|Kwak'wala]], and to a lesser extent Nuuchahnulth (Nootka), Nitinat, and Makah. Typical of languages spoken on the Northwest Coast, these languages consist of multiple consonants with limited allophonic variation.

Similar to the other Wakashan languages, Haisla does not have large vowel systems. The vowels seen in the language are {{IPA|/i/, /a/, /u/, /o/, /e/}} and {{IPA|/\u0259/. /\u0259/}} also exists in Kwakwala, and absent from Southern Wakashan languages. The two languages are also characterized by their open {{IPA|/i u/}}.\n\nDorsals can either be front {{IPA|/k \u0261 x/}} or back, {{IPA|/q \u0262 \u03c7/}}, and can also be rounded. Plosives can be further altered by aspiration, glottalization, and voicing. Resonants also experience further augmentation through glottalization. Fricatives and plain plosives are generally aspirated within Northern Wakashan languages, whereas the voiced plosives can be either phonetically voiced or voiceless un-aspirated.\n\nVoicing and glottalization are active components, seen in consonant mutations, while aspiration is not. Aspirated plosives, alongside fricatives, have  \nAll aspirated and glottalized plosives in Haisla are voiceless. All fricatives are voiceless as well.\n\n==Morphology==\n\nHaisla is a [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object|VSO (verb-initial) language]], with \"highly polysynthetic, suffixing, [and] possibly with no (lexical) N\u2013V distinction\".<ref name=\"A Note on Quantification and Blankets in Haisla\">{{cite journal|last=Emmon|first=Bach|author2=E.

Stem = [Ext](Root)(-LexSuf)*(-GramSuf)*\n\nB. Word = Stem(Ending)*\n\nThe majority of roots cannot function as independent words; those that can often take on different meanings. One example of this can be seen with the root ''bek\u02b7'', when combined with the stems ''-es'' or ''-ala'', mean either 'Sasquatch' or 'talk', respectively.\n\nSeen in all Wakashan languages, Haisla has a variety of common, clause-level clitics which contain inflection-like semantics. Seen also in Spair in Swadesh where they are identified as \"incremental suffixes\", these contain markers of tense, aspect, and modality. These clitics are non-obligatory outside of the perfective vs. imperfective aspect, and do not form paradigms, while having a set order.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fortescue|first=Michael|title=Drift and the Grammaticalization Divide between Northern and Southern Wakashan|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|date=July 2006|volume=72|issue=3|pages=295\u2013324|doi=10.1086/509488}}<!--|accessdate=February 6, 2014--></ref>\n\nHaisla has a wide range of classificatory roots, something shared with its fellow Northern Wakashan languages.

Haisla does not have a large focus on number, with the word for ''beg\u02b7\u00e1nem'' standing for both 'people' and 'person' depending on its context. Haisla also has inclusive and exclusive endings, in reference to if \"we\" or \"us\" includes the person being spoken to. Haisla has gender-neutral pronouns, with no distinction between 'him' and 'her'.\n\nAll Northern Wakashan languages display elaborate systems of third-person pronominal clitics. These usually include distinct case forms for object, subject, and instrument or possessor. Unlike Kwakw'ala, Haisla and the other Northern Wakashan languages  lack prenominal elements. Haisla, however, does make use of the independent demonstrative forms ''qi'', ''qu'', etc., which serve as optional yet frequently occurring first elements in nominal groups.\n\nThe subject endings can be seen in the two charts below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

For example, the sentence \"The chief sees the grizzly\", literally translates as \"see the chief the grizzly\". When expressing negation in Haisla, the helping verb ''k\u0315uus-/k\u0315uu-'' would occur at the beginning of the sentence. This root is then modified with the proper ending reflecting the subject of the verb, e.g. ''K\u0313un duq\u02b7el qi s\u00e1akax\u0304i'' \"I don't see the grizzly\".\n\n==Possessives==\nWhen expressing possession in Haisla, endings that are used to indicated to the possessor are also used with objects of some special verbs. The majority of these verbs tend to express emotions or psychological states.\n\nPossessive endings in Haisla sometimes bear a resemblance to those used in English. ''-nis'' can be used similarly to the English \"my\" when placed before a possessed object. Outside of using separated words to express possession, endings can also be used on individual words, e.g. ''g\u00fax\u02b7genc'' \"my house here\". The set of suffixes in Haisla that reflect possession is quite extensive. Haisla, however, does use the independent demonstrative forms ''qi'', ''qu'', etc., which serve as optional and frequently occurring first elements in nominal groups.\n\nThird Person Possessive Forms:\nPossessed things near me:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! item !!

Similar to the use of 'of' in English, some verbs require their objects to be marked by either the expression 'his' or the ending '-s' on the previous word. Possession in Haisla is expressed through pronouns, making use of the same endings that are used for oblique objects.\n\n==Deixis==\n\nIn Haisla, the location of a conversation directly impacts the use of the language. Depending if something occurred at the site of the conversation or far away, verb endings express where the action took place. There are four possible locations within the language: here (near the speaker), there (near you, the hearer), there (near neither the speaker nor the hearer), and just gone. These concepts help form the \"spatial and tempora\" aspects of Haisla.<ref name=Bach /> The language also distinguishes between things that are seen and known, which are classified as visible. Things that are not visible, instead being imagined or potential, are defined as invisible.\n\nUnique to Haisla is the addition of the optional demonstrative clitics ''qu'' and ''qi'', which help make the spatial explicitness of a clause more vivid.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This excess of communication eventually led to the creation of a special \"trade language\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Bach|first=Emmon|title=5.4 Historical Note: Chinook Jargon|url=http://people.umass.edu/ebach/xles-5.htm|access-date=13 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414191849/http://people.umass.edu/ebach/xles-5.htm|archive-date=14 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Called Chinook Jargon, Haisla adopted multiple words from this language such as ''g\u02b7as\u00e1u'', or pig. Other words, such as ''lepl\u00e1it ~ lilepl\u00e1it'', meaning 'minister, priest', reflect how contact with missionaries affected the language as a whole. The majority of adopted words were for 'new' objects, pre-existing words such as gewed\u00e9n, or horse, were not overwritten.\n\n==Arguments==\nWithin the Wakashan language family, \"core arguments are identified only by pronominal enclitics attached to the initial predicate.

The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.\n\nThe term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early precedents===\nTechniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.<ref name=\"Origins\" /> The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].<ref name=\"Origins\" /> An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}</ref>\nMany institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.<ref>http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview</ref> Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' <ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]</ref> at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].\n\n===Collage and modernism===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]\nDespite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.\n\nFor example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage \"was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.\".<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage \"Introduction to collage\"]. Tate Gallery website</ref> According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches \"collided with the surface plane of the painting.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works \"gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other,\" according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: \"References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art.\" This juxtaposition of signifiers, \"at once serious and tongue-in-cheek,\" was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: \"Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\n===Collage in painting===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (T\u00eate), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (T\u00eate)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]\nCollage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):\n\n\"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\nIn 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e)'',<ref>''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Mus\u00e9e National Picasso Paris</ref> Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.\n\n[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements|etr\u00e9cissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mari\u00ebn]] from a method first explored by Mari\u00ebn. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.\n\nThe [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.\nWesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,<ref>(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)</ref> exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.\n\nAnother technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.\n\n===Collage with wood===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&page_number=5&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMA]</ref> part of a series of experimental collages.]] -->\n[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918\u20131986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]</ref> The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/> Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.\n\nIt was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, \"As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/louise-nevelson-sky-cathedral-1958/ |title=Louise Nevelson, Sky Cathedral 1958  |publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81006 |title=Sky Cathedral |work=MoMA Highlights |location=New York |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222</ref> Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.\n\nMuch wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.\n\nFrequently, what is called \"wood collage art\" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable \"[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s\" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)\n\n===Decoupage===\n[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|d\u00e9coup\u00e9e]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]\n{{Main|Decoupage}}\nDecoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].\n\nThere are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].\n\nThe craft became known as d\u00e9coupage in [[France]] (from the verb ''d\u00e9couper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].\n\nThe most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].\n\n===Photomontage===\n{{Main|Photomontage}}\nCollage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.\n[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]\n\n''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.<ref name=tomorrow>[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm \"This is tomorrow\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to \"image 027TT-1956.jpg\"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref> Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.<ref>[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm \"Just what is it\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref>\n\nOther methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian \"combination printing\", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]\u2019s (1912\u20131988) series of black and white \"photomontage projections\" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8\u00bd \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.\n\nThe 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create \"paste-ups\" digitally.\n\nCreating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to \"undo\" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.\n\n===Digital collage===\nDigital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].\n\n===Three-dimensional collage===\nA 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.\n\n===Mosaic===\nIt is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design. Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.\n\n===eCollage===\nThe term \"eCollage\" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools. Wikipedia utizes eCollage in constructing the 'truth'.\n\n===Collage artists===\n<!--NOTE: Please add only existing articles about collage artists.

Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.\n\n===In music===\n[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955\u20131957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\n{{Main|Sound collage}}\nThe concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that \"[[sound collage|musical collages]]\" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, \"mash-up\" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called \"literature of sound.\" In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In illustration===\nCollage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].\n\n===In artist's books===\n\nCollage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.<ref>https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.\n\nThe [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.\n\n===In fashion design===\nCollage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.\n\n===In film===\n{{main|Collage film}}\nCollage film is traditionally defined as, \u201cA film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.\u201d Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director\u2019s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.\n\n====In post-production====\nThe use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel\u2019s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.\n\n==Legal issues==\nWhen collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.\n\nDue to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].<ref>See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.</ref> Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.\n\nThe copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the \"first sale\" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].<ref>''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)</ref> The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.<ref>See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.</ref> The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.<ref>''Blanch v. Koons'', -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 3040666 (2d Cir.

(Compare with [[pastiche]], which is a \"pasting\" together.)\n\nA collage may sometimes include [[Clipping (publications)|magazine and newspaper clippings]], [[ribbon]]s, [[paint]], bits of colored or handmade papers, portions of other artwork or texts, [[photograph]]s and other [[found object]]s, glued to a piece of paper or canvas. The origins of collage can be traced back hundreds of years, but this technique made a dramatic reappearance in the early 20th century as an [[art]] form of novelty.\n\nThe term ''collage'' was coined by both [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] in the beginning of the 20th century when collage became a distinctive part of [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/collage.html ''Collage'', essay by [[Clement Greenberg]]] Retrieved July 20, 2010</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early precedents===\nTechniques of collage were first used at the time of the [[Papermaking|invention of paper]] in [[China]], around 200 BC. The use of collage, however, wasn't used by many people until the 10th century in [[Japan]], when [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphers]] began to apply glued paper, using texts on surfaces, when writing their [[poem]]s.<ref name=\"Origins\" /> The technique of collage appeared in [[medieval Europe]] during the 13th century. [[Gold leaf]] panels started to be applied in [[Gothic cathedrals]] around the 15th and 16th centuries. [[Gemstone]]s and other [[precious metal]]s were applied to religious images, [[icon]]s, and also, to [[coats of arms]].<ref name=\"Origins\" /> An 18th-century example of collage art can be found in the work of [[Mary Delany]]. In the 19th century, collage methods also were used among hobbyists for [[memorabilia]] (e.g. applied to [[photo albums]]) and books (e.g. [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Carl Spitzweg]]).<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite book|last=Leland|first=Nita|authorlink=|author2=Virginia Lee Williams|editor=|others=|title=Creative Collage Techniques|origyear=|url=|format=|accessdate=|date=September 1994|publisher=North Light Books|isbn=0-89134-563-9|pages=7|chapter=One}}</ref>\nMany institutions have attributed the beginnings of the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s.<ref>http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview</ref> Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: ''Playing with Pictures'' <ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/VictPhotoColl/overview Art Institute of Chicago, Playing with Pictures]</ref> at [[Art Institute of Chicago|the Art Institute Chicago]] to acknowledge collage works by [[Alexandra of Denmark]] and [[Mary Georgina Filmer]] among others. The exhibition later traveled to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[Art Gallery of Ontario|The Art Gallery of Ontario]].\n\n===Collage and modernism===\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], ''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'', 1919, collage of pasted papers, 90x144&nbsp;cm, Staatliche Museum, [[Berlin]].]]\nDespite the pre-twentieth-century use of collage-like application techniques, some art authorities argue that collage, properly speaking, did not emerge until after 1900, in conjunction with the early stages of modernism.\n\nFor example, the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online art glossary states that collage \"was first used as an artists' technique in the twentieth century.\".<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/c/collage \"Introduction to collage\"]. Tate Gallery website</ref> According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online art glossary, collage is an artistic concept associated with the beginnings of modernism, and entails much more than the idea of gluing something onto something else. The glued-on patches which Braque and Picasso added to their canvases offered a new perspective on painting when the patches \"collided with the surface plane of the painting.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |title=Guggenheimcollection.org |access-date=2008-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218074849/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/concept_Collage.html |archive-date=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In this perspective, collage was part of a methodical reexamination of the relation between painting and sculpture, and these new works \"gave each medium some of the characteristics of the other,\" according to the Guggenheim essay. Furthermore, these chopped-up bits of newspaper introduced fragments of externally referenced meaning into the collision: \"References to current events, such as the war in the Balkans, and to popular culture enriched the content of their art.\" This juxtaposition of signifiers, \"at once serious and tongue-in-cheek,\" was fundamental to the inspiration behind collage: \"Emphasizing concept and process over end product, collage has brought the incongruous into meaningful congress with the ordinary.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\n===Collage in painting===\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1913-14, Head (T\u00eate), cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1913-14, ''Head (T\u00eate)'', cut and pasted colored paper, gouache and charcoal on paperboard, 43.5 x 33 cm, [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]], Edinburgh]]\nCollage in the modernist sense began with [[Cubism|Cubist painters]] [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. According to some sources, Picasso was the first to use the collage technique in oil paintings. According to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article about collage, Braque took up the concept of collage itself before Picasso, applying it to charcoal drawings. Picasso adopted collage immediately after (and could be the first to use collage in paintings, as opposed to drawings):\n\n\"It was Braque who purchased a roll of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and began cutting out pieces of the paper and attaching them to his charcoal drawings. Picasso immediately began to make his own experiments in the new medium.\"<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/>\n\nIn 1912 for his ''Still Life with Chair Caning (Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e)'',<ref>''[http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm Nature-morte \u00e0 la chaise cann\u00e9e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305050539/http://www.musee-picasso.fr/pages/page_id18547_u1l2.htm |date=2005-03-05 }}'' - Mus\u00e9e National Picasso Paris</ref> Picasso pasted a patch of [[oilcloth]] with a chair-cane design onto the canvas of the piece.\n\n[[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artists have made extensive use of collage. [[Cubomania]] is a collage made by cutting an image into squares which are then reassembled [[surrealist automatism|automatically]] or at random. Collages produced using a similar, or perhaps identical, method are called ''[[surrealist techniques#\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements|etr\u00e9cissements]]'' by [[Marcel Mari\u00ebn]] from a method first explored by Mari\u00ebn. [[Surrealist techniques|Surrealist games]] such as ''parallel collage'' use collective techniques of collage making.\n\nThe [[Sidney Janis]] [[Art gallery|Gallery]] held an early [[Pop Art]] exhibit called the ''New Realist Exhibition'' in November 1962, which included works by the American artists [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], and [[Andy Warhol]]; and Europeans such as [[Arman]], Baj, [[Christo]], [[Yves Klein]], Festa, Rotella, [[Jean Tinguely]], and Schifano. It followed the [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] exhibition at the Galerie Rive Droite in [[Paris]], and marked the international debut of the artists who soon gave rise to what came to be called [[Pop Art]] in Britain and The United States and [[Nouveau R\u00e9alisme]] on the European continent. Many of these artists used collage techniques in their work.\nWesselmann took part in the ''New Realist'' show with some reservations,<ref>(cf. S. Stealingworth, 1980, p. 31)</ref> exhibiting two 1962 works: ''Still life #17'' and ''Still life #22''.\n\nAnother technique is that of ''canvas collage,'' which is the application, typically with glue, of separately painted [[canvas]] patches to the surface of a painting's main canvas. Well known for use of this technique is British artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]] in his [[paintings]] of the late 1970s, but canvas collage was already an integral part of the [[mixed media]] works of such American artists as [[Conrad Marca-Relli]] and [[Jane Frank]] by the early 1960s. The intensely self-critical [[Lee Krasner]] also frequently destroyed her own paintings by cutting them into pieces, only to create new works of art by reassembling the pieces into collages.\n\n===Collage with wood===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dove The Intellectual.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Arthur Dove]], ''The Intellectual'' (1925), collection: [[Museum of Modern Art]] NYC,<ref>[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A1602&page_number=5&template_id=1&sort_order=1 MoMA]</ref> part of a series of experimental collages.]] -->\n[[File:Jane Frank Plum Pt thumb.jpg|thumb|200px|What may be called '''wood collage''' is the dominant feature in this 1964 [[mixed media]] painting by [[Jane Frank]] (1918\u20131986)]] The '''wood collage''' is a type that emerged somewhat later than paper collage. [[Kurt Schwitters]] began experimenting with wood collages in the 1920s after already having given up painting for paper collages.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030518223503/http://www.kurt-schwitters.org/p,2650057,1.html Kurt-schwitters.org]</ref> The principle of wood collage is clearly established at least as early as his 'Merz Picture with Candle', dating from the mid to late 1920s.\n\nIn a sense, wood collage made its debut indirectly at the same time as paper collage, since according to the Guggenheim online, [[Georges Braque]] initiated use of paper collage by cutting out pieces of simulated oak-grain wallpaper and attaching them to his own charcoal drawings.<ref name=\"guggenheimcollection.org\"/> Thus, the idea of gluing wood to a picture was implicit from the start, since the paper used was a commercial product manufactured to look like wood.\n\nIt was during a fifteen-year period of intense experimentation beginning in the mid-1940s that [[Louise Nevelson]] evolved her [[sculpture|sculptural]] wood collages, assembled from found scraps, including parts of [[furniture]], pieces of wooden crates or barrels, and architectural remnants like stair railings or moldings. Generally rectangular, very large, and painted black, they resemble gigantic paintings. Concerning Nevelson's ''Sky Cathedral'' (1958), the [[Museum of Modern Art]] catalogue states, \"As a rectangular plane to be viewed from the front, ''Sky Cathedral'' has the pictorial quality of a painting...\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/louise-nevelson-sky-cathedral-1958/ |title=Louise Nevelson, Sky Cathedral 1958  |publisher=[[The Museum of Modern Art]] |access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/81006 |title=Sky Cathedral |work=MoMA Highlights |location=New York |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}, revised 2004, originally published 1999, p. 222</ref> Yet such pieces also present themselves as massive walls or monoliths, which can sometimes be viewed from either side, or even looked ''through''.\n\nMuch wood collage art is considerably smaller in scale, framed and hung as a [[painting]] would be. It usually features pieces of wood, wood shavings, or scraps, assembled on a canvas (if there is painting involved), or on a wooden board. Such framed, picture-like, wood-[[relief]] collages offer the artist an opportunity to explore the qualities of depth, natural color, and [[texture (visual arts)|textural]] variety inherent in the material, while drawing on and taking advantage of the language, conventions, and historical resonances that arise from the tradition of creating pictures to hang on walls. The technique of wood collage is also sometimes combined with painting and other media in a single work of art.\n\nFrequently, what is called \"wood collage art\" uses only natural wood - such as [[driftwood]], or parts of found and unaltered logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This raises the question of whether such artwork is collage (in the original sense) at all (see [[Collage#Collage and modernism|Collage and modernism]]). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable \"[[sign (semiotics)|signifier]]s\" (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of [[semiotic]] collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase [[newel]] used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. ([[Driftwood]] is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.)\n\n===Decoupage===\n[[File:Blue Nudes Henri Matisse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Blue Nude II]],'' 1952, [[gouache]] [[decoupage|d\u00e9coup\u00e9e]], [[Pompidou Centre]], Paris]]\n{{Main|Decoupage}}\nDecoupage is a type of collage usually defined as a [[craft]]. It is the process of placing a picture into an object for [[beauty|decoration]]. Decoupage can involve adding multiple copies of the same image, cut and layered to add apparent depth. The picture is often coated with varnish or some other sealant for protection.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, decoupage, like many other art methods, began experimenting with a less realistic and more abstract style. 20th-century artists who produced decoupage works include [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. The most famous decoupage work is Matisse's [[Blue Nude II]].\n\nThere are many varieties on the traditional technique involving purpose made 'glue' requiring fewer layers (often 5 or 20, depending on the amount of paper involved). Cutouts are also applied under glass or raised to give a three-dimensional appearance according to the desire of the [[decouper]]. Currently decoupage is a popular [[handicraft]].\n\nThe craft became known as d\u00e9coupage in [[France]] (from the verb ''d\u00e9couper'', 'to cut out') as it attained great popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many advanced techniques were developed during this time, and items could take up to a year to complete due to the many coats and sandings applied. Some famous or aristocratic practitioners included [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Madame de Pompadour]], and [[Beau Brummell]]. In fact the majority of decoupage enthusiasts attribute the beginning of decoupage to 17th century [[Venice]]. However it was known before this time in [[Asia]].\n\nThe most likely origin of decoupage is thought to be [[East Siberia]]n [[funerary art]]. [[Nomad]]ic tribes would use cut out felts to decorate the tombs of their deceased. From Siberia, the practice came to [[China]], and by the 12th century, cut out paper was being used to decorate lanterns, windows, boxes and other objects. In the 17th century, [[Italy]], especially in [[Venice]], was at the forefront of trade with the [[Far East]] and it is generally thought that it is through these trade links that the cut out [[paper]] decorations made their way into [[Europe]].\n\n===Photomontage===\n{{Main|Photomontage}}\nCollage made from photographs, or parts of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a composite photograph by cutting and joining a number of other photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as ''compositing''.\n[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], '' [[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' 1956, collage, (one of the earliest works to be considered [[Pop Art]])]]\n\n''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the ''[[This Is Tomorrow]]'' exhibition in [[London]], [[England]] in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit.<ref name=tomorrow>[http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm \"This is tomorrow\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115063217/http://www.thisistomorrow2.com/images/cat_1956/cat_web/FrameSet.htm |date=2010-01-15 }}, thisistomorrow2.com (scroll to \"image 027TT-1956.jpg\"). Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref> Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.<ref>[http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm \"Just what is it\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121114450/http://www.pchelm.com/computage/just_what_is_it.htm |date=2008-11-21 }}, pchelm.com. Retrieved 27 August 2008.</ref>\n\nOther methods for combining pictures are also called photomontage, such as Victorian \"combination printing\", the printing from more than one negative on a single piece of printing paper (e.g. [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander|O. G. Rejlander]], 1857), front-projection and computer montage techniques. Much as a collage is composed of multiple facets, artists also combine montage techniques. [[Romare Bearden]]\u2019s (1912\u20131988) series of black and white \"photomontage projections\" is an example. His method began with compositions of paper, paint, and photographs put on boards 8\u00bd \u00d7 11&nbsp;inches. Bearden fixed the imagery with an emulsion that he then applied with handroller. Subsequently, he enlarged the collages photographically.\n\nThe 19th century tradition of physically joining multiple images into a composite and photographing the results prevailed in press photography and [[offset lithography]] until the widespread use of [[digital image editing]]. Contemporary photo editors in magazines now create \"paste-ups\" digitally.\n\nCreating a photomontage has, for the most part, become easier with the advent of computer software such as [[Adobe Photoshop]], Pixel image editor, and [[GIMP]]. These programs make the changes digitally, allowing for faster workflow and more precise results. They also mitigate mistakes by allowing the artist to \"undo\" errors. Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts. The current trend is to create pictures that combine painting, theatre, illustration and graphics in a seamless photographic whole.\n\n===Digital collage===\nDigital collage is the technique of using [[computer]] tools in collage creation to encourage [[Randomness|chance]] associations of disparate visual elements and the subsequent transformation of the visual results through the use of [[electronic media]]. It is commonly used in the creation of [[digital art]].\n\n===Three-dimensional collage===\nA 3D collage is the art of putting altogether three-dimensional objects such as rocks, beads, buttons, coins, or even soil to form a new whole or a new object. Examples can include houses, bead circles, etc.\n\n===Mosaic===\nIt is the art of putting together or assembling of small pieces of paper, tiles, marble, stones, etc. They are often found in cathedrals, churches, temples as a spiritual significance of interior design. Small pieces, normally roughly quadratic, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture.\n\n===eCollage===\nThe term \"eCollage\" (electronic Collage) can be used for a collage created by using computer tools.\n\n===Collage artists===\n<!--NOTE: Please add only existing articles about collage artists.

Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of [[Modernism]] and saw collage with its [[non-linear]] notion of history as a means to reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to get a sense of how better to operate. Rowe was a member of the so-called [[The Texas Rangers (architects)|Texas Rangers]], a group of [[architect]]s who taught at the [[University of Texas]] for a while. Another member of that group was [[Bernhard Hoesli]], a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the [[ETH]]-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a [[metaphor]] than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.\n\n===In music===\n[[File:Blake, On the Balcony.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], ''On the Balcony'', 1955\u20131957, collage, [[mixed-media]], [[Tate Gallery]]]]\n{{Main|Sound collage}}\nThe concept of collage has crossed the boundaries of visual arts. In [[music]], with the advances on recording technology, [[Avant-garde#Avant-garde artists|avant-garde artists]] started experimenting with cutting and pasting since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[George Martin]] created collages of recordings while producing the records of [[The Beatles]]. In 1967 [[pop art]]ist [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] made the collage for the cover of the Beatles seminal album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. In the 1970s and 1980s, the likes of [[Christian Marclay]] and the group [[Negativland]] reappropriated old audio in new ways. By the 1990s and 2000s, with the popularity of the [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], it became apparent that \"[[sound collage|musical collages]]\" had become the norm for [[popular music]], especially in [[rapping|rap]], [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[electronic music]].<ref name=\"timemagazine\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973092,00.html |title=Play It Again, Sampler |author=Guy Garcia |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |date=June 1991 |accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> In 1996, [[DJ Shadow]] released the groundbreaking album, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', made entirely of preexisting recorded material mixed together in audible collage. In the same year, New York City based artist, writer, and musician, Paul D. Miller aka [[DJ Spooky]]'s work pushed the work of sampling into a museum and gallery context as an art practice that combined DJ culture's obsession with archival materials as sound sources on his album ''Songs of a Dead Dreamer'' and in his books ''[http://www.rhythmscience.com Rhythm Science]'' (2004) and ''[http://www.soundunbound.com Sound Unbound]'' (2008) (MIT Press). In his books, \"mash-up\" and collage based mixes of authors, artists, and musicians such as [[Antonin Artaud]], [[James Joyce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], and [[Raymond Scott]] were featured as part of a what he called \"literature of sound.\" In 2000, [[The Avalanches]] released ''[[Since I Left You]]'', a musical collage consisting of approximately 3,500 musical sources (i.e., samples).<ref name=\"soundonsound\">{{cite news |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |title=The Avalanches |author=Mark Pytlik |publisher=[[Sound on Sound]] |date=November 2006 |accessdate=2007-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206122054/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov02/articles/avalanches.asp?print=yes |archive-date=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===In illustration===\nCollage is commonly used as a technique in [[Picture book|Children's picture book]] [[illustration]]. [[Eric Carle]] is a prominent example, using vividly colored hand-textured papers cut to shape and layered together, sometimes embellished with crayon or other marks. See image at [[The Very Hungry Caterpillar]].\n\n===In artist's books===\n\nCollage is sometimes used alone or in combination with other techniques in [[artists' books]], especially in [[one-off]] unique books rather than as reproduced images in published books.<ref>https://wp.vcu.edu/librarystories/2016/11/03/humphrey-gives-back-by-documenting-book-arts-and-richmond-arts-on-wikipedia/</ref>\n\n===In literature===\n[[Collage novel]]s are books with images selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative.\n\nThe [[bible]] of [[discordianism]], the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', is described by its author as a literary collage. A collage in literary terms may also refer to a layering of ideas or images.\n\n===In fashion design===\nCollage is utilized in [[fashion design]] in the sketching process, as part of mixed media illustrations, where drawings together with diverse materials such as paper, photographs, yarns or fabric bring ideas into designs.\n\n===In film===\n{{main|Collage film}}\nCollage film is traditionally defined as, \u201cA film that juxtaposes fictional scenes with footage taken from disparate sources, such as newsreels.\u201d Combining [[Found footage (appropriation)|different types of footage]] can have various implications depending on the director\u2019s approach.  Collage film can also refer to the physical collaging of materials onto filmstrips. Canadian Film maker, [[Arthur Lipsett]], was especially renown for his collage films, many of which were made from the cutting room floors of the National Film Board studios.\n\n====In post-production====\nThe use of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], or ''computer-generated imagery'', can be considered a form of collage, especially when animated graphics are layered over traditional film footage.  At certain moments during ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (Jean-Pierre Juenet, 2001), the [[mise en sc\u00e8ne]] takes on a highly fantasized style, including fictitious elements like swirling tunnels of color and light.  David O. Russel\u2019s ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' (2004) incorporates CGI effects to visually demonstrate philosophical theories explained by the existential detectives (played by [[Lily Tomlin]] and [[Dustin Hoffman]]).  In this case, the effects serve to enhance clarity, while adding a surreal aspect to an otherwise realistic film.\n\n==Legal issues==\nWhen collage uses existing works, the result is what some [[copyright]] [[scholar]]s call a ''[[derivative work]]''. The collage thus has a copyright separate from any copyrights pertaining to the original incorporated works.\n\nDue to redefined and reinterpreted copyright laws, and increased financial interests, some forms of collage art are significantly restricted. For example, in the area of [[sound collage]] (such as [[hip hop music]]), some court rulings effectively have eliminated the [[de minimis]] doctrine as a defense to [[copyright infringement]], thus shifting collage practice away from non-permissive uses relying on [[fair use]] or [[de minimis]] protections, and toward [[licensing]].<ref>See ''Bridgeport Music'', 6th Cir.</ref> Examples of musical collage art that have run afoul of modern copyright are ''[[The Grey Album]]'' and [[Negativland]]'s ''U2''.\n\nThe copyright status of visual works is less troubled, although still ambiguous. For instance, some visual collage artists have argued that the [[first-sale doctrine]] protects their work. The first-sale doctrine prevents copyright holders from controlling consumptive uses after the \"first sale\" of their work, although the [[Ninth Circuit]] has held that the first-sale doctrine does not apply to [[derivative works]].<ref>''Mirage Editions, Inc. v. Albuquerque A.R.T. Co.'', 856 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1989)</ref> The [[de minimis]] doctrine and the [[fair use]] exception also provide important defenses against claimed copyright infringement.<ref>See the [http://fairusenetwork.org/ Fair Use Network] for further explanations.</ref> The [[Second Circuit]] in October, 2006, held that artist [[Jeff Koons]] was not liable for copyright infringement because his incorporation of a photograph into a collage painting was fair use.<ref>''Blanch v. Koons'', -- F.3d --, 2006 WL 3040666 (2d Cir.

{"title_page": "Political status of Taiwan", "text_new": "{{Short description|Sovereignty debate}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Politics of Taiwan}}\n\nThe controversy regarding the '''political status of Taiwan''', sometimes referred to as the '''Taiwan Issue''' or '''Taiwan Strait Issue''', or from a Taiwanese perspective as the '''Mainland Issue''', is a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the subsequent split of China into the two present-day self-governing entities of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC; commonly known as \"China\") and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC; commonly known as \"Taiwan\").\n\nThe issue hinges on whether the islands of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] should remain the territory of the ROC as an effectively separate self-governing entity; become [[Chinese unification|unified]] with the PRC under the existing communist government; convert the ROC to a new \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\"; or unite with the mainland under the ROC government (after the dissolution of the PRC government).\n\nThis controversy also concerns whether the existence and legal status as a [[sovereign state]] of both the ROC and the PRC is [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] as a matter of [[international law]].\n\n[[Free Area of the Republic of China|Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and some other minor islands]] effectively make up the jurisdiction of the [[state (polity)|state]] with the official name of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]] but commonly known as \"[[Taiwan]]\".  The ROC, which took control of Taiwan (including Penghu and other nearby islands) in 1945, ruled [[mainland China]] and claimed sovereignty over [[Outer Mongolia]] (now [[Mongolia]]) and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] (part of which is present day [[Tuva]], Russia) before losing the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and relocating its government and [[capital city]] from [[Nanjing]] ([[Chinese postal romanization|alternately spelled]] as \"Nanking\") to [[Taipei]] as [[temporary capital]] in December 1949. The CPC established new government on the mainland as [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in October 1949.\n\nSince the ROC [[China and the United Nations|lost its United Nations seat]] as \"China\" in 1971 ([[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced]] by the PRC), most sovereign states have switched their diplomatic recognition to the PRC, recognizing the PRC as the representative of all China, though the majority of countries avoid clarifying what territories are meant by \"China\" in order to associate with both the PRC and ROC.  {{Numrec|ROC|asof=S|alt2=the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]],<ref name=NewsMalawi>{{cite news | title= Taiwan breaks ties with Malawi | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200801141806.htm|date=14 January 2008 | newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> although informal relations are maintained with nearly all others. Agencies of foreign governments such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] operate as ''de facto'' embassies of their home countries in Taiwan, and Taiwan operates similar ''de facto'' embassies and consulates in most countries under such names as \"Taipei Representative Office\" (TRO) or \"Taipei Economic and Cultural (Representative) Office\" (TECO). In certain contexts, Taiwan is also referred to as [[Chinese Taipei]].\n\nThe ROC government has in the past actively pursued the claim as the sole legitimate government over mainland China and Taiwan. This position began to change in the early 1990s as democracy was introduced and new Taiwanese leaders were elected, changing to one that does not actively challenge the legitimacy of PRC rule over mainland China.  Both the PRC and the ROC carry out [[Cross-Strait relations]] through specialized agencies (such as the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC), rather than through foreign ministries. Different groups have different concepts of what the current formal political situation of Taiwan is. (''See also: [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]], [[Taiwan independence]], and [[Cross-Strait relations]]'')\n\nIn addition, the situation can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]].  The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the perspective of the status quo: to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear and can be confusing given the fact that the People's Republic of China has never controlled Taiwan and the Republic of China still exists, albeit on a decreased scale.\n\nThe status quo is accepted in large part because it does not define the legal or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret the situation in a way that is politically acceptable to its members.  At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what the status quo is, leading to the possibility of war through [[brinkmanship]] or miscalculation. The People's Republic Of China seeks to end Taiwan's de facto independence through the process of reunification. If Taiwan refuses this process, The People's Republic of China is prepared to use force through military means, in order to achieve unification.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FP_20190226_taiwan_bush_hass.pdf\n</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|History of Taiwan}}\n\nTaiwan (excluding [[Penghu]])Taiwan is a country taiwan is a country\n was first populated by [[Austronesian people]] and was colonized by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had arrived in 1623. The [[Kingdom of Tungning]], lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first [[Han Chinese]] government to rule [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. From 1683, the [[Qing Dynasty]] ruled [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] as a [[prefecture]] and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate [[Chinese province]] to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Taiwan and [[Penghu]] were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of [[World War II]], putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after [[History of Taiwan#Japanese rule|50 years of Japanese rule]]. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]], [[Potsdam Declaration]], and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]], but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of [[mainland China]] and in the [[South China Sea]]. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was established in mainland China on 1 October 1949, claiming to be the [[succession of states theory|successor]] to the ROC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&m_id=4 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |accessdate=2 August 2008 |publisher=Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |date=21 February 2000}}</ref>\n\n[[Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[Wuchiu]] on the coast of [[Fujian|Fukien]], [[Taiping (island)|Taiping]] and [[Pratas]] in the [[South China Sea]], are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan. Some arguments supporting the independence of Taiwan do not apply to these islands.\n\n=== Cession, retrocession, legal status, and self-determination of Taiwan ===\n[[File:\"Japan\" with inset map \"Formosa and Riu-Kiu Islands\" from A Literary and Historical Atlas of Asia, by J.G. Bartholomew. J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd. 1912.jpg|thumb|right|230px|According to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] Taiwan was part of Japan at the establishment of the ROC in 1912. The PRC (founded 1 October 1949) argues that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was never valid, saying it was one of several [[unequal treaties]] forced upon the Qing.]]\n{{Anchor|Cession and retrocession|Cession and Retrocession|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination of Taiwan|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination of Taiwan}}China, during the [[Qing Dynasty]], ceded the island of Taiwan, including [[Penghu]], to Japan \"in perpetuity\" at the end of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895)|First Sino-Japanese War]] by signing the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. In the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] of 1943, the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\", specifically listing \"Formosa\" and Penghu, to the Republic of China after the defeat of Japan. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the [[Instrument of Surrender of Japan]] in 1945. The PRC's UN Ambassador, [[Wang Yingfan]], has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\" and \"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 [[Potsdam Declaration]] have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of [[international law]].\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty (San Francisco Peace Treaty) transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. Also, according to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, China legally surrendered its sovereignty and jurisdiction over Taiwan (Formosa) forever. So, this treaty therefore renders Japan's declaration of the returning of sovereignty over Taiwan to China as well as the PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan's claims regarding China's right to sovereignty over Taiwan, as legally extraneous and unsubstantiated. The US and UK governments also hold that the Cairo Declaration made in 1943 is just a war-time statement of intention and cannot itself transfer the sovereignty of Taiwan from Japan to China.\n\nThe ROC argues that the [[Treaty of Taipei]] implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum.<ref>{{citation |last=Starr |first=Robert I. |title=Legal Status of Taiwan |date=13 July 1971 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/starr.htm |accessdate=26 December 2009 | publisher= US State Dept.}}; reprinted as Appendix C of {{cite book |editor-last=Tkacik |editor-first=John J. |title=Rethinking One China |publisher=Heritage Foundation |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780891952701|date=30 October 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==== Legal status dispute under international law ====\n{{Anchor|Legal status dispute under international law|International law|Dispute under international law}}On the other hand, a number of supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] argue that Taiwan was only formally incorporated as a Chinese territory under the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1683, and as a province in 1885. Subsequently, because of the Shimonoseki Treaty of 1895, Taiwan had been ''[[de jure]]'' part of Japan when the ROC was established in 1912 and thus was not part of the Chinese republic. Also, because the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Declaration]] was an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9, the independence advocates argue that the legal effectiveness of the Declaration is highly questionable. Furthermore, they point out that the Instrument of Surrender of Japan was no more than an [[armistice]], a \"[[modus vivendi]]\" in nature, which served as a temporary or provisional agreement that would be replaced with a [[peace treaty]].  Therefore, only a military occupation of Taiwan began on 25 October 1945, and both the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and [[Treaty of Taipei]] hold legal supremacy over the surrender instrument. These treaties did not transfer the title of Taiwan from Japan to China. According to this argument, the sovereignty of Taiwan was returned to the people of Taiwan when Japan renounced sovereignty of Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco (also known as [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], SFPT) in 1951, based on the policy of [[self-determination]] which has been applied to \"territories which detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War\" as defined by article 76b and 77b of the [[United Nations Charter]] and also by the protocol of the [[Yalta Conference]].  The United Nations General Assembly has not been particularly receptive to this argument, and the ROC's applications for admission to the United Nations have been rejected 15 times.<ref>{{cite web |title=UN again rejects Taiwan allies' letter on UN bid |date=2008-04-02 |url=http://www.taiwanembassy.org/UK/ct.asp?xItem=57422&ctNode=3244&mp=132&nowPage=1&pagesize=15 |agency=Central News Agency |publisher=Taipei Representative Office in the UK |accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the interpretation of the peace treaties was used to challenge the legitimacy of the ROC on Taiwan before the 1990s, the introduction of popular elections in Taiwan has compromised this position. Except for the most extreme Taiwan independence supporters, most Taiwanese support the [[popular sovereignty]] theory and no longer see much conflict between this theory of sovereignty and the ROC position. In this sense, the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC which accepted Japanese surrender because the ruling authorities were given [[Mandate (politics)|popular mandate]] by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other is the Taiwanese constituencies. In fact, former president [[Chen Shui-bian]] has been frequently emphasizing the popular sovereignty theory in his speeches.\n\n[[File:The Taiwan State.jpg|thumb|300px|A shopping bag produced by an independence-leaning pastry establishment. The address uses \"State of Taiwan, Taipei County\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u570b\u53f0\u5317\u7e23}}) rather than \"Taiwan Province\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u7701}}) or \"Republic of China\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b}})]]\n\nHowever, as of 2010, the conflict between these two theories still plays a role in internal Taiwanese politics. The popular sovereignty theory, which the [[pan-green coalition]] emphasizes, suggests that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes by means of a popular referendum. The ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[pan-blue coalition]], suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.\n\n== Historical overview ==\n\n=== 1895&ndash;1945&ndash; Japanese rule ===\n[[File:China old map.jpg|thumb|right|A ROC Map, printed in 1926, which showed Taiwan as part of Japan.]]\n\n==== Treaty of Shimonoseki ====\n\n[[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (Formosa) including the [[Pescadores]] were permanently ceded by [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]] to [[Imperial Japan]] via Articles 2b and 2c of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] on 8 May 1895 in one of what the Chinese term as an [[unequal treaty]]. [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] on the coast of [[Fujian#Quemoy and Matsu|Fukien]], and the [[South China Sea Islands|islands in the South China Sea]] currently administered by the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan were not part of the cession.\n\nIn 1895, subsequent to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], officials in Taiwan declared independence in the hope of returning the island to Qing rule. The [[Republic of Taiwan (1895)]] collapsed after 12 days due to political infighting, but local leaders continued resistance in the hope of achieving self-rule. The incoming Japanese crushed the island's independence bid in a five-month campaign.\n\nThe [[China|Chinese]] [[Qing Dynasty]] was subsequently overthrown and replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC). Upon the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the ROC declared the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] void in its declaration of war on Japan. The war soon merged with [[World War II]], and Japan was subsequently defeated in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], of which the ROC was a part.\n\n==== Potsdam Declaration and surrender of Japan ====\nThe United States entered the War in December 1941. Most military attacks against Japanese installations and Japanese troops in Taiwan were conducted by [[United States]] military forces. At the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]], the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], and the ROC agreed that Taiwan was to be restored to the ROC after the war. This agreement was enunciated in the Cairo Declaration and the [[Potsdam Declaration]], which outlined the terms of Japanese surrender, specified that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.\n\nWhen [[Japan]] unconditionally surrendered, it accepted in its [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.  Japanese troops in Taiwan were directed to surrender to the representatives of the Supreme Allied Commander in the China Theater, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (i.e. the Republic of China military forces) on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], according to the directions of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], head of the United States Military Government, in [[General Order No. 1]], which was issued 2 September 1945. Chief Executive [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] of [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] soon proclaimed \"Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]]\" on 25 October 1945.\n\n=== 1945&ndash;Today &ndash; post-World War II status ===\n\n==== 1947 &ndash; 228 Incident ====\n\nWhen the [[228 Incident]] erupted on 28 February 1947, the U.S. Consulate-General in [[Taipei]] prepared a report in early March, calling for an immediate intervention in the name of the U.S. or the [[United Nations]]. Based on the argument that the Japanese surrender did not formally transfer sovereignty, Taiwan was still legally part of Japan and occupied by the United States (with administrative authority for the occupation delegated to the Chinese Nationalists), and a direct intervention was appropriate for a territory with such status. This proposed intervention, however, was rejected by the [[U.S. State Department]]. In a news report on the aftermath of the ''228 Incident'', some Taiwanese residents were reported to be talking of appealing to the United Nations to put the island under an international mandate, since China's possession of Taiwan had not been formalized by any international treaties by that time and the island was therefore still under belligerent occupation.<ref name=NYT033047>{{cite news |title=FORMOSANS' PLEA FOR RED AID SEEN; Harsh Repression of Revolt Is Expected to Increase Efforts to Escape Rule by China |last=Durdin |first=Tillman |date=30 March 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F1EF63B5F1A7A93C2AA1788D85F438485F9 |accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306103355/http://228.lomaji.com/news/033047.html-->\nThey later made a demand for a treaty role to be represented at the forthcoming peace conference on Japan, in the hope of requesting a [[plebiscite]] to determine the island's political future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Formosans Ask Treaty Role |date=5 October 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5061FFF395E17738DDDAC0894D8415B8788F1D3 |accessdate=2007-10-06 }}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306142800/http://228.lomaji.com/news/100547.html-->\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-partisan Taiwanese political candidate Wu San-lian (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first [[Taipei city]] mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters.

In June 1950, President Truman, who had previously given only passive support to Chiang Kai-shek and was prepared to see Taiwan fall into the hands of the [[Chinese Communists]], vowed to stop the spread of communism and sent the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent the PRC from attacking Taiwan, but also to prevent the ROC from attacking mainland China. He then declared that \"the determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.\"<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=800\n|title=Statement by the President on the Situation in Korea\n|date=27 June 1950\n|publisher=Truman library\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>   President Truman later reaffirmed the position \"that all questions affecting Formosa be settled by peaceful means as envisaged in the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]\" in his special message to the Congress in July 1950.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=822\n|title=Special Message to the Congress Reporting on the Situation in Korea\n|date=19 July 1950\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> The PRC denounced his moves as flagrant interference in the internal affairs of China.\n\nOn 8 September 1950, President Truman ordered [[John Foster Dulles]], then Foreign Policy Advisor to the [[U.S. Secretary of State]], to carry out his decision on \"neutralizing\" Taiwan in drafting the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] ([[San Francisco]] Peace Treaty) of 1951. According to [[George H. Kerr]]'s memoir ''[[Formosa Betrayed (1965 book)|Formosa Betrayed]]'', Dulles devised a plan whereby Japan would first merely renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan without a recipient country to allow the sovereignty over Taiwan to be determined together by the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Soviet Union]], and Republic of China on behalf of other nations on the peace treaty. The question of Taiwan would be taken into the United Nations (which the ROC was [[China and the United Nations|still part]]), if these four parties could not reach into an agreement within one year.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco) ====\n\nWhen Japan regained sovereignty over itself in 1952 with the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] (San Francisco Peace Treaty) with 48 nations, Japan renounced all claims and title over Taiwan and the Pescadores. Many claim that Japanese sovereignty only terminated at that point.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mandate for Change 1953\u20131956 |publisher=Doubleday & Co., New York |last=Eisenhower |first=Dwight D. |page=461 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/eisenhower.htm |oclc=2551357 |date=1963 |quote=The Japanese peace treaty of 1951 ended Japanese sovereignty over the islands but did not formally cede them to \"China,\" either Communist or Nationalist. |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> Notably absent at the peace conference was the ROC which was expelled from [[mainland China]] in December 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and had retreated to Taiwan. The PRC, which was proclaimed 1 October 1949, was also not invited. The lack of invitation was probably due to the dispute over which government was the legitimate government of China (which both governments claimed to be); however, [[Cold War]] considerations might have played a part as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some major governments represented in the San Francisco Conference, such as the UK and Soviet Union, had already established relations with the PRC, while others, such as the U.S. and Japan, still held relations with the ROC.\n\nThe UK at that time stated for the record that the San Francisco Peace Treaty \"itself does not determine the future of these islands,\" and therefore the UK, along with [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], was happy to sign the peace treaty.<ref name=taipeitimes20070930>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/09/30/2003381074\n|title=John Tkacik on Taiwan: Taiwan's status remains 'unsettled'\n|date=30 September 2007\n|author=John Tkacik\n|publisher=Taipei Times\n|page=8}}</ref>  One of the major reasons that the delegate from the Soviet Union gave for not signing the treaty was that: \"The draft contains only a reference to the renunciation by Japan of its rights to these territories [Taiwan] but intentionally omits any mention of the further fate of these territories.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\nArticle 25 of this treaty officially stipulated that only the Allied Powers defined in the treaty could benefit from this treaty. China was not listed as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]; however, article 21 still provided limited benefits from Articles 10 and 14(a)2 for China. Japan's cession of Taiwan is unusual in that no recipient of Taiwan was stated as part of Dulles's plan of \"neutralizing\" Taiwan. The ROC protested its lack of invitation to the San Francisco Peace conference, to no avail.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Taipei ====\n\nSubsequently, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was concluded between the ROC and Japan on 28 April 1952 (effective 5 August), where Japan basically re-affirmed the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and formalized the peace between the ROC and Japan. It also nullified all previous treaties made between China and Japan.  Article 10 of the treaty specifies:<blockquote>\"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be [[deem (law)|deemed]] to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).\"</blockquote> However, the ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs George Kung-ch'ao Yeh told the Legislative Yuan after signing the treaty that: \"The delicate international situation makes it that they [Taiwan and Penghu] do not belong to us. Under present circumstances, Japan has no right to transfer [Taiwan] to us; nor can we accept such a transfer from Japan even if she so wishes.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 /> In July 1971 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s position was, and remains: \"As Taiwan and the Pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition, sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\n== Question of sovereignty over Taiwan ==\n\n=== Position of the People's Republic of China (PRC) ===\n[[File:Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents (front).jpg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|[[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]].

The PRC points out the fact that the [[Montevideo Convention]] was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the United Nations as well as UN Resolutions should supersede the [[Montevideo Convention]]. However, \"When speaking of statehood, one invariably refers to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States,60 which, laying down what is now considered a rule of customary international law, states that \"[t] he State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other States.\"61 Taiwan indeed satisfies all these criteria for statehood.\"<ref>[https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/chnint8&i=461 Chan, Phil C.

The PRC government considers the 1992 consensus a temporary measure to set aside sovereignty disputes and to enable talks.\n\nThe PRC government considers perceived violations of its \"One-China policy\" or inconsistencies with it such as supplying the ROC with arms a violation of its rights to [[territorial integrity]].<ref name=\"pdaily041010\">{{cite news |url = http://english.people.com.cn/200410/10/eng20041010_159539.html |title = China expresses strong indignation for \"US-Taiwan defense conference\": FM spokesman |newspaper=[[People's Daily]] |date = 10 October 2004 }}</ref> International news organizations often report that \"China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be united with the mainland by force if necessary\", even though the PRC does not explicitly say that Taiwan is a \"renegade province\" in any press releases.

However, to make such an argument, one has to reject the PRC's claim of sovereignty over the territory of the [[Taiwan island]], a claim that the PRC has forced all other states to accept as a condition to establish [[diplomatic relations]] with it, as well as severing said relations with the ROC.

It was only in the mid-1930s when both the CCP and KMT realised the future strategic importance of Taiwan that they altered their party positions to make a claim on Taiwan as a part of China. After losing the Civil War against the Communist Party in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, and continued to maintain that their government represented all of China, i.e. both Taiwan and the mainland.\n\nThe position of most supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] is that the PRC is the government of \"China\" and that Taiwan is not part of China, defining \"China\" as only including Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Regarding the ROC, one ideology within Taiwan independence regards the ROC as already an independent, sovereign state, and seeks to amend the ROC's existing name, constitution, and existing framework to reflect the loss of ROC's mainland territory, and transform ROC into a Taiwan state; while another ideology of Taiwan independence regards the ROC as both a military government that has been administering the Taiwan island as a result of post-war [[military occupation]] on behalf of the [[allies of World War II]] since 1945, and a Chinese refugee regime currently in exile on Taiwan since 1949, and seeks to eliminate the ROC and establish a new independent Taiwan state.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party states that Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that the PRC does not exercise any hold over the 23 million Taiwanese on the island. On the other hand, the position of most [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] supporters is that the [[Chinese Civil War]] is still not over since no peace agreement has ever been signed, and that the current status is a state of [[ceasefire]] between two [[belligerents]] of \"[[One China]]\". Therefore, the current political separation across the Taiwan strait is only temporary and a reunified China including both mainland China and Taiwan will be the result.\n\nThe position of the [[Republic of China]] has been that it is a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereign state. \"Republic of China,\" according to the ROC government's definition, extended to both [[mainland China]] (Including [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) and the island of Taiwan.<ref name=mac>{{cite press release | publisher = Mainland Affairs Council, ROC Executive Yuan |date= 29 March 2005 | title = The Official Position of the Republic of China (Taiwan) on China's Passing of the Anti-secession (Anti-Separation) Law|url =http://www.mac.gov.tw/english/english/anti/mofa940329e.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] unofficially claimed that the government would no longer challenge the rule of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists in mainland China]], the ROC government under [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) rule actively maintained that it was the sole legitimate government of China.  The Courts in Taiwan have never accepted President Lee's statement, primarily due to the reason that the (now defunct) [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] never officially changed the acclaimed national borders. Notably, the People's Republic of China claims that changing the national borders would be \"a precursor to Taiwan independence\".  The task of changing the national borders now requires a constitutional amendment passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] and ratified by a majority of all eligible ROC voters, which the PRC has implied would constitute grounds for military attack.\n\n[[File:Exit and Entry Permit of Republic of China (Taiwan).jpg|thumb|Exit and Entry Permit Taiwan, Republic of China. This permit is issued by the Republic of China to enable residents of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to travel to Taiwan. The Republic of China refuses to accept [[People's Republic of China passport]]s.]]\nOn the other hand, though the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] promulgated in 1946 does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of the constitution of 1925 did individually list the provinces of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]] was not among them, since Taiwan was arguably ''de jure'' part of Japan as the result of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that \"the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], it cannot be altered.\" However, in 1946, [[Sun Fo]], son of [[Sun Yat-Sen]] and the minister of the [[Executive Yuan]] of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that \"there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the independence of [[Mongolia]], and the second example would be the reclamation of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. Both would be examples of territory changes.\" Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951 and the [[Treaty of Taipei]] of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the [[General Order No. 1]] (1945) to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution. The explanatory memorandum to the constitution explained the omission of individually listing the provinces as opposed to the earlier drafts was an act of deliberate ambiguity: as the ROC government does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, based on Chiang Kai-shek's [[Denunciation]] of the treaty in the late 1930s, hence (according to this argument) the sovereignty of Taiwan was never disposed by China. A ratification by the ROC National Assembly is therefore unnecessary.\n\nThe [[s:Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]] have mentioned \"Taiwan Province,\" and the now defunct National Assembly passed constitutional amendments that give the people of the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]\", comprising the territories under its current jurisdiction, the sole right, until reunification, to exercise the sovereignty of the Republic through elections<ref name=mac /><ref>{{cite news |title= Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref> of the President and the entire Legislature as well as through elections to ratify amendments to the ROC constitution. Also, Chapter I, Article 2 of the ROC constitution states that \"The sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens.\" This suggests that the constitution implicitly admits that the sovereignty of the ROC is limited to the areas that it controls even if there is no constitutional amendment that explicitly spells out the ROC's borders.\n\n[[File:Taiwan the Province Government Building.JPG|thumb|The building of the Provincial Government of the Taiwan Province of the Republic of China at Jhongsing Village]]\n[[File:Presidential Office Taipei.jpg|thumb|The Republic of China Presidential Office Building is located in the Zhongzheng District of [[Taipei]].]]\n\nIn 1999, ROC President [[Lee Teng-hui]] proposed a [[Special state-to-state relations|two-state theory]] (\u5169\u570b\u8ad6) in which both the [[Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China would acknowledge that they are two separate countries with a special diplomatic, cultural and historic relationship.<ref name=2states_1>{{cite news | first=Sanya | last=Bunnag | title=Understanding Taiwan's tactics |date=20 July 1999 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/399381.stm }}</ref><ref name = 2000vote>{{cite journal | author=Willem van Kemenade | title=Taiwan, Voting for Trouble? | journal=The Washington Quarterly | year=2000 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=135\u2013151 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v023/23.2kemenade.html | doi=10.1162/016366000560809 }}</ref> This however drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting [[Taiwan independence]].<ref name=2states_2>{{cite news | title=Beijing media ups the ante |date=20 July 1999|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/399350.stm }}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Chen Shui-bian]] (2000 \u2013 May 2008) fully supported the idea that the \"[[Republic of China]] is an independent, sovereign country\" but held the view that the Republic of China is Taiwan and Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China. This is suggested in his [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]. Due to the necessity of avoiding war with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] however, President Chen had refrained from formally declaring Taiwan's independence. Government publications have implied that Taiwan refers to the ROC, and \"China\" refers to the PRC.<ref name=mac /> After becoming chairman of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in July 2002, Chen appeared to move further than Lee's special two-state theory and in early August 2002, by putting forward the \"[[one country on each side]]\" concept, he stated that Taiwan may \"go on its own Taiwanese road\" and that \"it is clear that the two sides of the straits are separate countries.\" These statements essentially eliminate any \"special\" factors in the relations and were strongly criticized by opposition parties in Taiwan. President Chen has repeatedly refused to endorse the [[One China policy|One China Principle]] or the more \"flexible\" [[1992 Consensus]] the PRC demands as a precursor to negotiations with the PRC. During Chen's presidency, there had not been any successful attempts to restart negotiations on a semi-official level.\n\nIn the 2008 ROC elections, the people delivered KMT's [[Ma Ying-jeou]] with an election win as well as a sizable majority in the legislature. President Ma, throughout his election campaign, maintained that he would accept the 1992 consensus and promote better relations with the PRC. In respect of Taiwan political status, his policy was 1. he would not negotiate with the PRC on the subject of reunification during his term; 2. he would never declare Taiwan independence; and 3. he would not provoke the PRC into attacking Taiwan. He officially accepted the 1992 Consensus in his inauguration speech which resulted in direct semi-official talks with the PRC, and this later led to the commencement of weekend direct charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan.

[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505]], passed on 1 February 1952 considered the Chinese communists to be rebels against the Republic of China. However, the 1970s saw a switch in diplomatic recognitions from the ROC to the PRC. On 25 October 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[UN General Assembly]], which \"decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\"  Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter. (''See [[China and the United Nations]].'')\n\nThe PRC refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC,<ref name = prc_wp /> but does not object to nations conducting economic, cultural, and other such exchanges with Taiwan that do not imply diplomatic relation. Therefore, many nations that have diplomatic relations with Beijing maintain quasi-diplomatic offices in Taipei.

The Treaty of Shimonoseki was a [[dispositive treaty]], therefore it is not voidable or nullifiable (this doctrine being that treaties specifying particular actions which can be ''completed,'' once the action ''gets completed,'' ''cannot'' be voided or reversed without a new treaty specifically reversing that clause). Hence, the ''[[unequal treaty doctrine]]'' cannot be applied to this treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By way of comparison, as 200,000,000 Kuping [[tael]]s were not returned to China from [[Japan]], and [[Korea]] had not become a Chinese-dependent country again, the cession in the treaty was executed and cannot be nullified. The disposition of Formosa and the Pescadores in this treaty was a legitimate cession by conquest, confirmed by treaty, and thus is not a theft, as described as \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\" in Cairo Declaration.\n#It should also be noted that the Qing court exercised effective sovereignty over primarily the west coast of Taiwan only, and even then did not regard the area as an integral part of national Chinese territory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n# The \"Cairo Declaration\" was merely an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9 which does not carry a '''legal status''', while the [[Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Proclamation]] and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] are simply [[modus vivendi]] and [[armistice]] that function as temporary records and do not bear legally binding power to transfer sovereignty. Good faith of interpretation only takes place at the level of treaties.\n# The \"retrocession\" proclaimed by ROC in 1945 was legally null and impossible since Taiwan was still ''de jure'' part of Japan before the post-war [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect on 28 April 1952.  Consequently, the announcement of the mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens in January 1946 is unjust and void ''[[Ab initio]]''. After the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect, the sovereignty of Taiwan naturally belonged to the Taiwanese people.\n# Some of Taiwan independence supporters once used arguments not in favor of Chinese sovereignty to dispute to legitimacy of the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled government that ruled over Taiwan, they have dropped these arguments due to the democratization of Taiwan. This has allowed the more moderate supporters of independence to stress the [[popular sovereignty]] theory in order to accept the legitimacy of the Republic of China (whose government the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] used to control) in Taiwan.  Former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], by his interpretation of the \"Republic of China\", has repeatedly confirmed that the \"Republic of China is Taiwan.\"\n# Sovereignty transfer to the ROC by [[custom (law)|prescription]] does not apply to Taiwan's case since:\n## Prescription is the manner of acquiring property by a long, honest, and uninterrupted possession or use during the time required by law.

For prescription to apply, the state with title to the territory must acquiesce to the action of the other state. Yet, PRC has never established an occupation on Taiwan and exercised sovereignty;\n## Prescription as a rule for acquiring sovereignty itself is not universally accepted.

Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] only became effective on 5 August 1952, over three months after the coming into force of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] on 28 April 1952.

The [[postliminium]] restoration of China was completed without sovereignty over Taiwan since Taiwan was not part of China when the first Chinese Republic was established in 1911. Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was abrogated by Japan upon the PRC's request in 1972.\n# Cession of Taiwan without a recipient was neither unusual nor unique, since [[Cuba]], as a precedent, was ceded by Spain without recipient in [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] as the result of [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Cuba reached independence in May 1902.  At the end of WWII, [[Libya]] and [[Somaliland]] were also relinquished without recipient by Italy in the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|Treaty of peace with Italy of 1947]] and both reached independence later.\n# The Nationality Law of the Republic of China was originally promulgated in February 1929. However, no amendment or change to this law or any other law has ever been made by the Legislative Yuan in the post WWII period to reflect any mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.  This is important because Article 10 of the [[Treaty of Taipei]] specifies: \"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) ... \" Since no relevant laws or regulations have ever been promulgated, there is no legal basis to consider native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.\n# Furthermore it is recognized that the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC that accepted Japanese surrender in 1945, because the ruling authorities were given popular mandate by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other local Taiwanese. The popular sovereignty theory, to which the [[Pan-Green coalition]] subscribes, emphasizes that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes and choose a new national title by means of a popular referendum.  (In contrast, the ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[Pan-Blue coalition]] suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.)\n# Nevertheless the popular sovereignty theory does not contradict any arguments in favor of [[self-determination]], nor does it affirm arguments in favor of Chinese sovereignty.  This means that at present the only obstacle against declaring Taiwan independence is a lack of consensus among the Taiwanese people to do so; however it is clear that the consensus is changing as the Taiwanese people begin preparations for their 15th application for entrance to the United Nations in the fall of 2007.\n# The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]]'s omission of China as a participant was not an accident of history, but reflected the status that the ROC had failed to maintain its original position as the ''de jure''{{Which|date=October 2010}} and ''de facto'' government of the whole China.

Lai Chin Jung'', decided by the Tokyo High Court on December 24, 1956, it was stated that \u2018Formosa and the Pescadores came to belong to the Republic of China, at any rate on August 5, 1952, when the [Peace] Treaty between Japan and the Republic of China came into force\u2026\u2019...the principles of prescription and occupation that may justify the ROC's claim to Taiwan certainly are not applicable to the PRC because the application of these two principles to the Taiwan situation presupposes the validity of the two peace treaties by which Japan renounce its claim to Taiwan and thus makes the island ''terra nullius''.}}</ref> Under international law,{{Which|date=October 2010}} there are no actions which a [[government in exile]] can take in its current location of residence in order to be recognized as the local legitimate government.

In 1979, with the U.S. change of diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the ROC lost its ally needed to \"recover the mainland.\" Meanwhile, the PRC's desire to be accepted in the international community led it to promote peaceful unification under what would later be termed \"[[one country, two systems]]\", rather than to \"liberate Taiwan\" and to make Taiwan a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]].\n\n=== PRC's condition on military intervention ===\nNotwithstanding, the PRC government has issued triggers for an immediate war with Taiwan, most notably via its controversial [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|Anti-Secession Law of 2005]]. These conditions are:\n* if events occur leading to the ''\"separation\"'' of Taiwan from China ''in any name'', or\n* if a major event occurs which would lead to Taiwan's ''\"separation\"'' from China, or\n* if all possibility of peaceful unification is lost.\n\nIt has been interpreted that these criteria encompass the scenario of Taiwan developing nuclear weapons (''see main article'' [[Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction]] also [[Timeline of the Republic of China's nuclear program]]).\n\nMuch [[saber-rattling]] by the PRC has been done over this, with [[Jiang Zemin]], after assuming the mantle of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming a leading voice.\n\nThe third condition has especially caused a stir in Taiwan as the term \"indefinitely\" is open to interpretation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It has also been viewed by some as meaning that preserving the ambiguous status quo is not acceptable to the PRC, although the PRC stated on many occasions that there is no explicit timetable for reunification.\n\nConcern over a formal declaration of ''de jure'' [[Taiwan independence]] is a strong impetus for the military buildup between Taiwan and mainland China.

Both sides have chosen to have a strong naval presence. However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, while the ROC assumed a more defensive attitude by building and buying [[frigate]]s and missile [[destroyer]]s, and the PRC a more aggressive posture by developing long-range [[cruise missile]]s and supersonic [[surface-to-surface missile]]s.\n\nAlthough the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] is considered large, most of its fleet consists of older generation [[Chengdu J-7|J-7]] fighters (localized [[MiG-21]]s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict. Since mid-1990s PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, [[SU-27]] based fighters. These Russian fighters, as well as their Chinese [[Shenyang J-11|J11A]] variants, are currently over 170 in number, and have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's [[Beyond Visual Range missile|Beyond Visual Range]] (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation [[Chengdu J-10|J10A]] fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su30MKKs]] further enhanced the PLAAF's [[air-to-ground]] support ability. The [[Republic of China Air Force|ROC's air force]], on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s, approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defense Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct [[BVR]] combat missions with BVR missiles, but the level of technology in mainland Chinese fighters is catching up.

In 1979, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]], a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and Penghu, but not to Kinmen or Matsu, which are usually considered to be part of Mainland China). The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The [[Seventh Fleet]], operating primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}}. Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it can be safely assumed from past actions, that is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is written into the strategy of the United States department of defense within this region that, \u201cFirst, we are strengthening our military capacity to ensure the United States can successfully deter conflict and coercion and respond decisively when needed.

Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch [[preemptive strike]]s on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to the ROC's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, not only because the ROC controls valuable shipping routes, but also because its capture by PRC would make Japan more vulnerable. During [[World War II]], the US invaded the [[Philippines]], but another viable target to enable direct attacks on Japan would have been Taiwan (then known as Formosa).

However, also other priorities are becoming increasingly prominent and possible due to increasing military resources.

The current controversy is over the term ''one China'', as the PRC insists that the ROC must recognize this term to begin negotiations.  Although the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has moderated its support for [[Taiwan independence]], there is still insufficient support within that party for former President Chen Shui-bian to agree to one China.  By contrast, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP) appear willing to agree to some variation of one China, and observers believed the position of the PRC was designed to sideline Chen until the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]] where it was hoped that someone who was more supportive of [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] would come to power.  Partly to counter this, Chen Shui-bian announced in July 2002 that if the PRC does not respond to Taiwan's goodwill, Taiwan may \"go on its own ... road.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\nWhat ROC president, Chen Shui-bian, means by this is that there are other ways of combatting China as a powerful hegemon. For example, \u201cIf Taiwan\u2019s Chen Shui-bian had declared legal independence by a popular referendum, scholars agree that is could have immediately triggered a crisis in China, due to its political sensitivity on the mainland\u201d.<ref>Wei, C.

However, public opinion in Taiwan reacted unfavorably towards the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|anti-secession law]] passed by the PRC in March 2005. Following two high-profile visits by KMT and PFP party leaders to the PRC, the balance of public opinion appears to be ambiguous, with the Pan-Green Coalition gaining a majority in the [[2005 ROC National Assembly election|2005 National Assembly elections]], but the Pan-Blue Coalition scoring a landslide victory in the 2005 municipal elections.\n\nLegislative elections were held in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] on [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|January 12, 2008]]. The results gave the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] an absolute majority (86 of the 113 seats) in the [[Legislative Yuan|legislature]], handing a heavy defeat to President [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s [[Democratic Progressive Party]], which won the remaining 27 seats. The junior partner in the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], won no seats.\n\nThe election for the 12th President of ROC was held on [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|March 22, 2008]]. [[Kuomintang]] candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leadership. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma's landslide victory brought the Kuomintang back to power in Taiwan. This new political situation has led to a decrease of tension between both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] and the increase of [[cross-strait relations]], making a declaration of independence, or war, something unlikely.\n\nTaiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart \u2013 the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait]] (ARATS) signed four agreements in Taipei on 4 November 2008. Both SEF and ARATS have agreed to address direct sea links, daily charter flights, direct postal service and food safety.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan reached deals with China at the expense of sovereignty and democracy|publisher=[[European Federation of Taiwanese Associations|EFTA]]|date=6 November 2008|url=http://www.eutaiwan.org/en2.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Public opinion ===\nPublic opinion in Taiwan regarding relations with the PRC is notoriously difficult to gauge, as poll results tend to be extremely sensitive to how the questions are phrased and what options are given, and there is a tendency by all political parties to [[spin (politics)|spin]] the results to support their point of view.<ref>Lin, Yitzu, and Hsieh, John Fuh-Sheng. \u201cChange and Continuity in Taiwan\u2019s Public Opinion on the Cross-Strait Economic Interactions.\u201d Journal of Asian and African Studies, vol. 52, no. 8, SAGE Publications, Dec. 2017, pp. 1103\u201316, d oi:10.1177/0021909616649210.</ref>\n\nAccording to a November 2005 poll from the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], 37.7% of people living in the ROC favor maintaining the status quo until a decision can be made in the future, 18.4% favors maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 14% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual independence, 12% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual reunification, 10.3% favors independence as soon as possible, and 2.1% favors reunification as soon as possible.

In other words, if reunification supporters wanted to reunify Taiwan with mainland China in such a way that would effectively abolish the ROC or affect the ROC's sovereignty, or if independence supporters wanted to abolish the ROC and establish a Republic of Taiwan, they would also need to amend or abolish the ROC constitution and redraft a new constitution.  Passing an amendment requires an unusually broad political consensus, which includes approval from three-quarters of a quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan.  This quorum requires at least three-quarters of all members of the Legislature.  After passing the legislature, the amendments need ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC, ''irrespective'' of voter turnout.\n\nGiven these harsh constitutional requirements, neither the pan-greens nor pan-blues can unilaterally change Taiwan's political and legal status with respect to the ROC's constitution.  However, extreme Taiwan independence supporters view the ROC's constitution as illegal and therefore believe that amendments to the ROC constitution are an invalid way to change Taiwan's political status.\n\n== Note on terminology ==\n\n=== Political status vs. Taiwan issue or Mainland issue ===\nSome scholarly sources as well as political entities like the PRC refer to Taiwan's controversial status as the \"Taiwan question\", \"Taiwan issue\", or \"Taiwan problem\".  The ROC government does not like these terminologies, emphasizing that it should be called the \"'''Mainland issue'''\" or \"Mainland question\", because from the ROC's point of view, the PRC is making an issue out of or creating a problem out of Taiwan.  Others use the term \"Taiwan Strait Issue\" because it implies nothing about sovereignty and because \"[[Cross-Strait relations]]\" is a term used by both the ROC and the PRC to describe their interactions. However, this term is also objectionable to some because it still implies that there is an issue, which they feel is created only by the PRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n=== ''De facto'' vs. ''de jure'' and whether ROC ceased to exist ===\nThe use of the terms ''de facto'' and ''[[de jure]]'' to describe Taiwan's as well as the Republic of China's status as a state is itself a contentious issue. This partially stems from the lack of precedents regarding derecognized, but still constitutionally functioning states. For instance, it is argued by Jacques deLisle that Taiwan satisfies three of the four requirements of statehood at international law as stated in the [[Montevideo Convention]]. A state must have distinct and substantial territory which Taiwan is capable of satisfying since it is an island and controls few surrounding islands such as Penghu and Green Island. A state must also have a distinct population and substantial population which Taiwan satisfies by having a population of around 23 million people. A state must also have a government that provides order, does not answer to a higher government or government abroad, thus protecting its relative sovereignty, which Taiwan or the Republic of China satisfies. However, as Delisle states, \u201cThe fourth criterion for state status, according to the Montevideo Convention and customary international law, is the capacity to engage in relations with other states. Here, Taiwan has some troubles on the \u201cformal\u201d side.  No other country formally recognizes Taiwan as a separate state and only a small number of countries (now twenty-three) either recognize the ROC government or merely maintain formal diplomatic relations with it.\u201d <ref>[https://www.fpri.org/docs/media/201107.delisle.taiwan.pdf desLisle, J. (2011). Taiwan: Sovereignty and Participation in International Organizations. Foreign Policy Research Institute: A Catalyst for Ideas, E-Notes. Pg. 1-5. Pg. 1, Par. 3, Lines 1-5.]</ref>\nAt the same time, there is continued debate on whether UN membership or recognition as a state by the UN is a decisive feature of statehood (since it represents broad recognition by the international community); the debate arises because non-state entities can often satisfy the Montevideo Convention factors, while the list of states recognised by the UN, for the most part, correlates well with entities recognised as states by [[customary international law]]. If the latter argument is accepted, then the Republic of China may have ceased to be a state post-1971 as a matter of international law (\"''de jure''\"), yet continued to otherwise function as the state that it previously was recognised as (\"''de facto''\").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, media wire services sometimes describe Taiwan as having de facto independence, whereas the Republic of China has always considered itself as a continuously functioning ''de jure'' state.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Taiwan}}\n{{wikinewspar2|Pentagon report reflects concerns over China's increased military|Chinese General threatens U.S. with nuclear weapons over possible Taiwan Strait conflict, Beijing downplays comment}}\n\n* [[History of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|History of Taiwan under Japanese rule]]\n* [[History of Republic of China]]\n* [[Chinese Civil War]]\n* [[Secession in China]]\n* [[228 Incident]], for historical context of ROC-Taiwanese conflict\n* [[Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan]]\n* [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan Province]]\n* [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Claimed Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan independence]]\n* [[Cross-Strait Unification]]\n* [[Cross-Strait relations]]\n* [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Military Power of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC\n* [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the PRC\n* [[Foreign relations of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan in United Nations]]\n* [[Taiwan Relations Act]]\n* [[Three Communiqu\u00e9s]]\n* [[51st state#Taiwan]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bush, R. & O'Hanlon, M.

The ROC, which took control of Taiwan (including Penghu and other nearby islands) in 1945, ruled [[mainland China]] and claimed sovereignty over [[Outer Mongolia]] (now [[Mongolia]]) and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] (part of which is present day [[Tuva]], Russia) before losing the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and relocating its government and [[capital city]] from [[Nanjing]] ([[Chinese postal romanization|alternately spelled]] as \"Nanking\") to [[Taipei]] as [[temporary capital]] in December 1949. The CPC established new government on the mainland as [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in October 1949.\n\nSince the ROC [[China and the United Nations|lost its United Nations seat]] as \"China\" in 1971 ([[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced]] by the PRC), most sovereign states have switched their diplomatic recognition to the PRC, recognizing the PRC as the representative of all China, though the majority of countries avoid clarifying what territories are meant by \"China\" in order to associate with both the PRC and ROC.  {{Numrec|ROC|asof=S|alt2=the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]],<ref name=NewsMalawi>{{cite news | title= Taiwan breaks ties with Malawi | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200801141806.htm|date=14 January 2008 | newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> although informal relations are maintained with nearly all others. Agencies of foreign governments such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] operate as ''de facto'' embassies of their home countries in Taiwan, and Taiwan operates similar ''de facto'' embassies and consulates in most countries under such names as \"Taipei Representative Office\" (TRO) or \"Taipei Economic and Cultural (Representative) Office\" (TECO). In certain contexts, Taiwan is also referred to as [[Chinese Taipei]].\n\nThe ROC government has in the past actively pursued the claim as the sole legitimate government over mainland China and Taiwan. This position began to change in the early 1990s as democracy was introduced and new Taiwanese leaders were elected, changing to one that does not actively challenge the legitimacy of PRC rule over mainland China.  Both the PRC and the ROC carry out [[Cross-Strait relations]] through specialized agencies (such as the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC), rather than through foreign ministries. Different groups have different concepts of what the current formal political situation of Taiwan is. (''See also: [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]], [[Taiwan independence]], and [[Cross-Strait relations]]'')\n\nIn addition, the situation can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]].  The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the perspective of the status quo: to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear and can be confusing given the fact that the People's Republic of China has never controlled Taiwan and the Republic of China still exists, albeit on a decreased scale.\n\nThe status quo is accepted in large part because it does not define the legal or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret the situation in a way that is politically acceptable to its members.  At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what the status quo is, leading to the possibility of war through [[brinkmanship]] or miscalculation. The People's Republic Of China seeks to end Taiwan's de facto independence through the process of reunification. If Taiwan refuses this process, The People's Republic of China is prepared to use force through military means, in order to achieve unification.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FP_20190226_taiwan_bush_hass.pdf\n</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|History of Taiwan}}\n\nTaiwan (excluding [[Penghu]]) was first populated by [[Austronesian people]] and was colonized by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had arrived in 1623. The [[Kingdom of Tungning]], lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first [[Han Chinese]] government to rule [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. From 1683, the [[Qing Dynasty]] ruled [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] as a [[prefecture]] and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate [[Chinese province]] to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Taiwan and [[Penghu]] were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of [[World War II]], putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after [[History of Taiwan#Japanese rule|50 years of Japanese rule]]. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]], [[Potsdam Declaration]], and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]], but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of [[mainland China]] and in the [[South China Sea]]. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was established in mainland China on 1 October 1949, claiming to be the [[succession of states theory|successor]] to the ROC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&m_id=4 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |accessdate=2 August 2008 |publisher=Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |date=21 February 2000}}</ref>\n\n[[Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[Wuchiu]] on the coast of [[Fujian|Fukien]], [[Taiping (island)|Taiping]] and [[Pratas]] in the [[South China Sea]], are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan. Some arguments supporting the independence of Taiwan do not apply to these islands.\n\n=== Cession, retrocession, legal status, and self-determination of Taiwan ===\n[[File:\"Japan\" with inset map \"Formosa and Riu-Kiu Islands\" from A Literary and Historical Atlas of Asia, by J.G. Bartholomew. J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd. 1912.jpg|thumb|right|230px|According to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] Taiwan was part of Japan at the establishment of the ROC in 1912. The PRC (founded 1 October 1949) argues that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was never valid, saying it was one of several [[unequal treaties]] forced upon the Qing.]]\n{{Anchor|Cession and retrocession|Cession and Retrocession|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination of Taiwan|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination of Taiwan}}China, during the [[Qing Dynasty]], ceded the island of Taiwan, including [[Penghu]], to Japan \"in perpetuity\" at the end of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895)|First Sino-Japanese War]] by signing the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. In the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] of 1943, the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\", specifically listing \"Formosa\" and Penghu, to the Republic of China after the defeat of Japan. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the [[Instrument of Surrender of Japan]] in 1945. The PRC's UN Ambassador, [[Wang Yingfan]], has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\" and \"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 [[Potsdam Declaration]] have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of [[international law]].\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty (San Francisco Peace Treaty) transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. Also, according to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, China legally surrendered its sovereignty and jurisdiction over Taiwan (Formosa) forever. So, this treaty therefore renders Japan's declaration of the returning of sovereignty over Taiwan to China as well as the PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan's claims regarding China's right to sovereignty over Taiwan, as legally extraneous and unsubstantiated. The US and UK governments also hold that the Cairo Declaration made in 1943 is just a war-time statement of intention and cannot itself transfer the sovereignty of Taiwan from Japan to China.\n\nThe ROC argues that the [[Treaty of Taipei]] implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum.<ref>{{citation |last=Starr |first=Robert I. |title=Legal Status of Taiwan |date=13 July 1971 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/starr.htm |accessdate=26 December 2009 | publisher= US State Dept.}}; reprinted as Appendix C of {{cite book |editor-last=Tkacik |editor-first=John J. |title=Rethinking One China |publisher=Heritage Foundation |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780891952701|date=30 October 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==== Legal status dispute under international law ====\n{{Anchor|Legal status dispute under international law|International law|Dispute under international law}}On the other hand, a number of supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] argue that Taiwan was only formally incorporated as a Chinese territory under the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1683, and as a province in 1885. Subsequently, because of the Shimonoseki Treaty of 1895, Taiwan had been ''[[de jure]]'' part of Japan when the ROC was established in 1912 and thus was not part of the Chinese republic. Also, because the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Declaration]] was an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9, the independence advocates argue that the legal effectiveness of the Declaration is highly questionable. Furthermore, they point out that the Instrument of Surrender of Japan was no more than an [[armistice]], a \"[[modus vivendi]]\" in nature, which served as a temporary or provisional agreement that would be replaced with a [[peace treaty]].  Therefore, only a military occupation of Taiwan began on 25 October 1945, and both the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and [[Treaty of Taipei]] hold legal supremacy over the surrender instrument. These treaties did not transfer the title of Taiwan from Japan to China. According to this argument, the sovereignty of Taiwan was returned to the people of Taiwan when Japan renounced sovereignty of Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco (also known as [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], SFPT) in 1951, based on the policy of [[self-determination]] which has been applied to \"territories which detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War\" as defined by article 76b and 77b of the [[United Nations Charter]] and also by the protocol of the [[Yalta Conference]].  The United Nations General Assembly has not been particularly receptive to this argument, and the ROC's applications for admission to the United Nations have been rejected 15 times.<ref>{{cite web |title=UN again rejects Taiwan allies' letter on UN bid |date=2008-04-02 |url=http://www.taiwanembassy.org/UK/ct.asp?xItem=57422&ctNode=3244&mp=132&nowPage=1&pagesize=15 |agency=Central News Agency |publisher=Taipei Representative Office in the UK |accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the interpretation of the peace treaties was used to challenge the legitimacy of the ROC on Taiwan before the 1990s, the introduction of popular elections in Taiwan has compromised this position. Except for the most extreme Taiwan independence supporters, most Taiwanese support the [[popular sovereignty]] theory and no longer see much conflict between this theory of sovereignty and the ROC position. In this sense, the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC which accepted Japanese surrender because the ruling authorities were given [[Mandate (politics)|popular mandate]] by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other is the Taiwanese constituencies. In fact, former president [[Chen Shui-bian]] has been frequently emphasizing the popular sovereignty theory in his speeches.\n\n[[File:The Taiwan State.jpg|thumb|300px|A shopping bag produced by an independence-leaning pastry establishment. The address uses \"State of Taiwan, Taipei County\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u570b\u53f0\u5317\u7e23}}) rather than \"Taiwan Province\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u7701}}) or \"Republic of China\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b}})]]\n\nHowever, as of 2010, the conflict between these two theories still plays a role in internal Taiwanese politics. The popular sovereignty theory, which the [[pan-green coalition]] emphasizes, suggests that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes by means of a popular referendum. The ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[pan-blue coalition]], suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.\n\n== Historical overview ==\n\n=== 1895&ndash;1945&ndash; Japanese rule ===\n[[File:China old map.jpg|thumb|right|A ROC Map, printed in 1926, which showed Taiwan as part of Japan.]]\n\n==== Treaty of Shimonoseki ====\n\n[[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (Formosa) including the [[Pescadores]] were permanently ceded by [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]] to [[Imperial Japan]] via Articles 2b and 2c of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] on 8 May 1895 in one of what the Chinese term as an [[unequal treaty]]. [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] on the coast of [[Fujian#Quemoy and Matsu|Fukien]], and the [[South China Sea Islands|islands in the South China Sea]] currently administered by the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan were not part of the cession.\n\nIn 1895, subsequent to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], officials in Taiwan declared independence in the hope of returning the island to Qing rule. The [[Republic of Taiwan (1895)]] collapsed after 12 days due to political infighting, but local leaders continued resistance in the hope of achieving self-rule. The incoming Japanese crushed the island's independence bid in a five-month campaign.\n\nThe [[China|Chinese]] [[Qing Dynasty]] was subsequently overthrown and replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC). Upon the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the ROC declared the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] void in its declaration of war on Japan. The war soon merged with [[World War II]], and Japan was subsequently defeated in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], of which the ROC was a part.\n\n==== Potsdam Declaration and surrender of Japan ====\nThe United States entered the War in December 1941. Most military attacks against Japanese installations and Japanese troops in Taiwan were conducted by [[United States]] military forces. At the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]], the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], and the ROC agreed that Taiwan was to be restored to the ROC after the war. This agreement was enunciated in the Cairo Declaration and the [[Potsdam Declaration]], which outlined the terms of Japanese surrender, specified that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.\n\nWhen [[Japan]] unconditionally surrendered, it accepted in its [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.  Japanese troops in Taiwan were directed to surrender to the representatives of the Supreme Allied Commander in the China Theater, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (i.e. the Republic of China military forces) on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], according to the directions of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], head of the United States Military Government, in [[General Order No. 1]], which was issued 2 September 1945. Chief Executive [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] of [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] soon proclaimed \"Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]]\" on 25 October 1945.\n\n=== 1945&ndash;Today &ndash; post-World War II status ===\n\n==== 1947 &ndash; 228 Incident ====\n\nWhen the [[228 Incident]] erupted on 28 February 1947, the U.S. Consulate-General in [[Taipei]] prepared a report in early March, calling for an immediate intervention in the name of the U.S. or the [[United Nations]]. Based on the argument that the Japanese surrender did not formally transfer sovereignty, Taiwan was still legally part of Japan and occupied by the United States (with administrative authority for the occupation delegated to the Chinese Nationalists), and a direct intervention was appropriate for a territory with such status. This proposed intervention, however, was rejected by the [[U.S. State Department]]. In a news report on the aftermath of the ''228 Incident'', some Taiwanese residents were reported to be talking of appealing to the United Nations to put the island under an international mandate, since China's possession of Taiwan had not been formalized by any international treaties by that time and the island was therefore still under belligerent occupation.<ref name=NYT033047>{{cite news |title=FORMOSANS' PLEA FOR RED AID SEEN; Harsh Repression of Revolt Is Expected to Increase Efforts to Escape Rule by China |last=Durdin |first=Tillman |date=30 March 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F1EF63B5F1A7A93C2AA1788D85F438485F9 |accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306103355/http://228.lomaji.com/news/033047.html-->\nThey later made a demand for a treaty role to be represented at the forthcoming peace conference on Japan, in the hope of requesting a [[plebiscite]] to determine the island's political future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Formosans Ask Treaty Role |date=5 October 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5061FFF395E17738DDDAC0894D8415B8788F1D3 |accessdate=2007-10-06 }}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306142800/http://228.lomaji.com/news/100547.html-->\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-partisan Taiwanese political candidate Wu San-lian (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first [[Taipei city]] mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters.

In June 1950, President Truman, who had previously given only passive support to Chiang Kai-shek and was prepared to see Taiwan fall into the hands of the [[Chinese Communists]], vowed to stop the spread of communism and sent the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent the PRC from attacking Taiwan, but also to prevent the ROC from attacking mainland China. He then declared that \"the determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.\"<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=800\n|title=Statement by the President on the Situation in Korea\n|date=27 June 1950\n|publisher=Truman library\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>   President Truman later reaffirmed the position \"that all questions affecting Formosa be settled by peaceful means as envisaged in the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]\" in his special message to the Congress in July 1950.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=822\n|title=Special Message to the Congress Reporting on the Situation in Korea\n|date=19 July 1950\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> The PRC denounced his moves as flagrant interference in the internal affairs of China.\n\nOn 8 September 1950, President Truman ordered [[John Foster Dulles]], then Foreign Policy Advisor to the [[U.S. Secretary of State]], to carry out his decision on \"neutralizing\" Taiwan in drafting the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] ([[San Francisco]] Peace Treaty) of 1951. According to [[George H. Kerr]]'s memoir ''[[Formosa Betrayed (1965 book)|Formosa Betrayed]]'', Dulles devised a plan whereby Japan would first merely renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan without a recipient country to allow the sovereignty over Taiwan to be determined together by the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Soviet Union]], and Republic of China on behalf of other nations on the peace treaty. The question of Taiwan would be taken into the United Nations (which the ROC was [[China and the United Nations|still part]]), if these four parties could not reach into an agreement within one year.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco) ====\n\nWhen Japan regained sovereignty over itself in 1952 with the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] (San Francisco Peace Treaty) with 48 nations, Japan renounced all claims and title over Taiwan and the Pescadores.

The PRC, which was proclaimed 1 October 1949, was also not invited. The lack of invitation was probably due to the dispute over which government was the legitimate government of China (which both governments claimed to be); however, [[Cold War]] considerations might have played a part as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some major governments represented in the San Francisco Conference, such as the UK and Soviet Union, had already established relations with the PRC, while others, such as the U.S. and Japan, still held relations with the ROC.\n\nThe UK at that time stated for the record that the San Francisco Peace Treaty \"itself does not determine the future of these islands,\" and therefore the UK, along with [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], was happy to sign the peace treaty.<ref name=taipeitimes20070930>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/09/30/2003381074\n|title=John Tkacik on Taiwan: Taiwan's status remains 'unsettled'\n|date=30 September 2007\n|author=John Tkacik\n|publisher=Taipei Times\n|page=8}}</ref>  One of the major reasons that the delegate from the Soviet Union gave for not signing the treaty was that: \"The draft contains only a reference to the renunciation by Japan of its rights to these territories [Taiwan] but intentionally omits any mention of the further fate of these territories.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\nArticle 25 of this treaty officially stipulated that only the Allied Powers defined in the treaty could benefit from this treaty. China was not listed as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]; however, article 21 still provided limited benefits from Articles 10 and 14(a)2 for China. Japan's cession of Taiwan is unusual in that no recipient of Taiwan was stated as part of Dulles's plan of \"neutralizing\" Taiwan. The ROC protested its lack of invitation to the San Francisco Peace conference, to no avail.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Taipei ====\n\nSubsequently, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was concluded between the ROC and Japan on 28 April 1952 (effective 5 August), where Japan basically re-affirmed the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and formalized the peace between the ROC and Japan.

The PRC points out the fact that the [[Montevideo Convention]] was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the United Nations as well as UN Resolutions should supersede the [[Montevideo Convention]]. However, \"When speaking of statehood, one invariably refers to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States,60 which, laying down what is now considered a rule of customary international law, states that \"[t] he State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other States.\"61 Taiwan indeed satisfies all these criteria for statehood.\"<ref>[https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/chnint8&i=461 Chan, Phil C.

It was only in the mid-1930s when both the CCP and KMT realised the future strategic importance of Taiwan that they altered their party positions to make a claim on Taiwan as a part of China. After losing the Civil War against the Communist Party in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, and continued to maintain that their government represented all of China, i.e. both Taiwan and the mainland.\n\nThe position of most supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] is that the PRC is the government of \"China\" and that Taiwan is not part of China, defining \"China\" as only including Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Regarding the ROC, one ideology within Taiwan independence regards the ROC as already an independent, sovereign state, and seeks to amend the ROC's existing name, constitution, and existing framework to reflect the loss of ROC's mainland territory, and transform ROC into a Taiwan state; while another ideology of Taiwan independence regards the ROC as both a military government that has been administering the Taiwan island as a result of post-war [[military occupation]] on behalf of the [[allies of World War II]] since 1945, and a Chinese refugee regime currently in exile on Taiwan since 1949, and seeks to eliminate the ROC and establish a new independent Taiwan state.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party states that Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that the PRC does not exercise any hold over the 23 million Taiwanese on the island. On the other hand, the position of most [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] supporters is that the [[Chinese Civil War]] is still not over since no peace agreement has ever been signed, and that the current status is a state of [[ceasefire]] between two [[belligerents]] of \"[[One China]]\". Therefore, the current political separation across the Taiwan strait is only temporary and a reunified China including both mainland China and Taiwan will be the result.\n\nThe position of the [[Republic of China]] has been that it is a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereign state. \"Republic of China,\" according to the ROC government's definition, extended to both [[mainland China]] (Including [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) and the island of Taiwan.<ref name=mac>{{cite press release | publisher = Mainland Affairs Council, ROC Executive Yuan |date= 29 March 2005 | title = The Official Position of the Republic of China (Taiwan) on China's Passing of the Anti-secession (Anti-Separation) Law|url =http://www.mac.gov.tw/english/english/anti/mofa940329e.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] unofficially claimed that the government would no longer challenge the rule of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists in mainland China]], the ROC government under [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) rule actively maintained that it was the sole legitimate government of China.  The Courts in Taiwan have never accepted President Lee's statement, primarily due to the reason that the (now defunct) [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] never officially changed the acclaimed national borders. Notably, the People's Republic of China claims that changing the national borders would be \"a precursor to Taiwan independence\".  The task of changing the national borders now requires a constitutional amendment passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] and ratified by a majority of all eligible ROC voters, which the PRC has implied would constitute grounds for military attack.\n\n[[File:Exit and Entry Permit of Republic of China (Taiwan).jpg|thumb|Exit and Entry Permit Taiwan, Republic of China. This permit is issued by the Republic of China to enable residents of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to travel to Taiwan. The Republic of China refuses to accept [[People's Republic of China passport]]s.]]\nOn the other hand, though the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] promulgated in 1946 does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of the constitution of 1925 did individually list the provinces of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]] was not among them, since Taiwan was arguably ''de jure'' part of Japan as the result of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that \"the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], it cannot be altered.\" However, in 1946, [[Sun Fo]], son of [[Sun Yat-Sen]] and the minister of the [[Executive Yuan]] of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that \"there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the independence of [[Mongolia]], and the second example would be the reclamation of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. Both would be examples of territory changes.\" Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951 and the [[Treaty of Taipei]] of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the [[General Order No. 1]] (1945) to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution. The explanatory memorandum to the constitution explained the omission of individually listing the provinces as opposed to the earlier drafts was an act of deliberate ambiguity: as the ROC government does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, based on Chiang Kai-shek's [[Denunciation]] of the treaty in the late 1930s, hence (according to this argument) the sovereignty of Taiwan was never disposed by China. A ratification by the ROC National Assembly is therefore unnecessary.\n\nThe [[s:Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]] have mentioned \"Taiwan Province,\" and the now defunct National Assembly passed constitutional amendments that give the people of the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]\", comprising the territories under its current jurisdiction, the sole right, until reunification, to exercise the sovereignty of the Republic through elections<ref name=mac /><ref>{{cite news |title= Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref> of the President and the entire Legislature as well as through elections to ratify amendments to the ROC constitution. Also, Chapter I, Article 2 of the ROC constitution states that \"The sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens.\" This suggests that the constitution implicitly admits that the sovereignty of the ROC is limited to the areas that it controls even if there is no constitutional amendment that explicitly spells out the ROC's borders.\n\n[[File:Taiwan the Province Government Building.JPG|thumb|The building of the Provincial Government of the Taiwan Province of the Republic of China at Jhongsing Village]]\n[[File:Presidential Office Taipei.jpg|thumb|The Republic of China Presidential Office Building is located in the Zhongzheng District of [[Taipei]].]]\n\nIn 1999, ROC President [[Lee Teng-hui]] proposed a [[Special state-to-state relations|two-state theory]] (\u5169\u570b\u8ad6) in which both the [[Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China would acknowledge that they are two separate countries with a special diplomatic, cultural and historic relationship.<ref name=2states_1>{{cite news | first=Sanya | last=Bunnag | title=Understanding Taiwan's tactics |date=20 July 1999 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/399381.stm }}</ref><ref name = 2000vote>{{cite journal | author=Willem van Kemenade | title=Taiwan, Voting for Trouble? | journal=The Washington Quarterly | year=2000 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=135\u2013151 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v023/23.2kemenade.html | doi=10.1162/016366000560809 }}</ref> This however drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting [[Taiwan independence]].<ref name=2states_2>{{cite news | title=Beijing media ups the ante |date=20 July 1999|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/399350.stm }}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Chen Shui-bian]] (2000 \u2013 May 2008) fully supported the idea that the \"[[Republic of China]] is an independent, sovereign country\" but held the view that the Republic of China is Taiwan and Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China. This is suggested in his [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]. Due to the necessity of avoiding war with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] however, President Chen had refrained from formally declaring Taiwan's independence. Government publications have implied that Taiwan refers to the ROC, and \"China\" refers to the PRC.<ref name=mac /> After becoming chairman of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in July 2002, Chen appeared to move further than Lee's special two-state theory and in early August 2002, by putting forward the \"[[one country on each side]]\" concept, he stated that Taiwan may \"go on its own Taiwanese road\" and that \"it is clear that the two sides of the straits are separate countries.\" These statements essentially eliminate any \"special\" factors in the relations and were strongly criticized by opposition parties in Taiwan. President Chen has repeatedly refused to endorse the [[One China policy|One China Principle]] or the more \"flexible\" [[1992 Consensus]] the PRC demands as a precursor to negotiations with the PRC. During Chen's presidency, there had not been any successful attempts to restart negotiations on a semi-official level.\n\nIn the 2008 ROC elections, the people delivered KMT's [[Ma Ying-jeou]] with an election win as well as a sizable majority in the legislature. President Ma, throughout his election campaign, maintained that he would accept the 1992 consensus and promote better relations with the PRC. In respect of Taiwan political status, his policy was 1. he would not negotiate with the PRC on the subject of reunification during his term; 2. he would never declare Taiwan independence; and 3. he would not provoke the PRC into attacking Taiwan. He officially accepted the 1992 Consensus in his inauguration speech which resulted in direct semi-official talks with the PRC, and this later led to the commencement of weekend direct charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan. President Ma also interprets the cross-strait relations as \"[[special non-state-to-state relations|special]]\", \"but not that between two nations\".<ref name=\"chinapost.com.tw\">{{cite news |title=Taiwan and China in 'special relations': Ma|newspaper=China Post|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/china-taiwan%20relations/2008/09/04/173082/Taiwan-and.htm}}</ref> He later stated that mainland China is part of the territory of the Republic of China, and laws relating to international relations are not applicable to the relations between mainland China and Taiwan, as they are parts of a state.<ref name=\"taipeitimes.com\">{{cite news |last=Ko |first=Shu-Ling |title=Ma refers to China as ROC territory in magazine interview |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=8 October 2008 |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/10/08/2003425320}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u99ac\u7e3d\u7d71\uff1a\u5169\u5cb8\u95dc\u4fc2\u662f\u73fe\u5be6\u95dc\u4fc2 |trans-title=President Ma: Cross-strait relations are relations based on current reality |publisher=Central News Agency of the Republic of China |date=8 October 2008 |url=http://www.president.gov.tw/php-bin/prez/shownews.php4?_section=3&_recNo=2 |language=Chinese}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=\u738b\u5bd3\u4e2d |title=\u99ac\uff1a\u5927\u9678\u662f\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u9818\u571f |trans-title=Ma: the mainland is the territory of the Republic of China |publisher=Liberty Times |date=8 October 2008 |url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/oct/8/today-fo3.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Tsai Ing-Wen]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] won a landslide victory on the Presidential election, and was later re-elected for the second term in 2020.

On 9 January 1950, the Israeli government extended recognition to the People's Republic of China. [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505]], passed on 1 February 1952 considered the Chinese communists to be rebels against the Republic of China. However, the 1970s saw a switch in diplomatic recognitions from the ROC to the PRC. On 25 October 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[UN General Assembly]], which \"decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\"  Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter. (''See [[China and the United Nations]].'')\n\nThe PRC refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC,<ref name = prc_wp /> but does not object to nations conducting economic, cultural, and other such exchanges with Taiwan that do not imply diplomatic relation. Therefore, many nations that have diplomatic relations with Beijing maintain quasi-diplomatic offices in Taipei.

The Treaty of Shimonoseki was a [[dispositive treaty]], therefore it is not voidable or nullifiable (this doctrine being that treaties specifying particular actions which can be ''completed,'' once the action ''gets completed,'' ''cannot'' be voided or reversed without a new treaty specifically reversing that clause). Hence, the ''[[unequal treaty doctrine]]'' cannot be applied to this treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By way of comparison, as 200,000,000 Kuping [[tael]]s were not returned to China from [[Japan]], and [[Korea]] had not become a Chinese-dependent country again, the cession in the treaty was executed and cannot be nullified. The disposition of Formosa and the Pescadores in this treaty was a legitimate cession by conquest, confirmed by treaty, and thus is not a theft, as described as \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\" in Cairo Declaration.\n#It should also be noted that the Qing court exercised effective sovereignty over primarily the west coast of Taiwan only, and even then did not regard the area as an integral part of national Chinese territory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n# The \"Cairo Declaration\" was merely an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9 which does not carry a '''legal status''', while the [[Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Proclamation]] and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] are simply [[modus vivendi]] and [[armistice]] that function as temporary records and do not bear legally binding power to transfer sovereignty. Good faith of interpretation only takes place at the level of treaties.\n# The \"retrocession\" proclaimed by ROC in 1945 was legally null and impossible since Taiwan was still ''de jure'' part of Japan before the post-war [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect on 28 April 1952.  Consequently, the announcement of the mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens in January 1946 is unjust and void ''[[Ab initio]]''. After the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect, the sovereignty of Taiwan naturally belonged to the Taiwanese people.\n# Some of Taiwan independence supporters once used arguments not in favor of Chinese sovereignty to dispute to legitimacy of the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled government that ruled over Taiwan, they have dropped these arguments due to the democratization of Taiwan. This has allowed the more moderate supporters of independence to stress the [[popular sovereignty]] theory in order to accept the legitimacy of the Republic of China (whose government the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] used to control) in Taiwan.  Former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], by his interpretation of the \"Republic of China\", has repeatedly confirmed that the \"Republic of China is Taiwan.\"\n# Sovereignty transfer to the ROC by [[custom (law)|prescription]] does not apply to Taiwan's case since:\n## Prescription is the manner of acquiring property by a long, honest, and uninterrupted possession or use during the time required by law. The possession must have been ''possessio longa, continua, et pacifica, nec sit ligitima interruptio'' (long, continued, peaceable, and without lawful interruption). For prescription to apply, the state with title to the territory must acquiesce to the action of the other state. Yet, PRC has never established an occupation on Taiwan and exercised sovereignty;\n## Prescription as a rule for acquiring sovereignty itself is not universally accepted.

The ROC, as a founding member of the United Nations, has a treaty obligation to comply with the UN Charter and to help the people living in Taiwan enjoy the right of [[self-determination]].\n# The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] is definitive, where Japan ceded Taiwan (like [[Sakhalin]] and [[Kuril Islands]] etc.) without specifying a clear recipient. China was prohibited{{By whom|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} from acquiring Taiwan sovereignty as a benefit when the treaty was finalized{{Original research inline|date=October 2010}}. Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] only became effective on 5 August 1952, over three months after the coming into force of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] on 28 April 1952. Hence, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] cannot be interpreted to have ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to the ROC or the PRC, but only as a recognition of the territories which ROC had and under its control, as Japan cannot cede what it no longer possessed.\n# Since the peace brokered in the Boxer Protocol of 1901 was breached by the second Sino-Japanese War, the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] specifies that the date to be used in returning territory to China in Article 10 was 1901, not 1895. The [[postliminium]] restoration of China was completed without sovereignty over Taiwan since Taiwan was not part of China when the first Chinese Republic was established in 1911. Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was abrogated by Japan upon the PRC's request in 1972.\n# Cession of Taiwan without a recipient was neither unusual nor unique, since [[Cuba]], as a precedent, was ceded by Spain without recipient in [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] as the result of [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Cuba reached independence in May 1902.  At the end of WWII, [[Libya]] and [[Somaliland]] were also relinquished without recipient by Italy in the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|Treaty of peace with Italy of 1947]] and both reached independence later.\n# The Nationality Law of the Republic of China was originally promulgated in February 1929. However, no amendment or change to this law or any other law has ever been made by the Legislative Yuan in the post WWII period to reflect any mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.  This is important because Article 10 of the [[Treaty of Taipei]] specifies: \"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) ... \" Since no relevant laws or regulations have ever been promulgated, there is no legal basis to consider native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.\n# Furthermore it is recognized that the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC that accepted Japanese surrender in 1945, because the ruling authorities were given popular mandate by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other local Taiwanese. The popular sovereignty theory, to which the [[Pan-Green coalition]] subscribes, emphasizes that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes and choose a new national title by means of a popular referendum.  (In contrast, the ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[Pan-Blue coalition]] suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.)\n# Nevertheless the popular sovereignty theory does not contradict any arguments in favor of [[self-determination]], nor does it affirm arguments in favor of Chinese sovereignty.  This means that at present the only obstacle against declaring Taiwan independence is a lack of consensus among the Taiwanese people to do so; however it is clear that the consensus is changing as the Taiwanese people begin preparations for their 15th application for entrance to the United Nations in the fall of 2007.\n# The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]]'s omission of China as a participant was not an accident of history, but reflected the status that the ROC had failed to maintain its original position as the ''de jure''{{Which|date=October 2010}} and ''de facto'' government of the whole China.

In 1979, with the U.S. change of diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the ROC lost its ally needed to \"recover the mainland.\" Meanwhile, the PRC's desire to be accepted in the international community led it to promote peaceful unification under what would later be termed \"[[one country, two systems]]\", rather than to \"liberate Taiwan\" and to make Taiwan a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]].\n\n=== PRC's condition on military intervention ===\nNotwithstanding, the PRC government has issued triggers for an immediate war with Taiwan, most notably via its controversial [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|Anti-Secession Law of 2005]]. These conditions are:\n* if events occur leading to the ''\"separation\"'' of Taiwan from China ''in any name'', or\n* if a major event occurs which would lead to Taiwan's ''\"separation\"'' from China, or\n* if all possibility of peaceful unification is lost.\n\nIt has been interpreted that these criteria encompass the scenario of Taiwan developing nuclear weapons (''see main article'' [[Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction]] also [[Timeline of the Republic of China's nuclear program]]).\n\nMuch [[saber-rattling]] by the PRC has been done over this, with [[Jiang Zemin]], after assuming the mantle of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming a leading voice.\n\nThe third condition has especially caused a stir in Taiwan as the term \"indefinitely\" is open to interpretation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It has also been viewed by some as meaning that preserving the ambiguous status quo is not acceptable to the PRC, although the PRC stated on many occasions that there is no explicit timetable for reunification.\n\nConcern over a formal declaration of ''de jure'' [[Taiwan independence]] is a strong impetus for the military buildup between Taiwan and mainland China.

Both sides have chosen to have a strong naval presence. However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, while the ROC assumed a more defensive attitude by building and buying [[frigate]]s and missile [[destroyer]]s, and the PRC a more aggressive posture by developing long-range [[cruise missile]]s and supersonic [[surface-to-surface missile]]s.\n\nAlthough the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] is considered large, most of its fleet consists of older generation [[Chengdu J-7|J-7]] fighters (localized [[MiG-21]]s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict. Since mid-1990s PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, [[SU-27]] based fighters. These Russian fighters, as well as their Chinese [[Shenyang J-11|J11A]] variants, are currently over 170 in number, and have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's [[Beyond Visual Range missile|Beyond Visual Range]] (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation [[Chengdu J-10|J10A]] fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su30MKKs]] further enhanced the PLAAF's [[air-to-ground]] support ability. The [[Republic of China Air Force|ROC's air force]], on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s, approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defense Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct [[BVR]] combat missions with BVR missiles, but the level of technology in mainland Chinese fighters is catching up.

These concerns have led to a view in certain quarters that Taiwanese independence, if it is to be implemented, should be attempted as early as possible, while the ROC still has the capacity to defend itself in an all-out military conflict.

In 1979, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]], a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and Penghu, but not to Kinmen or Matsu, which are usually considered to be part of Mainland China). The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The [[Seventh Fleet]], operating primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}}. Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it can be safely assumed from past actions, that is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is written into the strategy of the United States department of defense within this region that, \u201cFirst, we are strengthening our military capacity to ensure the United States can successfully deter conflict and coercion and respond decisively when needed.

Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch [[preemptive strike]]s on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to the ROC's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, not only because the ROC controls valuable shipping routes, but also because its capture by PRC would make Japan more vulnerable. During [[World War II]], the US invaded the [[Philippines]], but another viable target to enable direct attacks on Japan would have been Taiwan (then known as Formosa). However, critics of the preemptive strike theory assert that the PRC would be loath to give Japan and the US such an excuse to intervene.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4217193543447225711&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&sciodt=0,33 Smith, R.

However, also other priorities are becoming increasingly prominent and possible due to increasing military resources.

The current controversy is over the term ''one China'', as the PRC insists that the ROC must recognize this term to begin negotiations.  Although the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has moderated its support for [[Taiwan independence]], there is still insufficient support within that party for former President Chen Shui-bian to agree to one China.  By contrast, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP) appear willing to agree to some variation of one China, and observers believed the position of the PRC was designed to sideline Chen until the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]] where it was hoped that someone who was more supportive of [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] would come to power.  Partly to counter this, Chen Shui-bian announced in July 2002 that if the PRC does not respond to Taiwan's goodwill, Taiwan may \"go on its own ... road.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\nWhat ROC president, Chen Shui-bian, means by this is that there are other ways of combatting China as a powerful hegemon. For example, \u201cIf Taiwan\u2019s Chen Shui-bian had declared legal independence by a popular referendum, scholars agree that is could have immediately triggered a crisis in China, due to its political sensitivity on the mainland\u201d.<ref>Wei, C.

However, public opinion in Taiwan reacted unfavorably towards the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|anti-secession law]] passed by the PRC in March 2005. Following two high-profile visits by KMT and PFP party leaders to the PRC, the balance of public opinion appears to be ambiguous, with the Pan-Green Coalition gaining a majority in the [[2005 ROC National Assembly election|2005 National Assembly elections]], but the Pan-Blue Coalition scoring a landslide victory in the 2005 municipal elections.\n\nLegislative elections were held in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] on [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|January 12, 2008]]. The results gave the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] an absolute majority (86 of the 113 seats) in the [[Legislative Yuan|legislature]], handing a heavy defeat to President [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s [[Democratic Progressive Party]], which won the remaining 27 seats. The junior partner in the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], won no seats.\n\nThe election for the 12th President of ROC was held on [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|March 22, 2008]]. [[Kuomintang]] candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leadership. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma's landslide victory brought the Kuomintang back to power in Taiwan. This new political situation has led to a decrease of tension between both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] and the increase of [[cross-strait relations]], making a declaration of independence, or war, something unlikely.\n\nTaiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart \u2013 the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait]] (ARATS) signed four agreements in Taipei on 4 November 2008. Both SEF and ARATS have agreed to address direct sea links, daily charter flights, direct postal service and food safety.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan reached deals with China at the expense of sovereignty and democracy|publisher=[[European Federation of Taiwanese Associations|EFTA]]|date=6 November 2008|url=http://www.eutaiwan.org/en2.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Public opinion ===\nPublic opinion in Taiwan regarding relations with the PRC is notoriously difficult to gauge, as poll results tend to be extremely sensitive to how the questions are phrased and what options are given, and there is a tendency by all political parties to [[spin (politics)|spin]] the results to support their point of view.<ref>Lin, Yitzu, and Hsieh, John Fuh-Sheng. \u201cChange and Continuity in Taiwan\u2019s Public Opinion on the Cross-Strait Economic Interactions.\u201d Journal of Asian and African Studies, vol. 52, no. 8, SAGE Publications, Dec. 2017, pp. 1103\u201316, d oi:10.1177/0021909616649210.</ref>\n\nAccording to a November 2005 poll from the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], 37.7% of people living in the ROC favor maintaining the status quo until a decision can be made in the future, 18.4% favors maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 14% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual independence, 12% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual reunification, 10.3% favors independence as soon as possible, and 2.1% favors reunification as soon as possible.

In other words, if reunification supporters wanted to reunify Taiwan with mainland China in such a way that would effectively abolish the ROC or affect the ROC's sovereignty, or if independence supporters wanted to abolish the ROC and establish a Republic of Taiwan, they would also need to amend or abolish the ROC constitution and redraft a new constitution.  Passing an amendment requires an unusually broad political consensus, which includes approval from three-quarters of a quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan.  This quorum requires at least three-quarters of all members of the Legislature.  After passing the legislature, the amendments need ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC, ''irrespective'' of voter turnout.\n\nGiven these harsh constitutional requirements, neither the pan-greens nor pan-blues can unilaterally change Taiwan's political and legal status with respect to the ROC's constitution.  However, extreme Taiwan independence supporters view the ROC's constitution as illegal and therefore believe that amendments to the ROC constitution are an invalid way to change Taiwan's political status.\n\n== Note on terminology ==\n\n=== Political status vs. Taiwan issue or Mainland issue ===\nSome scholarly sources as well as political entities like the PRC refer to Taiwan's controversial status as the \"Taiwan question\", \"Taiwan issue\", or \"Taiwan problem\".  The ROC government does not like these terminologies, emphasizing that it should be called the \"'''Mainland issue'''\" or \"Mainland question\", because from the ROC's point of view, the PRC is making an issue out of or creating a problem out of Taiwan.  Others use the term \"Taiwan Strait Issue\" because it implies nothing about sovereignty and because \"[[Cross-Strait relations]]\" is a term used by both the ROC and the PRC to describe their interactions. However, this term is also objectionable to some because it still implies that there is an issue, which they feel is created only by the PRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n=== ''De facto'' vs. ''de jure'' and whether ROC ceased to exist ===\nThe use of the terms ''de facto'' and ''[[de jure]]'' to describe Taiwan's as well as the Republic of China's status as a state is itself a contentious issue. This partially stems from the lack of precedents regarding derecognized, but still constitutionally functioning states. For instance, it is argued by Jacques deLisle that Taiwan satisfies three of the four requirements of statehood at international law as stated in the [[Montevideo Convention]]. A state must have distinct and substantial territory which Taiwan is capable of satisfying since it is an island and controls few surrounding islands such as Penghu and Green Island. A state must also have a distinct population and substantial population which Taiwan satisfies by having a population of around 23 million people. A state must also have a government that provides order, does not answer to a higher government or government abroad, thus protecting its relative sovereignty, which Taiwan or the Republic of China satisfies. However, as Delisle states, \u201cThe fourth criterion for state status, according to the Montevideo Convention and customary international law, is the capacity to engage in relations with other states. Here, Taiwan has some troubles on the \u201cformal\u201d side.  No other country formally recognizes Taiwan as a separate state and only a small number of countries (now twenty-three) either recognize the ROC government or merely maintain formal diplomatic relations with it.\u201d <ref>[https://www.fpri.org/docs/media/201107.delisle.taiwan.pdf desLisle, J. (2011). Taiwan: Sovereignty and Participation in International Organizations. Foreign Policy Research Institute: A Catalyst for Ideas, E-Notes. Pg. 1-5. Pg. 1, Par. 3, Lines 1-5.]</ref>\nAt the same time, there is continued debate on whether UN membership or recognition as a state by the UN is a decisive feature of statehood (since it represents broad recognition by the international community); the debate arises because non-state entities can often satisfy the Montevideo Convention factors, while the list of states recognised by the UN, for the most part, correlates well with entities recognised as states by [[customary international law]]. If the latter argument is accepted, then the Republic of China may have ceased to be a state post-1971 as a matter of international law (\"''de jure''\"), yet continued to otherwise function as the state that it previously was recognised as (\"''de facto''\").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, media wire services sometimes describe Taiwan as having de facto independence, whereas the Republic of China has always considered itself as a continuously functioning ''de jure'' state.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Taiwan}}\n{{wikinewspar2|Pentagon report reflects concerns over China's increased military|Chinese General threatens U.S. with nuclear weapons over possible Taiwan Strait conflict, Beijing downplays comment}}\n\n* [[History of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|History of Taiwan under Japanese rule]]\n* [[History of Republic of China]]\n* [[Chinese Civil War]]\n* [[Secession in China]]\n* [[228 Incident]], for historical context of ROC-Taiwanese conflict\n* [[Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan]]\n* [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan Province]]\n* [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Claimed Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan independence]]\n* [[Cross-Strait Unification]]\n* [[Cross-Strait relations]]\n* [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Military Power of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC\n* [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the PRC\n* [[Foreign relations of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan in United Nations]]\n* [[Taiwan Relations Act]]\n* [[Three Communiqu\u00e9s]]\n* [[51st state#Taiwan]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bush, R. & O'Hanlon, M.

Twelve days later it was transferred to Camp Cameron in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|North Cambridge]].\n\nLeaving Massachusetts June 15, on the 17th it reached Washington<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Assigned to Richardson's Brigade of Tyler's Division<ref name=\"OoB\" />. , it remained in camp near Washington until the advance to Bull Run where it participated in the battle at Blackburn's Ford, July 18, three days before the main battle of Bull Run.\n\nIn August it became a part of the famous Hooker Brigade. During the fall it was encamped for some time at Bladensburg, did duty on the Potomac above Washington, built Fort Lincoln, moved to Budd's Ferry, and was variously engaged until spring when it became a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, Heintzelman's (3d) Corps, and was transferred to the Peninsula.\n\nOn April 6 it was in action before Yorktown, and on May 5 it suffered heavily at Williamsburg. It was encamped in the White Oak Swamp region until June 25 when it was engaged with loss at Fair Oaks. During the Seven Days battles it lost heavily at Glendale, June 30, its major, Charles P. Chandler being killed. After the battle of Malvern Hill it retired to Harrison's Landing where it remained until August when it was ordered back to the defenses of Washington.\n\nJoining Gen. Pope's army near Warrenton Jc., as a part of Grover's Brigade, Hooker's Division, it was in action at Bristoe Station, Aug. 27, and again near Groveton (Manassas), Aug. 29, where it assaulted the celebrated railroad embankment and suffered severe loss. After the campaign was ended the regiment remained in or near the defenses of Washington until the last of October. About this time Gen. Carr succeeded Gen. Grover in command of the brigade.

In a book he said that Camberwell Beauty catches in England were suspiciously concentrated around London, [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Harwich]], all these being ports in the timber trade with [[Scandinavia]], and theorized that they had hibernated in stacks of timber which was then shipped to England, and had not traveled naturally.\n\n==Morphology ==\n[[File: Nymphalidae - Nymphalis antiopa (caterpillar) .jpg|thumb|220px|left|Caterpillar of ''Nymphalis antiopa'']]\n\n===Eggs===\nMourning cloak eggs are amber-yellow or pale olive-green when first laid.<ref name=\"subspecies\">{{cite journal|last=Belicek|first=Joseph|title=Notes on the Holotype of Nymphalis antiopa hyperborea|date=12 February 2013|url=http://www.butterfliesofamerica.com/docs/Nymphalis-antiopa-hyperborea-f3.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref> Upon further development, the coloration of the eggs will change, becoming lilac-pink, and darkening to almost black, as they mature prior to hatching.<ref name=\"fcps\" /> The eggs are generally 0.7 by 0.9&nbsp;mm in size.<ref name=\"umich\" /> Laid on terminal shoots of the larval food-plant, encircling the stem.
