He graduated from [[Helsinki Polytechnic Institute]] in 1894 and immediately won a major design competition for a church in [[Turku]], [[St Michael's Church, Turku|St Michael's Church]], ahead of many established architects. The church was designed in the prevailing [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic style]]. However, Sonck's style would soon go through a dramatic change, in the direction of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[National Romanticism]] that was moving through Europe at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s, Sonck would also design a number of buildings in the emerging [[Nordic Classicism]] style.\n\n==Architecture and town planning== \n[[File:Lars Sonck, T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 competition drawing, Helsinki, 1899.jpg|thumb|right|200px|T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 competition drawing, Helsinki, Lars Sonck, 1899.]]\nA prominent figure in Finland's search for architectural identity - at a period when Finland was a Grand Duchy under the control of Russia and Finnish politicians, intellectuals and artists were defining a distinct national identity - Sonck played a leading role in the development of [[National Romantic style|National Romanticism]], along with such other architects as [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]], and [[Eliel Saarinen]]. This style of architecture is often seen as part of the Art Nouveau style or Jugendstil, but shows influences from [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architecture as well as elements borrowed from the historical tradition of Finland's medieval stone structures and residential wooden architecture. Among Sonck's well-known works in the neo-Romanesque style are [[Kallio Church]], Helsinki (1912) and [[Kultaranta]], the President of Finland's official summer residence in Naantali (1920); in the Jugendstil style are [[Tampere Cathedral]], Tampere (1907) the Eira Hospital, Helsinki (1905) and \"[[Ainola]]\" (1903), the family home for the composer [[Jean Sibelius]] in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4; in the [[Nordic Classicism]] style are the housing blocks on Museokatu Street, in [[T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6]], Helsinki (c. 1920) and the [[Mikael Agricola Church]], Helsinki (1935).\n\nSonck was also active in city planning theory debate, between the picturesque theories of Austrian theorist [[Camillo Sitte]] versus fellow Austrian [[Otto Wagner]]. Sonck favoured the former approach. The debate came to a head in Finland in the first ever town planning design competition in 1898-1900 for the T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 district of Helsinki. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize to Gustaf Nystr\u00f6m, second prize to Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck, Bertil Jung and Valter Thom\u00e9. A fantastic sketch accompanying Sonck's competition entry gives an indication of the imagery he was aiming for, inspired by his travels in Germany. Historian Pekka Korvenmaa makes the point that leading theme was the creation of the atmosphere of medieval urban environments - and Sonck later designed a similar proposal in 1904 to rearrange the immediate surroundings of St.Michael's Church in Helsinki, with numerous \"fantastic\" spired buildings.<ref>Pekka Korvenmaa, ''Innovation versus Tradition: The Architect Lars Sonck - Works and Projects 1900-1900'', Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistyksen aikakauskirja, Helsinki, 1991, p.41.</ref> In the T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 competition, undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nystr\u00f6m and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nystr\u00f6m's spacious street network and elements of Sonck's Sittesque details. The final plan (1916) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in the restrained Nordic Classicism style along a curving street line, designed by Sonck. A still wider new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck.\n\n==Gallery of Lars Sonck's works==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:St Michael's Church, Turku.jpg|[[St Michael's Church, Turku]] (1899\u20131905)\nFile:Building at crossing of Uudenmaankatu and Frederikinkatu in Helsinki.jpg|Uudenmaankatu 25 / Frederikinkatu 35, [[Helsinki]] (1900)\nFile:Tampereen tuomiokirkko kes\u00e4 2004 IMG 2328.jpg|[[Tampere Cathedral]] (1902\u20131907)\nFile:Ainola yard.jpg|[[Ainola]], Jean Sibelius' home (1904)\nFile:Korkeavuorenkatu 35, Helsinki - DSC05585.JPG|Headquarters of the Helsinki Telephone Association (1903\u20131907)\nFile:Eiran sairaala Helsingiss\u00e4.jpg|[[Eira Hospital]], Helsinki (1905)\nFile:Kauniainen - Villa Vallmog\u00e5rd.jpg|Villa Vallmog\u00e5rd, [[Kauniainen]] (1907)\nFile:Kallio church, Helsinki 2004-06.jpg|[[Kallio Church]] in Helsinki (1908\u20131912)\nFile:Lars Sonck, Helsinki Stock Exchange.jpg|[[Helsinki Stock Exchange]] (1911)\nFile:Sofiankatu 4.jpg|Former [[Helsinki City Museum]] building (Sofiankatu 4, 1913)\nFile:Hotel Grand Marina.JPG|Hotel Grand Marina, Helsinki (1913)\nFile:Kultaranta 1920.jpg|[[Kultaranta]], President of Finland summer residence, Naantali (1920)\nFile:HelsinkiMuseokatu.jpg|Museokatu street, T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6, Helsinki (1920)\nFile:Tehtaankatu, 11-13.jpg|Tehtaankatu 11\u201313, Helsinki (1925\u20131929)\nFile:Kyrkan i Mariehamn 1..jpg|Church in [[Mariehamn]] (1929)\nFile:Helsinki Mikael Agricola church.jpg|[[Mikael Agricola Church]], Helsinki (1935)\nFile:MariehamnH\u00f6gskola.JPG|H\u00f6gskola, Mariehamn (1937\u201338)\nFile:Mariehamns stadshus May 2016 01.jpg|City Hall, Mariehamn (1939)\nFile:20190524 manor-house-museum-lars-sonck.jpg|alt=Round windows were a trade of the architect|House drawn for the architect's cousin in Kurkijoki, [[Karelia|Ladoga Karelia]] (1914)\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Architecture of Finland]]\n{{Commons category|Lars Sonck}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonck, Lars}}\n[[Category:1870 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Kokkola]]\n[[Category:People from Vaasa Province (Grand Duchy of Finland)]]\n[[Category:Swedish-speaking Finns]]\n[[Category:Finnish architects]]\n[[Category:Art Nouveau architects]]\n[[Category:Lars Sonck buildings| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n{{Infobox architect\n|name=Lars Sonck\n|image=Lars Sonck.jpg\n|caption=\n|nationality=[[Finns|Finnish]]\n|birth_name=Lars Eliel Sonck\n|birth_date={{Birth date|df=yes|1870|8|10}}\n|birth_place=[[K\u00e4lvi\u00e4]], Finland\n|death_date={{Death date and age|df=yes|1956|3|14|1870|8|10}}\n|death_place=Helsinki, Finland\n|practice=\n|significant_buildings=[[Tampere Cathedral]], Tampere<br />Eira Hospital, Helsinki<br />[[Kallio Church]], Helsinki<br />Stock Exchange, Helsinki\n|significant_projects=\"Sonck quartier\", T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6, Helsinki\n|significant_design=\n|awards=\n}}\n\n'''Lars Eliel Sonck''' (10 August 1870 \u2013 14 March 1956) was a Finnish [[architect]].

The character was created by artists [[William Dozier]], [[Julius Schwartz]], and [[Carmine Infantino]]. At the request of the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, DC editor Schwartz called for a new female counterpart to the superhero [[Batman]] that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as '''[[Batgirl]]''' in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, titled \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\" (January 1967), by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino,<ref>{{Citation|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|editor-last=Dolan |editor-first=Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 122 |quote = Nine months before making her debut on ''Batman'', a new Batgirl appeared in the pages of ''Detective Comics''...Yet the idea she is also seen as batmans secretary on the debut of Barbara Gordon, according to editor Julius Schwartz, was attributed to the television series executives' desire to have a character that would appeal to a female audience and for this character to originate in the comics. Hence, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino collaborated on \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\"}}</ref> allowing her to be introduced into the television series in the season 3 premiere \"[[Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin]]\", in September that same year.\n\nBarbara Gordon is the daughter of [[Gotham City]] police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], the sister of [[James Gordon Jr.]], and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in ''[[Batman Family]]'' which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]]. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in ''Batgirl Special'' #1, the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' depicts the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in [[paraplegia]]. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a [[technical advisor]], [[Hacker|computer expert]] and [[information broker]] known as '''Oracle'''. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' series. Reverting the character to her Batgirl persona, DC Comics relaunched its comic book titles in 2011 during [[The New 52]] event, featuring her in the eponymous ''Batgirl'' monthly title as well as ''Birds of Prey''. These changes were retained for the second company wide relaunch in 2016 known as [[DC Rebirth]].\n\nThe character was a popular comic book figure during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], due to her appearances in the ''Batman'' television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] under the ''Birds of Prey'' publication and as a disabled icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of ''The Killing Joke'', which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.\n\nAs both Batgirl and Oracle, Barbara Gordon has been featured in various adaptations related to the [[Batman franchise media|Batman franchise]], including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character has been portrayed by [[Yvonne Craig]], [[Dina Meyer]] and Jet\u00e9 Laurence, and has been voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]], [[Tara Strong]], Danielle Judovits, [[Alyson Stoner]], [[Mae Whitman]], [[Kimberly Brooks]], [[Ashley Greene]] and [[Rosario Dawson]], among others. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\".<ref name=\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\">{{citation | url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/17 | title= Top 100 Comic Book Heroes | publisher=IGN Entertainment | accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n===''Detective Comics'', ''Batman Family'' and other appearances (1967\u20131988)===\n[[File:Detective Comics 359 (Jan. 1967).jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl\".

The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.\n\nThe cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time.

Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl.\"<ref name=\"LINE OF FIRE REVIEWS: Batman Gotham Knights #12\"/> In an article for ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine entitled \"The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence\", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: \"Both had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight].

Ross explained in an interview that he and Dini had planned to restore her mobility by placing her in a [[Lazarus Pit]], a naturally occurring chemical pool in the DC Universe that has rejuvenating effects when a person is submerged within it. He stated that \"we pitched then-Batman editor [[Denny O'Neil]] with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character&nbsp;... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character. The theory was that DC didn't have enough handicapped characters, so they weren't going to do anything with Barbara as she was.

In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon is not limited to the Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President [[Dan DiDio]] comments, \"Some stories&nbsp;... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime.

Marc Dipaolo, author of ''War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film'' (2011) commented that DC writers and editors would not allow her to recover completely, and that \"[t]he decision was made because there were not enough handicapped superheroes in the DC Universe to justify 'curing' one, and because it would have been odd to see Barbara Gordon escape from her wheelchair in the world of fiction when [[Christopher Reeve]] never had that opportunity.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Marc Dipaolo|title=War, Politics and Superheroes: Ethics and Propaganda in Comics and Film|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|page=145|isbn=978-0-7864-4718-3}}</ref>\n\n===Restoration of the character's mobility and aftermath===\nIn June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles.

Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It's that type of honesty I expect more of&nbsp;... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I've seen in a long time.\"<ref name=\"OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be\"/> Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed.<ref name=\"Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL & ORACLE\">{{citation|author=Jill Pantozzi|title=Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL & ORACLE|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/gail-simone-dicusses-batgirl-and-oracle-110609.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing ''Batgirl'' with Gordon as the title character was that \"[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow.

Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of [[Purple Ray|purple rays]] and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed.

O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, \"[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals&nbsp;...

Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular characters to have emerged during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> In ''The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines'' (2009), author Mike Madrid states: \"While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs.\"<ref name=\"supergirls\"/> Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections.<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\">{{citation|author=Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse/page/724 724\u2013726]|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1|url=https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse/page/724}}</ref> Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair \"tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative\u2014not to say dowdy\u2014clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day\u2014busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior.\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that \"[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt[.]\"<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\"/>\n\n===Bronze Age===\nIn spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, \"by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts\". Her color scheme from the '' Adventures of Batman'' cartoon are used as her primary outfit.<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\"/> However, by the end of the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]] in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise \"where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels\".<ref name=\"Spy\"/> In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\"/>\n\n===Modern Age===\nRobin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews'' notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in ''Batman: The Killing Joke'', stating, \"Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings.\"<ref name=\"RAR\"/> Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer [[Devin Grayson]] stated that being \"[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind.\"<ref name=\"The Superhero Book\">{{citation|author=Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|pages=|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse}}</ref>\n\nA defining characteristic of Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's ''Birds of Prey'' issue #10, \"State of War\", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated in an interview that \"[s]he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it.

Commenting on Barbara Gordon's eventual evolution into Oracle, she states \"[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a 'better' character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that 'better' character.\"<ref name=\"RAR\"/>\n\nIn ''Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks'' (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that \"[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material\", calling the work \"sadistic to the core.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Sharon Packer|title=Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|page=201|isbn=978-0-313-35536-3}}</ref> Brian Cronin noted that \"[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out.\"<ref name=\"Spy\"/> Jeffrey A. Brown, author of ''Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture'' (2011) noted ''The Killing Joke'' as an example of the \"inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry\" in light of the \"relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.\"<ref name=\"curves\"/> While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage.<ref name=\"curves\"/> Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, \"if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly.\"<ref name=\"RAR\"/>\n\nDespite views that present the character's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman \"rather than standing alone as leader, such as [[Wonder Woman]]\" who had no pre-existing male counterpart.<ref name=\"Girl Culture\"/> In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, \"while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names\" such as the Batgirl character.<ref>{{citation|author1=[[Becky Francis]] |author2=Christine Skelton |title=Reassessing Gender and Achievement: Questioning Contemporary Key Debates|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2005|page=146|isbn=978-0-415-33324-5}}</ref> Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at [[Marquette University]], stated that Barbara Gordon's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman's protege, \"she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she's still basically following in Batman's footsteps.\"<ref name=\"endure\"/> Following ''The Killing Joke'', her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of ''Birds of Prey'', \"we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman.\"<ref name=\"endure\"/>\n\n===Representation for library and information science===\nIn ''The Image and Role of the Librarian'' (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a \"career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up.\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> In the essay \"Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality\" (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that \"[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given.\"<ref>{{citation|first=Abigail |last=Luthmann|title=Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality|journal=Library Review|volume=56|issue=9|pages=773\u201380 |doi=10.1108/00242530710831211|year=2007}}</ref> Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, \"[a]s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life).\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel note that Oracle exerts her influence over the DC Universe primarily from home, putting \"to full use the information science skills [she] learned on her way to her PhD\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> In her new persona, \"the physically challenged but superbly resourceful Oracle occupies a unique place in the annals of superhero-dom\u2014the 'information goddess' as crime stopper.\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> Using Barbara Gordon in her role as Oracle, author Sean Wise asserts her character as a model for [[business networking]]. In ''How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work'' (2008) he states that \"[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Sean Wise|title=How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtobebusinesss0000wise/page/151 151]|isbn=978-0-399-53456-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howtobebusinesss0000wise/page/151}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the [[American Library Association]] and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy. These efforts frequently involve Barbara Gordon. In 2004, artist Gene Ha created a poster and bookmark that depicted Barbara Gordon walking in a library.

In ''Unleashing the Superhero in Us All'' (2008), author T. James Musler notes that \"[f]or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable\" citing [[Franklin D.

South's chapter \"Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism\" in the 2004 book ''Superheroes and Philosophy'' analyzes how the changes in her life \"from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle\" drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral [[Perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]].<ref>{{citation |author=James B.

She also appears in ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'' voiced by [[Mae Whitman]] in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as [[Batgirl]].

It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis at the hands of the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: \"She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs&nbsp;... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied [[Arnis|escrima]] (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries.

The character was created by artists [[William Dozier]], [[Julius Schwartz]], and [[Carmine Infantino]]. At the request of the producers of the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series, DC editor Schwartz called for a new female counterpart to the superhero [[Batman]] that could be introduced into publication and the third season of the show simultaneously. The character subsequently made her first comic book appearance as '''[[Batgirl]]''' in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359, titled \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\" (January 1967), by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino,<ref>{{Citation|last=McAvennie|first= Michael|editor-last=Dolan |editor-first=Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 122 |quote = Nine months before making her debut on ''Batman'', a new Batgirl appeared in the pages of ''Detective Comics''...Yet the idea she is also seen as batmans secretary on the debut of Barbara Gordon, according to editor Julius Schwartz, was attributed to the television series executives' desire to have a character that would appeal to a female audience and for this character to originate in the comics. Hence, writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino collaborated on \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\"}}</ref> allowing her to be introduced into the television series in the season 3 premiere \"[[Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin]]\", in September that same year.\n\nBarbara Gordon is the daughter of [[Gotham City]] police commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], the sister of [[James Gordon Jr.]], and is initially employed as head of the Gotham City Public Library. Although the character appeared in various DC Comics publications, she was prominently featured in ''[[Batman Family]]'' which debuted in 1975, partnered with the original [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], [[Dick Grayson]]. In 1988, following the editorial retirement of the character's Batgirl persona in ''Batgirl Special'' #1, the graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' depicts the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] shooting her through the spinal cord in her civilian identity, resulting in [[paraplegia]]. In subsequent stories, the character was reestablished as a [[technical advisor]], [[Hacker|computer expert]] and [[information broker]] known as '''Oracle'''. Providing intelligence and computer hacking services to assist other superheroes, she makes her first appearance as Oracle in ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' #23 (1989) and later became a featured lead of the ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' series. Reverting the character to her Batgirl persona, DC Comics relaunched its comic book titles in 2011 during [[The New 52]] event, featuring her in the eponymous ''Batgirl'' monthly title as well as ''Birds of Prey''. These changes were retained for the second company wide relaunch in 2016 known as [[DC Rebirth]].\n\nThe character was a popular comic book figure during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], due to her appearances in the ''Batman'' television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] under the ''Birds of Prey'' publication and as a disabled icon. The character has been the subject of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of ''The Killing Joke'', which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.\n\nAs both Batgirl and Oracle, Barbara Gordon has been featured in various adaptations related to the [[Batman franchise media|Batman franchise]], including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. The character has been portrayed by [[Yvonne Craig]], [[Dina Meyer]] and Jet\u00e9 Laurence, and has been voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]], [[Tara Strong]], Danielle Judovits, [[Alyson Stoner]], [[Mae Whitman]], [[Kimberly Brooks]], [[Ashley Greene]] and [[Rosario Dawson]], among others. In 2011, she was ranked 17th in [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\".<ref name=\"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes\">{{citation | url=https://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/17 | title= Top 100 Comic Book Heroes | publisher=IGN Entertainment | accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n===''Detective Comics'', ''Batman Family'' and other appearances (1967\u20131988)===\n[[File:Detective Comics 359 (Jan. 1967).jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl\".

Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating \"Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the '50s but she had nothing to do with a bat.

The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.\n\nThe cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character's history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time.

Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl.\"<ref name=\"LINE OF FIRE REVIEWS: Batman Gotham Knights #12\"/> In an article for ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine entitled \"The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence\", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes.

He stated that \"we pitched then-Batman editor [[Denny O'Neil]] with these drawings of that costume design. The idea of using the red instead of the traditional yellow was meant to invoke the idea that coming from the Lazarus Pit, she was in a way, more compromised as a character&nbsp;... Denny shot it down, because, according to him, everybody loves Barbara Gordon as Oracle and as a handicapped character.

Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with [[muscular dystrophy]], stated that \"people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It's that type of honesty I expect more of&nbsp;... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I've seen in a long time.\"<ref name=\"OP/ED: ORACLE Is Stronger Than BATGIRL Will Ever Be\"/> Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed.<ref name=\"Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL & ORACLE\">{{citation|author=Jill Pantozzi|title=Gail, Jill and Babs: A Conversation about BATGIRL & ORACLE|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/gail-simone-dicusses-batgirl-and-oracle-110609.html|publisher=Newsarama|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing ''Batgirl'' with Gordon as the title character was that \"[a]rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of [[Purple Ray|purple rays]] and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But now, everything has changed.

O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, \"[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals&nbsp;...

Batgirl is considered to be one of the most popular characters to have emerged during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]].<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> In ''The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines'' (2009), author Mike Madrid states: \"While she embodied the spirit of a new wave of liberated superheroines, in the backdrop of the history of comic books, Batgirl carried on the tradition of the gutsy female vigilantes of the '40s who struck out on their own to right wrongs.\"<ref name=\"supergirls\"/> Although she is discouraged by Batman to engage in crime-fighting, she defiantly ignores his objections.<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\">{{citation|author=Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse/page/724 724\u2013726]|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1|url=https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse/page/724}}</ref> Her career choice as a librarian is speculated to be due in part to the fact that it works as a convincing cover for her much more dangerous work as Batgirl. In an effort to conceal her identity from not only her enemies, but her father, Commissioner Gordon, and Batman and Robin, she initially conforms to appearance and personality traits stereotypical of a librarian. In her civilian identity, she is seen with her hair \"tied up tightly in a bun. And she wears traditionally conservative\u2014not to say dowdy\u2014clothing. In other words, she embodies the stereotypical image of the female librarian of the day\u2014busy doing clerical tasks while attired and made up in such a way as to guarantee to minimize whatever physical attractiveness she might possess beneath her frumpy exterior.\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> Although her introduction was intended to embody feminist ideology, aspects of her persona were also considered to be sexist, such as the fact that \"[m]uch of her arsenal was carried in a Bat-purse attached to her utility belt[.]\"<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\"/>\n\n===Bronze Age===\nIn spite of shortcomings in her characterization during the late 1960s, \"by the early 1970s, Batgirl had matured, using her keen intellect, athletic dexterity, and burgeoning detective skills to solve petty and not-so-petty thefts\". Her color scheme from the '' Adventures of Batman'' cartoon are used as her primary outfit.<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\"/> However, by the end of the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]] in the mid-1980s (and with the dark, gritty influence of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s work on the Batman-related titles), Batgirl became less valuable to the franchise \"where there was not as much room for a librarian fighting crime in high heels\".<ref name=\"Spy\"/> In this environment, Barbara Gordon becomes increasingly skeptical of her effectiveness as Batgirl until she decides to give up crime-fighting permanently.<ref name=\"Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu\"/>\n\n===Modern Age===\nRobin Anne Reid, in her 2008 book, ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews'' notes a lack of characterization given to Barbara Gordon by Alan Moore in ''Batman: The Killing Joke'', stating, \"Barbara Gordon was not portrayed as the intelligent and resourceful woman who assumed the Batgirl persona; she was portrayed as a cocoa-serving homemaker overly concerned with the mess her father was making cutting and pasting news clippings.\"<ref name=\"RAR\"/> Following the character's recreation as Oracle, she is shown having overcome her paralysis at the hands of the Joker by utilizing her intellect to once again engage in crime-fighting as an information broker. Speaking on her characterization as a person living with a disability, comic writer [[Devin Grayson]] stated that being \"[h]yper-defensive about her [paralysis], she has, if anything, over compensated. However, her very determination to remain self-reliant, though admirable and inspiring, has made her less willing than ever to accept support or aid of any kind.\"<ref name=\"The Superhero Book\">{{citation|author=Gina Ren\u00e9e Misiroglu|title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes|publisher=Visible Ink Press|year=2004|pages=|isbn=978-1-57859-154-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/superherobookult0000unse}}</ref>\n\nA defining characteristic of Barbara Gordon is her sense of morality, which differs from that of Batman and her primary field agent Black Canary. She has demonstrated a willingness to use lethal force, such as in Chuck Dixon's ''Birds of Prey'' issue #10, \"State of War\", which contradicts the methodology used by her closest allies and most DC Comics characters. Dixon stated in an interview that \"[s]he's less morally conflicted than other characters. She's very 'means to an end' oriented. She sees that sometimes you have to kill to save lives. She's not comfortable with that but accepts it.

She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that.

Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used a wide variety of computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included an infrared scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle.

Throughout the course of the character's history, Barbara Gordon's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes.

Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, \"she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden.\"<ref name=\"supergirls\"/> Because she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, \"Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male.\"<ref name=\"supergirls\"/> Historian [[Peter Sanderson]] observed that while \"Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian&nbsp;... her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s.

Robin Anne Reid, in ''Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews'' (2009), wrote that \"Kesel's version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her ''Secret Origins'' (1987) and ''Batgirl Special'' (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore's acclaimed ''The Killing Joke'' (1988).\"<ref name=\"RAR\">{{citation|author=Robin Anne Reid|title=Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|pages=88, 89|isbn=978-0-313-33591-4}}</ref> She notes that Kesel's interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear. Commenting on Barbara Gordon's eventual evolution into Oracle, she states \"[m]any readers and individuals within the industry believe that Barbara Gordon became a 'better' character after she was paralyzed, but few people comment on specifics of the event that allowed her to become that 'better' character.\"<ref name=\"RAR\"/>\n\nIn ''Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks'' (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that \"[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon's] accident is advised to consult the source material\", calling the work \"sadistic to the core.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Sharon Packer|title=Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2010|page=201|isbn=978-0-313-35536-3}}</ref> Brian Cronin noted that \"[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out.\"<ref name=\"Spy\"/> Jeffrey A. Brown, author of ''Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture'' (2011) noted ''The Killing Joke'' as an example of the \"inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry\" in light of the \"relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.\"<ref name=\"curves\"/> While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage.<ref name=\"curves\"/> Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, \"if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly.\"<ref name=\"RAR\"/>\n\nDespite views that present the character's Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman \"rather than standing alone as leader, such as [[Wonder Woman]]\" who had no pre-existing male counterpart.<ref name=\"Girl Culture\"/> In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, \"while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names\" such as the Batgirl character.<ref>{{citation|author1=[[Becky Francis]] |author2=Christine Skelton |title=Reassessing Gender and Achievement: Questioning Contemporary Key Debates|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=2005|page=146|isbn=978-0-415-33324-5}}</ref> Professor James B. South, chairman of the Department of Philosophy at [[Marquette University]], stated that Barbara Gordon's character development as Oracle gave her a sense of independence she could not achieve as Batgirl. During her tenure as Batman's protege, \"she seems to develop her own style of fighting as Batgirl, [but] she's still basically following in Batman's footsteps.\"<ref name=\"endure\"/> Following ''The Killing Joke'', her recreation as Oracle, and the launch of ''Birds of Prey'', \"we see Barbara Gordon as a team leader and her transformation from a girl into a woman.\"<ref name=\"endure\"/>\n\n===Representation for library and information science===\nIn ''The Image and Role of the Librarian'' (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that her portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it in order to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a \"career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up.\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> In the essay \"Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality\" (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that \"[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given.\"<ref>{{citation|first=Abigail |last=Luthmann|title=Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality|journal=Library Review|volume=56|issue=9|pages=773\u201380 |doi=10.1108/00242530710831211|year=2007}}</ref> Unlike her earlier incarnation as Batgirl, \"[a]s Oracle, Barbara Gordon is arguably the first true librarian-as-super-hero yet seen in a mainstream comic book (as opposed to a super-hero who happens to be a librarian in his/her private life).\"<ref name=\"The Image and Role of the Librarian\"/> Wendi Arant and Candace R.

In ''How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work'' (2008) he states that \"[o]ver the last decade, Oracle has shown the power of a strong network of contacts, and in doing so she shows Business Superheroes the importance of cultivating contacts and developing assets that can further their collective goals.\"<ref>{{citation|author=Sean Wise|title=How to Be a Business Superhero: Prepare for Everything, Train with the Best, Make Your Own Destiny at Work|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2008|page=[https://archive.org/details/howtobebusinesss0000wise/page/151 151]|isbn=978-0-399-53456-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howtobebusinesss0000wise/page/151}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, the [[American Library Association]] and DC Comics have collaborated on multiple projects to promote literacy.

As it looked like Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he could not be physically able to compete. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock.

Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to \"play ball\" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, [[Groin attack|punch]] his boss in the \"[[Testicles|corporate grapefruits]]\" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\" ([[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]].<ref name=slam/> Austin lost the WWF Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War''.<ref name=slam/> Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship<ref name=slam/> and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on [[Judgment Day: In Your House]]. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at \"gunpoint\", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read \"Bang! 3:16\". During that segment, McMahon also learned that Stone Cold was later re-signed by his son, [[Shane McMahon]]. In the semifinals of the [[Survivor Series]] tournament to award the vacant WWF Championship, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', [[Mills Lane|Judge Mills Lane]] ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. However, because the title would not change hands via disqualification, The Rock still kept the championship. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Steve Austin soaks in cheers.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin celebrates with [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Earl Hebner]]]]\nAustin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On ''Raw Is War'', McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announcers' table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last-minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.<ref name=slam/>\n\nWith McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot the next night on ''Raw Is War''. At [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a [[Steel Cage match|steel cage match]], with the WWF Championship opportunity at [[WrestleMania XV]] at stake.<ref name=slam/> During the match, [[Big Show|Paul Wight]] made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin.

During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]]. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Linda McMahon]] made Austin the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap [[ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on ''Raw Is War'' and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]], where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Rivalry with Triple H and The Alliance (1999\u20132001) ====\n{{main|The Power Trip|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l1=Two-Man Power Trip|l2=The Invasion|l3=The Alliance}}\n[[File:Me&austin.jpg|thumb|Austin with a fan]]\nAustin held on to the WWF Championship until [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring [[Triple H]].<ref name=slam/> Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on ''Raw Is War''. Austin would get his rematch at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer shot meant for Triple H. When [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]] rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, at the event, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot.<ref name=slam/> Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]], due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at [[Summerslam (1997)|SummerSlam]] two years prior.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shoop|first1=Stephen A|last2=Falcon|first2=Mike|title=Piledriver slams Austin into surgery|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/health/doctor/lhdoc051.htm|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 14, 1999}}</ref> He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle being used to [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#write off|write him off television]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nIn April 2000, Austin appeared at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin down at Survivor Series.<ref name=slam/> [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] admitted to being the driver because \"he did it for The Rock\". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with Austin gone, The Rock, a fellow Samoan, would finally be able to ascend to the top of the company. At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], Austin faced Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin attempted to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, with the match being deemed no contest. Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and [[Kurt Angle]], Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head and revealed it was him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's car with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet.

In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, [[Debra Marshall|Debra]], being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], Austin faced The Rock for the second time. Just before the match began, it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside. He then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin with a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time.<ref name=slam/> After the match, Austin shook hands with Mr. McMahon, turning Austin heel.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nHe altered his character considerably over the next few months; in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him, even going so far as to hug him and bring him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. After teasing a face turn, Triple H instead turned on The Rock. Together, Austin and Triple H viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on ''SmackDown!'', when, during an interview with [[Jim Ross]] about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves [[The Power Trip|The Two-Man Power Trip]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin and Triple H ran roughshod over all their opponents, until coming up against The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin and Triple H wrestled against [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle.<ref name=slam/> As planned, the team lost the tag team titles at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer, but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's ''SmackDown!'', criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], he repeatedly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface. Though he did not wrestle as he was nursing a hand injury, he continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the ''SmackDown!'' preceding King of the Ring against the [[Dudley Boyz]]. At King of the Ring, Austin defeated Jericho and Benoit in a Triple Threat match, despite interference from the debuting [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. Stone Cold suffered a back injury during the match after Booker T dropped Stone Cold through the announcer's table.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin's signature ring entrance at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]\nAfter King of the Ring, Austin was left without a feud as Benoit was lost for the next year after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, [[History of World Championship Wrestling#Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath|the purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW)]] by McMahon began to bear fruit as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|alliance]] with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying tag-along. Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring \"the old Stone Cold\" back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming [[WWF Invasion|InVasion]] pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of ''Raw Is War'' he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]] against the team of WCW's Booker T and [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and ECW's [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and [[The Dudley Boyz]]. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again.<ref name=\"slam\" /> The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, that he was trying to get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted that he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAustin lost his title to Angle at [[Unforgiven (2001)|Unforgiven]] by submitting to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch due to his hand being under the ropes. Austin received that rematch on October 8 episode of ''Raw'' and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance.<ref name=\"slam\" /> Austin then began feuding with Alliance member [[Rob Van Dam]], who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]] later that month and won by pinning the latter. On October 29 episode of ''Raw'', Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] was coming up<ref name=\"slam\" /> and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam, and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and [[Big Show]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAt Survivor Series, Austin was one of the last two wrestlers in the match, with The Rock being the other, and was the last remaining hope for the Alliance to survive. Late in the match, Austin attempted to win the match with the Rock Bottom, the Rock's finishing maneuver but failed to earn a three count. He then kicked out of his own Stone Cold Stunner, which the Rock nailed on him, and attacked two referees including Alliance referee Nick Patrick. With the officials down, Angle ran to the ring and picked up Austin's title belt. He then entered the ring and struck Austin with it, betraying the Alliance and enabling The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom on Austin for the pin and the victory. With that, the InVasion ended, the Alliance was forced to disband, and Austin's future in the company was in question. Eventually, McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the title and award it to Angle for his actions. Just before he could, [[Ric Flair]] returned to the WWF for the first time since his 1993 departure and announced he was now half-owner of the company. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his title belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFlair then decided that Austin would face off against The Rock, who was still in possession of the former [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] (which was renamed the World Championship), at the upcoming [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view in December to unify the titles. However, since Austin was still feuding with Angle and Rock had an unresolved feud with Jericho over his title, McMahon overruled Flair and said that both men would wrestle their respective rivals for their respective titles at Vengeance, with the winners to face each other and the winner of that match to be crowned [[Undisputed championship|Undisputed]] WWF Champion. Austin won his first match by defeating Angle and faced World Champion Jericho in the [[Championship unification|unification match]]. Austin lost the match and his title after McMahon and Booker T interfered. Immediately after, Austin and Booker T began feuding which led to various fights in strange venues, such as a [[Confession (religion)|church confessional]], a [[bingo hall]] and a [[supermarket]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Final feuds and retirement (2002\u20132003) ====\nIn the [[Royal Rumble (2002)|2002 Royal Rumble]] on January 20, Austin entered at number nineteen and lasted until the final four, but was eliminated by Kurt Angle.

In recent years, Austin has this to say about why the match never took place: \"I guarantee you, if my head had been at a little different place, then by all rights, a [match] should have happened\", Austin told JR. \"Physically and mentally where I was at, I could go. I think Hogan probably would have been a step or two behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow myself down. I say that with all due respect to Hulk Hogan because he had a hellacious run. That was my thought process back in the day.

McMahon claimed his actions caused fury among fans who had paid to see him that night. Austin returned on April 1, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', the first of the new \"[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]\" era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]], which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]]. In a May 2002 interview on WWE's Internet program, ''Byte This!'', Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=WWE Byte This Report \u2013 Stone Cold Steve Austin|url=http://www.twnpnews.com/messages2/6000/6535.shtml|website=TWNP News|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologizing to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines. McMahon responded a week later on the same show playing down the outburst, claiming that Austin was merely the type of wrestler who was occasionally difficult to work with.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe WWE rehired [[Eddie Guerrero]] for Austin to feud with, while also prepping Austin for a feud with [[Brock Lesnar]]. However, Austin balked at the proposition that he lose a King of the Ring qualifying match on ''Raw'' to Lesnar, and ultimately walked out of the company.<ref name=trip/> Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak, and airing the match on free TV with no build-up did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of Austin's magnitude. Further fanning the flames amongst Austin's growing number of detractors was a well-publicized domestic dispute incident between Austin and his wife Debra ([[#Domestic violence cases|see below]]).<ref name=trip/>\n\nAfter Austin again [[List of professional wrestling terms#no show|no-showed]] June 10 episode of ''Raw'', his storylines were dropped.<ref name=trip>{{cite news|url=http://rattlesnake.amp-productions.com/groupfiles/Articles/2002_10_00.html|title=Austin's power trip|author=Alex Gordon|publisher=Wrestling Digest|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=October 2002}}</ref> Austin walked out again, publicly stating he felt bad storylines were presented to him by the creative team. This time his departure was for good.<ref name=trip/> McMahon, along with longtime Austin supporter and real-life friend Jim Ross, [[Bury (professional wrestling)|buried]] Austin on WWE programming, referring to him as \"taking his ball and going home\" because he was not getting his way, whilst also explaining to the fans that neither he nor Ross was able to persuade Austin to change his mind. McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on ''Raw'' that night, despite being drafted to ''SmackDown!'', and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon. Austin's merchandise continued to sell greatly in the weeks following his departure, however; with no sign of a return likely to be seen, the company stopped marketing his character and his merchandise and removed his profile from WWE.com.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFor the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with ''WWE Raw Magazine'',{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=19}} he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and how he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers,{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=22}} claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company. However, he admitted he still held strong reservations about his singles match with Hall at WrestleMania only lasting seven minutes and felt the build-up to the match did not live up to the expectations of his fans or Hall's and was angered by speculation suggesting he disagreed with [[Kevin Nash]] re-joining the company, insisting he and Nash have always been good friends.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=20}} He, however, maintained his displeasure with the storylines and creative changes the WWE had imposed around the time of his departure.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=21}}{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=26}} In an interview with Vince McMahon on his podcast in 2014, Austin revealed for the first time that McMahon had fined him $650,000 upon his return, but he was able to lower the amount to $250,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/51937-vince-mcmahon-addresses-cm-punk-on-stone-cold-podcast|title=Vince McMahon addresses CM Punk on Stone Cold Podcast|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 2, 2014|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rockaustinxix.jpg|left|thumb|Austin (left) faces off against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[WrestleMania XIX]] in Austin's last match]]\nAustin confessed he had a major rift with Triple H's role in the company upon his return in 2002 but insisted as of 2003 they resolved their issues.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=23}} Also, he claimed a brief dispute with The Rock was resolved quickly upon his return, and that none of his disputes with the talent roster continued or played the major part in his departure.{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=23}} In February, Austin returned at [[No Way Out (2003)|No Way Out]] by defeating Eric Bischoff. Austin would wrestle only one match between then and WrestleMania, in another short match against Bischoff on ''Raw''. He entered a feud with The Rock, who returned about the same time as a smug, Hollywood sell-out heel. The Rock was offended that the WWE fans voted for Austin in a WWE Magazine poll to determine the 'Superstar of the Decade'. He expressed his frustration at having never defeated Austin at WrestleMania, and challenged Austin to a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]]. Austin was then defeated by The Rock at WrestleMania XIX, in Austin's final match.<ref>{{cite web|first=John|last=Powell|title=WWE shines at WrestleMania XIX|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2003/03/31/55003.html|accessdate=December 25, 2010|work=Slam!

The next day, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com officially announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement which would see Austin appear in a non-wrestling role weekly. About Bischoff firing him on ''Raw'' that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on ''Raw'' were legitimate, and mainly related to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, which had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Sheriff of ''Raw'' (2003\u20132004) ====\n[[File:Stone Cold Steve Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin in [[Iraq]], 2003]]\nThe following month, Austin began his non-wrestling career with WWE and began a fresh storyline when he was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Raw Co-General Manager. He continued this storyline for the remainder of the year, still showing wrestling moves including the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and several exchanges of punches and kicks, although limiting regularity of these being performed. On November 17, 2003, episode of ''Raw'', Austin was \"fired\" from ''Raw'' as the result of a stipulation in a match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]] where Austin's hand-picked team of wrestlers failed to beat Bischoff's team of wrestlers. After Survivor Series, [[Mick Foley]] would become the new Co-General Manager of ''Raw'', and began a ([[kayfabe]]) petition to have Austin re-instated. Austin quickly returned to WWE television before the end of 2003 when he was part of the ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops#2003|Tribute to the Troops]]'' taped live in front of U.S. troops in [[Iraq]], posing and attacking Mr. McMahon. He returned to ''Raw'' on December 29 as its \"Sheriff\", giving a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Eric Bischoff and rehiring Shawn Michaels, who had just been \"fired\" by Bischoff.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAustin appeared on-and-off as 2004 began, culminating in him being the special guest referee for the Brock Lesnar vs. [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] match at [[WrestleMania XX]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Sporadic appearances (2005\u2013present) ====\nAustin made his first appearance on WWE programming in a year at [[WrestleMania 21]] where he was confronted by [[Roddy Piper]] in ''[[Piper's Pit]]'', until [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] interrupted to insult both.

The segment ended with Austin and Piper celebrating with beer until Austin gave Piper a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' as well. Austin was involved in the concluding segment at [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]] in which he had a beer bash with the ECW locker room and brawled with the anti-ECW invaders, led by Eric Bischoff.

On September 22, on the first-ever ''Raw'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Hart was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Austin entered the ring with five NYPD officers following and assaulted Hart. As it looked like Austin was going to fight the officers, Vince McMahon ran into the ring to lecture Austin about why he could not be physically able to compete. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested as part of the storyline. Austin was sidelined until [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]].

Austin flipped off Tyson, which led to Tyson shoving Austin much to McMahon's embarrassment, who began to publicly disapprove of the prospect of Austin as his champion.

Austin gave his answer in the form of another Stone Cold Stunner. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to \"play ball\" with McMahon, appearing in a suit and tie, with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, tell McMahon it was the last time he would see Austin dressed like this, [[Groin attack|punch]] his boss in the \"[[Testicles|corporate grapefruits]]\" and take another picture of the two of them while McMahon was doubled over in pain. In April 1998, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when Dude Love made an appearance. This led to a match between Dude Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], where Austin hit McMahon with a steel chair, then the following month they had a rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] for the WWF Championship. Austin managed to retain the title despite McMahon acting as the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\" ([[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]) as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. McMahon continued to do everything he could to ruin Austin and he finally scored a big victory for his side at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]].<ref name=slam/> Austin lost the WWF Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a First Blood match after The Undertaker accidentally hit him with a steel chair while the ref was incapacitated, despite Austin having knocked Kane unconscious and thwarted an earlier intervention by Mankind.<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin further angered McMahon by winning back the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War''.<ref name=slam/> Austin also emerged victorious against The Undertaker at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]]. In response, McMahon set up a Triple Threat match at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], where The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin at the same time. McMahon decided to vacate the WWF Championship<ref name=slam/> and award it based on a match between The Undertaker and Kane, in which Austin was the guest referee on [[Judgment Day: In Your House]]. Austin refused to count for either man and attacked both towards the end of the match. McMahon later fired him, although Austin got revenge by kidnapping McMahon and dragging him to the middle of the ring at \"gunpoint\", which ended up being a toy gun with a scroll that read \"Bang! 3:16\". During that segment, McMahon also learned that Stone Cold was later re-signed by his son, [[Shane McMahon]]. In the semifinals of the [[Survivor Series]] tournament to award the vacant WWF Championship, Austin lost to Mankind after Shane double-crossed Austin. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', [[Mills Lane|Judge Mills Lane]] ruled that The Rock had to defend his newly won WWF Championship against Austin that night, as stipulated in the new contract Austin had signed two weeks earlier with Shane. The Undertaker interfered and hit Austin with a shovel, earning Austin a disqualification victory. However, because the title would not change hands via disqualification, The Rock still kept the championship. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated The Undertaker in a Buried Alive match after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Undertaker into the grave. With this victory, Austin qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|1999 Royal Rumble]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Steve Austin soaks in cheers.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin celebrates with [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] [[Earl Hebner]]]]\nAustin's next definitive chance to exact revenge on Mr. McMahon came during the 1999 Royal Rumble match. On ''Raw Is War'', McMahon drew Austin's entry number with the obvious intention of screwing him over. Austin drew entry number one, while McMahon drew number two thanks to WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels. During the Royal Rumble match, McMahon slipped out of the ring and into the crowd as Austin chased him down. It turned out to be a trap as McMahon led Austin into the lobby restroom where he was ambushed by members of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]]. Austin was injured and taken away in an ambulance. With Austin gone and not in the Rumble match, McMahon joined the announcers' table in calling the match. Later on, however, Austin returned in an ambulance and re-entered the Royal Rumble, delivering a Stone Cold Stunner to [[Ray Traylor|Big Boss Man]] and eliminating him. With the assistance of The Corporation and a last-minute interference from The Rock, Austin was eliminated by McMahon himself, who won the 1999 Royal Rumble.<ref name=slam/>\n\nWith McMahon turning down his number-one contender spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot the next night on ''Raw Is War''. At [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a [[Steel Cage match|steel cage match]], with the WWF Championship opportunity at [[WrestleMania XV]] at stake.<ref name=slam/> During the match, [[Big Show|Paul Wight]] made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin into the side of the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor.<ref name=slam/> Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship.<ref name=slam/> Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at [[Backlash: In Your House|Backlash]], in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]]. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]] and [[Linda McMahon]] made Austin the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the company as part of the storyline. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap [[ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company he could have a title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on ''Raw Is War'' and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at [[WWF Fully Loaded 1999|Fully Loaded]], where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Rivalry with Triple H and The Alliance (1999\u20132001) ====\n{{main|The Power Trip|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l1=Two-Man Power Trip|l2=The Invasion|l3=The Alliance}}\n[[File:Me&austin.jpg|thumb|Austin with a fan]]\nAustin held on to the WWF Championship until [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] when he lost it to Mankind in a triple threat match also featuring [[Triple H]].<ref name=slam/> Triple H was originally scheduled to win his first championship at the event, but Austin refused to drop it to him, believing Triple H was not over enough with the crowd yet, so Mankind would be used as a transitional champion, dropping the title to Triple H the next night on ''Raw Is War''. Austin would get his rematch at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] against Triple H, but he lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer shot meant for Triple H. When [[Survivor Series (1999)|Survivor Series]] rolled around, Triple H was still champion. Austin was booked into a Triple Threat match for the WWF Championship against Triple H and The Rock. However, at the event, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot.<ref name=slam/> Austin then underwent neck surgery by Dr. [[Lloyd Youngblood]], due to Austin's injury from the piledriver at [[Summerslam (1997)|SummerSlam]] two years prior.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shoop|first1=Stephen A|last2=Falcon|first2=Mike|title=Piledriver slams Austin into surgery|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/health/doctor/lhdoc051.htm|accessdate=August 19, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 14, 1999}}</ref> He was away for a nine-month rehabilitation, with the car angle being used to [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#write off|write him off television]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nIn April 2000, Austin appeared at [[Backlash (2000)|Backlash]], attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. After Austin's official return at [[Unforgiven (2000)|Unforgiven]], Commissioner Mick Foley led an investigation to find out who ran Austin down at Survivor Series.<ref name=slam/> [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] admitted to being the driver because \"he did it for The Rock\". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with Austin gone, The Rock, a fellow Samoan, would finally be able to ascend to the top of the company. At [[No Mercy (2000)|No Mercy]], Austin faced Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin attempted to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, with the match being deemed no contest. Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and [[Kurt Angle]], Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head and revealed it was him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At [[Survivor Series (2000)|Survivor Series]], Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's car with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. Austin won his third [[Royal Rumble (2001)|Royal Rumble]] in January 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892|title=Stone Cold rumbles to Houston aiming to sell out Astrodome|author=Blackjack Brown|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=December 6, 2007|date=January 28, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101113130/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010128/ai_n9605892 <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=November 1, 2007}}</ref> last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at [[No Way Out (2001)|No Way Out]] in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nWith The Rock defeating Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin was set to face The Rock at WrestleMania. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, [[Debra Marshall|Debra]], being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], Austin faced The Rock for the second time. Just before the match began, it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside. He then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin with a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time.<ref name=slam/> After the match, Austin shook hands with Mr. McMahon, turning Austin heel.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nHe altered his character considerably over the next few months; in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who complained incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him, even going so far as to hug him and bring him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer. After teasing a face turn, Triple H instead turned on The Rock. Together, Austin and Triple H viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on ''SmackDown!'', when, during an interview with [[Jim Ross]] about his actions at WrestleMania, he thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves [[The Power Trip|The Two-Man Power Trip]].<ref name=slam/>\n\nAustin and Triple H ran roughshod over all their opponents, until coming up against The Undertaker and Kane. After defeating Kane and The Undertaker for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] at [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], they held the tag team titles, the WWF Championship (Austin) and the Intercontinental Championship (Triple H) all at once. At [[Judgment Day (2001)|Judgment Day]], Triple H lost his Intercontinental title to Kane. The following night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin and Triple H wrestled against [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Chris Benoit]] with the tag team titles on the line. Midway through the match, Triple H tore his quadriceps muscle.<ref name=slam/> As planned, the team lost the tag team titles at the end of the match when Triple H accidentally hit Austin in the stomach with a sledgehammer, but the injury to Triple H, which kept him out for the remainder of the year, forced the WWF to go in another direction. Austin officially broke up The Power Trip on that week's ''SmackDown!'', criticizing Triple H for his injury and for hitting him with the sledgehammer. He continued to align himself with McMahon and began feuding with Jericho and Benoit by himself, with Kurt Angle joining the group as Triple H's replacement. For most of the next month leading to [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], he repeatedly fell victim to a double submission involving Jericho's Walls of Jericho and Benoit's Crippler Crossface. Though he did not wrestle as he was nursing a hand injury, he continued to feud with the reigning tag team champions, eventually costing them the titles on the ''SmackDown!'' preceding King of the Ring against the [[Dudley Boyz]]. At King of the Ring, Austin defeated Jericho and Benoit in a Triple Threat match, despite interference from the debuting [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]. Stone Cold suffered a back injury during the match after Booker T dropped Stone Cold through the announcer's table.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[File:Austinentrance.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin's signature ring entrance at [[WrestleMania XIX]]]]\nAfter King of the Ring, Austin was left without a feud as Benoit was lost for the next year after neck surgery and Jericho moved on to other things. He began a small spat with Angle over who was McMahon's biggest supporter. Meanwhile, [[History of World Championship Wrestling#Acquisition by the World Wrestling Federation and aftermath|the purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW)]] by McMahon began to bear fruit as [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] began. McMahon was not able to fight off the invading WCW wrestlers, and when they formed an [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|alliance]] with a group of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) alumni that were signed to the WWF and both Shane and Stephanie McMahon were now aligned against their father, McMahon's empire began to crumble and he had zero help from his two biggest stars at the time. Austin made it known that he was against teaming with Angle, whom Austin saw as both a threat to his WWF Championship, as well as an annoying tag-along. Finally, a frustrated McMahon called Austin out and demanded that he bring \"the old Stone Cold\" back, even going as far as asking Austin to give him a Stone Cold Stunner, so he could effectively captain a team of WWF wrestlers in a ten-man tag team match at the upcoming [[WWF Invasion|InVasion]] pay-per-view in July. A dejected Austin initially refused, but on the following episode of ''Raw Is War'' he returned to his old ways and hit Stunners on every member of the Alliance, turning face again. At InVasion, Austin captained the WWF team consisting of himself, Angle, Jericho, and [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]] against the team of WCW's Booker T and [[Diamond Dallas Page]] and ECW's [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and [[The Dudley Boyz]]. Late in the match, however, as Angle had Booker in the ankle lock, Austin turned on Angle by Stunning him and joined the Alliance, turning Austin heel once again.<ref name=\"slam\" /> The reason why Austin did this was that he felt McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, that he was trying to get in touch with The Rock to return, and that he was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted that he return to the old Austin. Austin was immediately made the Alliance's new leader and began to feud with Angle over his WWF Championship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAustin lost his title to Angle at [[Unforgiven (2001)|Unforgiven]] by submitting to the ankle lock, but began badgering Angle for a rematch due to his hand being under the ropes. Austin received that rematch on October 8 episode of ''Raw'' and won the title after WWF Commissioner William Regal betrayed Angle and joined the Alliance.<ref name=\"slam\" /> Austin then began feuding with Alliance member [[Rob Van Dam]], who was the only member of the Alliance to be cheered by the fans despite the villainous tactics of the group. Austin faced Angle and Van Dam at [[No Mercy (2001)|No Mercy]] later that month and won by pinning the latter. On October 29 episode of ''Raw'', Angle joined the Alliance and became the second most powerful wrestler in the group. [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] was coming up<ref name=\"slam\" /> and it was ultimately decided to have a winner-take-all Survivor Series tag match with the winning team becoming the surviving entity. Austin was chosen to captain team Alliance, which consisted of Angle, Shane McMahon, Van Dam, and Booker T, against Team WWF which was captained by The Rock, who had returned the week following Austin's betrayal of the WWF at InVasion. The Rock's team included Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker and [[Big Show]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAt Survivor Series, Austin was one of the last two wrestlers in the match, with The Rock being the other, and was the last remaining hope for the Alliance to survive. Late in the match, Austin attempted to win the match with the Rock Bottom, the Rock's finishing maneuver but failed to earn a three count. He then kicked out of his own Stone Cold Stunner, which the Rock nailed on him, and attacked two referees including Alliance referee Nick Patrick. With the officials down, Angle ran to the ring and picked up Austin's title belt. He then entered the ring and struck Austin with it, betraying the Alliance and enabling The Rock to hit the Rock Bottom on Austin for the pin and the victory. With that, the InVasion ended, the Alliance was forced to disband, and Austin's future in the company was in question. Eventually, McMahon decided he was going to strip Austin of the title and award it to Angle for his actions. Just before he could, [[Ric Flair]] returned to the WWF for the first time since his 1993 departure and announced he was now half-owner of the company. Austin returned moments after this announcement and attacked Angle and McMahon for their actions. He was then handed his title belt by Flair and celebrated with him in the ring, turning him face once again.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFlair then decided that Austin would face off against The Rock, who was still in possession of the former [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] (which was renamed the World Championship), at the upcoming [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance]] pay-per-view in December to unify the titles. However, since Austin was still feuding with Angle and Rock had an unresolved feud with Jericho over his title, McMahon overruled Flair and said that both men would wrestle their respective rivals for their respective titles at Vengeance, with the winners to face each other and the winner of that match to be crowned [[Undisputed championship|Undisputed]] WWF Champion. Austin won his first match by defeating Angle and faced World Champion Jericho in the [[Championship unification|unification match]].

Austin returned on April 1, 2002 episode of ''Raw'', the first of the new \"[[WWE brand extension|brand extension]]\" era. The show was centered on which show he would sign with, and he ultimately chose Raw. Austin entered a feud with The Undertaker that resulted in a number-one contender's match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at [[Backlash (2002)|Backlash]], which Austin lost despite having his foot on the rope when he was pinned. He would later be betrayed by Big Show, who went on to rejoin the nWo and Ric Flair. Austin then defeated Big Show and Flair in a handicap match at [[Judgment Day (2002)|Judgment Day]]. In a May 2002 interview on WWE's Internet program, ''Byte This!'', Austin stunned the company and fans by launching a verbal attack on the direction the company was heading in and slated the creative team for not using him the way he felt they previously did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=WWE Byte This Report \u2013 Stone Cold Steve Austin|url=http://www.twnpnews.com/messages2/6000/6535.shtml|website=TWNP News|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref> The commentators struggled to keep Austin's opinions on a neutral wavelength, leading to the WWE apologizing to fans for the outburst and stated it was not part of Austin's current or upcoming storylines.

However, Austin balked at the proposition that he lose a King of the Ring qualifying match on ''Raw'' to Lesnar, and ultimately walked out of the company.<ref name=trip/> Austin later explained that he thought hot-shotting a rookie made Austin look weak, and airing the match on free TV with no build-up did not give Lesnar a proper stage for such a big win over a star of Austin's magnitude.

McMahon insisted that Austin owed an apology to all the fans across the world, especially those who paid solely to see him that night. McMahon toasted to Austin's career with a beer thanking him for all his hard work nonetheless. The same night, Austin's entrance theme was played during an in-ring segment by Ric Flair, but it was transitioned to Eddie Guerrero's theme and he entered the arena. The Rock also made an appearance on ''Raw'' that night, despite being drafted to ''SmackDown!'', and announced his frustrations towards Austin and threw a can of beer at McMahon. Austin's merchandise continued to sell greatly in the weeks following his departure, however; with no sign of a return likely to be seen, the company stopped marketing his character and his merchandise and removed his profile from WWE.com.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nFor the remainder of 2002, Austin kept a low profile and did not make any public appearances. It was reported, however, by the end of the year, Austin and McMahon met and resolved their differences. He then agreed to return to the company in early 2003. In an interview with ''WWE Raw Magazine'',{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=19}} he announced deep regret over the situation that led to his departure and how he had left, and deeper regret over inaccurate speculation regarding his alleged grudges held against other WWE wrestlers,{{sfn|The Stone Cold Truth|2003|p=22}} claiming he had no problem with Scott Hall rejoining the company.

The Rock was offended that the WWE fans voted for Austin in a WWE Magazine poll to determine the 'Superstar of the Decade'. He expressed his frustration at having never defeated Austin at WrestleMania, and challenged Austin to a match at [[WrestleMania XIX]].

The next day, Austin gave an interview on WWE.com officially announcing his retirement from wrestling, although he stated that he and Vince McMahon had reached an agreement which would see Austin appear in a non-wrestling role weekly. About Bischoff firing him on ''Raw'' that week, he said that although firing was for storyline purposes, he admitted the medical problems read out on ''Raw'' were legitimate, and mainly related to his injury sustained at SummerSlam in a match with Owen Hart in August 1997, which had begun to seriously plague him since late 2001.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Sheriff of ''Raw'' (2003\u20132004) ====\n[[File:Stone Cold Steve Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Austin in [[Iraq]], 2003]]\nThe following month, Austin began his non-wrestling career with WWE and began a fresh storyline when he was brought back by Linda McMahon as the Raw Co-General Manager. He continued this storyline for the remainder of the year, still showing wrestling moves including the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and several exchanges of punches and kicks, although limiting regularity of these being performed. On November 17, 2003, episode of ''Raw'', Austin was \"fired\" from ''Raw'' as the result of a stipulation in a match at [[Survivor Series (2003)|Survivor Series]] where Austin's hand-picked team of wrestlers failed to beat Bischoff's team of wrestlers. After Survivor Series, [[Mick Foley]] would become the new Co-General Manager of ''Raw'', and began a ([[kayfabe]]) petition to have Austin re-instated. Austin quickly returned to WWE television before the end of 2003 when he was part of the ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops#2003|Tribute to the Troops]]'' taped live in front of U.S. troops in [[Iraq]], posing and attacking Mr. McMahon.

When O'Connor toured the UK to promote the album, the opening act were a then-unknown group called [[Duran Duran]].

O'Connor also collaborated with other artists, and made appearances in the video for [[Mick Karn]]'s \"The Sound Of Waves\" and a cameo appearance in the 1983 [[Eurythmics]] video \"[[Who's That Girl?

When O'Connor toured the UK to promote the album, the opening act were a then-unknown group called [[Duran Duran]]. It was the band's first opportunity to play to large audiences throughout the UK and gave them the exposure they needed to secure a recording contract.\n\nSubsequent albums released by O'Connor included ''Sons and Lovers'' (which featured the UK Top 10 hit single \"D Days\"), ''Cover Plus'', ''Smile'', ''Private Wars'' and ''Five in the Morning''. O'Connor also collaborated with other artists, and made appearances in the video for [[Mick Karn]]'s \"The Sound Of Waves\" and a cameo appearance in the 1983 [[Eurythmics]] video \"[[Who's That Girl?

Her duet song \"Push and Shove\" with [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] leads off the second act of the album and accompanying video.\n\nShe has made numerous television appearances, starring in ''Jangles'' on British television and in 1986 playing the lead role of Vivienne in ''Fighting Back'' as well as singing the theme tune.

To add something new to the best of compilation, O'Connor recorded a [[cover version|cover]] of her friend [[George Michael]]'s hit \"One More Try\", with a band that included drummer [[Carlos Hercules]], who at the time was playing for [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Beverley Knight]].

Directed by Ed Kaplan, it is based on the 1992 novel of the same name by [[Jane Stanton Hitchcock]]. The film originally premiered on [[CBS]] as a presentation of ''CBS Sunday Afternoon Showcase'' on October 23, 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nFaith Crowell (Meg Tilly) is a struggling bohemian artist who is commissioned to paint a mural for wealthy, reclusive socialite widow Frances Griffin (Ellen Burstyn). Frances wants Faith to paint murals all over the ornate walls of the abandoned ballroom of her ostentatious 211-acre estate.

Teams played a ten-game schedule. The [[Montreal Wanderers]] won the league championship going undefeated, with their only loss of the season coming in a [[Stanley Cup]] challenge series with Kenora.\n\n==League business==\n{{Emergence of the NHL}}\n\n===Executive===\n* Fred McRobie (President)\n* Thomas D'Arcy McGee, Ottawa (1st Vice-President)\n* Gordon Blair, Quebec (2nd Vice-President)\n* [[Emmett Quinn]], Shamrocks (Secretary-Treasurer)\n\nNationals and Grand Trunk applied for franchises but did not get three-fourths approval.\n\n===Rule changes===\n* Teams could have professionals as well as amateurs\n* After a puck strikes a goalie, the rebound could now be played by the defending team without it being called offside\n* A player injured in the first half can sit for ten minutes and the other team has to take off a player.\n\n==Regular season==\n[[Frank McGee (ice hockey)|Frank McGee]] of Ottawa retired to pursue his government career. The Wanderers added two professionals, [[Riley Hern]] from the Portage Lake-Houghton pros and [[Hod Stuart]] from the Pittsburgh pros.\n\nPrior to the season, Ottawa travelled to Winnipeg for a series of exhibition games against Manitoba league teams including the [[Kenora Thistles]], who then came east to play a challenge in Montreal.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |date=January 1, 1907 |title=Kenora Didn't Stay|page=11}}</ref> The [[Montreal Victorias]] hosted the [[St. Nicholas Hockey Club]] from New York in an exhibition on December 22, 1906, defeating them 16\u20133.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |page=2 |title=Vics Showed Class}}</ref>\n\n===Highlights===\n\nA major battle took place for the game between the Senators and Wanderers on January 12.

The Wanderers would still win, 4\u20132.\n\nAfter the game, a special league meeting was called to hand out discipline, with Victorias and Wanderers wanting Spittal and Alf Smith suspended for the season. The players were not suspended, leading the league president Mr. McRobie to resign, leaving Darcy McGee to take over as president.\n\nOn the next visit of the Ottawa team to Montreal, to play the Victorias, the three Ottawa players were arrested by Montreal police. Eventually Alf Smith and Spittal were fined $20 for their actions and Harry Smith was found not guilty.\n\nThe scoring championship was close, with [[Ernie Russell]] of the Wanderers placing first with 42 goals in 9 games, and [[Russell Bowie]] scoring 38 in 10 games.\n\n===Final standings===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

So a best of three game series was upset to see who the Manitoba League Champion and who defended the cup again the Montreal Wanderers. After losing McGimsie, Si Griffis and Tom Hooper also went down to injury. Kenora signed three players to bolster its team: [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and [[Rat Westwick]] of Ottawa, and [[Fred Whitcroft]] of [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] to finish the season. (All three were future Hall of Fame inductees.) By the time of the MPHL playoff, Stanley Cup trustee [[William Foran]] notified Kenora that Smith and Westwick were ineligible for the challenge.\n==Playoff==\nKenora would play and win the MPHL playoff against Brandon to successfully defend the Cup, winning a best-of-three series 2\u20130.

At the time of the series, the acting Stanley Cup trustee [[William Foran]] had already declared Smith and Westwick ineligible for the challenge series.

Foran ruled that both players were ineligible. The series was supposed to start on March 20 in Kenora but did not. One report was that the ice in the rink was too poor to play on and the rink was closed.<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=March 21, 1907 |title=No Stanley Cup Game At Kenora Last Night |page=5}}</ref> The clubs went ahead and started the series on March 23 in Winnipeg instead, with Smith and Westwick playing. Foran was notified by the press (inaccurately) that Montreal had dropped its protest and that the clubs intended to play anyway. Foran threatened to take the Cup back to Ottawa:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf the two clubs ignore the instructions of the cup trustees by mutually agreeing to play against Westwick and Smith when both were positively informed these men were ineligible to participate in the present cup matches, the series will be treated as void, and the cup will be taken charge of by the trustees. It will remain in their possession till the various hockey leagues can educate themselves up to a standard where decent sport will be the order of the day.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 25, 1907 |title=Never Too Late to Mend |pages=9 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe teams went ahead and played the series.

Eventually Alf Smith and Spittal were fined $20 for their actions and Harry Smith was found not guilty.\n\nThe scoring championship was close, with [[Ernie Russell]] of the Wanderers placing first with 42 goals in 9 games, and [[Russell Bowie]] scoring 38 in 10 games.\n\n===Final standings===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Montreal Wanderers won the ECAHA regular-season champions and challenged to regain the Stanley Cup. Challenge was excepted.  However Brandon and Kenora finished tied for first in the Manitoba League.  So a best of three game series was upset to see who the Manitoba League Champion and who defended the cup again the Montreal Wanderers. After losing McGimsie, Si Griffis and Tom Hooper also went down to injury. Kenora signed three players to bolster its team: [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and [[Rat Westwick]] of Ottawa, and [[Fred Whitcroft]] of [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] to finish the season. (All three were future Hall of Fame inductees.) By the time of the MPHL playoff, Stanley Cup trustee [[William Foran]] notified Kenora that Smith and Westwick were ineligible for the challenge.\n==Playoff==\nKenora would play and win the MPHL playoff against Brandon to successfully defend the Cup, winning a best-of-three series 2\u20130. Hall and Ross played for Brandon in the series, while Smith, Westwick and Whitcroft played for the Thistles. At the time of the series, the acting Stanley Cup trustee [[William Foran]] had already declared Smith and Westwick ineligible for the challenge series. After the series was over, the Manitoba League registered their disapproval over Mr. Foran's decision to exclude the players.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Protest From Kenora |newspaper=The Globe |pages=9 |date=March 19, 1907}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Date\n! width=\"140\" | Winning Team\n! width=\"5\" | Score\n! width=\"140\" | Losing Team\n! width=\"145\" | Location\n|-\n|March 16, 1907||Kenora Thistles||8\u20136||Brandon Wheat City||rowspan=\"2\"| [[Winnipeg Auditorium]]\n|-\n|March 18, 1907||Kenora Thistles||4\u20131||Brandon Wheat City\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Kenora wins series 2\u20130\n|}\n\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 style=\"margin-left: 0.5in\"\n|+ March 16, 1907\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n! width=150 | Brandon Wheat Kings\n! 6\n! width=30| vs\n!width=150 |  Kenora Thistles\n! 8\n|-\n|Bobby Mercer   ||   ||align=center| G   || Eddie Geroux   ||   ||\n|-\n|Art Leader          ||   ||align=center| P   || Roxy Beaudro ||   ||\n|-\n|Art Ross             ||   ||align=center| CP  || Si Griffis ||  ||\n|-\n|George Smith     ||  ||align=center| RO  || Harry Westwick   ||   ||\n|-\n|Joe Hall Capt.       ||    ||align=center| C  || Fred Whitcroft     ||   ||\n|-\n|Walter Bellamy         ||    ||align=center| RW  || Alf Smith  ||  ||\n|-\n|Jack Fraser    ||    ||align=center| LW  || Tommy Phillips, Capt.   ||  ||\n|-\n|Art Serviss -RW ||   ||align=center| spare || Tom Hopper -R0/D ||  ||\n|-\n|Roy Amrstrong -D ||  ||align=center| spare || Russell Philllips -Rw/LW ||  ||\n|-\n|}\n\n\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 style=\"margin-left: 0.5in\"\n|+ March 18, 1907\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n! width=150 | Brandon Wheat Kings\n! 1\n! width=30| vs\n!width=150 |  Kenora Thistles\n! 4\n|-\n|Bobby Mercer   ||   ||align=center| G   || Eddie Geroux   ||   ||\n|-\n|Art Leader          ||   ||align=center| P   || Roxy Beaudro ||   ||\n|-\n|Art Ross       ||   ||align=center| CP  || Si Griffis ||  ||\n|-\n|George Smith     ||  ||align=center| RO  || Harry Westwick   ||   ||\n|-\n|Joe Hall Capt.       ||    ||align=center| C  || Fred Whitecorft     ||   ||\n|-\n|Walter Bellamy         ||    ||align=center| RW  || Alf Smith  ||  ||\n|-\n|Jack Fraser    ||    ||align=center| LW  || Tommy Phillips, Capt.   ||  ||\n|-\n|Art Serviss -RW ||   ||align=center| spare || Tom Hopper -R0/D ||  ||\n|-\n|Roy Armstrong -D ||  ||align=center| spare || Russell Phillips -Rw/LW ||  ||\n|-\n|}\n- Goal scorers in both games are unknown.\n\n===Montreal Wanderers vs. Kenora Thistles at Winnipeg===\n[[File:Montreal Wanderers in Winnipeg 1907.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wanderers players and team officials in Winnipeg for challenge|alt=Several rows of men, some wearing hockey uniforms, the others in overcoats and top hats.]]\nKenora dressed Smith and Westwick for the challenge anyway and Montreal filed a protest with Foran. Foran ruled that both players were ineligible. The series was supposed to start on March 20 in Kenora but did not. One report was that the ice in the rink was too poor to play on and the rink was closed.<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |date=March 21, 1907 |title=No Stanley Cup Game At Kenora Last Night |page=5}}</ref> The clubs went ahead and started the series on March 23 in Winnipeg instead, with Smith and Westwick playing. Foran was notified by the press (inaccurately) that Montreal had dropped its protest and that the clubs intended to play anyway. Foran threatened to take the Cup back to Ottawa:\n\n<blockquote>\nIf the two clubs ignore the instructions of the cup trustees by mutually agreeing to play against Westwick and Smith when both were positively informed these men were ineligible to participate in the present cup matches, the series will be treated as void, and the cup will be taken charge of by the trustees. It will remain in their possession till the various hockey leagues can educate themselves up to a standard where decent sport will be the order of the day.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 25, 1907 |title=Never Too Late to Mend |pages=9 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe teams went ahead and played the series. However, Foran changed his mind after the Wanderers won the Cup, stating that the Wanderers could keep the Cup, because they had not rescinded their protest.<ref>{{Cite news |newspaper=The Globe |date=March 26, 1907 |title=The News of Sport |pages=9 |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nAfter the series, the Wanderers returned to Montreal with the Stanley Cup. The Cup was stolen from Montreal photographer Jimmy Rice's home and held for ransom. No ransom was paid, and the Cup was returned to Rice. It was used as a geranium planter until the fall.<ref>{{cite news|work=Montreal Gazette |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/story.html?id=669f52ee-3cdc-4cb2-add6-8c0376be3fbf&k=7939 |title=It was butchery, not sport, in Westmount |publisher=Canada.com |accessdate=December 4, 2009 |date=January 12, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024194743/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/sports/story.html?id=669f52ee-3cdc-4cb2-add6-8c0376be3fbf&k=7939 |archivedate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Date\n! width=\"140\" | Winning Team\n! width=\"5\" | Score\n! width=\"140\" | Losing Team\n! width=\"145\" | Location\n|-\n|March 23, 1907||Montreal Wanderers||7\u20132||Kenora Thistles||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Winnipeg Auditorium]]\n|-\n|March 25, 1907||Kenora Thistles||6\u20135||Montreal Wanderers\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Montreal wins total goals series 12 goals to 8\n|}\n\n{| cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0 style=\"margin-left: 0.5in\"\n|+ March 23, 1907\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n! width=150 | Montreal Wanderers\n! 7\n! width=30| at \n!width=150 |  Kenora Thistles\n! 2\n|-\n|William \"Riley\" Hern    ||   ||align=center| G   || Eddie Giroux   ||   ||\n|-\n|Lester Patrick, Capt.        ||   ||align=center| P   || Tom Hooper  ||   ||\n|-\n|Hod Stuart              ||   ||align=center| CP  || Si Griffis ||  ||\n|-\n|Frank \"Pud\" Glass        || 2   ||align=center| RO  || Harry Westwick    ||   ||\n|-\n|Ernie Russell            ||  4  ||align=center| C  || Fred Whitecroft      ||   ||\n|-\n|Cecil Blachford          ||    ||align=center| RW  || Alf Smith    || 1 ||\n|-\n|Ernie \"Moose\" Johnson    || 1   ||align=center| LW  || Tommy Phillips, Capt.   || 1 ||\n|-\n|Bill Chipcase   ||  ||align=center| spare || Roxy Beaudro\n|-\n|Thomas Erskine & Rod Kennedy    ||  ||align=center| spare || Russell Phillips\n|-\n|Referee- W.

This lemma states that for any 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''\u03b5'', ''\u03b4''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1/2 and positive integer ''d'', there exists a distribution over '''R'''<sup>''k'' \u00d7 ''d''</sup> from which the matrix ''A'' is drawn such that for ''k'' = ''O''(''\u03b5''<sup>\u22122</sup>log(1/''\u03b4'')) and for any unit-length  vector ''x'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>, the claim below holds.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | last1 = Johnson\n | first1 = William B.\n | author1-link = William B.

Then the JL lemma follows by a union bound over all such pairs.\n\n== Speeding up the JL transform ==\nGiven ''A'', computing the matrix vector product takes ''O''(''kd'') time.
