The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] came to favour the name ''Sofya'' (\u0635\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0647). In 1879 there was a dispute about what the name of the new Bulgarian capital should be, when the citizens created a committee of famous people, insisting for the Slavic name. Gradually, a compromise arose, officialisation of ''Sofia'' for the nationwide institutions, while legitimating the title ''Sredets'' for the administrative and church institutions, before the latter was abandoned through the years.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://sredec-sofia.org/bg/page/38/istoriya|publisher=Capital Municipality|accessdate=20 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[Sofia City Province]] has an area of 1344&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|title=District Sofia-city |url=http://www.guide-bulgaria.com/SW/Sofia-city|work=Guide Bulgaria |accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> while the surrounding and much bigger [[Sofia Province]] is 7,059&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Sofia's development as a significant settlement owes much to its central position in the [[Balkans]]. It is situated in western Bulgaria, at the northern foot of the [[Vitosha]] mountain, in the [[Sofia Valley]] that is surrounded by the [[Balkan mountains]] to the north. The valley has an average altitude of {{convert|550|m}}. Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides. Three [[mountain pass]]es lead to the city, which have been key roads since antiquity, Vitosha being the watershed between [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Aegean Sea]]s.\n\nA number of shallow rivers cross the city, including the [[Boyanska reka|Boyanska]], [[Vladaya River|Vladayska]] and [[Perlovska]]. The [[Iskar (river)|Iskar River]] in its upper course flows near eastern Sofia. It takes its source in [[Rila]], Bulgaria's highest mountain,<ref name=\"Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria 537\">{{harvnb|Geographic Dictionary of Bulgaria|1980|p=537}}</ref> and enters Sofia Valley near the village of [[German, Bulgaria|German]]. The Iskar flows north toward the Balkan Mountains, passing between the eastern city suburbs, next to the main building and below the runways of [[Sofia Airport]], and flows out of the Sofia Valley at the town of [[Novi Iskar]], where the scenic [[Iskar Gorge]] begins.<ref name=\"Iskar 1\">{{cite web|url=http://old.bluelink.net/water/dunav/iskar/obshtihidrldanni.htm|title=General Hydrological Data|publisher=Iskar River System|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207013903/http://old.bluelink.net/water/dunav/iskar/obshtihidrldanni.htm|archive-date=7 December 2017|accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe city is known for its 49 [[Spring (hydrosphere)|mineral]] and [[Hot spring|thermal]] springs.

As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.\n\nIn 1945, the communist [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] took power and executed several thousand people.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The transformations of Bulgaria into the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city's appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.\n\nDuring the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] rule, a number of the city's most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.<ref>L.

According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000\u201320,000 in each following decade.<ref name=book/> Sofia's architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgar fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century [[Church of St. George, Sofia|Rotunda of St. George]], the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved [[Amphitheatre of Serdica]].\n\nAfter the Liberation War, knyaz [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander Battenberg]] invited architects from [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.<ref name=\"Fig. Arts\">{{cite book |last=Collective |title=Encyclopedia of Figurative Arts in Bulgaria, volume 1 |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |year=1980 |location=Sofia |pages=209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAmong the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were [[Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger]], Adolf V\u00e1clav Kol\u00e1\u0159, and [[Viktor Rumpelmayer]], who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite.<ref name=\"Fig. Arts\"/> Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], Neo-[[Rococo]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]], with the [[Vienna Secession]] also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.\n\nAfter World War II and the establishment of a [[Communist state|Communist government]] in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic]] public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around [[Largo, Sofia|The Largo]], Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete [[tower block]]s, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of [[Brutalist architecture]].\n\nAfter the abolition of [[Communism]] in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The {{convert|126|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Capital Fort]] Business Centre will be the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" caption=\"Architectural styles in Sofia\">\nFile:Rotunda Sveti Georgi, Sofia.jpg|[[Church of St. George, Sofia|The 4th century St. George Rotunda]] (the oldest building) behind some remains of Serdica\nFile:Mladost3.jpg|Socialist-era housing in [[Mladost, Sofia|Mladost]]\nFile:StSophiaChurch-Sofia-10.jpg|Interior of the ancient [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]\nFile:CentralMarketHall-Sofia-C.jpg|The [[Central Sofia Market Hall]]\nFile:Sofia Hotel Rodina near Russki pametnik 2012 PD 2.jpg|[[Hotel Rodina]], an example of [[Brutalist architecture]]\nFile:BusinessParkSofia view2.jpg|[[Business Park Sofia]]\nFile:Old house - Sofia - 2.jpg|[[Neo-Gothic architecture]] in Sofia\nFile:Tsar Liberator blvd building - Sofia.jpg|[[Baroque Revival architecture]]\nFile:Bulgaria Bulgaria-0546 - Church of St Nicholas the Miracle-Maker (7390227698).jpg|The [[Russian Church, Sofia|Russian Church]]\nFile:Kvadrat 500.jpg|Kvadrat 500, part of the National Gallery\n</gallery>\n\n===Green areas===\n[[File:Borisova gradina autumn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borisova gradina]]]]\nThe city has an extensive [[green belt]].

Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter and during the 70s and the 80s multiple ski slopes of various difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski area has been left to decay in the last 10 years so that currently there is only one chairlift and one slope working.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Government and law==\n===Local government===\n{{bar box\n|title=Composition of the City Council\n|titlebar=#DDD\n|float   =right\n|left1=Party\n|right2=61 Seats\n|width=375px\n|bars=\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|GERB]]'''|lightblue|30}} \n{{bar pixel|'''[[Reformist Bloc]]'''|darkblue|11}}\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Coalition for Bulgaria|Left Bulgaria]]'''|#FF0000|7}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Patriots for Sofia ([[IMRO - Bulgarian National Movement|IMRO]]/[[Attack (political party)|Attack]])'''|black|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''5 Political Group'''|#333399|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Serdika Coalition'''|pink|3}}\n|caption='''Total''' votes: 375 010<br>2015 election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/minr2015/tur1/mestni/2246.html|title=\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 :: \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c 2015|work=cik.bg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://council.sofia.bg/councilors|title=Municipal Councillors|publisher=Sofia City Council|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/28/2638234_listata_na_gerb_v_sofiia_se_srina_s_63_hil_glasa/|title=\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0415\u0420\u0411 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441 63 \u0445\u0438\u043b. \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e 2011 \u0433.|work=dnevnik.bg}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Sofia Capital Municipality|Sofia Municipality]] is identical to [[Sofia City Province]], which is distinct from [[Sofia Province]], which surrounds but does not include the capital itself.

The valley has an average altitude of {{convert|550|m}}. Unlike most European capitals, Sofia does not straddle any large river, but is surrounded by comparatively high mountains on all sides.

When the [[Romanian Army]] entered [[Vrazhdebna]] in 1913, then a village {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Sofia, now a suburb,<ref name=\"Hall97\">Hall (2000), p. 97.</ref> this prompted the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Tsardom of Bulgaria]] to capitulate.\n\nIn 1925, a terrorist act of ultra-leftists failed their attempted assassination of the king but resulted in the destruction of the [[Saint Nedelya Church]] and many victims.\n\n[[File:376bombgroup-bulgaria-01-jun-1944.gif|thumb|The [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|allied bombing of Sofia in World War II]] in 1944]]\n\nDuring the [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Second World War]], Bulgaria declared war on the US and UK on 13 December 1941 and in late 1943 and early 1944 the [[Bombing of Sofia in World War II|US and UK Air forces conducted bombings over Sofia]]. As a consequence of the bombings thousands of buildings were destroyed or damaged including the Capital Library and thousands of books. In 1944 Sofia and the rest of Bulgaria was occupied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and within days of the Soviet invasion Bulgaria declared war on Nazi Germany.\n\nIn 1945, the communist [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] took power and executed several thousand people.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The transformations of Bulgaria into the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] in 1946 and into the Republic of Bulgaria in 1990 marked significant changes in the city's appearance. The population of Sofia expanded rapidly due to migration from rural regions. New residential areas were built in the outskirts of the city, like Druzhba, Mladost and Lyulin.\n\nDuring the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] rule, a number of the city's most emblematic streets and squares were renamed for ideological reasons, with the original names restored after 1989.<ref>L. Ivanov.

According to modern records, 39,551 dwellings were constructed until 1949, 119,943 between 1950 and 1969, 287,191 between 1970 and 1989, 57,916 in the 90s and 102,623 between 2000 and 2011. Until 1949, 13,114 buildings were constructed and between 10,000\u201320,000 in each following decade.<ref name=book/> Sofia's architecture combines a wide range of architectural styles, some of which are aesthetically incompatible. These vary from Christian Roman architecture and medieval Bulgar fortresses to Neoclassicism and prefabricated Socialist-era apartment blocks. A number of ancient Roman, Byzantine and medieval Bulgarian buildings are preserved in the centre of the city. These include the 4th century [[Church of St. George, Sofia|Rotunda of St. George]], the walls of the Serdica fortress and the partially preserved [[Amphitheatre of Serdica]].\n\nAfter the Liberation War, knyaz [[Alexander, Prince of Bulgaria|Alexander Battenberg]] invited architects from [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] to shape the new capital's architectural appearance.<ref name=\"Fig. Arts\">{{cite book |last=Collective |title=Encyclopedia of Figurative Arts in Bulgaria, volume 1 |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |year=1980 |location=Sofia |pages=209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\nAmong the architects invited to work in Bulgaria were [[Friedrich Gr\u00fcnanger]], Adolf V\u00e1clav Kol\u00e1\u0159, and [[Viktor Rumpelmayer]], who designed the most important public buildings needed by the newly re-established Bulgarian government, as well as numerous houses for the country's elite.<ref name=\"Fig. Arts\"/> Later, many foreign-educated Bulgarian architects also contributed. The architecture of Sofia's centre is thus a combination of [[Baroque Revival architecture|Neo-Baroque]], Neo-[[Rococo]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]], with the [[Vienna Secession]] also later playing an important part, but it is most typically Central European.\n\nAfter World War II and the establishment of a [[Communist state|Communist government]] in Bulgaria in 1944, the architectural style was substantially altered. [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Gothic]] public buildings emerged in the centre, notably the spacious government complex around [[Largo, Sofia|The Largo]], Vasil Levski Stadium, the Cyril and Methodius National Library and others. As the city grew outwards, the then-new neighbourhoods were dominated by many concrete [[tower block]]s, prefabricated panel apartment buildings and examples of [[Brutalist architecture]].\n\nAfter the abolition of [[Communism]] in 1989, Sofia witnessed the construction of whole business districts and neighbourhoods, as well as modern skryscraper-like glass-fronted office buildings, but also top-class residential neighbourhoods. The {{convert|126|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Capital Fort]] Business Centre will be the first skyscraper in Bulgaria, with 36 floors. However, the end of the old administration and centrally planned system also paved the way for chaotic and unrestrained construction, which continues today.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" caption=\"Architectural styles in Sofia\">\nFile:Rotunda Sveti Georgi, Sofia.jpg|[[Church of St. George, Sofia|The 4th century St. George Rotunda]] (the oldest building) behind some remains of Serdica\nFile:Mladost3.jpg|Socialist-era housing in [[Mladost, Sofia|Mladost]]\nFile:StSophiaChurch-Sofia-10.jpg|Interior of the ancient [[Saint Sofia Church, Sofia|Saint Sofia Church]]\nFile:CentralMarketHall-Sofia-C.jpg|The [[Central Sofia Market Hall]]\nFile:Sofia Hotel Rodina near Russki pametnik 2012 PD 2.jpg|[[Hotel Rodina]], an example of [[Brutalist architecture]]\nFile:BusinessParkSofia view2.jpg|[[Business Park Sofia]]\nFile:Old house - Sofia - 2.jpg|[[Neo-Gothic architecture]] in Sofia\nFile:Tsar Liberator blvd building - Sofia.jpg|[[Baroque Revival architecture]]\nFile:Bulgaria Bulgaria-0546 - Church of St Nicholas the Miracle-Maker (7390227698).jpg|The [[Russian Church, Sofia|Russian Church]]\nFile:Kvadrat 500.jpg|Kvadrat 500, part of the National Gallery\n</gallery>\n\n===Green areas===\n[[File:Borisova gradina autumn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borisova gradina]]]]\nThe city has an extensive [[green belt]].

Vitosha mountain is a popular hiking destination due to its proximity and ease of access via car and public transport. Two functioning cable cars provide year long access from the outskirts of the city. The mountain offers favourable skiing conditions during the winter and during the 70s and the 80s multiple ski slopes of various difficulty were made available. Skiing equipment can be rented and skiing lessons are available. However, due to the bad communication between the private offshore company that runs the resort and Sofia municipality, most of the ski area has been left to decay in the last 10 years so that currently there is only one chairlift and one slope working.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Government and law==\n===Local government===\n{{bar box\n|title=Composition of the City Council\n|titlebar=#DDD\n|float   =right\n|left1=Party\n|right2=61 Seats\n|width=375px\n|bars=\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|GERB]]'''|lightblue|30}} \n{{bar pixel|'''[[Reformist Bloc]]'''|darkblue|11}}\n{{bar pixel|'''[[Coalition for Bulgaria|Left Bulgaria]]'''|#FF0000|7}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Patriots for Sofia ([[IMRO - Bulgarian National Movement|IMRO]]/[[Attack (political party)|Attack]])'''|black|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''5 Political Group'''|#333399|5}}\n{{bar pixel|'''Serdika Coalition'''|pink|3}}\n|caption='''Total''' votes: 375 010<br>2015 election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/minr2015/tur1/mestni/2246.html|title=\u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 :: \u041c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0440\u0435\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043c 2015|work=cik.bg}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://council.sofia.bg/councilors|title=Municipal Councillors|publisher=Sofia City Council|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/28/2638234_listata_na_gerb_v_sofiia_se_srina_s_63_hil_glasa/|title=\u041b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0413\u0415\u0420\u0411 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0435 \u0441\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0441 63 \u0445\u0438\u043b. \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e 2011 \u0433.|work=dnevnik.bg}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Sofia Capital Municipality|Sofia Municipality]] is identical to [[Sofia City Province]], which is distinct from [[Sofia Province]], which surrounds but does not include the capital itself.
