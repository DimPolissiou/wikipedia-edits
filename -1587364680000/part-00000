Sections of [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] from these two northbound rounds have been identified and excavated.

It is the oldest inscribed milestone found in Derbyshire. The inscription is \u2018TRIB POT COS II P P A NAVIONE M P XI\u2019 which means \u2018With the [[tribune]]'s power, twice [[consul]], father of this country. From Navio 11 miles.' The site of the [[Navio Roman Fort|Navio Roman fort]] is by the present day village of [[Brough, Derbyshire|Brough]]. In 1903, excavations by local archaeologist Micah Salt in the Silverlands area found various Roman artefacts including a silver coin, tiles, leather sandals, gritstone hearths, glassware and many fragments of fine [[Terra sigillata|Samian]] pottery. Pottery inscriptions indicate that they were made in 60-100 AD and from [[Verulamium]] (modern St Albans). The milestone and the other Roman items are on display in the Buxton Museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk/facts/roman-baths-silverlands/|title=Roman Buxton \u2013 Silverlands|website=www.wondersofthepeak.org.uk|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nNumerous Roman remains were also discovered in 1811 on the site of Buxton's Town Hall, when it was built at the north end of the market place. Close to the Town Hall, Roman floor slabs were found in the cellar of 3 Hall Bank in 2006 and large Roman masonry is exposed in 8A Hall Bank.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRoman coins and Romano-British bronze jewellery were also found in nearby [[Poole's Cavern]] in 1865.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poolescavern.co.uk/take-a-peek/archeology/|title=Archeology|website=Pooles Cavern & Buxton Country Park|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nA gritstone altar dedicated to Arnemetia (Arnomecta) was found in 1903 in the strong room of Navio fort's Principia (headquarters building).

[[Batham Gate]] (Old English for \"road to the bath town\") is a Roman road from [[Templebrough]] Roman fort in [[South Yorkshire]] past [[Navio Roman Fort]] and onto Buxton. Part of the route of this old Roman road on [[Tideswell]] Moor is a protected Scheduled Monument.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1007051|desc=Batham Gate, Roman road|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> This was an important route for access to sites of lead production in the [[Peak District]]. There is still a road called Batham Gate road heading east out of Buxton. [[The Street (Derbyshire)|The Street]] road ([[Margary numbers|Margary Number]] 71a) from [[Derventio Coritanorum|Derventio]] ([[Derby]]) ran to Aquae Arnemetiae, followed in places today by the modern A515 road to the south of Buxton. The Street is still the name of the road in the Upper Goyt Valley that may have connected Buxton with [[Condate (Britain)|Condate]] (Roman [[Northwich]]). There is plaque in a stone wall by The Street road near Arbor Low (at OS map location SK 1649 6232). It is marked \"Aquae Armentiae Derventio\" indicating the Buxton to [[Little Chester]] (Derby) Roman road. It is further inscribed: \"Huius viae curam curatores viarum non susceperunt\". This translates as \"The road menders have not taken care of this road\". Roman roads also led north to [[Mamucium|Mancunium]] ([[Manchester]]) and to [[Ardotalia|Melandra]] fort, near [[Glossop]] (Margary Number 71b). Sections of [[Agger (ancient Rome)|agger]] from these two northbound rounds have been identified and excavated. There was also a Roman Road (Margary Number 713) between Buxton and Leek (which may be the Roman town of Chesterton) whose course joins the present A53 road towards Leek at Morridge Top.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3270628|title=Geograph:: A plaque in the wall (C) Peter Barr|website=www.geograph.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe convergence of roads upon Aquae Armetiae, led Edward Tristram in 1916 to deduce the possible location of a fort in the town to the south of the market place by the current Bath Road.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tristram|first=Edward|date=1916|title=Roman Buxton|url=|journal=Derbyshire Archaeological Journal|volume=38|pages=84-104|via=}}</ref>\n[[File:Centurion_Stone_from_Navio_Roman_Fort.jpg|alt=|thumb|Centurial Stone from Navio Roman Fort]]\n[[File:Plaque on The Street (Buxton to Derby Roman Road).jpg|alt=|thumb|Plaque by Buxton to Derby Roman Road]]\nNavio fort guarded the route northwest to the larger fort of Melandra.

There, Thomas had the opportunity to study at [[John Calvin]]'s newly erected Academy. He attended lectures in Divinity given by [[Theodore Beza]] and Calvin himself and attended services led by [[John Knox]]. He learned [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] from [[Mattheus Beroaldus]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from [[Antoine Rodolphe Chevallier|Antoine Chevallier]]. The study of these languages remained enduring passions for Bodley throughout his life.\n\nAfter Mary's death in 1558 and the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], the family returned to England, and Bodley entered [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], to study under [[Lawrence Humphrey]]. In 1563 he took his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree, and was shortly thereafter, in 1564, admitted as a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]]. \n\n==Career==\nHe began lecturing at Merton and in April 1565 was formally appointed as the college's first Lecturer in Ancient Greek, a post that was subsequently made permanent. He served in many college offices: in 1569 he was elected as one of the University's junior [[proctor]]s and for some time after was deputy [[Public Orator]].  Leaving Oxford in 1576 with a license to study abroad and a grant from his college of \u00a36.&nbsp;13s.&nbsp;4d., Bodley toured [[France]], [[Italy]], and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], visiting scholars and adding French, Italian, and Spanish to his repertoire of languages.\n\nIt has been suggested that during his tour in Italy he was in initiated in [[Forl\u00ec]] in some form of Pythagorean initiation in a platonic academy.<ref>Thomas, D. I., \"A Modern Pythagorean\", ''Gnosis'', 59, Summer 1997: \"It as been suggested  that some form of Pythagorean initiation  survived through the centuries, first in the Byzantine Empire and later, as the Ottoman Turks advanced, in Italy, where the Greek intellectual elite took refuge. During the reign of Elizabeth I, Sir Thomas Bodeley is said to have been initiated in the northern Italian city of Forl\u00ec in a platonic academy, established in imitation of an older Society which had existed before the fall of the Grecian Empire in the towns of Constantinople and Thessalonica.\"</ref>\n\nOn his return to England Bodley was appointed a [[Gentleman usher|gentleman-usher]] to Queen Elizabeth and in 1584 entered the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] as one of the members for [[Portsmouth]]. In 1585 he was entrusted with a mission to form a league between [[Frederick II of Denmark]] and certain German princes to assist [[Henry of Navarre]], the future [[Henry IV of France]]. He was next dispatched on a secret mission to [[France]]. In 1586 he was elected to represent [[St Germans (UK Parliament constituency)|St Germans]] in parliament, and in 1588 he was sent to the [[Hague]] as minister, a post which demanded great diplomatic skill, for it was in the [[Netherlands]] that the power of [[Spain]] had to be fought. The essential difficulties of his mission were complicated by the intrigues of the queen's ministers at home, and Bodley repeatedly asked to be recalled. He was finally permitted to return to England in 1596, but finding his hoped-for preferment of becoming [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]] obstructed by the competing interests of [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]] and [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Essex]], he retired from public life and returned to Oxford.\n\nFollowing his marriage in 1587 he was obliged to resign his fellowship at Merton, but he retained many friends there and in the spring of 1598 the college gave a dinner in his honour. G. H. Martin speculates that the inspiration to restore the old [[Duke Humfrey's Library]] may have come from the renewal of Bodley's contact with [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Henry Savile]] and other former colleagues at this dinner. Once his proposal was accepted, he devoted the rest of his life to the library project. He was [[knight]]ed on 18 April 1604.  \n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:CarewArms.png|thumb|Arms of Carew: ''Or, three [[Lions in heraldry|lions passant]] in pale sable'',<ref>Debrett's Peerage, 1968, Carew Baronets, p.155; Baron Carew p.216</ref> as seen on monument<ref>See image[https://www.flickr.com/photos/lysander2/5159172414]</ref> to Thomas Bodley in Merton College Chapel]]\nIn 1587 he married Ann Carew, the wealthy widow of a certain Mr Ball, and the daughter of a certain Mr Carew<ref>Misnamed as \"Cary\" (another ancient Devonshire family) in Vivian, p.96</ref> of [[Bristol]]<ref>Vivian, p.96</ref> in Somerset. His monument in Merton College Chapel displays the arms of Bodley [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] Carew (''Or, three lions passant in pale sable''),<ref>See image[https://www.flickr.com/photos/lysander2/5159172414]</ref> an ancient Devonshire family seated at [[Mohuns Ottery]], descended from [[Nicholas Carew (died 1311)|Nicholas Carew]] (d. 1311), feudal lord of [[Carew Castle]] in [[Pembrokeshire]], feudal lord of Odrone (mod. Idrone, County Carlow) in Ireland and lord of the manor of [[Moulsford]] in Berkshire.\n\n==Death and burial==\nHe died on 28 January 1613, and was buried in the choir of Merton College Chapel. His monument survives on the western wall of the north [[transept]] of the chapel, formed of black and white marble with pillars representing books and allegories of learning. \n\n==The Bodleian Library==\nBodley's greatest achievement was the re-founding of the library at Oxford. In 1444, the existing university library was augmented by a gift of some 300 manuscripts from [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], the youngest son of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]; this prompted the university to build a new library above the Divinity School which was at that time under construction. However, during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] of the 1550s, the library had been stripped and abandoned, remaining virtually untouched until the return of Bodley in 1598. The library was later named the [[Bodleian Library]] in his honour. He determined, he said, \"to take his farewell of state employments and to set up his staff at the library door in Oxford.\" In 1598 his offer to restore the old library was accepted by the university. Bodley began his book collection effort in 1600, using the site of the former library above the Divinity School, which was in near ruin.\n\nAlthough Bodley lived over 400 years ago, modern libraries benefit from some of his ideas and practices.\n\nOne important idea that Bodley implemented was the creation of a \"Benefactors' Book\" in 1602, which was bound and put on display in the library in 1604. While he did have funding through the wealth of his wife, Ann Ball, and the inheritance he received from his father, Bodley still needed gifts from his affluent friends and colleagues to build his library collection. Although not a completely original idea (as encouragement in 1412 the university chaplain was ordered to say mass for benefactors), Bodley recognized that having the contributor's name on permanent display was also inspiring. According to Louis B. Wright, <blockquote> He had prepared a handsome Register of Donations, in vellum, in which the name of every benefactor should be written down in a large and fair hand so all might read. And he kept the Register prominently displayed so that no visitor to the library could escape seeing the generosity of Bodley's friends. The plan, as it deserved, was a success, for its originator found that, 'every man bethinks himself how by some good book or other he may be written in the scroll of the benefactors.'<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3815753|title=Some Early \"Friends\" of Libraries|first=Louis B.|last=Wright|date=1 January 1939|publisher=|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=2|issue=3|pages=355\u2013369|doi=10.2307/3815753}}</ref></blockquote>For over four centuries, this innovative idea has continued to motivate friends of libraries everywhere.\n\nAnother significant event related to Bodley was the agreement between the Bodleian Library and the Stationer's Company, in which \"the Company agreed to send to the Library a copy of every book entered in their Register on condition that the books thus given might be borrowed if needed for reprinting, and that the books given to the Library by others might be examined, collated and copied by the Company.\"<ref>Nicoll, Allardyce, ed.

In 2003, the Copyright Act of 1911 was expanded to include information on CD-ROM and websites.  This regulation is in place to ensure the collection and preservation of all published materials as an accurate, up to date historical record.\n\n==Publications==\nBodley wrote his autobiography up to the year 1609, which, with the first draft of the statutes drawn up for the library, and his letters to the librarian, [[Thomas James]], was published by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], under the title of ''Reliquiae Bodleianae, or Authentic Remains of Sir Thomas Bodley'', (London, 1703, 8vo).\n\n==Descendants==\nThomas Bodley was married to Ann Ball, a wealthy widow, and he left no children.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifesirthomasbo00librgoog|title=The Life of Sir Thomas Bodley|first=Sir Thomas|last=Bodley|date=1 January 1906|publisher=A.

He was [[knight]]ed on 18 April 1604.  \n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:CarewArms.png|thumb|Arms of Carew: ''Or, three [[Lions in heraldry|lions passant]] in pale sable'',<ref>Debrett's Peerage, 1968, Carew Baronets, p.155; Baron Carew p.216</ref> as seen on monument<ref>See image[https://www.flickr.com/photos/lysander2/5159172414]</ref> to Thomas Bodley in Merton College Chapel]]\nIn 1587 he married Ann Carew, the wealthy widow of a certain Mr Ball, and the daughter of a certain Mr Carew<ref>Misnamed as \"Cary\" (another ancient Devonshire family) in Vivian, p.96</ref> of [[Bristol]]<ref>Vivian, p.96</ref> in Somerset.

Idrone, County Carlow) in Ireland and lord of the manor of [[Moulsford]] in Berkshire.\n\n==Death and burial==\nHe died on 28 January 1613, and was buried in the choir of Merton College Chapel. His monument survives on the western wall of the north [[transept]] of the chapel, formed of black and white marble with pillars representing books and allegories of learning. \n\n==The Bodleian Library==\nBodley's greatest achievement was the re-founding of the library at Oxford. In 1444, the existing university library was augmented by a gift of some 300 manuscripts from [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]], the youngest son of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]; this prompted the university to build a new library above the Divinity School which was at that time under construction. However, during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] of the 1550s, the library had been stripped and abandoned, remaining virtually untouched until the return of Bodley in 1598. The library was later named the [[Bodleian Library]] in his honour. He determined, he said, \"to take his farewell of state employments and to set up his staff at the library door in Oxford.\" In 1598 his offer to restore the old library was accepted by the university. Bodley began his book collection effort in 1600, using the site of the former library above the Divinity School, which was in near ruin.\n\nAlthough Bodley lived over 400 years ago, modern libraries benefit from some of his ideas and practices.\n\nOne important idea that Bodley implemented was the creation of a \"Benefactors' Book\" in 1602, which was bound and put on display in the library in 1604. While he did have funding through the wealth of his wife, Ann Ball, and the inheritance he received from his father, Bodley still needed gifts from his affluent friends and colleagues to build his library collection. Although not a completely original idea (as encouragement in 1412 the university chaplain was ordered to say mass for benefactors), Bodley recognized that having the contributor's name on permanent display was also inspiring. According to Louis B. Wright, <blockquote> He had prepared a handsome Register of Donations, in vellum, in which the name of every benefactor should be written down in a large and fair hand so all might read. And he kept the Register prominently displayed so that no visitor to the library could escape seeing the generosity of Bodley's friends. The plan, as it deserved, was a success, for its originator found that, 'every man bethinks himself how by some good book or other he may be written in the scroll of the benefactors.'<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3815753|title=Some Early \"Friends\" of Libraries|first=Louis B.|last=Wright|date=1 January 1939|publisher=|journal=Huntington Library Quarterly|volume=2|issue=3|pages=355\u2013369|doi=10.2307/3815753}}</ref></blockquote>For over four centuries, this innovative idea has continued to motivate friends of libraries everywhere.\n\nAnother significant event related to Bodley was the agreement between the Bodleian Library and the Stationer's Company, in which \"the Company agreed to send to the Library a copy of every book entered in their Register on condition that the books thus given might be borrowed if needed for reprinting, and that the books given to the Library by others might be examined, collated and copied by the Company.\"<ref>Nicoll, Allardyce, ed.

In 2003, the Copyright Act of 1911 was expanded to include information on CD-ROM and websites.  This regulation is in place to ensure the collection and preservation of all published materials as an accurate, up to date historical record.\n\n==Publications==\nBodley wrote his autobiography up to the year 1609, which, with the first draft of the statutes drawn up for the library, and his letters to the librarian, [[Thomas James]], was published by [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], under the title of ''Reliquiae Bodleianae, or Authentic Remains of Sir Thomas Bodley'', (London, 1703, 8vo).\n\n==Descendants==\nThomas Bodley was married to Ann Ball, a wealthy widow, and he left no children.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifesirthomasbo00librgoog|title=The Life of Sir Thomas Bodley|first=Sir Thomas|last=Bodley|date=1 January 1906|publisher=A.
