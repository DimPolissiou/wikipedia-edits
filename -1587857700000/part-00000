He began working in WWE at age 15, starting in their warehouse, where he filled merchandise orders. McMahon was also a referee, producer, announcer, and eventually a wrestler on-screen, while also becoming WWE's Executive Vice President of Global Media behind the scenes. He is the great-grandson of [[Jess McMahon]], grandson of [[Vincent J.

McMahon soon left behind his refereeing duties and took on the role of a backstage official at [[WrestleMania VIII]] in an attempt to break up a storyline brawl between [[Randy Savage]] and [[Ric Flair]]. McMahon would then mainly work behind the scenes, launching WWF.com in 1997.\n\n==== The Corporation (1998\u20132000) ====\n{{Main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation|The Corporate Ministry}}\nShane McMahon made his first appearances as a regular on-air character in early 1998, when he was one of the main WWF executives negotiating with [[Mike Tyson]] during Tyson's heavily-hyped involvement in WrestleMania. He became a recurring part of his father's on-air [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. In the early days of that [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], McMahon offered support for his father in cameo roles, but he did not become an [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]] like [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]. McMahon was a [[color commentator]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' alongside [[Jim Cornette]] and later [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]], and announced with [[Jerry Lawler]] on the 1999 videogame ''[[WWF Attitude]]''. Concurrently with this, Shane took on the role as a regular character, turning on his father by signing Austin to a contract after Vince demoted him to the position of referee. Yet at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], Shane turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] by turning on Austin and became an official member of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/1998.htm|title=Survivor Series 1998 Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1999, McMahon moved away from the commentary role on ''Heat'' and became a key component in the Corporation angle, winning the [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]] from [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]].<ref name=\"European\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/358602|title=Shane McMahon's European Title History|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=July 18, 2007}}</ref> The two met in a rematch at [[WrestleMania XV]]; McMahon got help from his childhood friends the [[Mean Street Posse]] and [[Triple H]], who turned on X-Pac during the match, to retain the championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/xv.htm|title=WrestleMania XV Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> McMahon then retired the title, wanting to retire as an \"undefeated champion\". McMahon later gave the title to [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]], who found it in McMahon's duffel bag, thus reactivating it.\n\nAfter WrestleMania, Vince briefly made his second face run and Shane took control of the Corporation. With wrestlers such as Triple H in this new faction, Shane feuded with his father and a new faction made up of former Corporation members, [[Corporate Ministry#The Union|The Union]]. On the UPN pilot for ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Shane joined forces with [[The Undertaker]] and the [[Ministry of Darkness]] to form the [[Corporate Ministry]]. Eventually, Vince was revealed to be the mastermind behind this faction, and his face turn was explained to be a plot to get the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]] off Austin. Austin then met Shane and Vince in a [[ladder match]] at the [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] for ownership of the WWF, as in the storyline, Austin had 50%, which was assigned to him by Linda and Stephanie McMahon, upset by Vince and Shane's complicity in the storyline kidnapping of Stephanie by the Corporate Ministry, while Vince and Shane each had 25%. Shane and Vince won the match when a mystery associate raised the briefcase out of Austin's reach when he climbed the ladder, allowing Vince and Shane to grab the case and regain 100% ownership of the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/1999.htm|title=King of the Rings 1999 Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> In 1999, McMahon was awarded the [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] Rookie of the Year award but he declined to accept it stating \u201cThese are for the boys, not me\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wrestlingrumors.net/chrisbaker/here-comes-the-money-the-career-of-shane-mcmahon/|title=Here Comes the Money: The Career of Shane McMahon|date=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith his ownership reinstated, McMahon shifted his sights to, then [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], who was [[kayfabe]] dating Shane's sister, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]]. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating \"beneath the family's standards\", and wound up feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test's life a living hell. At [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], McMahon met Test in a \"Love Her or Leave Her\" match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie could no longer see each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test was able to get the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=104}}</ref> As his father, Vince, then feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and [[D-Generation X]] (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned heel, siding with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]] began, and all of the other McMahons disappeared from television.\n\nAt [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]], Shane made his return as a heel again by trying to help [[Big Show]] defeat [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]; these efforts failed as Vince returned the next Monday night on ''Raw Is War'', when the Rock got a rematch against Big Show, and helped The Rock win the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/february/2000.htm|title=No Way Out 2000 Results|accessdate=August 14, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> This started the road to [[WrestleMania 2000]], where in the four-way main event each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner.

The feud with Vince was due to the elder McMahon's (kayfabe) affair with [[Trish Stratus]] and Vince's spite and demand to divorce Linda McMahon. As fate would have it, rival [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) was sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) one week before the Father versus Son match at WrestleMania X-Seven. In [[Kayfabe|terms of the storyline]], Vince demanded that [[Ted Turner]] sign the contract at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]]. With Vince's ego getting the best of him, Shane was able to seize the opportunity and purchase WCW himself, to the shock of Vince. McMahon defeated his father at WrestleMania X-Seven, in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=107}}</ref> At [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], McMahon debuted his [[Music in professional wrestling|theme song]] \"Here Comes The Money\" and was in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Man Standing match]] against Big Show.

[[Test (wrestler)|Test]] helped McMahon to his feet, causing McMahon to get the victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/backlash.html#01|title=Backlash 2001 Results|accessdate=May 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>\n\nMcMahon then began a feud with [[Kurt Angle]]. By the [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], on June 24, McMahon's feud with Angle had culminated. After already participating in two tournament matches that night, Angle wrestled McMahon in a Street Fight. After a suplex on the hard floor, Angle was thought to have cracked his [[Coccyx|tailbone]]. Angle also delivered an [[Suplex#Belly to belly suplex|overhead belly to belly suplex]] through the plated glass stage set, but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to put him through a second plate back out to the stage and again failed two more times. The match also had Shane missing a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Shooting star press|shooting star press]] and ended with Angle performing the [[Professional wrestling throws#Olympic slam|Angle Slam]] off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/2001.htm|title=King of the Ring 2001 Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>\n\nMcMahon then began to lead his WCW wrestlers against his father and the WWF wrestlers, eventually turning heel by joining forces with [[Paul Heyman]] and his brand of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) wrestlers, along with their new owner, McMahon's sister Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. Calling themselves The Alliance, they pledged to finally run the WWF (and specifically their father) out of business. Ultimately, [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] came to a head at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] in a match to determine [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|which power would ultimately have control]].

At Survivor Series, Shane was the last man to be eliminated by Triple H, meaning Team SmackDown lost.\n[[File:ShaneMcMahon WM34 crop.jpg|thumb|upright|McMahon at [[WrestleMania 34]]]]\nOn March 11, 2018 at [[Fastlane (2018)|Fastlane]], Shane McMahon pulled the referee out of the ring when Kevin Owens covered Dolph Ziggler and pulled Sami Zayn out of the ring when he covered Kevin Owens. On the March 13 episode of SmackDown Live, Shane McMahon announced his indefinite leave of absence as SmackDown's commissioner. Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn then proceeded to attack Shane McMahon in the ring and behind the entrance. Shane (kayfabe) suffered laryngeal contusion, trapezius and rhomboid strains. He was then taken to a local medical facility. On March 26, 2018, WWE.com reported that Shane legitimately had acute diverticulitis while resting with his family in the Caribbean on March 14, and was hospitalized in Antigua for a few days before he was moved to a hospital in New York where doctors also found that Shane has an umbilical hernia that requires surgery once the infection is eradicated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/article/shane-mcmahon-hospitalized|title=Shane McMahon hospitalized with diverticulitis|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}</ref> McMahon posted the below message to his [[Instagram]] account: \"Thank you everyone for the get well wishes.

Shane returned on the April 3 episode of ''SmackDown Live'', to address his WrestleMania match, saying that Owens and Zayn would never be seen on a Smackdown Live arena again. At the event, Bryan and Shane defeated Zayn and Owens.\n\nHe then competed at the [[WWE Greatest Royal Rumble|Greatest Royal Rumble]], where he entered the namesake match at #47 before being eliminated after getting chokeslammed off the top rope through a table by [[Braun Strowman]].

Shane's father Vince introduced Elias as SmackDown's biggest acquisition on the April 16 episode of ''SmackDown''. The two were confronted by Reigns, who attacked Elias and attacked Vince with the Superman Punch. The following week, Shane called out Reigns for a fight for attacking his father, but Reigns was attacked from behind by Elias, who was assisted by Shane, forming an alliance between Elias and Shane. Shane then forced Reigns to face The B-Team ([[Bo Dallas]] and [[Curtis Axel]]) in a handicap match with Elias as the special referee enforcer that Reigns won. The following week on ''SmackDown'', Shane teamed with Elias, Daniel Bryan, and [[Erick Rowan|Rowan]] in a seven-man handicap match and defeated the team of  Reigns and The Usos. At Money In The Bank, Shane once again defeated The Miz this time by escaping the cage ending their feud.

McMahon soon left behind his refereeing duties and took on the role of a backstage official at [[WrestleMania VIII]] in an attempt to break up a storyline brawl between [[Randy Savage]] and [[Ric Flair]]. McMahon would then mainly work behind the scenes, launching WWF.com in 1997.\n\n==== The Corporation (1998\u20132000) ====\n{{Main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|l1=The Corporation|The Corporate Ministry}}\nShane McMahon made his first appearances as a regular on-air character in early 1998, when he was one of the main WWF executives negotiating with [[Mike Tyson]] during Tyson's heavily-hyped involvement in WrestleMania. He became a recurring part of his father's on-air [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. In the early days of that [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], McMahon offered support for his father in cameo roles, but he did not become an [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]] like [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]]. McMahon was a [[color commentator]] on ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' alongside [[Jim Cornette]] and later [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]], and announced with [[Jerry Lawler]] on the 1999 videogame ''[[WWF Attitude]]''. Concurrently with this, Shane took on the role as a regular character, turning on his father by signing Austin to a contract after Vince demoted him to the position of referee. Yet at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], Shane turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] by turning on Austin and became an official member of [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/november/1998.htm|title=Survivor Series 1998 Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1999, McMahon moved away from the commentary role on ''Heat'' and became a key component in the Corporation angle, winning the [[WWE European Championship|European Championship]] from [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]].<ref name=\"European\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/euro/358602|title=Shane McMahon's European Title History|publisher=WWE.com|accessdate=July 18, 2007}}</ref> The two met in a rematch at [[WrestleMania XV]]; McMahon got help from his childhood friends the [[Mean Street Posse]] and [[Triple H]], who turned on X-Pac during the match, to retain the championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/march/xv.htm|title=WrestleMania XV Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> McMahon then retired the title, wanting to retire as an \"undefeated champion\". McMahon later gave the title to [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]], who found it in McMahon's duffel bag, thus reactivating it.\n\nAfter WrestleMania, Vince briefly made his second face run and Shane took control of the Corporation. With wrestlers such as Triple H in this new faction, Shane feuded with his father and a new faction made up of former Corporation members, [[Corporate Ministry#The Union|The Union]]. On the UPN pilot for ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Shane joined forces with [[The Undertaker]] and the [[Ministry of Darkness]] to form the [[Corporate Ministry]]. Eventually, Vince was revealed to be the mastermind behind this faction, and his face turn was explained to be a plot to get the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Championship]] off Austin. Austin then met Shane and Vince in a [[ladder match]] at the [[King of the Ring#1999|King of the Ring]] for ownership of the WWF, as in the storyline, Austin had 50%, which was assigned to him by Linda and Stephanie McMahon, upset by Vince and Shane's complicity in the storyline kidnapping of Stephanie by the Corporate Ministry, while Vince and Shane each had 25%. Shane and Vince won the match when a mystery associate raised the briefcase out of Austin's reach when he climbed the ladder, allowing Vince and Shane to grab the case and regain 100% ownership of the WWF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/1999.htm|title=King of the Rings 1999 Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> In 1999, McMahon was awarded the [[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] Rookie of the Year award but he declined to accept it stating \u201cThese are for the boys, not me\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wrestlingrumors.net/chrisbaker/here-comes-the-money-the-career-of-shane-mcmahon/|title=Here Comes the Money: The Career of Shane McMahon|date=February 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith his ownership reinstated, McMahon shifted his sights to, then [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], who was [[kayfabe]] dating Shane's sister, [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]]. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating \"beneath the family's standards\", and wound up feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test's life a living hell. At [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], McMahon met Test in a \"Love Her or Leave Her\" match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie could no longer see each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test was able to get the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally.<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=104}}</ref> As his father, Vince, then feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and [[D-Generation X]] (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned heel, siding with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]] began, and all of the other McMahons disappeared from television.\n\nAt [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]], Shane made his return as a heel again by trying to help [[Big Show]] defeat [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]; these efforts failed as Vince returned the next Monday night on ''Raw Is War'', when the Rock got a rematch against Big Show, and helped The Rock win the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/february/2000.htm|title=No Way Out 2000 Results|accessdate=August 14, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref> This started the road to [[WrestleMania 2000]], where in the four-way main event each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner.

The feud with Vince was due to the elder McMahon's (kayfabe) affair with [[Trish Stratus]] and Vince's spite and demand to divorce Linda McMahon. As fate would have it, rival [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) was sold to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) one week before the Father versus Son match at WrestleMania X-Seven. In [[Kayfabe|terms of the storyline]], Vince demanded that [[Ted Turner]] sign the contract at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]]. With Vince's ego getting the best of him, Shane was able to seize the opportunity and purchase WCW himself, to the shock of Vince. McMahon defeated his father at WrestleMania X-Seven, in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]].<ref>{{cite news|title=2007 Wrestling Almanac & Book of Facts|work=Wrestling's Historical Cards|publisher=Kappa Publishing|year=2007|page=107}}</ref> At [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], McMahon debuted his [[Music in professional wrestling|theme song]] \"Here Comes The Money\" and was in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Man Standing match]] against Big Show.

[[Test (wrestler)|Test]] helped McMahon to his feet, causing McMahon to get the victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/backlash.html#01|title=Backlash 2001 Results|accessdate=May 25, 2007|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>\n\nMcMahon then began a feud with [[Kurt Angle]]. By the [[King of the Ring (2001)|King of the Ring]], on June 24, McMahon's feud with Angle had culminated. After already participating in two tournament matches that night, Angle wrestled McMahon in a Street Fight. After a suplex on the hard floor, Angle was thought to have cracked his [[Coccyx|tailbone]]. Angle also delivered an [[Suplex#Belly to belly suplex|overhead belly to belly suplex]] through the plated glass stage set, but McMahon did not break through on the first attempt, causing him to fall head-first onto the concrete floor. After a successful second attempt, Angle was to put him through a second plate back out to the stage and again failed two more times. The match also had Shane missing a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Shooting star press|shooting star press]] and ended with Angle performing the [[Professional wrestling throws#Olympic slam|Angle Slam]] off the top rope before scoring the victory over a bloodied McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/2001.htm|title=King of the Ring 2001 Results|accessdate=August 22, 2007|publisher=PWWEW.net}}</ref>\n\nMcMahon then began to lead his WCW wrestlers against his father and the WWF wrestlers, eventually turning heel by joining forces with [[Paul Heyman]] and his brand of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) wrestlers, along with their new owner, McMahon's sister Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. Calling themselves The Alliance, they pledged to finally run the WWF (and specifically their father) out of business. Ultimately, [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] came to a head at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] in a match to determine [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|which power would ultimately have control]].

The ensign is the largest flag, generally flown at the stern (rear) of the ship while in port. The [[naval ensign]] (also known as war ensign), used on warships, may be different from the [[civil ensign]] (merchant ships) or the [[yacht ensign]] (recreational boats). Large versions of naval ensigns called [[battle ensign]]s are used when a warship goes into battle. The ensign differs from the [[jack (flag)|jack]], which is flown from a [[jackstaff]] at the bow of a vessel.\n\nIn its widest sense, an ensign is just a flag or other standard.<ref>{{cite web|website=Oxforddictionaries.com|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ensign|title=Ensign}}</ref> The European military rank of [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]],<ref name=\"types\">{{cite book |last= Znamierowski |title= The World Encyclopedia of Flags |page= 31 |chapter=Types of flags}}</ref> once responsible for bearing a unit's standard (whether national or regimental), derives from it (in the [[cavalry]], the equivalent rank was [[Cornet (rank)|cornet]], named after a type of flag). In contrast, the Arab rank of ensign, ''[[liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'', derives from the command of a unit or units with an ensign, not the carrier of such a unit's ensign, and is a [[general officer]]. In Arab armies, \"ensign\" is a unit title equivalent to a Western brigade, and as a rank is equivalent to a divisional commander.\n\nEnsigns, such as the ancient Roman ensigns in the [[Arch of Constantine]], are not always flags.\n\n==National ensigns==\nIn nautical use, the ensign is flown on a ship or boat to indicate its appartenance. While this includes its nationality,<ref name=\"types\" /> it may well indicate more information (e.g. civilian, naval, or police vessel) rather than being the national flag itself. This is particularly common for commonwealth and European countries.\n\nEnsigns are usually at the [[stern]] [[flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]] when in port, and may be shifted to a [[gaff rig|gaff]] (if available) or mast amidships when the ship is under way, becoming known as a ''steaming ensign''.\n\n[[Vexillology|Vexillologists]] distinguish three varieties of a [[national flag]] when used as an ensign:\n*A [[civil ensign]] (usage symbol [[File:FIAV 000100.svg|23px]]) is worn by merchant and pleasure vessels. In some countries the [[yacht ensign]], used on recreational boats or ships instead of merchant vessels, differs from the civil ensign.\n*A state ensign or government ensign (usage symbol [[File:FIAV 000010.svg|23px]]) is worn by government vessels, such as [[coast guard]] ships.\n*A [[naval ensign]] (usage symbol [[File:FIAV 000001.svg|23px]]) is used by a country's [[navy]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Znamierowski |title= The World Encyclopedia of Flags |page= 88 |chapter=Naval ensigns and flags}}</ref>\n\nMany countries do not distinguish among these uses, and employ only one national flag and ensign in all cases; in the [[United States]], for example, all ships of the seagoing services of the [[United States Government]] with the exception of the [[United States Coast Guard]] fly the national flag as their ensign, although the ships of some agencies also fly an agency flag as a \"[[distinguishing mark]].\" Other countries (like the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ukraine]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Japan]]) use different ensigns. Such ensigns are strictly regulated and indicate if the vessel is a [[warship]], a [[merchant ship]], a [[Royal Mail Ship|ship under contract to carry mail]], or a [[yacht]], for example.\n\nSeveral [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries' national flags had their origin in the ensigns of their original colonising power, the United Kingdom. Most notable of these national flags are those of Australia, New Zealand, and several smaller island nations.

The ensign is the largest flag, generally flown at the stern (rear) of the ship while in port. The [[naval ensign]] (also known as war ensign), used on warships, may be different from the [[civil ensign]] (merchant ships) or the [[yacht ensign]] (recreational boats). Large versions of naval ensigns called [[battle ensign]]s are used when a warship goes into battle. The ensign differs from the [[jack (flag)|jack]], which is flown from a [[jackstaff]] at the bow of a vessel.\n\nIn its widest sense, an ensign is just a flag or other standard.<ref>{{cite web|website=Oxforddictionaries.com|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ensign|title=Ensign}}</ref> The European military rank of [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]],<ref name=\"types\">{{cite book |last= Znamierowski |title= The World Encyclopedia of Flags |page= 31 |chapter=Types of flags}}</ref> once responsible for bearing a unit's standard (whether national or regimental), derives from it (in the [[cavalry]], the equivalent rank was [[Cornet (rank)|cornet]], named after a type of flag). In contrast, the Arab rank of ensign, ''[[liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'', derives from the command of a unit or units with an ensign, not the carrier of such a unit's ensign, and is a [[general officer]]. In Arab armies, \"ensign\" is a unit title equivalent to a Western brigade, and as a rank is equivalent to a divisional commander.\n\nEnsigns, such as the ancient Roman ensigns in the [[Arch of Constantine]], are not always flags.\n\n==National ensigns==\nIn nautical use, the ensign is flown on a ship or boat to indicate its appartenance. While this includes its nationality,<ref name=\"types\" /> it may well indicate more information (e.g. civilian, naval, or police vessel) rather than being the national flag itself. This is particularly common for commonwealth and European countries.\n\nEnsigns are usually at the [[stern]] [[flag#Flagpoles|flagstaff]] when in port, and may be shifted to a [[gaff rig|gaff]] (if available) or mast amidships when the ship is under way, becoming known as a ''steaming ensign''.\n\n[[Vexillology|Vexillologists]] distinguish three varieties of a [[national flag]] when used as an ensign:\n*A [[civil ensign]] (usage symbol [[File:FIAV 000100.svg|23px]]) is worn by merchant and pleasure vessels. In some countries the [[yacht ensign]], used on recreational boats or ships instead of merchant vessels, differs from the civil ensign.\n*A state ensign or government ensign (usage symbol [[File:FIAV 000010.svg|23px]]) is worn by government vessels, such as [[coast guard]] ships.\n*A [[naval ensign]] (usage symbol [[File:FIAV 000001.svg|23px]]) is used by a country's [[navy]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Znamierowski |title= The World Encyclopedia of Flags |page= 88 |chapter=Naval ensigns and flags}}</ref>\n\nMany countries do not distinguish among these uses, and employ only one national flag and ensign in all cases; in the [[United States]], for example, all ships of the seagoing services of the [[United States Government]] with the exception of the [[United States Coast Guard]] fly the national flag as their ensign, although the ships of some agencies also fly an agency flag as a \"[[distinguishing mark]].\" Other countries (like the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ukraine]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Japan]]) use different ensigns. Such ensigns are strictly regulated and indicate if the vessel is a [[warship]], a [[merchant ship]], a [[Royal Mail Ship|ship under contract to carry mail]], or a [[yacht]], for example.\n\nSeveral [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries' national flags had their origin in the ensigns of their original colonising power, the United Kingdom. Most notable of these national flags are those of Australia, New Zealand, and several smaller island nations.

A self-described terrorist from the age of 16, she was known widely by her nickname, '''Marusya'''. Through her exploits she became a renowned figure in the anarchist movement of 1918\u20131919 in Ukraine during [[Russian Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and exile===\nBorn in Alexandrovsk (now [[Zaporizhia]]), [[Ukraine]], in 1885, Maria's father was an officer and hero of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]]. At the age of 16, she left home and became a babysitter, sales clerk, and ultimately a factory worker, with a position of bottle washer in a vodka distillery. She joined a local group of [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communists]].\n[[File:Aleksandrovsk.jpg|thumb|left|Aleksandrvsk at the end of the nineteenth century.  Nikiforova was a teenager during this period.]]\nShe adopted a strategy of ''motiveless terrorism'' (bezmotivny terror), staging a number of bombings and expropriation missions, including bank robberies. In 1907 she was captured, her involvement in these activities leading to a [[death sentence]], later commuted to [[life imprisonment]]. She served part of her sentence in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress|Petropavlovsk]] prison in [[St. Petersburg]], before being exiled to [[Siberia]] in 1910. From there she escaped to [[Japan]]. She went from there to the [[United States]], then [[Spain]], and finally arrived in [[Paris]]. By 1913 she had become well known by a nickname, Marusya, a Slavic diminutive form of \"Maria\", though when or how she acquired the name is not known.. She was very familiar with it, using it as a signature and was addressed by strangers with it. In Paris, she married [[Witold Brzostek]], a Polish [[anarchist]] and friend, as a matter of convenience. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], she sided with [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s anti-German position, in favor of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. She applied and graduated from a French officer college, serving in the [[Macedonian front|Macedonian Front]]. \n\n===Return to Alexandrovsk===\nWith the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], she abandoned [[France]] and returned to [[Petrograd]]. In the city, she organized and spoke at pro-anarchist rallies in [[Kronstadt]]. In the summer of 1917, with [[anti-anarchist]] activity within the [[Russian Provisional Government]] on the rise, Maria escaped back to her home town in Alexandrovsk, [[Ukraine]].{{Ref label|A|I|none}} Once there, she organized a fighting force of anarchist [[Black Guards]] under her command to terrorize the city's authorities, in particular army officers and landlords who refused to cooperate with peasant efforts to redistribute wealth. Alexandrovsk's nationalist government struggled to maintain order under the subversive actions of leftists in general, and anarchists in particular, who exercised political control and popular support to exclude the influence of the [[Central Council of Ukraine|Central Rada]] and redistribute private property.\n\n===Enter Nestor Makhno===\n[[File:Makhno en 1918.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nestor Makhno]] (1918), future leader of the [[Free Territory]], was still a minor militia leader when he first encountered Nikiforova]]\nWhen the [[October Revolution]] took place in [[Russian Empire]], leftist-dominated cities such as [[Huliaipole]] were already teetering on open civil war. There, anarchists gained strength by appealing to peasant enthusiasm for revolution. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by the [[Red Army]], the soviet of the small city issued a decree calling for fighters to join the invasion to overthrow the Ukrainian nationalists. Hundreds of men, mostly anarchists, formed a Black Guard under [[Nestor Makhno]] and his brother Sava, and marched on Alexandrovsk. Under siege by advancing [[Red Army]] forces to the north, Makhno's anarchists to the east, and subversion by Nikiforova's Black Guards from within, the nationalist army retreated from the city on January 15, 1918. The city shortly came under [[Bolshevik]] control.<ref name=\"Palij 83\"/> Makhno's forces arrived within days, altering the balance of power in the anarchist's favor.\n\nWith Alexandendrovsk secured, Nikiforova and her new ally, Nestor Makhno, held a meeting with the Bolsheviks. Backed by their Black Guards, the duo negotiated to become anarchist representatives in the city's new [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|Revolutionary committee]]. At the beginning, Maroussia and Makhno have allied her on common grounds of anarchism, and later Maroussia has begun to accuse Nestor of ignoring the anarchist ideas. ''She called him for a bloody struggle against the exploiters and Ukrainian nationalism''<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|first=\u0412.\u0410.|title=\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e|year=2005|publisher=\u0424\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043e|location=\u0425\u0430\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432|isbn=966-03-3053-7|pages=401}}, page 30, [http://www.makhno.ru/lit/Savchenko.pdf]</ref>\n\nNikiforova was appointed to the position of assistant deputy, but within weeks Makhno stepped down in dissatisfaction with the group's lack of radicalism. The pair would operate independently as military commanders in the future, but worked closely and often pooled resources in pursuing an anarchist revolution. Makhno historian, Michael Palij, noted that Nikiforova \"exercised a substantial influence upon Makhno from the very beginning of their acquaintance\".<ref name=\"Palij 73\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1917, anarchists unofficially held economic power in Huliaipole, though this was due to underground activity, as officially power rested with the Bolshevik backed soviet in the city <ref name=\"Palij 86\"/>\nIn August 1917, Nikiforova seized and robbed a military storehouse at [[Orikhiv]], subsequently attacking, disarming and dispersing the town's regiment and executing all officers captured. However, rather than pass these spoils to the Red Army, they were delivered to Makhno and his own Black Guards. This signaled the end of Nikiforova's loyalty to the committee and Bolsheviks, though she would continue to ally with the Red Army occasionally in battle.\n\nShe later established a new Black Guard [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] in the other cities, including [[Kirovohrad|Elisavetgrad]].<ref name=\"Palij 74\"/>\n\n===The Free Combat Druzhina===\nIn December 1917, her Black Guards helped to establish Soviet power in eastern Ukraine cities of Kharkiv and Yekaterinoslav, as well as Aleksandrovsk. In thanks, the Bolshevik commander in the region, [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]], gave her funds to upgrade her detachment, which became known as the \"Free Combat [[Druzhina]]\". This unit was active in fighting the Whites Guards, the Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Germans-Austro-Hungarians over a large area of southern Ukraine. She was instrumental in establishing Soviet power in the city of Yelizavetgrad (today [[Kropyvnytskyi]]) and later was involved in bloody battles in quelling a right-wing revolt in the city. In April 1918, she received a commendation from  [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]] for her revolutionary activities.\n\nThe Free Combat Druzhina was equipped with two large guns and an armoured flatcar. The wagons were loaded with armoured cars, tachankas, and horses as well as troops which meant that the detachment was by no means restricted to railway lines. The trains were festooned with banners reading \"The Liberation of the Workers is the Affair of the Workers Themselves\", \"Long Live Anarchy\", \"Power Breeds Parasites\", and \"Anarchy is the Mother of Order.\"\n\nThe soldiers were better fed and equipped than many of the Red Army units. Although there were no official uniforms, the soldiers certainly had a sense of style. Long hair (not common in that era), sheepskin caps, officers' service jackets, red breeches, and ammunition belts were much in evidence. The Druzhina was composed of a core of militants devoted to Marusya and a larger group which came and went on a fairly casual basis. The militants included a fair number of Black Sea sailors, noted for their fighting qualities throughout Ukraine.\n\nWith their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere. Travelling in echelons, the Druzhina advanced to meet the enemy, which in January 1918, meant the White Guards and the Ukrainian Central Rada.\n\n[[File:Antonov-Ovseenko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]] was a longtime ally of Nikiforova's, having met her in Paris years earlier. He provided her with needed political and material support from within the Bolshevik party.]]\n\nNikiforova was put on the trial twice by the Bolsheviks on charges of insubordination and pillaging: in Taganrog in April 1918 and in Moscow in January 1919. She was acquitted at the first trial, where witnesses were present to speak in her defense. Antonov-Ovseyenko also telegraphed a letter in support of her, commending her revolutionary activities in aid to the Bolsheviks. At the second, she was unable to launch a legal defense, and was banned from holding a political post for a year. Returning to Ukraine, she traveled to Huliaipole, now an autonomous area under Nestor Makhno's anarchist control, dubbed the [[Free Territory]]. Unwilling to damage his alliance with the Red Army, Makhno refused to disobey the sentence and would not appoint her to a position in his Black Army, the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]. Unable to command a fighting force for, she worked alongside Makhno by making public speeches, and organizing propaganda events.\n\nAntonov-Ovseenko recalled meeting her on April 28, 1919, while reviewing Makhno's troops and the city of Gulyai-Polye (Huliaipole). \"Makhno introduces the members of the Gulyai-Polye soviet's executive committee and of his staff. Also there is the political commissar of the bridge, my old acquaintance, Marussia Nikiforova.\"<ref name=\"Skirda 97\"/> Seeking to clarify rumors of corruption and counter-revolutionary activity among Makhno's ranks and the soviet of the city, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote glowingly of his impression of Gulyai-Polye. His report intrigued prominent Bolsheviks, who decided to visit the city personally. [[Lev Kamenev]] and a delegation of Ukrainian politicians, arrived by armored train a week following Antonov-Ovseenko visit, on May 7. Nikiforova met them at the train station, and with other members of Makhno's staff, [[Boris Veretelnikov]] and [[Mikhalev-Pavlenko]], offered to escort them into the city. After meeting Makhno and touring the city, Kamenev was impressed with Nikiforova, and upon returning to [[Dnipropetrovsk|Ekaterinoslav]], he telegraphed Moscow officials. He ordered that her sentence be reduced, from a year, to \"six months deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts.\" However, given the overwhelmingly anti-anarchist propaganda among Bolshevik commanders, politicians, and media, Antonov-Ovseenko's attempts to lobby for military support for the anarchists faltered. His political power declined, and he was replaced within weeks of his visit, on June 15, by [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]].<ref name=\"Skirda 100\"/>\n\n===Capture and death===\n{{Rquote|right|Recognition can be fatal for a terrorist and so it was for Nikiforova in the end. |Malcolm Archibald, 2007.<ref name=\"Archibald 1\"/>}}\nIn June 1919, Makhno's anarchist armies were outlawed by the Bolshevik command, and came under attack. Facing a two-front war against the white and red armies, Maria gathered a group of fighters, and reunited with her husband Witold Brzostek. Her intention was to field terrorist cells, as a formal fighting force was no longer available. Dispatching three cells on various missions, she took part in a sabotage mission against the [[White movement]] in the city of [[Sevastopol]]. There she and Bzhostek were recognized and arrested. Tried on September 16, 1919, she and her husband were found guilty and sentenced to death. Both were shot.\n\n==Political positions==\n\n===Anarchism and revolution===\nIn her youth, Nikiforova entered [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communist]] politics and adopted militant tactics to pursue them.<ref>{{harvnb|Archibald|2007}}: \"Around the same time she became a factory worker, Nikiforova also joined a local group of anarcho-communists. ... Maria became a full-fledged militant ...\"</ref> Throughout her years of activism, Nikiforova gave numerous speeches espousing her political opinions. However, transcriptions and quotes from her speeches scarcely survived the Soviet era, and she was not known to write her views in letters, essays, or articles. What is known of her speeches is that she was widely regarded for her charismatic oratory, which she used to expound anarchist views.<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/> Widely known as an anarchist, she was said to constantly wear entirely black clothing as a symbol of her libertarian philosophy.<ref name=\"Skirda 318\"/>\n\nDuring times of revolution, she favored immediate and complete [[Redistribution of wealth|redistribution of property]] owned by wealthy land owners, declaring, \"The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/>\n\nHowever, while she constantly spoke in favor of anarchist philosophy, she warned against [[vanguardism]] and [[elitism]], insisting that anarchists could not guarantee positive social change. \"The anarchists are not promising anything to anyone.\" She cautioned, \"The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/>\n\n===World War I enlistment===\n[[File:Emprunt National 1918.jpg|thumb|right|A French, anti-German propaganda poster. Nikiforova sided with the [[Allies of World War I]] and joined the [[French Army in World War I|French Army]].]]\nWhile living in exile in Paris, she sided with Peter Kropotkin on the issue of World War I, favoring the Allies in opposition to the German Empire. She graduated from [[French Army in World War I|French military school]] at the officer rank and served in the army.{{sfn|Archibald|2007}}\n\n===Conflicts with Soviet authority===\nUpon returning to Russia in 1917, Nikiforova was influenced by [[Apollon Karelin]], a veteran anarchist who advocated a tactical strategy of \"Soviet anarchism.\" Meeting her in Petrograd, Karelin's political tactics encouraged anarchist participation in Soviet institutions with the long term plan of directing them towards an anarchist agenda, provided these institutions did not deviate from revolutionary goals. In the event that they deviated from a radical agenda, anarchists were to rebel against them. Such institutional cooperation was widely disliked among anarchists, as they were largely a minority within such institutions, rendering their activity ineffectual.<ref>{{harvnb|Archibald|2007}}. See paragraph \"On a tactical level ...\"</ref>\n\nNikiforova agreed to ally with the Bolsheviks under special circumstances and negotiated to have herself appointed to a soviet institution, briefly becoming the Deputy leader of the Alexandrovsk [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|revkom]]. She would go on to help establish footholds for Soviet power in several Ukrainian cities, demanding material support from Bolshevik agents in return, which she then used to pursue her anarchist agenda.<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/> Although she would ally herself with the Red Army on multiple occasions, she was constantly at odds with their commanders and personally antagonized several, arguing against some their practices on revolutionary grounds. Upon discovering that a Soviet commander was hoarding luxury goods looted from an aristocrat's home, she angrily confronted him for his selfishness. \"The property of the estate owners doesn't belong to any particular detachment,\" she declared \"but to the people as a whole. Let the people take what they want.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 24\"/>\n\n==Public image==\n<!--\n===Reputation as a commander===\n\nWhat we do know for certain is that Marusya was a charismatic individual who made a strong impression on people she met and was capable of influencing them purely on the strength of her personality. Her comrades-in-arms were fiercely loyal to her and she returned their loyalty in kind.<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/>\n\nThen Marusya stepped to the podium and began to speak. Now the Cossacks were paying attention. \"Cossacks, I must tell you that you are the butchers of the Russian workers. Will you continue to be so in the future, or will you acknowledge your own wickedness and join the ranks of the oppressed? Up to now you have shown no respect for the poor workers. For one of the tsar's roubles or a glass of wine, you have nailed them living to the cross.\"\n\nAs Marusya continued in this vein many of the Cossacks removed their caps and bowed their heads. Soon some of them were weeping like children.\n\nA knot of Aleksandrovsk intellectuals was standing in the crowd. They told each other: \"The speeches of the Left Bloc representatives seem so pale in comparison with the speeches of the anarchists and, in particular, with the speech of M. Nikiforova.\" One upshot of the meetings, which went on for days, was that a number of Cossacks maintained contact with the Gulyai-Pole anarchists even after they went home to the Kuban and other regions.<ref name=\"Archibald 19\"/>\n\nWith their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere.<ref name=\"Archibald 22\"/>\n\nSummer 1918: \"A carriage flew down the street at a mad speed. Carelessly sprawled in it was a young brunette wearing a [[Papakhi|kubanka]] at a rakish angle. Standing on the footboard was a broad-shouldered chap wearing red cavalry britches. The brunette and her bodyguard had all sorts of weapons hanging from them.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/>\n\n===Criminal accusations===\n In order to inflame the population, a story was spread that Marusya looted icons from churches. She was depicted as the leader of a gang of thieves.<ref name=\"Archibald 27\"/>\n-->\n\n===Physical descriptions===\nFollowing Nikiforova's death, several publications described her in terms which placed emphasis on her supposed unattractiveness. Chudnov, a former [[Makhnovism|Makhnovist]], wrote of her when recalling a 1918 meeting: \"This was a woman of 32 \u2013 35, medium height, with an emaciated, prematurely aged face in which there was something of a eunuch or hermaphrodite. Her hair was cropped short in a circle.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 8\"/> Years after meeting her in 1919, [[Aleksei Semyonovich Kiselyov|Aleksei Kiselyov]] described her in his memoirs: \"Around 30 years old. Thin with an emaciated face, she produced the impression of an old maid type. Narrow nose. Sunken cheeks. She wore a blouse and skirt and a small revolver hung from her belt.\" Kiselev also alleged that she was a [[cocaine]] addict. Nikiforova biographer, [[Malcolm Archibald]], noted that most Bolshevik writers described her in ways similar to this, and hypothesized that this was part of an effort to discredit her ideas with [[ad hominem]] attacks. \"One suspects the Bolshevik memoirists, finding her ideology unattractive, tried to make her external appearance ugly as well.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/>\n\nDescriptions of Nikiforova fall into two general categories, either highlighting an alleged repulsiveness, or beauty. An exception to the majority of Bolshevik descriptions, Raksha recalled his 1918 meeting with her in very positive terms: \"I had heard that she was a beautiful woman... Marusya was sitting at a table and had a cigarette in her teeth. This she-devil really was a beauty: about 30, gypsy-type with black hair and a magnificent bosom which filled out her military tunic.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Postmortem mythology===\nThroughout her life, Nikiforova had been wounded multiple times, or had been mistaken for dead, only to reappear in good health later. Due to her reputation within folklore, rumors spread in the months following her death that she was actually still alive.\n\n'''Marusya copycats'''\n\nFollowing her death, Nikiforova's surviving legacy created an opportunity for copycats{{mdash}}faux Marusyas{{mdash}}to appear in the months and years to follow. The only female atamansha while alive, Nikiforova was followed by three women fighters in the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]] who adopted her name for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"Archibald 43\"/>\n\nIn 1919, Marusya Sokolovskaia became the commander of her brother's cavalry detachment after his death in battle. A 25-year-old Ukrainian nationalist school teacher, she was captured by the Reds and shot. In 1920-1921, ''Black Maria'' (Marusya Chernaya) became a commander of a cavalry regiment in the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]. She died in battle against the Red Army. A final copycat, Marusya Kosova, appeared in the [[Tambov Rebellion]] in 1921-1922. After the revolt was suppressed, she disappeared.<ref name=\"Archibald 43-44\"/>\n\n'''International espionage rumors'''\n\nNikiforova was rumored to have become a spy for the Soviet government in Paris in the years following her death. There, it was claimed, she performed undercover work, and was involved in the assassination of [[Symon Petliura]], an exiled Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. In actuality, Petliura was assassinated by [[Sholom Schwartzbard]]. A fellow exile and Ukrainian-Jewish anarchist, and former member of [[Grigori Kotovsky]]'s anarchist detachment, Schwartzbard had worked alone in the assassination. Malcolm Archibald commented, \"The only truth in this story might be the fact of anarchists doing the Bolshevik's work for them.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 44\"/>\n\n===Treatment by historians===\nNikiforova left few written records or photographs of herself during much of her life.<ref name=\"Archibald 1\"/> This is owed in part to her hidden activity as an international terrorist. Operating underground, and in exile across multiple countries, Nikiforova did not begin to make her activity public knowledge until the last two years of her life, when she officially held a military command. A few contemporary records of her life survived the Soviet era. Nestor Makhno provided eye-witness accounts of several dramatic incidents in Nikiforova's life within his memoirs. Makhno's former adjutant, [[Viktor Belash]], also wrote of her life within his own records, which were rescued from files held by the Soviet secret police.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/> Briefly a member of the Red Army, Nikiforova's service record exists as one of the few official documentations of her life.<ref name=\"Archibald 3\"/>\n{{Rquote|left|Gradually a clearer picture of her life is coming to light and it is possible to establish a reasonably reliable narrative although many ambiguities remain.|Malcolm Archibald , 2007.<ref name=\"Archibald 3\"/>}}\nNikiforova has been largely ignored by historians since her death. Soviet-era historians largely erased her from history, despite the important role she played in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and subsequent civil war. A biographical dictionary of the Russian Revolution includes hundreds of entries, but does not include her. Of the few Bolshevik women who are included, none held military commands as Nikiforova did. There is no scholarly biography of her life, or historiography of her era which mentions her. The few references made to her by Bolshevik contemporaries in memoirs and works of fiction are biased against her. These depict her uniformly as \"repulsive and evil,\" with little exception.<ref name=\"Archibald 1\"/>\n\nNikiforova has also been ignored by non-Soviet historians. Today, Nikiforova remains obscure and uncelebrated within Ukraine. She has been ignored by Ukrainian historians. Critics of this treatment speculate that as an anti-nationalist who fought and was executed by the White Army, Nikforova's activities have been too difficult to rewrite and reconcile to fit a reformist historical narrative.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/>\n\nThere is little explanation for the neglect on the part of anarchist historians. While several biographies of Nestor Makhno have been published, there is little mention of Nikiforova. This is despite their close collaboration, and her greater contemporary prominence, according to biographer Malcolm Archibald: \"...in 1918 Nikiforova was already famous as an anarchist atamansha (military female leader) throughout Ukraine, while Makhno was still a rather obscure figure operating in a provincial backwater.\" Of several anarchist historians who have published histories regarding Makhno, only [[Alexandre Skirda]]'s work, ''Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack'', mentions her{{mdash}}a single paragraph, out of over 400 pages, is devoted to her.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians have attempted to reintroduce individuals expunged from history, such as Nikiforova, Makhno, and other anarchists.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/> Several essays on Nikiforova have been published, and the Nikiforova biography, ''Atamansha'', published in 2007, was based on such sources in Russia and the Ukraine.<ref name=\"Archibald 3\"/>\n\nNikiforova appears in the French novel \"Clarisse\", by [[Cecil Saint-Laurent]]. She keeps Clarisse prisoner in her armoured train in Ukraine, and the two women become lovers, Clarisse being deflowered by Nikiforova.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Biography|Soviet Union|Ukraine|War}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Anarchism in Ukraine]]\n*[[Anarchism and violence]]\n*[[Olga Taratuta]]\n*[[Propaganda of the deed]]\n*[[Women in the First World War]]\n*[[Women in the military]]\n*[[Women in warfare (1900\u20131939)]]\n*[[Women warriors in literature and culture|Woman warrior]]\n}}\n;Lists\n*[[List of guerrillas]]\n*[[List of military commanders]]\n*[[List of Ukrainians]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''{{Small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Historian Michael Palij refers to this city as \"Oleksandrivsk\".<ref name=\"Palij 74\"/> This should not be confused with contemporary [[Oleksandrivsk]], as the city's Russian name formally matched Nikiforova's home city, Alexandrovsk.

A self-described terrorist from the age of 16, she was known widely by her nickname, '''Marusya'''. Through her exploits she became a renowned figure in the anarchist movement of 1918\u20131919 in Ukraine during [[Russian Civil War]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and exile===\nBorn in Alexandrovsk (now [[Zaporizhia]]), [[Ukraine]], in 1885, Maria's father was an officer and hero of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]]. At the age of 16, she left home and became a babysitter, sales clerk, and ultimately a factory worker, with a position of bottle washer in a vodka distillery. She joined a local group of [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communists]].\n[[File:Aleksandrovsk.jpg|thumb|left|Aleksandrvsk at the end of the nineteenth century.  Nikiforova was a teenager during this period.]]\nShe adopted a strategy of ''motiveless terrorism'' (bezmotivny terror), staging a number of bombings and expropriation missions, including bank robberies. In 1907 she was captured, her involvement in these activities leading to a [[death sentence]], later commuted to [[life imprisonment]]. She served part of her sentence in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress|Petropavlovsk]] prison in [[St. Petersburg]], before being exiled to [[Siberia]] in 1910. From there she escaped to [[Japan]]. She went from there to the [[United States]], then [[Spain]], and finally arrived in [[Paris]]. By 1913 she had become well known by a nickname, Marusya, a Slavic diminutive form of \"Maria\", though when or how she acquired the name is not known.. She was very familiar with it, using it as a signature and was addressed by strangers with it. In Paris, she married [[Witold Brzostek]], a Polish [[anarchist]] and friend, as a matter of convenience. With the outbreak of [[World War I]], she sided with [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s anti-German position, in favor of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]]. She applied and graduated from a French officer college, serving in the [[Macedonian front|Macedonian Front]]. \n\n===Return to Alexandrovsk===\nWith the outbreak of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], she abandoned [[France]] and returned to [[Petrograd]]. In the city, she organized and spoke at pro-anarchist rallies in [[Kronstadt]]. In the summer of 1917, with [[anti-anarchist]] activity within the [[Russian Provisional Government]] on the rise, Maria escaped back to her home town in Alexandrovsk, [[Ukraine]].{{Ref label|A|I|none}} Once there, she organized a fighting force of anarchist [[Black Guards]] under her command to terrorize the city's authorities, in particular army officers and landlords who refused to cooperate with peasant efforts to redistribute wealth. Alexandrovsk's nationalist government struggled to maintain order under the subversive actions of leftists in general, and anarchists in particular, who exercised political control and popular support to exclude the influence of the [[Central Council of Ukraine|Central Rada]] and redistribute private property.\n\n===Enter Nestor Makhno===\n[[File:Makhno en 1918.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nestor Makhno]] (1918), future leader of the [[Free Territory]], was still a minor militia leader when he first encountered Nikiforova]]\nWhen the [[October Revolution]] took place in [[Russian Empire]], leftist-dominated cities such as [[Huliaipole]] were already teetering on open civil war. There, anarchists gained strength by appealing to peasant enthusiasm for revolution. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by the [[Red Army]], the soviet of the small city issued a decree calling for fighters to join the invasion to overthrow the Ukrainian nationalists. Hundreds of men, mostly anarchists, formed a Black Guard under [[Nestor Makhno]] and his brother Sava, and marched on Alexandrovsk. Under siege by advancing [[Red Army]] forces to the north, Makhno's anarchists to the east, and subversion by Nikiforova's Black Guards from within, the nationalist army retreated from the city on January 15, 1918. The city shortly came under [[Bolshevik]] control.<ref name=\"Palij 83\"/> Makhno's forces arrived within days, altering the balance of power in the anarchist's favor.\n\nWith Alexandendrovsk secured, Nikiforova and her new ally, Nestor Makhno, held a meeting with the Bolsheviks. Backed by their Black Guards, the duo negotiated to become anarchist representatives in the city's new [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|Revolutionary committee]]. At the beginning, Maroussia and Makhno have allied her on common grounds of anarchism, and later Maroussia has begun to accuse Nestor of ignoring the anarchist ideas. ''She called him for a bloody struggle against the exploiters and Ukrainian nationalism''<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e|first=\u0412.\u0410.|title=\u041c\u0430\u0445\u043d\u043e|year=2005|publisher=\u0424\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043e|location=\u0425\u0430\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432|isbn=966-03-3053-7|pages=401}}, page 30, [http://www.makhno.ru/lit/Savchenko.pdf]</ref>\n\nNikiforova was appointed to the position of assistant deputy, but within weeks Makhno stepped down in dissatisfaction with the group's lack of radicalism. The pair would operate independently as military commanders in the future, but worked closely and often pooled resources in pursuing an anarchist revolution. Makhno historian, Michael Palij, noted that Nikiforova \"exercised a substantial influence upon Makhno from the very beginning of their acquaintance\".<ref name=\"Palij 73\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1917, anarchists unofficially held economic power in Huliaipole, though this was due to underground activity, as officially power rested with the Bolshevik backed soviet in the city <ref name=\"Palij 86\"/>\nIn August 1917, Nikiforova seized and robbed a military storehouse at [[Orikhiv]], subsequently attacking, disarming and dispersing the town's regiment and executing all officers captured. However, rather than pass these spoils to the Red Army, they were delivered to Makhno and his own Black Guards. This signaled the end of Nikiforova's loyalty to the committee and Bolsheviks, though she would continue to ally with the Red Army occasionally in battle.\n\nShe later established a new Black Guard [[Detachment (military)|detachment]] in the other cities, including [[Kirovohrad|Elisavetgrad]].<ref name=\"Palij 74\"/>\n\n===The Free Combat Druzhina===\nIn December 1917, her Black Guards helped to establish Soviet power in eastern Ukraine cities of Kharkiv and Yekaterinoslav, as well as Aleksandrovsk. In thanks, the Bolshevik commander in the region, [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]], gave her funds to upgrade her detachment, which became known as the \"Free Combat [[Druzhina]]\". This unit was active in fighting the Whites Guards, the Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Germans-Austro-Hungarians over a large area of southern Ukraine. She was instrumental in establishing Soviet power in the city of Yelizavetgrad (today [[Kropyvnytskyi]]) and later was involved in bloody battles in quelling a right-wing revolt in the city. In April 1918, she received a commendation from  [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko]] for her revolutionary activities.\n\nThe Free Combat Druzhina was equipped with two large guns and an armoured flatcar. The wagons were loaded with armoured cars, tachankas, and horses as well as troops which meant that the detachment was by no means restricted to railway lines. The trains were festooned with banners reading \"The Liberation of the Workers is the Affair of the Workers Themselves\", \"Long Live Anarchy\", \"Power Breeds Parasites\", and \"Anarchy is the Mother of Order.\"\n\nThe soldiers were better fed and equipped than many of the Red Army units. Although there were no official uniforms, the soldiers certainly had a sense of style. Long hair (not common in that era), sheepskin caps, officers' service jackets, red breeches, and ammunition belts were much in evidence. The Druzhina was composed of a core of militants devoted to Marusya and a larger group which came and went on a fairly casual basis. The militants included a fair number of Black Sea sailors, noted for their fighting qualities throughout Ukraine.\n\nWith their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere. Travelling in echelons, the Druzhina advanced to meet the enemy, which in January 1918, meant the White Guards and the Ukrainian Central Rada.\n\n[[File:Antonov-Ovseenko.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]] was a longtime ally of Nikiforova's, having met her in Paris years earlier. He provided her with needed political and material support from within the Bolshevik party.]]\n\nNikiforova was put on the trial twice by the Bolsheviks on charges of insubordination and pillaging: in Taganrog in April 1918 and in Moscow in January 1919. She was acquitted at the first trial, where witnesses were present to speak in her defense. Antonov-Ovseyenko also telegraphed a letter in support of her, commending her revolutionary activities in aid to the Bolsheviks. At the second, she was unable to launch a legal defense, and was banned from holding a political post for a year. Returning to Ukraine, she traveled to Huliaipole, now an autonomous area under Nestor Makhno's anarchist control, dubbed the [[Free Territory]]. Unwilling to damage his alliance with the Red Army, Makhno refused to disobey the sentence and would not appoint her to a position in his Black Army, the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]. Unable to command a fighting force for, she worked alongside Makhno by making public speeches, and organizing propaganda events.\n\nAntonov-Ovseenko recalled meeting her on April 28, 1919, while reviewing Makhno's troops and the city of Gulyai-Polye (Huliaipole). \"Makhno introduces the members of the Gulyai-Polye soviet's executive committee and of his staff. Also there is the political commissar of the bridge, my old acquaintance, Marussia Nikiforova.\"<ref name=\"Skirda 97\"/> Seeking to clarify rumors of corruption and counter-revolutionary activity among Makhno's ranks and the soviet of the city, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote glowingly of his impression of Gulyai-Polye. His report intrigued prominent Bolsheviks, who decided to visit the city personally. [[Lev Kamenev]] and a delegation of Ukrainian politicians, arrived by armored train a week following Antonov-Ovseenko visit, on May 7. Nikiforova met them at the train station, and with other members of Makhno's staff, [[Boris Veretelnikov]] and [[Mikhalev-Pavlenko]], offered to escort them into the city. After meeting Makhno and touring the city, Kamenev was impressed with Nikiforova, and upon returning to [[Dnipropetrovsk|Ekaterinoslav]], he telegraphed Moscow officials. He ordered that her sentence be reduced, from a year, to \"six months deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts.\" However, given the overwhelmingly anti-anarchist propaganda among Bolshevik commanders, politicians, and media, Antonov-Ovseenko's attempts to lobby for military support for the anarchists faltered. His political power declined, and he was replaced within weeks of his visit, on June 15, by [[Jukums V\u0101cietis]].<ref name=\"Skirda 100\"/>\n\n===Capture and death===\n{{Rquote|right|Recognition can be fatal for a terrorist and so it was for Nikiforova in the end. |Malcolm Archibald, 2007.<ref name=\"Archibald 1\"/>}}\nIn June 1919, Makhno's anarchist armies were outlawed by the Bolshevik command, and came under attack. Facing a two-front war against the white and red armies, Maria gathered a group of fighters, and reunited with her husband Witold Brzostek. Her intention was to field terrorist cells, as a formal fighting force was no longer available. Dispatching three cells on various missions, she took part in a sabotage mission against the [[White movement]] in the city of [[Sevastopol]]. There she and Bzhostek were recognized and arrested. Tried on September 16, 1919, she and her husband were found guilty and sentenced to death. Both were shot.\n\n==Political positions==\n\n===Anarchism and revolution===\nIn her youth, Nikiforova entered [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communist]] politics and adopted militant tactics to pursue them.<ref>{{harvnb|Archibald|2007}}: \"Around the same time she became a factory worker, Nikiforova also joined a local group of anarcho-communists. ... Maria became a full-fledged militant ...\"</ref> Throughout her years of activism, Nikiforova gave numerous speeches espousing her political opinions. However, transcriptions and quotes from her speeches scarcely survived the Soviet era, and she was not known to write her views in letters, essays, or articles. What is known of her speeches is that she was widely regarded for her charismatic oratory, which she used to expound anarchist views.<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/> Widely known as an anarchist, she was said to constantly wear entirely black clothing as a symbol of her libertarian philosophy.<ref name=\"Skirda 318\"/>\n\nDuring times of revolution, she favored immediate and complete [[Redistribution of wealth|redistribution of property]] owned by wealthy land owners, declaring, \"The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/>\n\nHowever, while she constantly spoke in favor of anarchist philosophy, she warned against [[vanguardism]] and [[elitism]], insisting that anarchists could not guarantee positive social change. \"The anarchists are not promising anything to anyone.\" She cautioned, \"The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/>\n\n===World War I enlistment===\n[[File:Emprunt National 1918.jpg|thumb|right|A French, anti-German propaganda poster. Nikiforova sided with the [[Allies of World War I]] and joined the [[French Army in World War I|French Army]].]]\nWhile living in exile in Paris, she sided with Peter Kropotkin on the issue of World War I, favoring the Allies in opposition to the German Empire. She graduated from [[French Army in World War I|French military school]] at the officer rank and served in the army.{{sfn|Archibald|2007}}\n\n===Conflicts with Soviet authority===\nUpon returning to Russia in 1917, Nikiforova was influenced by [[Apollon Karelin]], a veteran anarchist who advocated a tactical strategy of \"Soviet anarchism.\" Meeting her in Petrograd, Karelin's political tactics encouraged anarchist participation in Soviet institutions with the long term plan of directing them towards an anarchist agenda, provided these institutions did not deviate from revolutionary goals. In the event that they deviated from a radical agenda, anarchists were to rebel against them. Such institutional cooperation was widely disliked among anarchists, as they were largely a minority within such institutions, rendering their activity ineffectual.<ref>{{harvnb|Archibald|2007}}. See paragraph \"On a tactical level ...\"</ref>\n\nNikiforova agreed to ally with the Bolsheviks under special circumstances and negotiated to have herself appointed to a soviet institution, briefly becoming the Deputy leader of the Alexandrovsk [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|revkom]]. She would go on to help establish footholds for Soviet power in several Ukrainian cities, demanding material support from Bolshevik agents in return, which she then used to pursue her anarchist agenda.<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/> Although she would ally herself with the Red Army on multiple occasions, she was constantly at odds with their commanders and personally antagonized several, arguing against some their practices on revolutionary grounds. Upon discovering that a Soviet commander was hoarding luxury goods looted from an aristocrat's home, she angrily confronted him for his selfishness. \"The property of the estate owners doesn't belong to any particular detachment,\" she declared \"but to the people as a whole. Let the people take what they want.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 24\"/>\n\n==Public image==\n<!--\n===Reputation as a commander===\n\nWhat we do know for certain is that Marusya was a charismatic individual who made a strong impression on people she met and was capable of influencing them purely on the strength of her personality. Her comrades-in-arms were fiercely loyal to her and she returned their loyalty in kind.<ref name=\"Archibald 10\"/>\n\nThen Marusya stepped to the podium and began to speak. Now the Cossacks were paying attention. \"Cossacks, I must tell you that you are the butchers of the Russian workers. Will you continue to be so in the future, or will you acknowledge your own wickedness and join the ranks of the oppressed? Up to now you have shown no respect for the poor workers. For one of the tsar's roubles or a glass of wine, you have nailed them living to the cross.\"\n\nAs Marusya continued in this vein many of the Cossacks removed their caps and bowed their heads. Soon some of them were weeping like children.\n\nA knot of Aleksandrovsk intellectuals was standing in the crowd. They told each other: \"The speeches of the Left Bloc representatives seem so pale in comparison with the speeches of the anarchists and, in particular, with the speech of M. Nikiforova.\" One upshot of the meetings, which went on for days, was that a number of Cossacks maintained contact with the Gulyai-Pole anarchists even after they went home to the Kuban and other regions.<ref name=\"Archibald 19\"/>\n\nWith their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere.<ref name=\"Archibald 22\"/>\n\nSummer 1918: \"A carriage flew down the street at a mad speed. Carelessly sprawled in it was a young brunette wearing a [[Papakhi|kubanka]] at a rakish angle. Standing on the footboard was a broad-shouldered chap wearing red cavalry britches. The brunette and her bodyguard had all sorts of weapons hanging from them.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/>\n\n===Criminal accusations===\n In order to inflame the population, a story was spread that Marusya looted icons from churches. She was depicted as the leader of a gang of thieves.<ref name=\"Archibald 27\"/>\n-->\n\n===Physical descriptions===\nFollowing Nikiforova's death, several publications described her in terms which placed emphasis on her supposed unattractiveness. Chudnov, a former [[Makhnovism|Makhnovist]], wrote of her when recalling a 1918 meeting: \"This was a woman of 32 \u2013 35, medium height, with an emaciated, prematurely aged face in which there was something of a eunuch or hermaphrodite. Her hair was cropped short in a circle.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 8\"/> Years after meeting her in 1919, [[Aleksei Semyonovich Kiselyov|Aleksei Kiselyov]] described her in his memoirs: \"Around 30 years old. Thin with an emaciated face, she produced the impression of an old maid type. Narrow nose. Sunken cheeks. She wore a blouse and skirt and a small revolver hung from her belt.\" Kiselev also alleged that she was a [[cocaine]] addict. Nikiforova biographer, [[Malcolm Archibald]], noted that most Bolshevik writers described her in ways similar to this, and hypothesized that this was part of an effort to discredit her ideas with [[ad hominem]] attacks. \"One suspects the Bolshevik memoirists, finding her ideology unattractive, tried to make her external appearance ugly as well.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/>\n\nDescriptions of Nikiforova fall into two general categories, either highlighting an alleged repulsiveness, or beauty. An exception to the majority of Bolshevik descriptions, Raksha recalled his 1918 meeting with her in very positive terms: \"I had heard that she was a beautiful woman... Marusya was sitting at a table and had a cigarette in her teeth. This she-devil really was a beauty: about 30, gypsy-type with black hair and a magnificent bosom which filled out her military tunic.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 9\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Postmortem mythology===\nThroughout her life, Nikiforova had been wounded multiple times, or had been mistaken for dead, only to reappear in good health later. Due to her reputation within folklore, rumors spread in the months following her death that she was actually still alive.\n\n'''Marusya copycats'''\n\nFollowing her death, Nikiforova's surviving legacy created an opportunity for copycats{{mdash}}faux Marusyas{{mdash}}to appear in the months and years to follow. The only female atamansha while alive, Nikiforova was followed by three women fighters in the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]] who adopted her name for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"Archibald 43\"/>\n\nIn 1919, Marusya Sokolovskaia became the commander of her brother's cavalry detachment after his death in battle. A 25-year-old Ukrainian nationalist school teacher, she was captured by the Reds and shot. In 1920-1921, ''Black Maria'' (Marusya Chernaya) became a commander of a cavalry regiment in the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]. She died in battle against the Red Army. A final copycat, Marusya Kosova, appeared in the [[Tambov Rebellion]] in 1921-1922. After the revolt was suppressed, she disappeared.<ref name=\"Archibald 43-44\"/>\n\n'''International espionage rumors'''\n\nNikiforova was rumored to have become a spy for the Soviet government in Paris in the years following her death. There, it was claimed, she performed undercover work, and was involved in the assassination of [[Symon Petliura]], an exiled Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. In actuality, Petliura was assassinated by [[Sholom Schwartzbard]]. A fellow exile and Ukrainian-Jewish anarchist, and former member of [[Grigori Kotovsky]]'s anarchist detachment, Schwartzbard had worked alone in the assassination. Malcolm Archibald commented, \"The only truth in this story might be the fact of anarchists doing the Bolshevik's work for them.\"<ref name=\"Archibald 44\"/>\n\n===Treatment by historians===\nNikiforova left few written records or photographs of herself during much of her life.<ref name=\"Archibald 1\"/> This is owed in part to her hidden activity as an international terrorist. Operating underground, and in exile across multiple countries, Nikiforova did not begin to make her activity public knowledge until the last two years of her life, when she officially held a military command. A few contemporary records of her life survived the Soviet era. Nestor Makhno provided eye-witness accounts of several dramatic incidents in Nikiforova's life within his memoirs. Makhno's former adjutant, [[Viktor Belash]], also wrote of her life within his own records, which were rescued from files held by the Soviet secret police.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/> Briefly a member of the Red Army, Nikiforova's service record exists as one of the few official documentations of her life.<ref name=\"Archibald 3\"/>\n{{Rquote|left|Gradually a clearer picture of her life is coming to light and it is possible to establish a reasonably reliable narrative although many ambiguities remain.|Malcolm Archibald , 2007.<ref name=\"Archibald 3\"/>}}\nNikiforova has been largely ignored by historians since her death. Soviet-era historians largely erased her from history, despite the important role she played in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and subsequent civil war. A biographical dictionary of the Russian Revolution includes hundreds of entries, but does not include her. Of the few Bolshevik women who are included, none held military commands as Nikiforova did. There is no scholarly biography of her life, or historiography of her era which mentions her. The few references made to her by Bolshevik contemporaries in memoirs and works of fiction are biased against her. These depict her uniformly as \"repulsive and evil,\" with little exception.<ref name=\"Archibald 1\"/>\n\nNikiforova has also been ignored by non-Soviet historians. Today, Nikiforova remains obscure and uncelebrated within Ukraine. She has been ignored by Ukrainian historians. Critics of this treatment speculate that as an anti-nationalist who fought and was executed by the White Army, Nikforova's activities have been too difficult to rewrite and reconcile to fit a reformist historical narrative.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/>\n\nThere is little explanation for the neglect on the part of anarchist historians. While several biographies of Nestor Makhno have been published, there is little mention of Nikiforova. This is despite their close collaboration, and her greater contemporary prominence, according to biographer Malcolm Archibald: \"...in 1918 Nikiforova was already famous as an anarchist atamansha (military female leader) throughout Ukraine, while Makhno was still a rather obscure figure operating in a provincial backwater.\" Of several anarchist historians who have published histories regarding Makhno, only [[Alexandre Skirda]]'s work, ''Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack'', mentions her{{mdash}}a single paragraph, out of over 400 pages, is devoted to her.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/>\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians have attempted to reintroduce individuals expunged from history, such as Nikiforova, Makhno, and other anarchists.<ref name=\"Archibald 2\"/> Several essays on Nikiforova have been published, and the Nikiforova biography, ''Atamansha'', published in 2007, was based on such sources in Russia and the Ukraine.<ref name=\"Archibald 3\"/>\n\nNikiforova appears in the French novel \"Clarisse\", by [[Cecil Saint-Laurent]]. She keeps Clarisse prisoner in her armoured train in Ukraine, and the two women become lovers, Clarisse being deflowered by Nikiforova.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Biography|Soviet Union|Ukraine|War}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Anarchism in Ukraine]]\n*[[Anarchism and violence]]\n*[[Olga Taratuta]]\n*[[Propaganda of the deed]]\n*[[Women in the First World War]]\n*[[Women in the military]]\n*[[Women in warfare (1900\u20131939)]]\n*[[Women warriors in literature and culture|Woman warrior]]\n}}\n;Lists\n*[[List of guerrillas]]\n*[[List of military commanders]]\n*[[List of Ukrainians]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''{{Small|I}}.''' {{Note label|A|I|none}} Historian Michael Palij refers to this city as \"Oleksandrivsk\".<ref name=\"Palij 74\"/> This should not be confused with contemporary [[Oleksandrivsk]], as the city's Russian name formally matched Nikiforova's home city, Alexandrovsk.

{"title_page": "Group theory", "text_new": "{{hatnote|This article covers advanced notions. For basic topics, see [[Group (mathematics)]].}}\n{{for|group theory in social sciences|social group}}\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|The popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ern\u0151 Rubik]] has been used as an illustration of [[permutation group]]s. See [[Rubik's Cube group]].]]\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], '''group theory''' studies the [[algebraic structure]]s known as [[group (mathematics)|groups]].  \nThe concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s and [[axiom]]s. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. [[Linear algebraic group]]s and [[Lie group]]s are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.\n\nVarious physical systems, such as [[crystal]]s and the [[hydrogen atom]], may be modelled by [[symmetry group]]s. Thus group theory and the closely related [[representation theory]] have many important applications in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[materials science]]. Group theory is also central to [[public key cryptography]].\n\nOne of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century<ref>* Elwes, Richard, \"[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups],\" ''Plus Magazine'', Issue 41, December 2006.</ref> was the collaborative effort, taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980, that culminated in a complete [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\n==Main classes of groups==\n{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}\n\nThe range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from [[Finite set|finite]] [[permutation group]]s and special examples of [[matrix group]]s to abstract groups that may be specified through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by [[Generating set of a group|generators]] and [[Binary relation|relations]].\n\n===Permutation groups===\nThe first [[Class (set theory)|class]] of groups to undergo a systematic study was [[permutation group]]s. Given any set ''X'' and a collection ''G'' of [[bijection]]s of ''X'' into itself (known as ''permutations'') that is closed under compositions and inverses, ''G'' is a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on ''X''. If ''X'' consists of ''n'' elements and ''G'' consists of ''all'' permutations, ''G'' is the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub>; in general, any permutation group ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group of ''X''. An early construction due to [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] exhibited any group as a permutation group, acting on itself ({{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''}}) by means of the left [[regular representation]].\n\nIn many cases, the structure of a permutation group can be studied using the properties of its action on the corresponding set. For example, in this way one proves that for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A<sub>''n''</sub> is [[simple group|simple]], i.e. does not admit any proper [[normal subgroup]]s. This fact plays a key role in the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem|impossibility of solving a general algebraic equation of degree {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}} in radicals]].\n\n===Matrix groups===\nThe next important class of groups is given by ''matrix groups'', or [[linear group]]s. Here ''G'' is a set consisting of invertible [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of given order ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' that is closed under the products and inverses. Such a group acts on the ''n''-dimensional vector space ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> by [[linear transformation]]s. This action makes matrix groups conceptually similar to permutation groups, and the geometry of the action may be usefully exploited to establish properties of the group ''G''.\n\n===Transformation groups===\nPermutation groups and matrix groups are special cases of [[transformation group]]s: groups that act on a certain space ''X'' preserving its inherent structure. In the case of permutation groups, ''X'' is a set; for matrix groups, ''X'' is a [[vector space]]. The concept of a transformation group is closely related with the concept of a [[symmetry group]]: transformation groups frequently consist of ''all'' transformations that preserve a certain structure.\n  \nThe theory of transformation groups forms a bridge connecting group theory with [[differential geometry]]. A long line of research, originating with [[Sophus Lie|Lie]] and [[Felix Klein|Klein]], considers group actions on [[manifold]]s by [[homeomorphism]]s or [[diffeomorphism]]s. The groups themselves may be [[discrete group|discrete]] or [[continuous group|continuous]].\n\n===Abstract groups===\nMost groups considered in the first stage of the development of group theory were \"concrete\", having been realized through numbers, permutations, or matrices. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea of an abstract group as a set with operations satisfying a certain system of axioms began to take hold. A typical way of specifying an abstract group is through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by ''generators and relations'',\n\n: <math> G = \\langle S|R\\rangle. </math>\n\nA significant source of abstract groups is given by the construction of a ''factor group'', or [[quotient group]], ''G''/''H'', of a group ''G'' by a [[normal subgroup]] ''H''. [[Class group]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in [[number theory]]. If a group ''G'' is a permutation group on a set ''X'', the factor group ''G''/''H'' is no longer acting on ''X''; but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to worry about this discrepancy.\n\nThe change of perspective from concrete to abstract groups makes it natural to consider properties of groups that are independent of a particular realization, or in modern language, invariant under [[isomorphism]], as well as the classes of group with a given such property: [[finite group]]s, [[periodic group]]s, [[simple group]]s, [[solvable group]]s, and so on. Rather than exploring properties of an individual group, one seeks to establish results that apply to a whole class of groups. The new paradigm was of paramount importance for the development of mathematics: it foreshadowed the creation of [[abstract algebra]] in the works of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Emil Artin]], [[Emmy Noether]], and mathematicians of their school.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Groups with additional structure ===\nAn important elaboration of the concept of a group occurs if ''G'' is endowed with additional structure, notably, of a [[topological space]], [[differentiable manifold]], or [[algebraic variety]]. If the group operations ''m'' (multiplication) and ''i'' (inversion),\n\n: <math> m: G\\times G\\to G, (g,h)\\mapsto gh, \\quad i:G\\to G, g\\mapsto g^{-1}, </math>\n\nare compatible with this structure, that is, they are [[continuous map|continuous]], [[smooth map|smooth]] or [[Regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular]] (in the sense of algebraic geometry) maps, then ''G'' is a [[topological group]], a [[Lie group]], or an [[algebraic group]].<ref>This process of imposing extra structure has been formalized through the notion of a  [[group object]] in a suitable [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Thus Lie groups are group objects in the category of differentiable manifolds and affine algebraic groups are group objects in the category of affine algebraic varieties.</ref>\n\nThe presence of extra structure relates these types of groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for [[abstract harmonic analysis]], whereas [[Lie group]]s (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of [[differential geometry]] and unitary [[representation theory]]. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, [[compact Lie group|compact connected Lie groups]] have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group ''\u0393'' can be realized as a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in a topological group ''G'', the geometry and analysis pertaining to ''G'' yield important results about ''\u0393''. A comparatively recent trend in the theory of finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups ([[profinite group]]s): for example, a single [[powerful p-group|''p''-adic analytic group]] ''G'' has a family of quotients which are finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]] of various orders, and properties of ''G'' translate into the properties of its finite quotients.\n\n==Branches of group theory==\n\n===Finite group theory===\n{{Main|Finite group}}\nDuring the twentieth century, mathematicians investigated some aspects of the theory of finite groups in great depth, especially the [[Local analysis|local theory]] of finite groups and the theory of [[Solvable group|solvable]] and [[nilpotent group]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013|reason=In who's opinion?}} As a consequence, the complete [[classification of finite simple groups]] was achieved, meaning that all those [[simple group]]s from which all finite groups can be built are now known.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians such as [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley]] and [[Robert Steinberg|Steinberg]] also increased our understanding of finite analogs of [[classical groups]], and other related groups. One such family of groups is the family of [[general linear group]]s over [[finite field]]s.  \nFinite groups often occur when considering [[symmetry]] of mathematical or\nphysical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. The theory of [[Lie group]]s,\nwhich may be viewed as dealing with \"[[continuous symmetry]]\", is strongly influenced by the associated [[Weyl group]]s. These are finite groups generated by reflections which act on a finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The properties of finite groups can thus play a role in subjects such as [[theoretical physics]] and [[chemistry]].\n\n===Representation of groups===\n{{Main|Representation theory}}\nSaying that a group ''G'' ''[[Group action (mathematics)|acts]]'' on a set ''X'' means that every element of ''G'' defines a bijective map on the set ''X'' in a way compatible with the group structure. When ''X'' has more structure, it is useful to restrict this notion further: a representation of ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[group homomorphism]]:\n\n:<math>\\rho:G \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V),</math>\n\nwhere [[general linear group|GL]](''V'') consists of the invertible [[linear map|linear transformations]] of ''V''. In other words, to every group element ''g'' is assigned an [[automorphism]] ''\u03c1''(''g'') such that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c1''(''g'') \u2218 ''\u03c1''(''h'') = ''\u03c1''(''gh'')}} for any ''h'' in ''G''.\n\nThis definition can be understood in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics.<ref>Such as [[group cohomology]] or [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]].</ref> On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group ''G'': often, the group operation in ''G'' is abstractly given, but via ''\u03c1'', it corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication|multiplication of matrices]], which is very explicit.<ref>In particular, if the representation is [[faithful representation|faithful]].</ref> On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies the study of the object in question. For example, if ''G'' is finite, it is [[Maschke's theorem|known]] that ''V'' above decomposes into [[irreducible representation|irreducible parts]]. These parts in turn are much more easily manageable than the whole ''V'' (via [[Schur's lemma]]).\n\nGiven a group ''G'', [[representation theory]] then asks what representations of ''G'' exist. There are several settings, and the employed methods and obtained results are rather different in every case: [[representation theory of finite groups]] and representations of [[Lie group]]s are two main subdomains of the theory. The totality of representations is governed by the group's [[character theory|characters]]. For example, [[Fourier series|Fourier polynomial]]s can be interpreted as the characters of [[unitary group|U(1)]], the group of [[complex numbers]] of [[absolute value]] ''1'', acting on the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>2</sup>]]-space of periodic functions.\n\n===Lie theory===\n{{main|Lie theory}}\nA [[Lie group]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are compatible with the [[Differential structure|smooth structure]]. Lie groups are named after [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student [[Arthur Tresse]], page 3.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants diff\u00e9rentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1\u201388 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2273334/files/article.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLie groups represent the best-developed theory of [[continuous symmetry]] of [[mathematical object]]s and [[mathematical structure|structures]], which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics, as well as for modern [[theoretical physics]]. They provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]] ([[differential Galois theory]]), in much the same way as [[permutation groups]] are used in [[Galois theory]] for analysing the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]]. An extension of Galois theory to the case of continuous symmetry groups was one of Lie's principal motivations.\n\n===Combinatorial and geometric group theory===\n{{main|Geometric group theory}}\nGroups can be described in different ways. Finite groups can be described by writing down the [[group table]] consisting of all possible multiplications {{nowrap|''g'' \u2022 ''h''}}. A more compact way of defining a group is by ''generators and relations'', also called the ''presentation'' of a group. Given any set ''F'' of generators <math>\\{g_i\\}_{i\\in I}</math>, the [[free group]] generated by ''F'' surjects onto the group ''G''. The kernel of this map is called the subgroup of relations, generated by some subset ''D''. The presentation is usually denoted by <math>\\langle F \\mid D\\rangle.</math> For example, the group presentation <math>\\langle a,b\\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\rangle</math> describes a group which is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}.</math> A string consisting of generator symbols and their inverses is called a ''word''.\n\n[[Combinatorial group theory]] studies groups from the perspective of generators and relations.<ref>{{harvnb|Schupp|Lyndon|2001}}</ref> It is particularly useful where finiteness assumptions are satisfied, for example finitely generated groups, or finitely presented groups (i.e. in addition the relations are finite). The area makes use of the connection of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s via their [[fundamental group]]s. For example, one can show that every subgroup of a free group is free.\n\nThere are several natural questions arising from giving a group by its presentation. The ''[[word problem for groups|word problem]]'' asks whether two words are effectively the same group element. By relating the problem to [[Turing machine]]s, one can show that there is in general no [[algorithm]] solving this task. Another, generally harder, algorithmically insoluble problem is the [[group isomorphism problem]], which asks whether two groups given by different presentations are actually isomorphic. For example, the group with presentation <math>\\langle x,y \\mid xyxyx = e \\rangle,</math> is isomorphic to the additive group '''Z''' of integers, although this may not be immediately apparent.<ref>Writing <math>z=xy</math>, one has <math>G \\cong \\langle z,y \\mid z^3 = y\\rangle \\cong \\langle z\\rangle.</math></ref>\n\n[[File:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|150px|thumb|The Cayley graph of &lang; x, y \u2223 &rang;, the free group of rank 2.]]\n[[Geometric group theory]] attacks these problems from a geometric viewpoint, either by viewing groups as geometric objects, or by finding suitable geometric objects a group acts on.<ref>{{harvnb|La Harpe|2000}}</ref> The first idea is made precise by means of the [[Cayley graph]], whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the [[word metric]] given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of [[John Milnor|Milnor]] and Svarc then says that given a group ''G'' acting in a reasonable manner on a [[metric space]] ''X'', for example a [[compact manifold]], then ''G'' is [[quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space ''X''.\n\n==Connection of groups and symmetry==\n{{main|Symmetry group}}\nGiven a structured object ''X'' of any sort, a [[symmetry]] is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases, for example\n#If ''X'' is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a [[bijection|bijective]] map from the set to itself, giving rise to [[permutation group]]s.\n#If the object ''X'' is a set of points in the plane with its [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] structure or any other [[metric space]], a symmetry is a [[bijection]] of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an [[isometry]]). The corresponding group is called [[isometry group]] of ''X''.\n#If instead [[angle]]s are preserved, one speaks of [[conformal map]]s. Conformal maps give rise to [[Kleinian group]]s, for example.\n#Symmetries are not restricted to geometrical objects, but include algebraic objects as well.  For instance, the equation <math>x^2-3=0</math> has the two solutions <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> and <math>-\\sqrt{3}</math>. In this case, the group that exchanges the two roots is the [[Galois group]] belonging to the equation.  Every polynomial equation in one variable has a Galois group, that is a certain permutation group on its roots.\n\nThe axioms of a group formalize the essential aspects of [[symmetry]]. Symmetries form a group: they are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] because if you take a symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity comes from the fact that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.\n\n[[Frucht's theorem]] says that every group is the symmetry group of some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. So every abstract group is actually the symmetries of some explicit object.\n\nThe saying of \"preserving the structure\" of an object can be made precise by working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Maps preserving the structure are then the [[morphism]]s, and the symmetry group is the [[automorphism group]] of the object in question.\n\n==Applications of group theory==<!--this section is linked at from [[Applications of group theory]]-->\nApplications of group theory abound. Almost all structures in [[abstract algebra]] are special cases of groups. [[Ring (mathematics)|Rings]], for example, can be viewed as [[abelian group]]s (corresponding to addition) together with a second operation (corresponding to multiplication). Therefore, group theoretic arguments underlie large parts of the theory of those entities.\n\n===Galois theory===\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n[[Galois theory]] uses groups to describe the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial (or more precisely the automorphisms of the algebras generated by these roots). The [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] provides a link between [[algebraic field extension]]s and group theory. It gives an effective criterion for the solvability of polynomial equations in terms of the solvability of the corresponding [[Galois group]]. For example, ''S''<sub>5</sub>, the [[symmetric group]] in 5 elements, is not solvable which implies that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals in the way equations of lower degree can. The theory, being one of the historical roots of group theory, is still fruitfully applied to yield new results in areas such as [[class field theory]].\n\n===Algebraic topology===\n{{main|Algebraic topology}}\n[[Algebraic topology]] is another domain which prominently [[functor|associates]] groups to the objects the theory is interested in. There, groups are used to describe certain invariants of [[topological space]]s. They are called \"invariants\" because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some [[homeomorphism|deformation]]. For example, the [[fundamental group]] \"counts\" how many paths in the space are essentially different. The [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], proved in 2002/2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], is a prominent application of this idea. The influence is not unidirectional, though. For example, algebraic topology makes use of [[Eilenberg\u2013MacLane space]]s which are spaces with prescribed [[homotopy groups]]. Similarly [[algebraic K-theory]] relies in a way on [[classifying space]]s of groups. Finally, the name of the [[torsion subgroup]] of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory.\n\n[[File:Torus.png|thumb|right|200px|A torus. Its abelian group structure is induced from the map {{nowrap|'''C''' \u2192 '''C'''/('''Z''' + ''\u03c4'''''Z''')}}, where ''\u03c4'' is a parameter living in the [[upper half plane]].]]\n\n===Algebraic geometry===\n{{main|Algebraic geometry}}\n[[Algebraic geometry]] likewise uses group theory in many ways. [[Abelian variety|Abelian varieties]] have been introduced above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures.<ref>For example the [[Hodge conjecture]] (in certain cases).</ref> The one-dimensional case, namely [[elliptic curve]]s is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing.<ref>See the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], one of the [[millennium problem]]s</ref> In another direction, [[toric variety|toric varieties]] are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] acted on by a [[torus]]. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in [[algebraic geometry]], in particular [[resolution of singularities]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Abramovich | first1=Dan | last2=Karu | first2=Kalle | last3=Matsuki | first3=Kenji | last4=Wlodarczyk | first4=Jaroslaw | title=Torification and factorization of birational maps | mr=1896232  | year=2002 | journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=531\u2013572 | doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-02-00396-X| arxiv=math/9904135 }}</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n[[Algebraic number theory]] makes uses of groups for some important applications.

The failure of this statement for [[Dedekind ring|more general rings]] gives rise to [[class group]]s and [[regular prime]]s, which feature in [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer's]] treatment of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\n===Harmonic analysis===\n{{main|Harmonic analysis}}\nAnalysis on Lie groups and certain other groups is called [[harmonic analysis]]. [[Haar measure]]s, that is, integrals invariant under the translation in a Lie group, are used for [[pattern recognition]] and other [[image processing]] techniques.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Lenz | first1=Reiner | title=Group theoretical methods in image processing | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn=978-0-387-52290-6 | year=1990 | volume=413 | url=https://archive.org/details/grouptheoretical0000lenz | doi=10.1007/3-540-52290-5 | url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Combinatorics===\nIn [[combinatorics]], the notion of [[permutation]] group and the concept of group action are often used to simplify the counting of a set of objects; see in particular [[Burnside's lemma]].\n\n[[File:Fifths.png|right|thumb|150px|The circle of fifths may be endowed with a cyclic group structure]]\n\n===Music===\nThe presence of the 12-[[Periodic group|periodicity]] in the [[circle of fifths]] yields applications of [[elementary group theory]] in [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]]. [[Transformational theory]] models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group.\n\n===Physics===\nIn [[physics]], groups are important because they describe the symmetries which the laws of physics seem to obey. According to [[Noether's theorem]], every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] of the system. Physicists are very interested in group representations, especially of Lie groups, since these representations often point the way to the \"possible\" physical theories. Examples of the use of groups in physics include the [[Standard Model]], [[gauge theory]], the [[Lorentz group]], and the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n===Chemistry and materials science===\nIn [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]], groups are used to classify [[crystal structure]]s, regular polyhedra, and the [[molecular symmetry|symmetries of molecules]].  The assigned point groups can then be used to determine physical properties (such as [[chemical polarity]] and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]), spectroscopic properties (particularly useful for [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], circular dichroism spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy), and to construct [[molecular orbital]]s.\n\nMolecular symmetry is responsible for many physical and spectroscopic properties of compounds and provides relevant information about how chemical reactions occur. In order to assign a point group for any given molecule, it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it. The symmetry operation is an action, such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane. In other words, it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration. In group theory, the rotation axes and mirror planes are called \"symmetry elements\". These elements can be a point, line or plane with respect to which the symmetry operation is carried out. The symmetry operations of a molecule determine the specific point group for this molecule.\n\n[[File:Miri2.jpg|thumb|100px|Water molecule with symmetry axis]]\nIn [[chemistry]], there are five important symmetry operations. They are identity operation ('''E)''', rotation operation or proper rotation('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') , reflection operation('''\u03c3)''', inversion('''i''') and rotation reflection operation or improper rotation ('''S<sub>''n''</sub>'''). The identity operation ('''E''') consists of leaving the molecule as it is. This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a [[chiral]] molecule consists of only the identity operation. An identity operation is a characteristic of every molecule even if it has no symmetry. Rotation around an axis ('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. It is rotation through the 360 degree/n about a rotation axis. For example, if a [[water]] molecule rotates 180\u00b0 around the axis that passes through the [[oxygen]] atom and between the [[hydrogen]] atoms, it is in the same configuration as it started. In this case, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, since applying it twice produces the identity operation.In the reflection operation ('''\u03c3''') the molecule contains a mirror plane. Many molecules have mirror planes, although they may not be obvious to identify. The reflection operation exchanges left and right, as if each point had moved perpendicularly through the plane to a position exactly as far from the plane as when it started.When the plane is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation, it is called '''\u03c3<sub>''h''</sub>'''\u00a0 (horizontal). Other planes, which contain the principal axis of rotation, are labeled '''\u03c3<sub>''v''</sub>''' (vertical) or '''\u03c3<sub>''d''</sub>''' (dihedral).  Other symmetry operations are inversion and improper rotation (rotation followed by reflection).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shriver |first1=Duward | last2=Atkins | first2=Peter |date=2009 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5th |publisher=Freeman, W.H. & Company |isbn=9781429218207 }}</ref>\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\nGroup theory can be used to resolve the incompleteness of the statistical interpretations of mechanics developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]], relating to the summing of an infinite number of probabilities to yield a meaningful solution.<ref>[[Norbert Wiener]], Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine,  {{ISBN|978-0262730099}}, Ch 2</ref>\n\n===Cryptography===\n \nVery large groups of prime order constructed in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] serve for [[public-key cryptography]]. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from the flexibility of the geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the [[discrete logarithm]] very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, [[Caesar cipher|Caesar's cipher]], may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. Most cryptographic schemes use groups in some way. In particular Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange uses finite cyclic groups. So the term group-based cryptography refers mostly to cryptographic protocols that use infinite nonabelian groups such as a braid group.\n\n[[File:Caesar3.svg|thumb|left|150px|The [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''<sub>26</sub> underlies [[Caesar's cipher]].]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of group theory}}\nGroup theory has three main historical sources: [[number theory]], the theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, and [[geometry]]. The number-theoretic strand was begun by [[Leonhard Euler]], and developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss's]] work on [[modular arithmetic]] and additive and multiplicative groups related to [[quadratic field]]s. Early results about [[permutation group]]s were obtained by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]], and [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] in their quest for general solutions of polynomial equations of high degree. [[\u00c9variste Galois]] coined the term \"group\" and established a connection, now known as [[Galois theory]], between the nascent theory of groups and [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]]. In geometry, groups first became important in [[projective geometry]] and, later, [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed group theory to be the organizing principle of geometry.\n\n[[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]], in the 1830s, was the first to employ groups to determine the solvability of [[polynomial equation]]s. [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] pushed these investigations further by creating the theory of [[permutation groups]]. The second historical source for groups stems from [[geometry|geometrical]] situations. In an attempt to come to grips with possible geometries (such as [[euclidean geometry|euclidean]], [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] or [[projective geometry]]) using group theory, [[Felix Klein]] initiated the [[Erlangen programme]]. [[Sophus Lie]], in 1884, started using groups (now called [[Lie group]]s) attached to [[analysis (mathematics)|analytic]] problems. Thirdly, groups were, at first implicitly and later explicitly, used in [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nThe different scope of these early sources resulted in different notions of groups. The theory of groups was unified starting around 1880. Since then, the impact of group theory has been ever growing, giving rise to the birth of [[abstract algebra]] in the early 20th century, [[representation theory]], and many more influential spin-off domains. The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is a vast body of work from the mid 20th century, classifying all the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of group theory topics]]\n*[[Examples of groups]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Linear algebraic groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-97370-8 | mr=1102012  | year=1991 | volume=126 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0941-6}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Carter | first1=Nathan C. | title=Visual group theory | url=http://web.bentley.edu/empl/c/ncarter/vgt/ | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | series=Classroom Resource Materials Series | isbn=978-0-88385-757-1 | mr=2504193  | year=2009}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cannon | first1=John J. | title=Computers in group theory: A survey | mr=0290613  | year=1969 | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=12 | pages=3\u201312 | doi=10.1145/362835.362837}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Herstellung von Graphen mit vorgegebener abstrakter Gruppe | url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | year=1939 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=6 | pages=239\u201350 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083831/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | archivedate=2008-12-01 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Golubitsky | first1=Martin| last2=Stewart | first2=Ian | author1-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician)| title =Nonlinear dynamics of networks: the groupoid formalism |mr=2223010  |journal= Bull.

See [[Rubik's Cube group]].]]\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[abstract algebra]], '''group theory''' studies the [[algebraic structure]]s known as [[group (mathematics)|groups]].  \nThe concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[vector space]]s, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s and [[axiom]]s. Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra. [[Linear algebraic group]]s and [[Lie group]]s are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.\n\nVarious physical systems, such as [[crystal]]s and the [[hydrogen atom]], may be modelled by [[symmetry group]]s. Thus group theory and the closely related [[representation theory]] have many important applications in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[materials science]]. Group theory is also central to [[public key cryptography]].\n\nOne of the most important mathematical achievements of the 20th century<ref>* Elwes, Richard, \"[http://plus.maths.org/issue41/features/elwes/index.html An enormous theorem: the classification of finite simple groups],\" ''Plus Magazine'', Issue 41, December 2006.</ref> was the collaborative effort, taking up more than 10,000 journal pages and mostly published between 1960 and 1980, that culminated in a complete [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\n==Main classes of groups==\n{{Main|Group (mathematics)}}\n\nThe range of groups being considered has gradually expanded from [[Finite set|finite]] [[permutation group]]s and special examples of [[matrix group]]s to abstract groups that may be specified through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by [[Generating set of a group|generators]] and [[Binary relation|relations]].\n\n===Permutation groups===\nThe first [[Class (set theory)|class]] of groups to undergo a systematic study was [[permutation group]]s. Given any set ''X'' and a collection ''G'' of [[bijection]]s of ''X'' into itself (known as ''permutations'') that is closed under compositions and inverses, ''G'' is a group [[Group action (mathematics)|acting]] on ''X''. If ''X'' consists of ''n'' elements and ''G'' consists of ''all'' permutations, ''G'' is the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub>; in general, any permutation group ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group of ''X''. An early construction due to [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] exhibited any group as a permutation group, acting on itself ({{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''G''}}) by means of the left [[regular representation]].\n\nIn many cases, the structure of a permutation group can be studied using the properties of its action on the corresponding set. For example, in this way one proves that for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A<sub>''n''</sub> is [[simple group|simple]], i.e. does not admit any proper [[normal subgroup]]s. This fact plays a key role in the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem|impossibility of solving a general algebraic equation of degree {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 5}} in radicals]].\n\n===Matrix groups===\nThe next important class of groups is given by ''matrix groups'', or [[linear group]]s. Here ''G'' is a set consisting of invertible [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of given order ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' that is closed under the products and inverses. Such a group acts on the ''n''-dimensional vector space ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> by [[linear transformation]]s. This action makes matrix groups conceptually similar to permutation groups, and the geometry of the action may be usefully exploited to establish properties of the group ''G''.\n\n===Transformation groups===\nPermutation groups and matrix groups are special cases of [[transformation group]]s: groups that act on a certain space ''X'' preserving its inherent structure. In the case of permutation groups, ''X'' is a set; for matrix groups, ''X'' is a [[vector space]]. The concept of a transformation group is closely related with the concept of a [[symmetry group]]: transformation groups frequently consist of ''all'' transformations that preserve a certain structure.\n  \nThe theory of transformation groups forms a bridge connecting group theory with [[differential geometry]]. A long line of research, originating with [[Sophus Lie|Lie]] and [[Felix Klein|Klein]], considers group actions on [[manifold]]s by [[homeomorphism]]s or [[diffeomorphism]]s. The groups themselves may be [[discrete group|discrete]] or [[continuous group|continuous]].\n\n===Abstract groups===\nMost groups considered in the first stage of the development of group theory were \"concrete\", having been realized through numbers, permutations, or matrices. It was not until the late nineteenth century that the idea of an abstract group as a set with operations satisfying a certain system of axioms began to take hold. A typical way of specifying an abstract group is through a [[presentation of a group|presentation]] by ''generators and relations'',\n\n: <math> G = \\langle S|R\\rangle. </math>\n\nA significant source of abstract groups is given by the construction of a ''factor group'', or [[quotient group]], ''G''/''H'', of a group ''G'' by a [[normal subgroup]] ''H''. [[Class group]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in [[number theory]]. If a group ''G'' is a permutation group on a set ''X'', the factor group ''G''/''H'' is no longer acting on ''X''; but the idea of an abstract group permits one not to worry about this discrepancy.\n\nThe change of perspective from concrete to abstract groups makes it natural to consider properties of groups that are independent of a particular realization, or in modern language, invariant under [[isomorphism]], as well as the classes of group with a given such property: [[finite group]]s, [[periodic group]]s, [[simple group]]s, [[solvable group]]s, and so on. Rather than exploring properties of an individual group, one seeks to establish results that apply to a whole class of groups. The new paradigm was of paramount importance for the development of mathematics: it foreshadowed the creation of [[abstract algebra]] in the works of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Emil Artin]], [[Emmy Noether]], and mathematicians of their school.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Groups with additional structure ===\nAn important elaboration of the concept of a group occurs if ''G'' is endowed with additional structure, notably, of a [[topological space]], [[differentiable manifold]], or [[algebraic variety]]. If the group operations ''m'' (multiplication) and ''i'' (inversion),\n\n: <math> m: G\\times G\\to G, (g,h)\\mapsto gh, \\quad i:G\\to G, g\\mapsto g^{-1}, </math>\n\nare compatible with this structure, that is, they are [[continuous map|continuous]], [[smooth map|smooth]] or [[Regular map (algebraic geometry)|regular]] (in the sense of algebraic geometry) maps, then ''G'' is a [[topological group]], a [[Lie group]], or an [[algebraic group]].<ref>This process of imposing extra structure has been formalized through the notion of a  [[group object]] in a suitable [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Thus Lie groups are group objects in the category of differentiable manifolds and affine algebraic groups are group objects in the category of affine algebraic varieties.</ref>\n\nThe presence of extra structure relates these types of groups with other mathematical disciplines and means that more tools are available in their study. Topological groups form a natural domain for [[abstract harmonic analysis]], whereas [[Lie group]]s (frequently realized as transformation groups) are the mainstays of [[differential geometry]] and unitary [[representation theory]]. Certain classification questions that cannot be solved in general can be approached and resolved for special subclasses of groups. Thus, [[compact Lie group|compact connected Lie groups]] have been completely classified. There is a fruitful relation between infinite abstract groups and topological groups: whenever a group ''\u0393'' can be realized as a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in a topological group ''G'', the geometry and analysis pertaining to ''G'' yield important results about ''\u0393''. A comparatively recent trend in the theory of finite groups exploits their connections with compact topological groups ([[profinite group]]s): for example, a single [[powerful p-group|''p''-adic analytic group]] ''G'' has a family of quotients which are finite [[p-group|''p''-groups]] of various orders, and properties of ''G'' translate into the properties of its finite quotients.\n\n==Branches of group theory==\n\n===Finite group theory===\n{{Main|Finite group}}\nDuring the twentieth century, mathematicians investigated some aspects of the theory of finite groups in great depth, especially the [[Local analysis|local theory]] of finite groups and the theory of [[Solvable group|solvable]] and [[nilpotent group]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013|reason=In who's opinion?}} As a consequence, the complete [[classification of finite simple groups]] was achieved, meaning that all those [[simple group]]s from which all finite groups can be built are now known.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, mathematicians such as [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley]] and [[Robert Steinberg|Steinberg]] also increased our understanding of finite analogs of [[classical groups]], and other related groups. One such family of groups is the family of [[general linear group]]s over [[finite field]]s.  \nFinite groups often occur when considering [[symmetry]] of mathematical or\nphysical objects, when those objects admit just a finite number of structure-preserving transformations. The theory of [[Lie group]]s,\nwhich may be viewed as dealing with \"[[continuous symmetry]]\", is strongly influenced by the associated [[Weyl group]]s. These are finite groups generated by reflections which act on a finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The properties of finite groups can thus play a role in subjects such as [[theoretical physics]] and [[chemistry]].\n\n===Representation of groups===\n{{Main|Representation theory}}\nSaying that a group ''G'' ''[[Group action (mathematics)|acts]]'' on a set ''X'' means that every element of ''G'' defines a bijective map on the set ''X'' in a way compatible with the group structure. When ''X'' has more structure, it is useful to restrict this notion further: a representation of ''G'' on a [[vector space]] ''V'' is a [[group homomorphism]]:\n\n:<math>\\rho:G \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V),</math>\n\nwhere [[general linear group|GL]](''V'') consists of the invertible [[linear map|linear transformations]] of ''V''. In other words, to every group element ''g'' is assigned an [[automorphism]] ''\u03c1''(''g'') such that {{nowrap|1=''\u03c1''(''g'') \u2218 ''\u03c1''(''h'') = ''\u03c1''(''gh'')}} for any ''h'' in ''G''.\n\nThis definition can be understood in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics.<ref>Such as [[group cohomology]] or [[Equivariant algebraic K-theory|equivariant K-theory]].</ref> On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group ''G'': often, the group operation in ''G'' is abstractly given, but via ''\u03c1'', it corresponds to the [[matrix multiplication|multiplication of matrices]], which is very explicit.<ref>In particular, if the representation is [[faithful representation|faithful]].</ref> On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies the study of the object in question. For example, if ''G'' is finite, it is [[Maschke's theorem|known]] that ''V'' above decomposes into [[irreducible representation|irreducible parts]]. These parts in turn are much more easily manageable than the whole ''V'' (via [[Schur's lemma]]).\n\nGiven a group ''G'', [[representation theory]] then asks what representations of ''G'' exist. There are several settings, and the employed methods and obtained results are rather different in every case: [[representation theory of finite groups]] and representations of [[Lie group]]s are two main subdomains of the theory. The totality of representations is governed by the group's [[character theory|characters]]. For example, [[Fourier series|Fourier polynomial]]s can be interpreted as the characters of [[unitary group|U(1)]], the group of [[complex numbers]] of [[absolute value]] ''1'', acting on the [[Lp space|''L''<sup>2</sup>]]-space of periodic functions.\n\n===Lie theory===\n{{main|Lie theory}}\nA [[Lie group]] is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that is also a [[differentiable manifold]], with the property that the group operations are compatible with the [[Differential structure|smooth structure]]. Lie groups are named after [[Sophus Lie]], who laid the foundations of the theory of continuous [[transformation group]]s. The term ''groupes de Lie'' first appeared in French in 1893 in the thesis of Lie's student [[Arthur Tresse]], page 3.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Sur les invariants diff\u00e9rentiels des groupes continus de transformations | author= Arthur Tresse |journal=Acta Mathematica|volume=18|year=1893|pages=1\u201388 |doi=10.1007/bf02418270|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2273334/files/article.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLie groups represent the best-developed theory of [[continuous symmetry]] of [[mathematical object]]s and [[mathematical structure|structures]], which makes them indispensable tools for many parts of contemporary mathematics, as well as for modern [[theoretical physics]]. They provide a natural framework for analysing the continuous symmetries of [[differential equations]] ([[differential Galois theory]]), in much the same way as [[permutation groups]] are used in [[Galois theory]] for analysing the discrete symmetries of [[algebraic equations]]. An extension of Galois theory to the case of continuous symmetry groups was one of Lie's principal motivations.\n\n===Combinatorial and geometric group theory===\n{{main|Geometric group theory}}\nGroups can be described in different ways. Finite groups can be described by writing down the [[group table]] consisting of all possible multiplications {{nowrap|''g'' \u2022 ''h''}}. A more compact way of defining a group is by ''generators and relations'', also called the ''presentation'' of a group. Given any set ''F'' of generators <math>\\{g_i\\}_{i\\in I}</math>, the [[free group]] generated by ''F'' surjects onto the group ''G''. The kernel of this map is called the subgroup of relations, generated by some subset ''D''. The presentation is usually denoted by <math>\\langle F \\mid D\\rangle.</math> For example, the group presentation <math>\\langle a,b\\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}\\rangle</math> describes a group which is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}.</math> A string consisting of generator symbols and their inverses is called a ''word''.\n\n[[Combinatorial group theory]] studies groups from the perspective of generators and relations.<ref>{{harvnb|Schupp|Lyndon|2001}}</ref> It is particularly useful where finiteness assumptions are satisfied, for example finitely generated groups, or finitely presented groups (i.e. in addition the relations are finite). The area makes use of the connection of [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s via their [[fundamental group]]s. For example, one can show that every subgroup of a free group is free.\n\nThere are several natural questions arising from giving a group by its presentation. The ''[[word problem for groups|word problem]]'' asks whether two words are effectively the same group element. By relating the problem to [[Turing machine]]s, one can show that there is in general no [[algorithm]] solving this task. Another, generally harder, algorithmically insoluble problem is the [[group isomorphism problem]], which asks whether two groups given by different presentations are actually isomorphic. For example, the group with presentation <math>\\langle x,y \\mid xyxyx = e \\rangle,</math> is isomorphic to the additive group '''Z''' of integers, although this may not be immediately apparent.<ref>Writing <math>z=xy</math>, one has <math>G \\cong \\langle z,y \\mid z^3 = y\\rangle \\cong \\langle z\\rangle.</math></ref>\n\n[[File:Cayley graph of F2.svg|right|150px|thumb|The Cayley graph of &lang; x, y \u2223 &rang;, the free group of rank 2.]]\n[[Geometric group theory]] attacks these problems from a geometric viewpoint, either by viewing groups as geometric objects, or by finding suitable geometric objects a group acts on.<ref>{{harvnb|La Harpe|2000}}</ref> The first idea is made precise by means of the [[Cayley graph]], whose vertices correspond to group elements and edges correspond to right multiplication in the group. Given two elements, one constructs the [[word metric]] given by the length of the minimal path between the elements. A theorem of [[John Milnor|Milnor]] and Svarc then says that given a group ''G'' acting in a reasonable manner on a [[metric space]] ''X'', for example a [[compact manifold]], then ''G'' is [[quasi-isometry|quasi-isometric]] (i.e. looks similar from a distance) to the space ''X''.\n\n==Connection of groups and symmetry==\n{{main|Symmetry group}}\nGiven a structured object ''X'' of any sort, a [[symmetry]] is a mapping of the object onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases, for example\n#If ''X'' is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a [[bijection|bijective]] map from the set to itself, giving rise to [[permutation group]]s.\n#If the object ''X'' is a set of points in the plane with its [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] structure or any other [[metric space]], a symmetry is a [[bijection]] of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an [[isometry]]). The corresponding group is called [[isometry group]] of ''X''.\n#If instead [[angle]]s are preserved, one speaks of [[conformal map]]s. Conformal maps give rise to [[Kleinian group]]s, for example.\n#Symmetries are not restricted to geometrical objects, but include algebraic objects as well.  For instance, the equation <math>x^2-3=0</math> has the two solutions <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> and <math>-\\sqrt{3}</math>. In this case, the group that exchanges the two roots is the [[Galois group]] belonging to the equation.  Every polynomial equation in one variable has a Galois group, that is a certain permutation group on its roots.\n\nThe axioms of a group formalize the essential aspects of [[symmetry]]. Symmetries form a group: they are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] because if you take a symmetry of an object, and then apply another symmetry, the result will still be a symmetry. The identity keeping the object fixed is always a symmetry of an object. Existence of inverses is guaranteed by undoing the symmetry and the associativity comes from the fact that symmetries are functions on a space, and composition of functions are associative.\n\n[[Frucht's theorem]] says that every group is the symmetry group of some [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. So every abstract group is actually the symmetries of some explicit object.\n\nThe saying of \"preserving the structure\" of an object can be made precise by working in a [[category (mathematics)|category]]. Maps preserving the structure are then the [[morphism]]s, and the symmetry group is the [[automorphism group]] of the object in question.\n\n==Applications of group theory==<!--this section is linked at from [[Applications of group theory]]-->\nApplications of group theory abound. Almost all structures in [[abstract algebra]] are special cases of groups. [[Ring (mathematics)|Rings]], for example, can be viewed as [[abelian group]]s (corresponding to addition) together with a second operation (corresponding to multiplication). Therefore, group theoretic arguments underlie large parts of the theory of those entities.\n\n===Galois theory===\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n[[Galois theory]] uses groups to describe the symmetries of the roots of a polynomial (or more precisely the automorphisms of the algebras generated by these roots). The [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] provides a link between [[algebraic field extension]]s and group theory. It gives an effective criterion for the solvability of polynomial equations in terms of the solvability of the corresponding [[Galois group]]. For example, ''S''<sub>5</sub>, the [[symmetric group]] in 5 elements, is not solvable which implies that the general [[quintic equation]] cannot be solved by radicals in the way equations of lower degree can. The theory, being one of the historical roots of group theory, is still fruitfully applied to yield new results in areas such as [[class field theory]].\n\n===Algebraic topology===\n{{main|Algebraic topology}}\n[[Algebraic topology]] is another domain which prominently [[functor|associates]] groups to the objects the theory is interested in. There, groups are used to describe certain invariants of [[topological space]]s. They are called \"invariants\" because they are defined in such a way that they do not change if the space is subjected to some [[homeomorphism|deformation]]. For example, the [[fundamental group]] \"counts\" how many paths in the space are essentially different. The [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], proved in 2002/2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], is a prominent application of this idea. The influence is not unidirectional, though. For example, algebraic topology makes use of [[Eilenberg\u2013MacLane space]]s which are spaces with prescribed [[homotopy groups]]. Similarly [[algebraic K-theory]] relies in a way on [[classifying space]]s of groups. Finally, the name of the [[torsion subgroup]] of an infinite group shows the legacy of topology in group theory.\n\n[[File:Torus.png|thumb|right|200px|A torus. Its abelian group structure is induced from the map {{nowrap|'''C''' \u2192 '''C'''/('''Z''' + ''\u03c4'''''Z''')}}, where ''\u03c4'' is a parameter living in the [[upper half plane]].]]\n\n===Algebraic geometry===\n{{main|Algebraic geometry}}\n[[Algebraic geometry]] likewise uses group theory in many ways. [[Abelian variety|Abelian varieties]] have been introduced above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures.<ref>For example the [[Hodge conjecture]] (in certain cases).</ref> The one-dimensional case, namely [[elliptic curve]]s is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing.<ref>See the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]], one of the [[millennium problem]]s</ref> In another direction, [[toric variety|toric varieties]] are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] acted on by a [[torus]]. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in [[algebraic geometry]], in particular [[resolution of singularities]].<ref>{{Citation | last1=Abramovich | first1=Dan | last2=Karu | first2=Kalle | last3=Matsuki | first3=Kenji | last4=Wlodarczyk | first4=Jaroslaw | title=Torification and factorization of birational maps | mr=1896232  | year=2002 | journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=531\u2013572 | doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-02-00396-X| arxiv=math/9904135 }}</ref>\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n{{main|Algebraic number theory}}\n[[Algebraic number theory]] makes uses of groups for some important applications.

The failure of this statement for [[Dedekind ring|more general rings]] gives rise to [[class group]]s and [[regular prime]]s, which feature in [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer's]] treatment of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]].\n\n===Harmonic analysis===\n{{main|Harmonic analysis}}\nAnalysis on Lie groups and certain other groups is called [[harmonic analysis]]. [[Haar measure]]s, that is, integrals invariant under the translation in a Lie group, are used for [[pattern recognition]] and other [[image processing]] techniques.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Lenz | first1=Reiner | title=Group theoretical methods in image processing | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn=978-0-387-52290-6 | year=1990 | volume=413 | url=https://archive.org/details/grouptheoretical0000lenz | doi=10.1007/3-540-52290-5 | url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Combinatorics===\nIn [[combinatorics]], the notion of [[permutation]] group and the concept of group action are often used to simplify the counting of a set of objects; see in particular [[Burnside's lemma]].\n\n[[File:Fifths.png|right|thumb|150px|The circle of fifths may be endowed with a cyclic group structure]]\n\n===Music===\nThe presence of the 12-[[Periodic group|periodicity]] in the [[circle of fifths]] yields applications of [[elementary group theory]] in [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]]. [[Transformational theory]] models musical transformations as elements of a mathematical group.\n\n===Physics===\nIn [[physics]], groups are important because they describe the symmetries which the laws of physics seem to obey. According to [[Noether's theorem]], every continuous symmetry of a physical system corresponds to a [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] of the system. Physicists are very interested in group representations, especially of Lie groups, since these representations often point the way to the \"possible\" physical theories. Examples of the use of groups in physics include the [[Standard Model]], [[gauge theory]], the [[Lorentz group]], and the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]].\n\n===Chemistry and materials science===\nIn [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]], groups are used to classify [[crystal structure]]s, regular polyhedra, and the [[molecular symmetry|symmetries of molecules]].  The assigned point groups can then be used to determine physical properties (such as [[chemical polarity]] and [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]]), spectroscopic properties (particularly useful for [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[infrared spectroscopy]], circular dichroism spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy, UV/Vis spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy), and to construct [[molecular orbital]]s.\n\nMolecular symmetry is responsible for many physical and spectroscopic properties of compounds and provides relevant information about how chemical reactions occur. In order to assign a point group for any given molecule, it is necessary to find the set of symmetry operations present on it. The symmetry operation is an action, such as a rotation around an axis or a reflection through a mirror plane. In other words, it is an operation that moves the molecule such that it is indistinguishable from the original configuration. In group theory, the rotation axes and mirror planes are called \"symmetry elements\". These elements can be a point, line or plane with respect to which the symmetry operation is carried out. The symmetry operations of a molecule determine the specific point group for this molecule.\n\n[[File:Miri2.jpg|thumb|100px|Water molecule with symmetry axis]]\nIn [[chemistry]], there are five important symmetry operations. They are identity operation ('''E)''', rotation operation or proper rotation('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') , reflection operation('''\u03c3)''', inversion('''i''') and rotation reflection operation or improper rotation ('''S<sub>''n''</sub>'''). The identity operation ('''E''') consists of leaving the molecule as it is. This is equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a [[chiral]] molecule consists of only the identity operation. An identity operation is a characteristic of every molecule even if it has no symmetry. Rotation around an axis ('''C<sub>''n''</sub>''') consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. It is rotation through the 360 degree/n about a rotation axis. For example, if a [[water]] molecule rotates 180\u00b0 around the axis that passes through the [[oxygen]] atom and between the [[hydrogen]] atoms, it is in the same configuration as it started. In this case, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, since applying it twice produces the identity operation.In the reflection operation ('''\u03c3''') the molecule contains a mirror plane. Many molecules have mirror planes, although they may not be obvious to identify. The reflection operation exchanges left and right, as if each point had moved perpendicularly through the plane to a position exactly as far from the plane as when it started.When the plane is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation, it is called '''\u03c3<sub>''h''</sub>'''\u00a0 (horizontal). Other planes, which contain the principal axis of rotation, are labeled '''\u03c3<sub>''v''</sub>''' (vertical or '''\u03c3<sub>''d''</sub>''' (dihedral).  Other symmetry operations are inversion and improper rotation (rotation followed by reflection).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shriver |first1=Duward | last2=Atkins | first2=Peter |date=2009 |title=Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5th |publisher=Freeman, W.H. & Company |isbn=9781429218207 }}</ref>\n\n===Statistical mechanics===\nGroup theory can be used to resolve the incompleteness of the statistical interpretations of mechanics developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Willard Gibbs]], relating to the summing of an infinite number of probabilities to yield a meaningful solution.<ref>[[Norbert Wiener]], Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine,  {{ISBN|978-0262730099}}, Ch 2</ref>\n\n===Cryptography===\n \nVery large groups of prime order constructed in [[elliptic curve cryptography]] serve for [[public-key cryptography]]. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from the flexibility of the geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the [[discrete logarithm]] very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, [[Caesar cipher|Caesar's cipher]], may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. Most cryptographic schemes use groups in some way. In particular Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange uses finite cyclic groups. So the term group-based cryptography refers mostly to cryptographic protocols that use infinite nonabelian groups such as a braid group.\n\n[[File:Caesar3.svg|thumb|left|150px|The [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''<sub>26</sub> underlies [[Caesar's cipher]].]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of group theory}}\nGroup theory has three main historical sources: [[number theory]], the theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, and [[geometry]]. The number-theoretic strand was begun by [[Leonhard Euler]], and developed by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss's]] work on [[modular arithmetic]] and additive and multiplicative groups related to [[quadratic field]]s. Early results about [[permutation group]]s were obtained by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]], [[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]], and [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] in their quest for general solutions of polynomial equations of high degree. [[\u00c9variste Galois]] coined the term \"group\" and established a connection, now known as [[Galois theory]], between the nascent theory of groups and [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]]. In geometry, groups first became important in [[projective geometry]] and, later, [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]] proclaimed group theory to be the organizing principle of geometry.\n\n[[\u00c9variste Galois|Galois]], in the 1830s, was the first to employ groups to determine the solvability of [[polynomial equation]]s. [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] pushed these investigations further by creating the theory of [[permutation groups]]. The second historical source for groups stems from [[geometry|geometrical]] situations. In an attempt to come to grips with possible geometries (such as [[euclidean geometry|euclidean]], [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] or [[projective geometry]]) using group theory, [[Felix Klein]] initiated the [[Erlangen programme]]. [[Sophus Lie]], in 1884, started using groups (now called [[Lie group]]s) attached to [[analysis (mathematics)|analytic]] problems. Thirdly, groups were, at first implicitly and later explicitly, used in [[algebraic number theory]].\n\nThe different scope of these early sources resulted in different notions of groups. The theory of groups was unified starting around 1880. Since then, the impact of group theory has been ever growing, giving rise to the birth of [[abstract algebra]] in the early 20th century, [[representation theory]], and many more influential spin-off domains. The [[classification of finite simple groups]] is a vast body of work from the mid 20th century, classifying all the [[finite set|finite]] [[simple group]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of group theory topics]]\n*[[Examples of groups]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Linear algebraic groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-97370-8 | mr=1102012  | year=1991 | volume=126 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0941-6}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Carter | first1=Nathan C. | title=Visual group theory | url=http://web.bentley.edu/empl/c/ncarter/vgt/ | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | series=Classroom Resource Materials Series | isbn=978-0-88385-757-1 | mr=2504193  | year=2009}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cannon | first1=John J. | title=Computers in group theory: A survey | mr=0290613  | year=1969 | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=12 | pages=3\u201312 | doi=10.1145/362835.362837}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Frucht | first1=R. | title=Herstellung von Graphen mit vorgegebener abstrakter Gruppe | url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | year=1939 | journal=Compositio Mathematica | issn=0010-437X | volume=6 | pages=239\u201350 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201083831/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=CM_1939__6__239_0 | archivedate=2008-12-01 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Golubitsky | first1=Martin| last2=Stewart | first2=Ian | author1-link=Ian Stewart (mathematician)| title =Nonlinear dynamics of networks: the groupoid formalism |mr=2223010  |journal= Bull.
