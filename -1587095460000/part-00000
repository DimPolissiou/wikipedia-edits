Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters who are collectively known as Demons. In the hierarchy of worlds, it is higher than the Human Realm but lower than the Heavenly Realm. Nearly one thousand years ago, the Sage Realm and the Heavenly Realm had a war, which the Sage Realm lost.\n\n'''The''' '''Heavenly Realm''' (kor: \uc2e0\uacc4; hanja: \u795e\u754c,  lit. \"''Divine World''\").

During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters who are collectively known as Demons. In the hierarchy of worlds, it is higher than the Human Realm but lower than the Heavenly Realm. Nearly one thousand years ago, the Sage Realm and the Heavenly Realm had a war, which the Sage Realm lost.\n\n'''The''' '''Heavenly Realm''' (kor: \uc2e0\uacc4; hanja: \u795e\u754c,  lit. \"''Divine World''\").

The federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]], and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Korangi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, Korangi Town was re-organized as part of [[Karachi East]], before it was made part of [[Korangi District]].\n\n== Hospital and Healthcare ==\n* indus

The federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]], and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Korangi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, Korangi Town was re-organized as part of [[Karachi East]], before it was made part of [[Korangi District]].\n\n== Hospital and Healthcare ==\n* indus hospital<ref>https://indushospital.org.pk/</ref>\n* LRBT free tertiary eye hospital korangi <ref>https://www.lrbt.org.pk/lrbt-free-tertiary-eye-hospital-korangi-karachi/</ref>\n* sultan general hospital korangi<ref>http://wikimapia.org/26399248/Sultan-General-Hospital</ref>\n\n== Neighbourhoods of Korangi Town ==\n''Note:'' The town of Korangi should not be confused with [[Korangi]] neighbourhood in neighbouring [[Landhi Town]].\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Bilal Colony]]\n* [[Chakra Goth]]\n* [[Gulzar Colony]]\n* [[Hasrat Mohani Colony]]\n* [[Hundred Quarters]]\n* [[Allahwala Town]]\n* [[Gulshan-e-Mehran]]\n* [[Korangi Sector 33]]\n* [[Mustafa Taj Colony]]\n* [[Nasir Colony]]\n* [[Zaman Town]]\n* [[Bhittai Colony]]\n* [[Qayyumabad]]\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[City District Government Karachi]]\n* [[Korangi Creek Cantonment]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://dmckorangi.gos.pk/ Karachi Website]\n* [http://dmckorangi.gos.pk/ Korangi Town]\n\n{{Karachi Towns}}\n{{Karachi topics}}\n\n{{coord missing|Karachi}}\n\n[[Category:Korangi Town| ]]\n\n\n{{Karachi-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Alishernavoi", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korangi_Town"}

It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.\n\n==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Richard Francis Burton in Africa.jpg|thumb|Richard Francis Burton]]\nSeveral pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.\u00a0 A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L.

Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963).

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.

Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. \n\n=== The Immersion Expeditions ===\nThe multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date\n\n# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/03/14/the-new-hoplology-stick-machete-and-whip-fighting-in-the-caribbean/</ref>\n# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/06/27/stickman-doh-fraid-no-damom-stick-and-machete-fighting-in-the-new-world-part-1/|title=Stickman doh \u2018fraid no damom: Stick and machete fighting in the New world \u2013 Part 1|last=Ryan|first=Michael|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal<ref>https://em3video.com/2020-spring-issue-masters-magazine-frames-video-free-download/</ref>\n# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines \n# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2020/03/11/field-notes-sticks-blades-and-movement-along-the-pacific-rim/</ref>\n\n[[File:Masters Magazine Cover.jpg|thumb|Emergence of the New Hoplology]]\nThe first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]].

It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.\n\n==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Richard Francis Burton in Africa.jpg|thumb|Richard Francis Burton]]\nSeveral pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.\u00a0 A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963).

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006.

Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. \n\n=== The Immersion Expeditions ===\nThe multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date\n\n# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/03/14/the-new-hoplology-stick-machete-and-whip-fighting-in-the-caribbean/</ref>\n# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/06/27/stickman-doh-fraid-no-damom-stick-and-machete-fighting-in-the-new-world-part-1/|title=Stickman doh \u2018fraid no damom: Stick and machete fighting in the New world \u2013 Part 1|last=Ryan|first=Michael|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal<ref>https://em3video.com/2020-spring-issue-masters-magazine-frames-video-free-download/</ref>\n# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines \n# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2020/03/11/field-notes-sticks-blades-and-movement-along-the-pacific-rim/</ref>\n\n[[File:Masters Magazine Cover.jpg|thumb|The Phoenix Rises covers the emergence of the New Hoplology]]\nThe first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]].

Its 2,710 gendarmes protect people and property in rural areas, control roads and communications and contribute to provide assistance to the population in emergencies.\n\n== History ==\nThe Gendarmerie traces its origins to the establishment of the \"''garde indig\u00e8ne''\" (native guards) on 2 February 1915. On 28 June 1925, it became the \"compagnie de milice indig\u00e8ne\", later renamed the \"garde togolaise\". By 1933, it had become the \"service de police urbaine et rurale\". On 17 September 1942 Togolese troops were included in the foundation of the ''[[National Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie de l\u2019Afrique Occidentale Fran\u00e7aise]]'' (AOF), the colonial gendarmerie.\n\nIn 1963, the force was integrated into the armed forces and divided into two forces, the ''Gendarmerie territoriale'', and the ''Gendarmerie mobile''. In August 1965, the two were merged into the ''Gendarmerie nationale togolaise'' and remained in this form until 1995 when it was reorganized, and again in 2008.\n\n== Organisation ==\n[[File:Togo Gendarmerie Dacia 0112A.JPG|180|thumb|Dacia Logan of the Gendarmerie nationale togolaise.|right]]\nThe GNT is divided into central and regional bodies:<ref name=decret200810pr>{{cite web|title=D\u00e9cret 2008-010/PR du 28 janvier 2008 relatif \u00e0 la gendarmerie nationale togolaise|url=http://www.icla.up.ac.za/images/un/use-of-force/africa/Togo/National%20Police%20Act%20Togo%202007.pdf|website=www.icla.up.ac.za|accessdate=8 July 2015|language=French}}</ref>\n* Central bodies (''Organes centraux'') are primarily located in Lom\u00e9.
