It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

Having performed in school bands When in Rome and Joseph Groome Towers, Prowse formed [[Pele (English band)|Pele]] in 1989 along with Dally (drums), Robbo (Hammond), Nico (violin) and Jim McCallister (bass). Signed by [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy]] in March 1991 to Polydor/M&G Records, the band went on to release two studio albums (''Fireworks'' & ''The Sport Of Kings''), one live album and six singles. Pele's singles never reached the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with it being often remarked that Pele sold more of their famous primary colour T-shirts than they did records.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However they scored a number one single in South Africa with \"Megalomania\", and had other hits in Holland, Portugal and Belgium. After nine tours of the UK, including those with [[Del Amitri]] and [[The Pogues]], they split in 1996 due to problems with the record company whose efforts to make Prowse record as a solo artist were resisted by the singer.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\nProwse celebrated the 25th anniversary of first album ''Fireworks'' with a UK tour in the early 2017 with a 25th anniversary of The Sport of Kings tour announced for 2018.\n\n===Amsterdam===\nProwse went on to form [[Amsterdam (band)|Amsterdam]] in 1999 with former [[The Blow Monkeys|Blow Monkeys]] drummer Tony Kiley and cousin Johnny Barlow. It was not until September 2004 that the band managed to secure a record deal in the form of London-based Beat Crazy. They released one album ''The Journey'' in February 2005 and three singles, \"The Journey\" (which hit number 32 in the UK Singles Chart) and \"Does This Train Stop on Merseyside\" also hit the lower reaches of the chart. The partnership was dissolved by mutual consent in 2006.\n \nThe band then signed to The Stranglers management company and released their next album ''Arm in Arm'' on CIA Recordings in 2008.\n\n\"Does This Train Stop on Merseyside\" regularly elicited an emotional response from Radio 1 DJ [[John Peel]]. Peel's widow Sheila Ravenscroft went on the station after the DJ's death and confirmed that 'He was not capable of playing it without crying'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/21/john-peel-train|title=All aboard the John Peel train \u2026|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=21 October 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 June 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The song itself got a further lease of life in 2009 as one of the centre pieces of [[Christy Moore]]'s album ''[[Listen (Christy Moore album)|Listen]]'', which spent five weeks at the top spot in his home country.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nDuring this time, the band struck up a friendship with [[Elvis Costello]] who used them as his backing band on the [[Jonathan Ross]] television show<ref name=\"Jonathan Ross\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/Liverpool%27s_Number_One_Project_brings_Amsterdam_closer_to_Elvis_Costello |title=Liverpool's Number One Project brings Amsterdam closer to Elvis Costello - The Elvis Costello Wiki |publisher=Elviscostello.info |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> as well as support act on several occasions. \nProwse also performed a duet with Costello for EMI Records with a cover of [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]]' 1964 hit \"[[Don't Throw Your Love Away]]\" for the Liverpool Number Ones Project in 2008.

Having performed in school bands When in Rome and Joseph Groome Towers, Prowse formed [[Pele (English band)|Pele]] in 1989 along with Dally (drums), Robbo (Hammond), Nico (violin) and Jim McCallister (bass). Signed by [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy]] in March 1991 to M&G Records/Polydor, the band went on to release two studio albums (''Fireworks'' & ''The Sport Of Kings''), one live album and six singles. Pele's singles never reached the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with it being often remarked that Pele sold more of their famous primary colour T-shirts than they did records.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} However they scored a number one single in South Africa with \"Megalomania\", and had other hits in Holland, Portugal and Belgium. After nine tours of the UK, including those with [[Del Amitri]] and [[The Pogues]], they split in 1996 due to problems with the record company whose efforts to make Prowse record as a solo artist were resisted by the singer.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\nProwse celebrated the 25th anniversary of first album ''Fireworks'' with a UK tour in the early 2017 with a 25th anniversary of The Sport of Kings tour announced for 2018.\n\n===Amsterdam===\nProwse went on to form [[Amsterdam (band)|Amsterdam]] in 1999 with former [[The Blow Monkeys|Blow Monkeys]] drummer Tony Kiley and cousin Johnny Barlow. It was not until September 2004 that the band managed to secure a record deal in the form of London-based Beat Crazy. They released one album ''The Journey'' in February 2005 and three singles, \"The Journey\" (which hit number 32 in the UK Singles Chart) and \"Does This Train Stop on Merseyside\" also hit the lower reaches of the chart. The partnership was dissolved by mutual consent in 2006.\n \nThe band then signed to The Stranglers management company and released their next album ''Arm in Arm'' on CIA Recordings in 2008.\n\n\"Does This Train Stop on Merseyside\" regularly elicited an emotional response from Radio 1 DJ [[John Peel]]. Peel's widow Sheila Ravenscroft went on the station after the DJ's death and confirmed that 'He was not capable of playing it without crying'.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/21/john-peel-train|title=All aboard the John Peel train \u2026|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=21 October 2008|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 June 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The song itself got a further lease of life in 2009 as one of the centre pieces of [[Christy Moore]]'s album ''[[Listen (Christy Moore album)|Listen]]'', which spent five weeks at the top spot in his home country.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nDuring this time, the band struck up a friendship with [[Elvis Costello]] who used them as his backing band on the [[Jonathan Ross]] television show<ref name=\"Jonathan Ross\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elviscostello.info/wiki/index.php/Liverpool%27s_Number_One_Project_brings_Amsterdam_closer_to_Elvis_Costello |title=Liverpool's Number One Project brings Amsterdam closer to Elvis Costello - The Elvis Costello Wiki |publisher=Elviscostello.info |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> as well as support act on several occasions. \nProwse also performed a duet with Costello for EMI Records with a cover of [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]]' 1964 hit \"[[Don't Throw Your Love Away]]\" for the Liverpool Number Ones Project in 2008.

It flows to the east. Ponor runs into Nerskaya on distance of 5&nbsp;km on the northeast from the town of [[Kurovsky (inhabited locality)|Kurovskoye]].\n\nThe country, which the Ponor River runs through, is very boggy and, therefore, difficult for hiking.
