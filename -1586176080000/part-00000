The town was mentioned in written sources dating to 1165 as a seminal parish. The castle was first mentioned in 1148 and the [[market town]] in 1236. The town itself was not surrounded by walls. At the time of the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman raids]], the church with its [[vicarage]] served as a fortified refuge. A second church in the settlement is dedicated to [[Saint Anne]]. It dates to the mid-16th century with a 17th-century [[bell tower|belfry]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] additions.<ref>[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number e\u0161d 3380</ref>\n\nThe main street and the transversal connections above the Dravinja are lined with longitudinal or transversally positioned one-storey houses with well-preserved Gothic cores and Renaissance additions. The fa\u00e7ades were restyled in the 19th century ([[Biedermeier]], [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]]). A rarity is the [[Art Nouveau]] building of the former savings bank. A [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian column]] dating to the mid-18th century and a column shrine dedicated to [[Saint Florian]] above the stream (both designed by the local artist Franc Zamlik in 1750) dominate the open square. The town core is well preserved.\n\nKonjice played a role during the [[Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515]], with rebels here composing a letter with their demands to send to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|the emperor]] in Vienna.<ref>Baraga Jo\u017ee, Motaln Valerija, Konji\u0161ko 860 let (1146\u20132006) Zbornik ob 860-letnici Slovenskih Konjic, Kronologija Konjic</ref> Economic development was boosted after construction of main [[Vienna]] to [[Trieste]] road in the 18th century. During the 19th century the town got a local court. The [[Austrian Southern Railway]] was built in 1846, but it ran {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Konjice.

On 29 June 1921 it was extended to [[Zre\u010de]]. It was closed in 1963, and the tracks were removed in 1970.

The new Town Square (''Mestni trg'') was build on the other bank of the river, connected with Old Square by a bridge with four horse heads on the corners.\n[[File:Gonobitz church.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Saint George's parish church]]\n\nThe dominant structure in the upper part of the town's medieval core is the [[parish church|archparish church]] dedicated to [[Saint George]]<ref name = \"Barron\"/> and belonging to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor]], dating back to the late 13th century with 18th-century additions (a Baroque side chapel).<ref>[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number e\u0161d 2927</ref> The veneration of the saint at this place goes even further back in history. The town was mentioned in written sources dating to 1165 as a seminal parish. The castle was first mentioned in 1148 and the [[market town]] in 1236. The town itself was not surrounded by walls. At the time of the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman raids]], the church with its [[vicarage]] served as a fortified refuge. A second church in the settlement is dedicated to [[Saint Anne]]. It dates to the mid-16th century with a 17th-century [[bell tower|belfry]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] additions.<ref>[http://rkd.situla.org/ Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage] reference number e\u0161d 3380</ref>\n\nThe main street and the transversal connections above the Dravinja are lined with longitudinal or transversally positioned one-storey houses with well-preserved Gothic cores and Renaissance additions. The fa\u00e7ades were restyled in the 19th century ([[Biedermeier]], [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]]). A rarity is the [[Art Nouveau]] building of the former savings bank. A [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian column]] dating to the mid-18th century and a column shrine dedicated to [[Saint Florian]] above the stream (both designed by the local artist Franc Zamlik in 1750) dominate the open square. The town core is well preserved.\n\nKonjice played a role during the [[Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515]], with rebels here composing a letter with their demands to send to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|the emperor]] in Vienna.<ref>Baraga Jo\u017ee, Motaln Valerija, Konji\u0161ko 860 let (1146\u20132006) Zbornik ob 860-letnici Slovenskih Konjic, Kronologija Konjic</ref> Economic development was boosted after construction of main [[Vienna]] to [[Trieste]] road in the 18th century. During the 19th century the town got a local court. The [[Austrian Southern Railway]] was built in 1846, but it ran {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Konjice. On 20 June 1892 works started on a [[narrow gauge]] (760&nbsp;mm) [[steam railroad]] line called ''Konji\u010danka'' from [[Polj\u010dane]] to Slovenske Konjice, which was opened on 20 December 1892. On 29 June 1921 it was extended to [[Zre\u010de]]. It was closed in 1963, and the tracks were removed in 1970. A Museum locomotive K.3 (Gonobitz), build by Krauss factory at [[Linz]], used on this line, is on display at the [[Slovenian Railway Museum]] in [[Ljubljana]].\n{{stack|[[File:Konjice_-_Stari_trg1.JPG|left|thumb|[[Old Square]]]]}}\n\n===Name===\nOver the centuries, the name ''Konjice'' appears in written documents in various forms: ''Gonviz'' (1251), ''Gombicz'' (1370), ''Gannabitz'' (1570), ''Gonaviz'' (1594), ''Gonavitz'' (1630), ''Gonwitz'' (1636), ''Gonowitz'' (1662), ''Ganowiz'' (1680), ''Gonnawitz'' (1680), and modern German ''Gonobitz''.

In 1995, the Mk1 Trafic got its final facelift, with new grille, new tail lights, large double rear view mirrors, and a new interior with modern dashboard and multi adjustable seats.\n\nThis version was also sold as the '''Opel Arena''' from 1997.\n\n===Winnebago===\nThe chassis and cab of the 1980s models were used as the base vehicle by [[Winnebago Industries]] to build the Winnebago '[[Winnebago LeSharo|LeSharo]]' from 1983,<ref>{{cite web|title=Curbside Classic: 1985 Winnebago|url=http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2010/05/curbside-classic-1985-winnebago-23mpg-lesharo-turbo-diesel-rv/|work=Truth about cars|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> and Itasca Phasar. \n\nFor the chassis and cab version to meet safety and emission requirements in the United States, this version was sold with Renault's J7T: 2165&nbsp;cc, (2.2 litre) and 2.1 litre diesel and turbo diesel engines, coded as J8S and shared with the 1985 to 1987 AMC/Jeep Cherokee/Commanche. \n\nNote: Jeep versions used the Garrett T2 turbo and Winnebago's, the larger T3. C.A.R.B. granted a series of yearly waivers to Winnebago for the non compliance of fitting On Board Diagnostics (OBD I), and remained in effect throughout the model run from 1983 to 1992.\n\n===Campervan Variants===\nThe Mk1 Trafic became popular for professional conversion into budget family motorhomes due to the flexibility of the design and the generous internal space for what was a relatively small van. Popular converters were Auto-Sleepers and Holdsworth (now defunct). Other motorhome builders using the Trafic Mk1 as a base include Hymer, Elddis, Eriba, and Autostar.\n\n===Opel Arena===\n{{For|the stadium|Opel Arena (stadium)}}\nFrom 1997 to 2000, the Renault Trafic was marketed as the Chevrolet Trafic and Opel Arena (Vauxhall Arena in the United Kingdom).<ref>{{cite web|title=Opel History|url=http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/download/pdf/history/opel_historie_all_pics.pdf|publisher=General Motors|accessdate=24 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227141155/http://media.gm.com/intl/opel/en/download/pdf/history/opel_historie_all_pics.pdf|date=1 December 2006|archivedate=27 February 2007 |quote=1997: With the Arena, Opel reenters the commercial vehicle market segment.}}</ref>\n\n===Tata Winger===\n{{main|Tata Winger}}\nIn June 2007, [[Tata Motors]] announced the introduction of the [[Tata Winger|Winger]], a panel van and minibus based on the 1995 to 2001 version of the Renault Trafic, but fitted with Tata's own two litre diesel engines, with or without turbo.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tata Motors says holding margins a challenge |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/06/18/idUKBOM23581620070618 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=18 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\nFor South America, the vehicle was made in the Argentinian facility at Santa Isabel, C\u00f3rdoba, for the Mercosur.
