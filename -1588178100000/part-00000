Washington took office after the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1788\u201389 presidential election]], the nation's first quadrennial presidential election, in which he was [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|elected unanimously]]. Washington was re-elected unanimously in the [[1792 United States presidential election|1792 presidential election]], and chose to retire after two terms. He was succeeded by his vice president, [[John Adams]] of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\nWashington had established his preeminence among the new nation's [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] through his service as [[Commander-in-Chief#United States|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and as President of the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. Once the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was approved, it was widely expected that Washington would become the first president of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public life. In his first [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], Washington expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, but he proved an able [[leadership|leader]].\n\nWashington presided over the establishment of the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], appointing all of the high-ranking officials in the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive]] and [[Federal judiciary of the United States|judicial]] branches, shaping numerous political practices, and establishing the site of the permanent capital of the United States. He supported [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s economic policies whereby the federal government [[Funding Act of 1790|assumed the debts]] of the state governments and established the [[First Bank of the United States]], the [[United States Mint]], and the [[United States Customs Service]]. Congress passed the [[Tariff of 1789]], the Tariff of 1790, and an [[excise tax]] on whiskey to fund the government and, in the case of the tariffs, address the trade imbalance with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. Washington personally led federal soldiers in suppressing the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], which arose in opposition to the administration's taxation policies. He directed the [[Northwest Indian War]], which saw the United States establish control over [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the [[Northwest Territory]]. In foreign affairs, he assured domestic tranquility and maintained peace with the European powers despite the raging [[French Revolutionary Wars]] by issuing the 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. He also secured two important bilateral treaties, the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]] with Great Britain and the 1795 [[Pinckney's Treaty|Treaty of San Lorenzo]] with Spain, both of which fostered trade and helped secure control of the [[American frontier]]. To protect American shipping from [[Barbary pirates]] and other threats, he re-established the [[United States Navy]] with the [[Naval Act of 1794]].\n\nGreatly concerned about the growing partisanship within the government and the detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity of the nation, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. President never to be affiliated with a political party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/washingtons-farewell-address-warned-us-about-hyper-partisanship-214616|title=George Washington's Farewell Warning|last=|first=|date=|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=March 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114212921/https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/washingtons-farewell-address-warned-us-about-hyper-partisanship-214616|archive-date=November 14, 2017|url-status= }}</ref> In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] and formed the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians as one of [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|the greatest presidents in American history]], usually ranking in the top three with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\n==Election of 1788\u20131789==\n{{Main|1788\u201389 United States presidential election}}\n\nFollowing the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, a fatigued Washington returned to his estate in Virginia, [[Mount Vernon]].

Because direct taxes were politically unfeasible, Congress turned to the tariff as the main source of funding.

Each region sought favorable terms for the duties on various goods.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 37\u201341</ref> Because the federal government would be unable to even pay the salaries of its officials without passage of the bill, members of Congress were strongly motivated to reach a compromise. In July, Congress finally passed the [[Tariff of 1789]], which Washington signed into law. The act created a uniform impost on goods carried by foreign ships, while also establishing a much smaller tax on goods carried by American-owned ships.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 100\u2013102</ref> The tariffs established by this and later acts would make up the vast majority of government revenue; more than 87 percent of the federal government's revenue between 1789 and 1800 came from import duties.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, p. 108</ref>\n\nTo enable the federal government to collect the import duties, Congress also passed the Collection Act of 1789, which established the [[United States Customs Service]] and designated [[ports of entry]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 102\u2013103</ref> One year later, the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue-Marine]] was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|ten cutters]] to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling.

In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1960}}, p. 39</ref> In his [[First Report on the Public Credit|Report on the Public Credit]], Hamilton estimated that the state and federal governments had a combined debt of $79&nbsp;million; he projected that the federal government's annual income would be $2.8&nbsp;million. Drawing on the ideas of Robert Morris and others, Hamilton proposed the most ambitious and far-reaching economic plan that had ever been advanced by an American, calling for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal [[bond (finance)|bonds]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 183\u2013187</ref> Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure a stable and adequate money stock, and make it easier for the federal government to borrow during emergencies such as wars.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> He also proposed redeeming the [[promissory note]]s issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value, thereby establishing the precedent that the government would uphold the value of its [[Security (finance)|securities]].

For the British, America remained neutral and economically grew closer to Britain. The Americans also guaranteed favorable treatment to British imports. In return, the British agreed to evacuate the western forts, which they had been supposed to do by 1783. They also agreed to open their West Indies ports to smaller American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies, and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships, and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. As the treaty contained neither concessions on impressment nor statement of rights for American sailors, another commission was later established to settle both those and boundary issues.<ref>Thomas A.

Washington then traveled to Boston, where a large crowd greeted him. From Boston, Washington traveled north, stopping in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. About a week after arriving in Boston, he traveled north to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and circled back to New York, stopping in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].

After sailing through a large storm, they arrived in Annapolis. From Annapolis they traveled to Mount Vernon, and from there to [[Colchester, Virginia]], to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. After leaving Richmond, they went to [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], than [[Emporia, Virginia]]. They left Virginia and went to [[Craven County, North Carolina]], then [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]].

Washington took office after the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1788\u201389 presidential election]], the nation's first quadrennial presidential election, in which he was [[List of United States presidential elections by Electoral College margin|elected unanimously]]. Washington was re-elected unanimously in the [[1792 United States presidential election|1792 presidential election]], and chose to retire after two terms. He was succeeded by his vice president, [[John Adams]] of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\nWashington had established his preeminence among the new nation's [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] through his service as [[Commander-in-Chief#United States|Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and as President of the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. Once the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was approved, it was widely expected that Washington would become the first president of the United States, despite his own desire to retire from public life. In his first [[Inauguration|inaugural address]], Washington expressed both his reluctance to accept the presidency and his inexperience with the duties of civil administration, but he proved an able [[leadership|leader]].\n\nWashington presided over the establishment of the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], appointing all of the high-ranking officials in the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive]] and [[Federal judiciary of the United States|judicial]] branches, shaping numerous political practices, and establishing the site of the permanent capital of the United States. He supported [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s economic policies whereby the federal government [[Funding Act of 1790|assumed the debts]] of the state governments and established the [[First Bank of the United States]], the [[United States Mint]], and the [[United States Customs Service]]. Congress passed the [[Tariff of 1789]], the Tariff of 1790, and an [[excise tax]] on whiskey to fund the government and, in the case of the tariffs, address the trade imbalance with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. Washington personally led federal soldiers in suppressing the [[Whiskey Rebellion]], which arose in opposition to the administration's taxation policies. He directed the [[Northwest Indian War]], which saw the United States establish control over [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the [[Northwest Territory]]. In foreign affairs, he assured domestic tranquility and maintained peace with the European powers despite the raging [[French Revolutionary Wars]] by issuing the 1793 [[Proclamation of Neutrality]]. He also secured two important bilateral treaties, the 1794 [[Jay Treaty]] with Great Britain and the 1795 [[Pinckney's Treaty|Treaty of San Lorenzo]] with Spain, both of which fostered trade and helped secure control of the [[American frontier]]. To protect American shipping from [[Barbary pirates]] and other threats, he re-established the [[United States Navy]] with the [[Naval Act of 1794]].\n\nGreatly concerned about the growing partisanship within the government and the detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity of the nation, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. President never to be affiliated with a political party.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/washingtons-farewell-address-warned-us-about-hyper-partisanship-214616|title=George Washington's Farewell Warning|last=|first=|date=|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=March 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114212921/https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/washingtons-farewell-address-warned-us-about-hyper-partisanship-214616|archive-date=November 14, 2017|url-status= }}</ref> In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]] and formed the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians as one of [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|the greatest presidents in American history]], usually ranking in the top three with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\n==Election of 1788\u20131789==\n{{Main|1788\u201389 United States presidential election}}\n\nFollowing the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, a fatigued Washington returned to his estate in Virginia, [[Mount Vernon]].

Because direct taxes were politically unfeasible, Congress turned to the tariff as the main source of funding. The tariffs could also [[Protective tariff|protect]] nascent American manufacturing by increasing the cost of imported goods, many of which came from Britain. Each region sought favorable terms for the duties on various goods.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 37\u201341</ref> Because the federal government would be unable to even pay the salaries of its officials without passage of the bill, members of Congress were strongly motivated to reach a compromise. In July, Congress finally passed the [[Tariff of 1789]], which Washington signed into law. The act created a uniform impost on goods carried by foreign ships, while also establishing a much smaller tax on goods carried by American-owned ships.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 100\u2013102</ref> The tariffs established by this and later acts would make up the vast majority of government revenue; more than 87 percent of the federal government's revenue between 1789 and 1800 came from import duties.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, p. 108</ref>\n\nTo enable the federal government to collect the import duties, Congress also passed the Collection Act of 1789, which established the [[United States Customs Service]] and designated [[ports of entry]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 102\u2013103</ref> One year later, the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue-Marine]] was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|ten cutters]] to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy Department]] in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the [[United States Life-Saving Service|U.S. Life-Saving Service]] were merged in 1915 to form the [[United States Coast Guard]].<ref>{{Include-USGov|agency= United States Coast Guard|article= U.S. Coast Guard History|url= https://www.uscg.mil/history/web/USCGbriefhistory.asp|accessdate=July 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Ref-1\">{{harvnb|Bailey|Kennedy|Cohen|2006}} pp. 193\u2013195</ref>\n\n===Hamiltonian economic program===\n\nAfter the passage of the Tariff of 1789, various other plans were considered to address the debt issues during the first session of Congress, but none were able to generate widespread support. In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit.<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1960}}, p. 39</ref> In his [[First Report on the Public Credit|Report on the Public Credit]], Hamilton estimated that the state and federal governments had a combined debt of $79 million; he projected that the federal government's annual income would be $2.8 million. Drawing on the ideas of Robert Morris and others, Hamilton proposed the most ambitious and far-reaching economic plan that had ever been advanced by an American, calling for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal [[bond (finance)|bonds]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 183\u2013187</ref> Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure a stable and adequate money stock, and make it easier for the federal government to borrow during emergencies such as wars.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> He also proposed redeeming the [[promissory note]]s issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value, thereby establishing the precedent that the government would uphold the value of its [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Hamilton's proposal drew opposition from Madison, who was reluctant to reward the [[speculation|speculators]] who had bought up many of the promissory notes at a fraction of their value after the Revolutionary War.<ref>{{harvnb|Chernow|2010}}, pp. 620\u2013622</ref>\n\nCongressional delegations from Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens would effectively pay a portion of the debt of other states if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval.<ref name =\"Ellis-p48\">{{Harvnb|Ellis|2000|pp=48\u201352}}</ref> Others contended that the debts should be repudiated, and the United States should refuse to pay them.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonald|1974}} p.54</ref> Washington supported Hamilton's plan but refused to become involved in the congressional debate, and opposition mounted in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 209\u2013212</ref> The debate over assumption became entangled with the simultaneous debate over the site of the nation's capital. In the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790, as several southern congressmen voted for the bill in exchange for a capital located on the Potomac River.<ref>{{harvnb|Bordewich|2016}}, pp. 244\u2013252</ref>\n\nLater in 1790, Hamilton issued another set of recommendations in his [[Second Report on Public Credit]]. The report called for the establishment of a [[History of central banking in the United States|national bank]] and an [[excise tax]] on [[distilled spirit]]s. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the [[Bank Bill of 1791]], establishing the [[First Bank of the United States]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ferling|2009}}, pp. 293\u2013298</ref> Madison and Attorney General Randolph lobbied Washington to veto the bill as unconstitutional extension of the federal government's authority.

Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the [[Execution of Louis XVI]], some of Hamilton's followers began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent.

He also asked Jay, if possible, to seek limited access for American ships to the [[British West Indies]].<ref name=JayPapers/> Jay and the British [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]], began negotiations on July 30, 1794. The treaty that emerged several weeks later, commonly known as the [[Jay Treaty]], was, in Jay's words \"equal and fair.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Combs|1970}}, p. 158</ref>  Both sides achieved many objectives; several issues were sent to arbitration. For the British, America remained neutral and economically grew closer to Britain. The Americans also guaranteed favorable treatment to British imports. In return, the British agreed to evacuate the western forts, which they had been supposed to do by 1783. They also agreed to open their West Indies ports to smaller American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies, and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships, and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. As the treaty contained neither concessions on impressment nor statement of rights for American sailors, another commission was later established to settle both those and boundary issues.<ref>Thomas A.

Washington then traveled to Boston, where a large crowd greeted him. From Boston, Washington traveled north, stopping in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]] and [[Salem, Massachusetts]]. About a week after arriving in Boston, he traveled north to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and circled back to New York, stopping in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]].

After sailing through a large storm, they arrived in Annapolis. From Annapolis they traveled to Mount Vernon, and from there to [[Colchester, Virginia]], to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. After leaving Richmond, they went to [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], than [[Emporia, Virginia]]. They left Virginia and went to [[Craven County, North Carolina]], then [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]].
