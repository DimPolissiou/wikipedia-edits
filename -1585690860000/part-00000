When their eastern neighbors, the [[Donghu people|Donghu]], expressed desire to occupy uninhabited land that lay between them, Modu reacted by attacking them. By 208 BCE, the Donghu had been defeated and their remnants split into the [[Xianbei]] and [[Wuhuan]] tribes. Modun went on to subdue the [[Dingling]] and other peoples to the north, and defeat the [[Yuezhi]] in 203 BCE. After these conquests, all Xiongnu lords submitted to him.<ref name=\"Cosmo\" />\n\nWith these victories, he was able to gain control of the important trade routes, which later supplied the Xiongnu with a large income. \n\n{{Main|Battle of Baideng}}\n\nIn 200 BCE, [[Xin, King of Han]], surrendered to the Xiongnu at Mayi, [[Shuofang]], [[Dai Commandery]], and joined them in raiding Han territory. [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]] led an army against them and scattered their forces, defeating them several times before they retreated. Later Xin set up [[Zhao Li]] as King of Zhao and marched south against Gaozu. They too were defeated. Seeing the influence the Xiongnu had on his vassals, Gaozu marched north with a 320,000 strong army to confront them. However his men suffered from inadequate clothing to ward off the cold and a lack of supplies, so Gaozu left them behind and advanced to [[Pingcheng District|Pingcheng]] with only 40,000 men. Modu Chanyu saw his chance to turn the tide and immediately surrounded the city 300,000 cavalry, cutting the emperor off from the rest of his army. It's not clear why, but the Chanyu eventually withdrew some of his men. [[Sima Qian]] suggests his consort persuaded him to let the emperor escape. However a prolonged siege would have been impractical anyway since Xin's infantry never made it on time. Seeing the Chanyu's thinned lines, Gaozu sortied out and broke the siege. When Han reinforcements arrived, the Xiongnu withdrew. This came to be known as the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Gaozu's narrow escape from capture by the Xiongnu convinced him to make peace with his nomadic enemy. He sent one of his daughters to the Chanyu (''[[heqin]]'' marriage alliance) and offered him silk, wine, and food stuffs.

The reason for that is a striking similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the [[Turco-Persian tradition]] ([[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]], [[Husayni Isfahani]], [[Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur]]) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by [[Hyacinth (Bichurin)|Hyacinth]] (Compilation of reports, pp.&nbsp;56\u201357).<ref>Bichurin N.Ya., ''\"Compilation of reports on peoples inhabiting Central Asia in ancient times\"'', vol. 1, Sankt Petersburg, 1851,  pp. 56\u201357</ref><ref>Taskin V.S., ''\"Materials on history of S\u00fcnnu\"'', transl., 1968, Vol. 1, p. 129</ref>\n\nAnother suggestion connects it with the name of the ''Magyar'' royal tribe of the [[Hungarians]] and with their distant relatives the [[Mator language|Mators]], now extinct.<ref>[[Eugene Helimski|E.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to Ku. Ku is born with a damaged wing, rendering her unable to fly before Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking themselves to Niwen, where a storm causes Ori and Ku to be separated. \n\nOri's search for Ku eventually leads them to Kwolok, a toad who looked over the Inkwater Marsh who asks Ori to set The Wellspring's wheels in motion, clearing Niwen's water and allowing Ori to enter the Silent Woods, the graveyard of owls where Ku had fallen. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]], desperate to rejoin with them. Ori clears the water and finds Ku with them having a brief encounter with Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan on birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Ori and Ku attempt to escape the Silent Woods and Shriek, but she intervenes and kills Ku.\n\nAfter Ori mourns over Ku, Kwolok explains to them the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered all across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed all of the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori to seek out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. During Ori's journey to complete this task, they run into Kwolok again, being controlled by a hostile creature Ori previously encountered in The Wellspring. Ori breaks its control over Kwolok, allowing Kwolok to kill the creature, but with its control having taken its toll, Kwolok dies shortly after. In Kwolok's final moments, he pleads for Ori to watch over Niwen, stating Ori may be the only one who can.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow, but are ambushed by Shriek along the way; Seir attacks Shriek to defend it and Ori, but a sympathetic Ori stops Seir from attacking her any further. Shriek however, rejects Ori's kindness and flies away, while Naru and Gumo arrive at Niwen at roughly the same time. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree states to Ori it can no longer carry Seir and asks them to merge with Seir to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. Before Seir can return to Ori, Shriek reappears and snatches Seir. After a hard battle, Ori defeats Shriek, who, still unwilling to accept change, returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her decayed parents. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, restoring Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. The three work together to allow the tree to flourish while the Spirit Tree, narrating, reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the Spirit Tree completely grew and life began anew. The game ends with the cycle beginning again, as a new spirit guardian falls from the tree.\n\n== Development and release ==\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = \"A lot of people completed ''Blind Forest'' in roughly eight hours, and thought that it was a positive experience,\" explains Daniel Smith, senior producer at Xbox Games Studios, who has been attached to the Ori projects since before the first title launched.\n\n\"But our community told us that there wasn't a lot of draw to come back in once they'd completed the title.

He described the game as \"A hallmark of excellence\", saying that \"There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage\". Carter particularly praised the game's visuals, combat improvements from the game's predecessor, as well as the \"dramatic chase sequences\". However, he mentioned some [[frame rate]] issues regarding the Xbox One version of the game.<ref name=\"Carter\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''{{'}}s Michael Goroff stated positive opinions regarding the game, while pointing out the performance issues which the [[Xbox One]] edition of the game suffered from before the day-one [[patch (computing)|patch]] was released. Goroff further mentioned that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' does everything that a good sequel is supposed to do. It refines ''The Blind Forest''{{'}}s mechanics, expands on the world, and throws in a whole bunch of new moves and concepts. But in an era that's rich with 'emotional platformers', ''Will of the Wisps'' doesn't do anything to make itself stand out. It's a fine, if not forgettable, experience\".<ref name=\"EGMreview\"/> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner praised the game's graphics, story and combat, subsequently calling the game better than its predecessor. Reiner said that \"The story is fantastic, the world is breathtaking, and all of that pales in comparison to the wonderfully made gameplay that soars both as a platforming and combat game. Moon Studios has outdone itself with ''Will of the Wisps'', delivering an experience that doesn't have any lulls, makes the player feel clever, and just keeps getting better as it goes.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer\"/> ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s critic Steve Watts gave the game a positive review, commending the combat, exploring elements, story as well as the \"Gorgeous animation and environments\". Moreover, he highlighted occasional visual bugs as negative aspects of the game.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> \n\nAustin Wood, reviewer for ''[[GamesRadar+]]'', acclaimed the game and its \"breathtaking music\", world and its platforming. Wood stated that \"There are a few minor stumbles here and there, but make no mistake: I ''adore'' ''Ori and The Will of the Wisps''. It's one of the best platformers ever made, and it's an easy front-runner for game of the year. If you liked the first game, you will love this one. And if you haven't experienced Ori's story, you owe it to yourself to dive in now, especially with both games now on Xbox Game Pass. I'll be replaying this game, listening to its soundtrack, and reminiscing over its characters for years to come.\" However, Wood acknowledged some negatives regarding a few of the game's abilities and called the final level \"slightly underwhelming\".<ref name=\"GRadarreview\"/> Brandin Tyrrel of ''[[IGN]]'' also praised the game, saying that \"''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an excellent return to this bright and beautiful open-world platformer, with an affecting story to bolster the white-knuckle challenge.\" Tyrrell further complimented the game for staying true to the original, while at the same time adding more content than its predecessor.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s critic Tyler Wilde gave the game a favorable review, praising the platforming, boss fights and the visuals. Wilde mentioned some criticism regarding the fighting though, saying that \"it's not much fun\".<ref name=\"PCG review\"/> Writing for ''VideoGamer'', Josh Wise acclaimed the game for its graphics, music and platforming, stating that \"In the beauty stakes and beyond, there are very few, in the rarefied realms of indie or AAA, who can challenge it\". However, Wise pointed out some negatives towards the game's plot, calling it \"thin\".<ref name=\"VGreview\"/> Tola Onanuga of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game, saying that \"More than anything else, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisps'' is an intoxicating feast for the senses. From its hauntingly beautiful visuals to its ambient, responsive music, there is so much to love about the look and feel of this long-awaited sequel.\" Onanuga acknowledged some less positive aspects of the game, calling the story \"melancholy at times\" and stating that fighting \"the more common enemies can feel a little tedious after a while\". She ended her review in a positive manner, saying that \"Peppered with devious puzzles, ''Ori and the Will of the Wisp'' is an irresistible challenge.

Kuro's last egg hatches, giving birth to Ku. Ku is born with a damaged wing, rendering her unable to fly before Gumo affixes Kuro's feather to her wing. Ku and Ori go off on a flight, eventually taking themselves to Niwen, where a storm causes Ori and Ku to be separated. \n\nOri's search for Ku eventually leads them to Kwolok, a toad who looked over the Inkwater Marsh who asks Ori to set The Wellspring's wheels in motion, clearing Niwen's water and allowing Ori to enter the Silent Woods, the graveyard of owls where Ku had fallen. Kwolok also gives Ori a wisp, the Voice of the Forest, to guide them on their journey. At the same time that Ori enters The Wellspring, Naru and Gumo, realizing where Ori and Ku are, head off to Niwen via a [[raft]], desperate to rejoin with them. Ori clears the water and finds Ku with them having a brief encounter with Shriek, a deformed owl who was an orphan on birth and rejected by the rest of her kind. Ori and Ku attempt to escape the Silent Woods and Shriek, but she intervenes and kills Ku.\n\nAfter Ori mourns over Ku, Kwolok explains to them the Voice of the Forest is not at full power and as such, is unable to help Ku in its current state. Due to the Spirit Willow's passing, the light it carried was shattered into five wisps that scattered all across Niwen, leaving the forest vulnerable to corruption and decay that killed all of the Willow's guardian spirits and Shriek's parents before her birth. Kwolok tasks Ori to seek out the other four wisps of the Spirit Willow's light: the Memory, Eyes, Strength and Heart of the Forest, and merge them with the Voice to reform the tree's light. During Ori's journey to complete this task, they run into Kwolok again, being controlled by a hostile creature Ori previously encountered in The Wellspring. Ori breaks its control over Kwolok, allowing Kwolok to kill the creature, but with its control having taken its toll, Kwolok dies shortly after. In Kwolok's final moments, he pleads for Ori to watch over Niwen, stating Ori may be the only one who can.\n\nOri eventually finds all five wisps and merges them together to reform Seir, the Golden Light. Ori and Seir head to the Spirit Willow, but are ambushed by Shriek along the way; Seir attacks Shriek to defend it and Ori, but a sympathetic Ori stops Seir from attacking her any further. Shriek however, rejects Ori's kindness and flies away, while Naru and Gumo arrive at Niwen at roughly the same time. Upon arriving at the Spirit Willow, Seir revives it. However, the tree states to Ori it can no longer carry Seir and asks them to merge with Seir to restore Niwen, though Ori would have to leave their previous life behind. Before Seir can return to Ori, Shriek reappears and snatches Seir. After a hard battle, Ori defeats Shriek, who, still unwilling to accept change, returns to the Silent Woods and dies in the wings of her decayed parents. \n\nMeanwhile, Ori limps their way to Seir and merges with it, restoring Niwen and reviving Ku with her damaged wing restored in the process, which Naru and Gumo arrive in time to witness. Ku, Naru and Gumo find where Ori and Seir merged, and they discover a Spirit Tree beginning to grow there. The three work together to allow the tree to flourish while the Spirit Tree, narrating, reveals that it was Ori all along, retelling the events leading up to when it merged with Seir. Eventually, the Spirit Tree completely grew and life began anew.

As a result, arranged marriage was the dominant form of marriage. Those couples who could not obtain permission had to elope and stay in [[common-law marriage]].\n\nThe purpose of Article 24 of the new Constitution was to assert freedom of consenting adults to marry, and to explicitly establish the equality of both sexes in marriage. The wording defined marriage as a union of husband and wife. Some legal scholars argue that because the intent behind the article was not in reference to same-sex marriage, it need not apply in legalising same-sex marriage. However, conservative lawmakers as well as legal scholars who take a literal approach to constitutional interpretation argue that such an argument is a stretch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201502190062|title=Abe: Gay marriage not an option under the Constitution|work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=30 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150219182028/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201502190062|archivedate=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, the [[National Diet]] debated whether same-sex marriage should be recognized under Japan's Constitution.<ref name=\"Diet\">{{cite web|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002968253 |title=Amending the Constitution / Unanticipated situation: same-sex marriage |publisher=The Japan News |date=30 May 2016}}</ref> [[Kota Matsuda]], a member of the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]], said:\n{{quote|We need to eliminate lifestyle difficulties for same-sex couples.

Koseki registration performs a somewhat similar role to marriage in the West as it endows a member of the same koseki legal power (as next of kin) in dealing with civil matters such as inheritance, hospital visits or the right to organise a funeral. Therefore, registering each other as a part of the koseki works as a substitute for Western-style marriage. As a consequence, Japanese gay couples, in the absence of same-sex marriage or civil partnership laws, often use [[Japanese adult adoption|adoption procedures]] to register themselves as belonging to the same household (where the older partner legally adopts the younger partner, which in absence of a spouse makes the only adopted child the sole executor of that household).\n\n==Public opinion==\nA May 2013 Ipsos poll found that out of over a thousand Japanese adult interviewees, 24% of respondents were in favor of same-sex marriage and another 27% supported other forms of recognition for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=12795|title=Same-Sex Marriage|date=7\u201321 May 2013|publisher=Ipsos|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314051755/http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=12795|archivedate=14 March 2016}}</ref> An April 2014 Ipsos poll found that 26% of respondents were in favor of same-sex marriage and that 24% were in favor of some other form of recognition for couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=13813|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Respondents in 15 Countries Assess Their Views on Same-Sex Marriage|date=June 2014|publisher=Ipsos|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106020526/http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=13813|archivedate=2015-01-06}}</ref> A May 2015 Ipsos poll found 30% of respondents in favour of same-sex marriage and a further 28% in favour of some other form of recognition (meaning that 58% supported recognising same-sex couples in some form).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/nine-facts-we-learned-about-same-sex-marriage-support-poll#.mdE1QlGOk |title=This Is How Many People Support Same-Sex Marriage In 23 Countries Around The World - BuzzFeed News |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a survey by Nihon Yoron Ch\u014dsa-ka, conducted on 1 and 2 March 2014, 42.3% of Japanese supported same-sex marriage, while 52.4% opposed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/18/national/52-4-of-japanese-say-they-oppose-same-sex-marriage/|title=52.4% of Japanese say they oppose same-sex marriage|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> Another poll conducted by FNN in April 2015 showed that 59% supported the same-sex partnership certificate law proposed in Shibuya and 53% supported same-sex marriage.

As a result, arranged marriage was the dominant form of marriage. Those couples who could not obtain permission had to elope and stay in [[common-law marriage]].\n\nThe purpose of Article 24 of the new Constitution was to assert freedom of consenting adults to marry, and to explicitly establish the equality of both sexes in marriage. The wording defined marriage as a union of husband and wife. Some legal scholars argue that because the intent behind the article was not in reference to same-sex marriage, it need not apply in legalising same-sex marriage. However, conservative lawmakers as well as legal scholars who take a literal approach to constitutional interpretation argue that such an argument is a stretch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201502190062|title=Abe: Gay marriage not an option under the Constitution|work=AJW by The Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=30 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150219182028/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/politics/AJ201502190062|archivedate=19 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2015, the [[National Diet]] debated whether same-sex marriage should be recognized under Japan's Constitution.<ref name=\"Diet\">{{cite web|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0002968253 |title=Amending the Constitution / Unanticipated situation: same-sex marriage |publisher=The Japan News |date=30 May 2016}}</ref> [[Kota Matsuda]], a member of the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]], said:\n{{quote|We need to eliminate lifestyle difficulties for same-sex couples.

Koseki registration performs a somewhat similar role to marriage in the West as it endows a member of the same koseki legal power (as next of kin) in dealing with civil matters such as inheritance, hospital visits or the right to organise a funeral. Therefore, registering each other as a part of the koseki works as a substitute for Western-style marriage. As a consequence, Japanese gay couples, in the absence of same-sex marriage or civil partnership laws, often use [[Japanese adult adoption|adoption procedures]] to register themselves as belonging to the same household (where the older partner legally adopts the younger partner, which in absence of a spouse makes the only adopted child the sole executor of that household).\n\n==Public opinion==\nA May 2013 Ipsos poll found that out of over a thousand Japanese adult interviewees, 24% of respondents were in favor of same-sex marriage and another 27% supported other forms of recognition for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=12795|title=Same-Sex Marriage|date=7\u201321 May 2013|publisher=Ipsos|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314051755/http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=12795|archivedate=14 March 2016}}</ref> An April 2014 Ipsos poll found that 26% of respondents were in favor of same-sex marriage and that 24% were in favor of some other form of recognition for couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=13813|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Respondents in 15 Countries Assess Their Views on Same-Sex Marriage|date=June 2014|publisher=Ipsos|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106020526/http://www.ipsos-na.com/download/pr.aspx?id=13813|archivedate=2015-01-06}}</ref> A May 2015 Ipsos poll found 30% of respondents in favour of same-sex marriage and a further 28% in favour of some other form of recognition (meaning that 58% supported recognising same-sex couples in some form).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/nine-facts-we-learned-about-same-sex-marriage-support-poll#.mdE1QlGOk |title=This Is How Many People Support Same-Sex Marriage In 23 Countries Around The World - BuzzFeed News |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-10}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a survey by Nihon Yoron Ch\u014dsa-ka, conducted on 1 and 2 March 2014, 42.3% of Japanese supported same-sex marriage, while 52.4% opposed it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/03/18/national/52-4-of-japanese-say-they-oppose-same-sex-marriage/|title=52.4% of Japanese say they oppose same-sex marriage|work=The Japan Times|accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> Another poll conducted by FNN in April 2015 showed that 59% supported the same-sex partnership certificate law proposed in Shibuya and 53% supported same-sex marriage.
