Established in 1946, the Fulbright Program provides grants for students, scholars, teachers and professionals to undertake studies and research.

International students are also demanding more \"value for money\" as finding job opportunities abroad is becoming more difficult.[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180724145334625]  \n\t\nIn most host countries, higher education was tuition fee-free. Until the 1980s, many countries had not any provision for levying fees on domestic and international students. The UK was the first to introduce fees on overseas students; other countries, such as Australia, began to follow suit.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nThe international market for students now accounts for billions of dollars and, subsequently, competition between institutions is fierce.

However the majority of this figure comes from students moving from one European country to another.<ref name=UNESCO/>\n\n[[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific]] top the list for sending students and accounts for 29% of all international higher education students.  (Students from [[China]] account for 15% of this total.) [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] account for 18%, then Central and East Europe 11%, South and West Asia 9%, [[Arab States]] 7% and [[Sub Saharan Africa]] 5.8%.<ref name=UNESCO/>\n\n== Contributing factors to growth in student migration ==\nThere are many factors contributing to the growing numbers of student migration. \nMany [[developing countries]] have an under supply of university places to satisfy demand and as a result students have no other choice but to [[study abroad]].  In addition to this it is a common expectation that studying overseas can enhance professional business opportunities.<ref name=gribble/>  Generally, students seeking cross-border education migrate to countries with more developed education institutions than their own.  For example, students in Arab countries migrate to Egypt and Jordan to pursue their studies, and many students from Bangladesh and Nepal travel to India.\nThe flow of students from [[developing countries]] to [[developed countries]] is often due to the belief that the quality and standards of education offered in [[OECD]] countries is superior to what is offered in the country of origin.<ref name=varghese/>\n\nHigher education has become a major global export commodity with [[developing countries]] capitalising on domestic shortages by recruiting [[foreign student]]s.  Subsequently, changes to visa and immigration policies have provided incentives for students to travel abroad and potentially offer a gateway to permanent residency within a host nation.  Migration opportunities are one of the major contributions to the growth of student migration.  A 2006 survey, undertaken by Australia\u2019s Monash University, produced statistics which showed 75% of Indian students who completed university education in Australia applied for and were granted residency.  The author of the research, Michiel Bass suggests that the most influential reason Indian students studied in Australia was not because of academic reputation, but the opportunity to gain permanent residency.<ref name=\"verbik\">Verbik, L., Lasanowski, V. 2007, International Student Mobility: Patterns & Trends, The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education, Association of Commonwealth Universities & Universities UK</ref>\n\nAn important factor contributing to student migration is the desire to study in a language other than the student's first language. For example, a growth in the number of students travelling to study in the UK from Central and Eastern Europe has been partially attributed to the wish \"to study in a higher education environment where communication is in English\".<ref name=\"catterall\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269872663_Developing_Writing_Skills_for_International_Students_Adopting_a_critical_pragmatic_approach</ref>\n\nOther factors for the rise in student migration include lowering travel expenses and greater [[communication technology]] which has made studying abroad more accessible.<ref name=gribble/>\n\n== Student visa and immigration policies ==\n\n=== United States ===\nThe US attracts a large number of foreigners to its workforce each year, however international graduates of US institutions do not automatically have the right to remain in the country for work purposes upon completion of their course.  In fact, as part of the student application process, applicants must state that they are not planning to [[emigrate]] to the US.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nVisa and immigration policies in the US are (arguably) significantly less accommodating towards international students and graduates compared to other host countries.  The greatest changes to visa regulations occurred after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when the US immediately implemented tougher visa and immigration requirements.  Under the Enhanced Border Security and Visas Entry Reform Act (2002) the US introduced a new overseas student tax in order to fund an advanced computer tracking system for visa applications, but also made it more difficult for applicants to transfer between visa categories.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, recently the [[US Department of State]] has established a new [[internship]] scheme which has been specifically designed for foreign students.  Since July 2007, certain international students are eligible to participate in a year-long [[internship]] per degree level for practical training as long as they can describe how the experience can enhance their education.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn 2006, as part of a larger scheme to attract highly [[skilled labour]], the UK government made amendments to the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme (SEGS) which enabled all international students who have completed a post-graduate degree course (Master\u2019s of PhD starting after 1 May 2006) to remain in the UK and seek employment for up to 12 months regardless of discipline.<ref name=verbik/>\nThe Government has also made a special provision for internationally coveted [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) students, allowing graduates of 50 highly ranked business schools to apply for a three-year extension to their one-year working visa once their studies have been completed.<ref name=verbik/>\nAs part of the [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]] (HSMP), such students have been eligible to apply for [[permanent residency|permanent residence]] since 12 April 2005.  The Government further extended opportunities for non EU/EEA students in 2007, which allows all students who have completed degree programmes in the UK the opportunity to stay in the UK for employment purposes.  The [[International Graduates Scheme]] has been in operation since 1 May 2007.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, in March 2011, the UK Government made an announcement on reforming student visa system, which is getting much stricter The major changes in student immigration policies including tougher requirements for entrance, tightening work entitlements and closing the post-study work route are aimed at ensuring the UK welcomes the best overseas students with expected contribution.\n\n=== Germany and France ===\nSince January 2005, Germany has issued singular permits for both residence and employment in an effort to attract international students and skilled migrants to the country and facilitate their arrival.  Overseas students are also eligible to apply for an extension on their residence permit for up to one year for the purpose of seeking employment which is relevant to their field of study upon completion of their studies.\n \nIn France, international students have the right to work part-time for up to 19 hours per week whilst studying.  Students must, however, have a valid residency permit and be enrolled in an institution which participates in the French social protection system.  Upon completion of studies, students are able to accept offers of employment from French firms by applying for temporary employment authorization. It ought to be noted that both Germany and France belongs to the [[Schengen Area|Schengen agreement]].<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn addition to Australia's points system, which encourages skilled migration, regulations allow all international students completing an Australian degree to remain in the country for 18 months upon graduating. Students can earn bonus points for skilled work experience and English-language proficiency in addition to those already earned for Australian qualifications, under amendments to the General Skilled Migration Programme (GSM). Previously, international students were exempt from [[work experience]] requirements when applying for general skilled migration.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nLegislation introduced on September 1, 2007 requires authorities to provide 'temporary visas' to enable applicants to earn experience. These changes were made to strengthen links between study, work experience and employment to ensure migrants have the skills that Australian employers are looking for. The main rationale behind these schemes is the desire for Australia to benefit from the skills of foreign graduates.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nStudents no longer have the option to remain in Australia following the completion of a master's degree for the purposes of work. It is now necessary to re-apply under specific sponsorship.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Canada ===\nInternational students travelling to Canada are not required to apply for a study visa unless the programmes they are enrolled in are longer than 6 months.  Acquiring a study permit, does however have significant benefits to students, giving them permission to seek part-time employment on campus and since April 2006, off campus, for up to 20 hours per week whilst they are completing their studies.\nUnder the Post-Graduation Work Permit Programmes, international graduates from Canadian higher education institutions are eligible to apply for employment of up to two years.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nAn international student is eligible for PGWP if they had graduated from a specified Designated Learning Institution [DLI] in Canada and wish to stay in Canada temporarily for working.[[https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/about.html 1]]\n\nNot all on the DLI list are eligible though. \n\nAn international student will have 180 days from the day of getting their final marks to apply for a PGWP. [ [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/about.html 2]]\n\nIn situations wherein the study permit might be expiring before the student could get his final marks, the student can either leave for Canada and apply for PGWP, or stay in the country longer by applying for a visitor record. \n\nIf a student stays on in Canada and the study permit that they are in Canada on expires, the student must apply for a restoration of their student status in Canada before applying for PGWP. Additional fees will have to be paid for the restoration of their status as an international student in Canada.\n\nThe duration of an international students Post-Graduation Work Permit [PGWP] in Canada will depend on the length of their study program in Canada. [[https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/about.html 3]]\n\nThe study program in Canada must be a minimum of 8 months in duration. \n\nWith the COVID-19 special measures in Canada, many of the courses are currently being taught online. The government of Canada has clarified that the student\u2019s eligibility for the PGWP will not be affected if their course is being taught online because of COVID-19 restrictions in Canada.[ [https://blog.y-axis.com/canada-eligibility-for-pgwp-not-affected-by-online-courses/ 4]]\n\nIn 2008, 105 780 study permits applied for from outside Canada were processed, and in 22% of those cases a study permit was refused.  Refusal rates varied by region, with 11% of applicants from Europe refused and 35% from Africa and the Middle East refused.<ref>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/evaluation/isp/findings.asp Evaluation of the International Student Program: Findings] ''[[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]'' Accessed 27 February 2014</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn New Zealand, international students are not required to apply for a student visa if they are studying for a course which is less than three months in duration.  Under certain circumstances international students can seek part-time employment for up to 20 hours per week whilst studying (full-time) in a course that at least 6 months in duration.  \nIn July 2007, amendments were made to the [[Skilled Migrant Category (New Zealand)|Skilled Migrant Category]] which gives students the opportunity to earn bonus points for recognized New Zealand higher education qualifications or for two years of full-time study in the country.  In addition, the number of years to require points for work experience in New Zealand will be reduced and international students may be eligible to apply for a work visa for up to two year upon completion of their studies in the country.\n\n== Issues that can arise with student migration ==\nThe loss of students from sending countries can have a rather detrimental impact on the economy by depleting already scarce resources.<ref name=gribble/> [[Brain drain]] is the large scale loss of individuals with technical skills or knowledge.\n\nDifferences in learning cultures is an issue in student migration. This means that the students can have difficulty if the teaching, learning and assessment methods are very different from those in their previous education.<ref name=catterall/>  For example, some European students studying in Britain have been noted as having little experience of a number of tasks typically expected of British students while many are familiar \"with only traditional forms of assessment such as examinations\".<ref name=catterall/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Brain drain]]\n* [[Colombo Plan]]\n* [[Fulbright Program]]\n* [[Immigration]]\n* [[Immigration policy]]\n* [[International student]]\n* [[Student exchange]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External links==\n* Bulgarian Student Migration to Hungary https://www.academia.edu/2549846/_._._Bulgarian_Student_Migration_to_Hungary_in_the_Second_Half_of_the_19th_and_the_First_Half_of_the_20th_Centuries_19-20_\n* [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.001 Research on social inclusion of international students]\n\n[[Category:Student migration| ]]\n[[Category:United States visas by type]]\n[[Category:Visa policy of the United States]]\n[[Category:Human migration]]\n", "text_old": "'''Student migration''' is the movement of students who study outside their country of birth or citizenship for a period of 12 months or more.<ref>Spring, J. 2009, Globalization of Education: An Introduction, QueensCollege & Graduate Centre, City University of New York</ref> During the period of [[globalization]], the internationalisation of higher education increased dramatically and it has become a market driven activity.

The greatest changes to visa regulations occurred after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when the US immediately implemented tougher visa and immigration requirements.  Under the Enhanced Border Security and Visas Entry Reform Act (2002) the US introduced a new overseas student tax in order to fund an advanced computer tracking system for visa applications, but also made it more difficult for applicants to transfer between visa categories.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, recently the [[US Department of State]] has established a new [[internship]] scheme which has been specifically designed for foreign students.  Since July 2007, certain international students are eligible to participate in a year-long [[internship]] per degree level for practical training as long as they can describe how the experience can enhance their education.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn 2006, as part of a larger scheme to attract highly [[skilled labour]], the UK government made amendments to the Science and Engineering Graduate Scheme (SEGS) which enabled all international students who have completed a post-graduate degree course (Master\u2019s of PhD starting after 1 May 2006) to remain in the UK and seek employment for up to 12 months regardless of discipline.<ref name=verbik/>\nThe Government has also made a special provision for internationally coveted [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) students, allowing graduates of 50 highly ranked business schools to apply for a three-year extension to their one-year working visa once their studies have been completed.<ref name=verbik/>\nAs part of the [[Highly Skilled Migrant Programme]] (HSMP), such students have been eligible to apply for [[permanent residency|permanent residence]] since 12 April 2005.  The Government further extended opportunities for non EU/EEA students in 2007, which allows all students who have completed degree programmes in the UK the opportunity to stay in the UK for employment purposes.  The [[International Graduates Scheme]] has been in operation since 1 May 2007.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nHowever, in March 2011, the UK Government made an announcement on reforming student visa system, which is getting much stricter The major changes in student immigration policies including tougher requirements for entrance, tightening work entitlements and closing the post-study work route are aimed at ensuring the UK welcomes the best overseas students with expected contribution.\n\n=== Germany and France ===\nSince January 2005, Germany has issued singular permits for both residence and employment in an effort to attract international students and skilled migrants to the country and facilitate their arrival.  Overseas students are also eligible to apply for an extension on their residence permit for up to one year for the purpose of seeking employment which is relevant to their field of study upon completion of their studies.\n \nIn France, international students have the right to work part-time for up to 19 hours per week whilst studying.  Students must, however, have a valid residency permit and be enrolled in an institution which participates in the French social protection system.  Upon completion of studies, students are able to accept offers of employment from French firms by applying for temporary employment authorization. It ought to be noted that both Germany and France belongs to the [[Schengen Area|Schengen agreement]].<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn addition to Australia's points system, which encourages skilled migration, regulations allow all international students completing an Australian degree to remain in the country for 18 months upon graduating. Students can earn bonus points for skilled work experience and English-language proficiency in addition to those already earned for Australian qualifications, under amendments to the General Skilled Migration Programme (GSM). Previously, international students were exempt from [[work experience]] requirements when applying for general skilled migration.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nLegislation introduced on September 1, 2007 requires authorities to provide 'temporary visas' to enable applicants to earn experience. These changes were made to strengthen links between study, work experience and employment to ensure migrants have the skills that Australian employers are looking for. The main rationale behind these schemes is the desire for Australia to benefit from the skills of foreign graduates.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nStudents no longer have the option to remain in Australia following the completion of a master's degree for the purposes of work. It is now necessary to re-apply under specific sponsorship.<ref name=verbik/>\n\n=== Canada ===\nInternational students travelling to Canada are not required to apply for a study visa unless the programmes they are enrolled in are longer than 6 months.  Acquiring a study permit, does however have significant benefits to students, giving them permission to seek part-time employment on campus and since April 2006, off campus, for up to 20 hours per week whilst they are completing their studies.\nUnder the Post-Graduation Work Permit Programmes, international graduates from Canadian higher education institutions are eligible to apply for employment of up to two years.<ref name=verbik/>\n\nIn 2008, 105 780 study permits applied for from outside Canada were processed, and in 22% of those cases a study permit was refused.  Refusal rates varied by region, with 11% of applicants from Europe refused and 35% from Africa and the Middle East refused.<ref>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/evaluation/isp/findings.asp Evaluation of the International Student Program: Findings] ''[[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada]]'' Accessed 27 February 2014</ref>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\nIn New Zealand, international students are not required to apply for a student visa if they are studying for a course which is less than three months in duration.  Under certain circumstances international students can seek part-time employment for up to 20 hours per week whilst studying (full-time) in a course that at least 6 months in duration.  \nIn July 2007, amendments were made to the [[Skilled Migrant Category (New Zealand)|Skilled Migrant Category]] which gives students the opportunity to earn bonus points for recognized New Zealand higher education qualifications or for two years of full-time study in the country.  In addition, the number of years to require points for work experience in New Zealand will be reduced and international students may be eligible to apply for a work visa for up to two year upon completion of their studies in the country.\n\n== Issues that can arise with student migration ==\nThe loss of students from sending countries can have a rather detrimental impact on the economy by depleting already scarce resources.<ref name=gribble/> [[Brain drain]] is the large scale loss of individuals with technical skills or knowledge.\n\nDifferences in learning cultures is an issue in student migration. This means that the students can have difficulty if the teaching, learning and assessment methods are very different from those in their previous education.<ref name=catterall/>  For example, some European students studying in Britain have been noted as having little experience of a number of tasks typically expected of British students while many are familiar \"with only traditional forms of assessment such as examinations\".<ref name=catterall/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Brain drain]]\n* [[Colombo Plan]]\n* [[Fulbright Program]]\n* [[Immigration]]\n* [[Immigration policy]]\n* [[International student]]\n* [[Student exchange]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External links==\n* Bulgarian Student Migration to Hungary https://www.academia.edu/2549846/_._._Bulgarian_Student_Migration_to_Hungary_in_the_Second_Half_of_the_19th_and_the_First_Half_of_the_20th_Centuries_19-20_\n* [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.07.001 Research on social inclusion of international students]\n\n[[Category:Student migration| ]]\n[[Category:United States visas by type]]\n[[Category:Visa policy of the United States]]\n[[Category:Human migration]]\n", "name_user": "RenukaTG", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_migration"}

Cunningham]], written by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], and starring [[Betsy Palmer]], [[Adrienne King]], [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby]], [[Laurie Bartram]], [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]], [[Jeannine Taylor]], Robbi Morgan, and [[Kevin Bacon]]. The film tells the story of a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown killer while attempting to re-open an abandoned [[summer camp]].\n\nPrompted by the success of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), director Cunningham put out an advertisement to sell the film in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in early 1979, while Miller was still drafting the screenplay. After casting the film in New York City, filming took place in [[New Jersey]] in the summer of 1979, on an estimated budget of $550,000. A bidding war ensued over the finished film, ending with [[Paramount Pictures]] acquiring the film for domestic distribution, while [[Warner Bros.]] secured European distribution rights.\n\nReleased in May 1980, ''Friday the 13th'' was a major box office success, grossing over $59.8 million worldwide. Critical response was divided, with some praising the film's cinematography, score, and performances, while numerous others derided it for its depiction of graphic violence. Aside from being the first [[independent film]] of its kind to secure distribution in the U.S. by a major studio, its box office success led to [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|a long series of sequels]], [[Freddy vs. Jason|a crossover]] with  ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|a 2009 series reboot]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, counselors Barry Jackson and Claudette Hayes sneak inside a storage farm shed to have hard core damn sex, where an unseen assailant kills and murders them. Twenty-one years later, camp counselor Annie Phillips is given a lift halfway to the reopened Camp Crystal Lake by a truck driver named Enos, despite an elderly man named Crazy Ralph warning her. While driving, Enos warns Annie about the camp's past, informing her about a young boy who drowned at Crystal Lake in 1957, the two murders in 1958, several fires after that, and poisoned water in 1962. After being dropped off, she hitches another ride from an unseen person, who chases her into the woods and slashes her throat.\n\nAt the camp, counselors Ned Rubenstein, Jack Burrell, Bill Brown, Marcie Stanler, Brenda Jones, and [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]], along with the owner Steve Christy, refurbish the cabins and facilities. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves the campground to stock supplies. Ned sees someone walk into a cabin and follow. While Jack and Marcie have sex in one of the cabin's bunk beds, they are unaware of Ned's body above them, with his throat slit. When Marcie leaves to use the bathroom, Jack's throat is pierced with an arrow from beneath the bed. The killer follows Marcie into the bathrooms and slams an ax into her face. Brenda hears a voice calling for help and ventures outside to the archery range, where the lights turn on. Later, Steve returns and recognizes the unseen killer, who stabs him.\n\nWorried by their friends' disappearances, Alice and Bill leave the main cabin to investigate. They find the ax in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and the cars inoperable. When the power goes out, Bill goes to check on the generator. Alice heads out to look for him and finds his body pinned with arrows to the generator room's door. She flees to the main cabin to hide, only to be traumatized further when Brenda's body is thrown through the window. Soon after, Alice sees a vehicle pull up and rushes outside, thinking it is Steve. Instead, she is greeted by a middle-aged woman named [[Pamela Voorhees]], who claims to be an old friend of Steve and his family.\n\nShe reveals that her son, [[Jason Voorhees]] was the young boy who drowned in 1957, blaming his death on the counselors who were supposed to be watching him, but they instead were having sex. Revealing herself as the killer, she attempts to kill Alice, but Alice knocks her out. At the shore, she tries to kill her again with a machete, but Alice gains the advantage and decapitates her. Exhausted, Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe, which floats out on Crystal Lake. Suddenly Jason's corpse attacks her, dragging her into the lake. She awakens inside a hospital with a police sergeant and medical staff tending to her. When Alice asks about Jason, the sergeant says there was no sign of any boy. She says: \"then he's still there,\" as the lake is shown at peace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Adrienne King]] as [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]]\n* [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby III]] as Bill Brown\n* [[Jeannine Taylor]] as Marcie Stanler{{sfn|Robinson|2012|p=xix}}\n* [[Laurie Bartram]] as Brenda Jones \n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Jack Burrell{{sfn|Falconer|2010|p=131}}\n* [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]] as Ned Rubenstein{{sfn|Robinson|2012|p=xix}}\n* Robbi Morgan as Annie Phillips \n* Peter Brouwer as Steve Christy \n* [[Rex Everhart]] as Enos \n* [[Ronn Carroll]] as Sgt.

Hogan notes that, \"throughout the film, teenage boys are hideously dispatched, but not with the same buildup and attention to detail that Cunningham and makeup wiz [[Tom Savini]] reserved for nubile young girls.\"{{sfn|Hogan|2016|p=254}}\n\n===Gender of villain===\nThe film has spurred critical discussion in regard to its villain being female, a plot point examined at length by film scholar [[Carol J. Clover]] in her book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]''. Clover notes the revelation of Pamela Voorhees as the killer as \"the most dramatic case of pulling out the gender rug\" in horror film history.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=56}} Commenting on the first-person point-of-view shots from the killer, Clover writes: \"'We' [the audience] stalk and kill a number of teenagers over the course of an hour of movie time without even knowing who 'we' are; we are invited, by conventional expectation and by glimpses of 'our' own bodily parts{{em dash}}a heavily booted foot, a roughly gloved hand{{em dash}}to suppose that 'we' are male, but 'we' are revealed, at the film's end, as a woman.\"{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=56}}\n\nOn the killer's identity, Dimare has noted:\n\n{{quote|Because Cunningham avoids revealing anything about the psychotic killer beyond the fact that the figure is dressed in men's gloves and boots, the audience assumes the slayer is a man ... &nbsp; Cunningham sustains the eerie indeterminacy of the killer's age, social status, and gender deep into his film. The use of this cinematic process of abstraction allows the film to linger over the ambiguous nature of evil until 'sits climactic last act.{{sfn|Dimare|2011|p=186}}}}\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:F13Variety.jpg|thumb|upright|''Friday the 13th'' did not have a completed script when Sean S. Cunningham took out this advertisement in ''Variety'' magazine]]\n''Friday the 13th'' was produced and directed by [[Sean S. Cunningham]], who had previously worked with filmmaker [[Wes Craven]] on the film ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''. Cunningham, inspired by [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'',{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}} wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be shocking, visually stunning and \"[make] you jump out of your seat.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}} Wanting to distance himself from ''The Last House on the Left'', Cunningham wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be more of a \"roller-coaster ride.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe original screenplay was tentatively titled ''A Long Night at Camp Blood''.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} While working on a redraft of the screenplay, Cunningham proposed the title ''Friday the 13th'', after which Miller began redeveloping.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} Cunningham rushed out to place an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' using the ''Friday the 13th'' title.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}} Worried that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. He commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his concept of the ''Friday the 13th'' logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=15\u201316}} In the end, Cunningham believed there were \"no problems\" with the title, but distributor George Mansour stated, \"There was a movie before ours called ''Friday the 13th: The Orphan''. It was moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. Either Phil Scuderi paid them off, but it was finally resolved.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}}\n\nThe screenplay was completed in mid-1979{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], who later went on to write for several television [[soap opera]]s, including ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]''; at the time, Miller was living in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], near Cunningham, and the two had begun collaborating on potential film projects.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}} Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer who turned out to be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. \"I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted\u2014a mother who would have killed for her kids.\"<ref name=miller/> Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. \"Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain.\"<ref name=miller>{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Victor |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.victormiller.com/faq.php |work=Victor Miller Official Site |accessdate=June 25, 2017 |quote=I have a major problem with all of them because they made Jason the villain.

Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain.}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was initially not used in the original script; in Miller's final draft, the film ended with Alice merely floating on the lake.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=20}} Jason's appearance was actually suggested by makeup designer [[Tom Savini]].{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=20}} Savini stated that \"The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'', so we thought that we need a 'chair jumper' like that, and I said, 'let's bring in Jason'\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Jason Voorhees: From mama's boy to his own man|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/story/462246p-388901c.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114062638/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/story/462246p-388901c.html|archivedate=November 14, 2006 |work=[[New York Daily News]]|accessdate=December 11, 2006 |date=October 19, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nA New York-based firm, headed by Julie Hughes and Barry Moss, was hired to find eight young actors to play the camp's staff members. Cunningham admits that he was not looking for \"great actors,\" but anyone that was likable, and appeared to be a responsible camp counselor.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=21\u201328}} The way Cunningham saw it, the actors would need to look good, read the dialogue somewhat well, and work cheap. Moss and Hughes were happy to find four actors, [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Laurie Bartram]], Peter Brouwer, and [[Adrienne King]], who had previously appeared on [[soap operas]].{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} The role of [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film. King earned an audition primarily because she was the friend of someone working in Moss and Hughes's office, and Cunningham felt she embodied the qualities of Alice.{{sfn|Norman|2014|p=84}} After she auditioned, Moss recalls Cunningham commenting that they saved the best actress for last.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}} As Cunningham explains, he was looking for people that could behave naturally, and King was able to show that to him in the audition.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I didn't even really think of this movie as a horror film. \"To me, this was a small independent film about carefree teenagers who are having a rip-roaring time at a summer camp where they happen to be working as counselors.

Kevin Bacon, [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]] and Jeannine Taylor, who had known each other prior to the film, were cast as Jack, Ned, and Marcie respectively. It is Bacon and Nelson's contention that, because the three already knew each other, they already had the specific chemistry the casting director was looking for in the roles of Jack, Ned, and Marcie.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} Taylor has stated that Hughes and Moss were highly regarded while she was an actress, so when they offered her an audition she felt that, whatever the part, it would \"be a good opportunity.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n\n''Friday the 13th'' was Nelson's first feature film, and when he went in for his first audition the only thing he was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, \"It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}} Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular.{{Sfn|Grove|2005|pages= 36\u201339}} Ned is believed to have given birth to the \"practical joker victim\" of horror films.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=41}} According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', or [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' before that. He served as a model for the slasher films that would follow ''Friday the 13th''.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=41}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I went in to audition for [Moss and Hughes] for something else.

[[Rex Everhart]], who portrays Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, so she had to either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis\u2014Savini's assistant\u2014who would sit in the truck with her.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=34\u201335}} It was Peter Brouwer's girlfriend that helped him land a role on ''Friday the 13th''. After recently being written off the show ''[[Love of Life]]'', Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an [[assistant director]] for ''Friday the 13th'', Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer's girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}}\n\n[[Estelle Parsons]] was initially asked to portray the film's killer, Mrs. Voorhees, but eventually declined. Her agent cited that the film was too violent, and did not know what kind of actress would play such a part. Hughes and Moss sent a copy of the script to Betsy Palmer, in hopes that she would accept the part. Palmer could not understand why someone would want her for a part in a horror film, as she had previously starred in films such as ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'', ''The Angry Man'', and ''[[The Tin Star]]''. Palmer only agreed to play the role because she needed to buy a new car, even when she believed the film to \"be a piece of shit.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} Stavrakis subbed for Betsy Palmer as well, which involved Morgan's character being chased through the woods by Mrs. Voorhees, although the audience only sees a pair of legs running after Morgan. Palmer had just arrived in town when those scenes were about to be filmed, and was not in the physical shape necessary to chase Morgan around the woods. Morgan's training as an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]] assisted her in these scenes, as her character was required to leap out of a moving jeep when she discovers that Mrs. Voorhees does not intend to take her to the camp.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=34\u201335}} Betsy Palmer explains how she developed the character of Mrs. Voorhees:\n\n{{quote|Being an actress who uses the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavsky method]], I always try to find details about my character. With Pamela ... I began with a class ring that I remember reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex\u2014which is very bad of course\u2014and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having ... babies out of [[Marriage|wedlock]] isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but he turned out to be a very strange boy. [She took] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=49\u201350}}}}\n\nCunningham wanted to make the Mrs. Voorhees character \"terrifying\", and to that end he believed it was important that Palmer not act \"over the top.\" There was also the fear that Palmer's past credits, as more of a wholesome character, would make it difficult to believe she could be scary.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=52}} Palmer was paid $1000 per day for her ten days on set.<ref name=freaky>{{cite news|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|pages=D\u20131, {{url|https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938843/pittsburgh_postgazette/|D-5}}|author=Vancheri, Barbara|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|date=February 13, 2009|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938812/pittsburgh_postgazette/|title=Freaky Friday}}</ref> Ari Lehman, who had previously auditioned for Cunningham's ''Manny's Orphans'', failing to get the part, was determined to land the role of Jason Voorhees.

Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason's death.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=50}}\n\nA number of scenes from the film were recreated in ''Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale'', a two-issue comic book prequel released by [[WildStorm]] in 2007.

Cunningham]], written by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], and starring [[Betsy Palmer]], [[Adrienne King]], [[Harry Crosby (businessman)|Harry Crosby]], [[Laurie Bartram]], [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]], [[Jeannine Taylor]], Robbi Morgan, and [[Kevin Bacon]]. The film tells the story of a group of teenage camp counselors who are murdered one by one by an unknown killer while attempting to re-open an abandoned [[summer camp]].\n\nPrompted by the success of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), director Cunningham put out an advertisement to sell the film in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in early 1979, while Miller was still drafting the screenplay. After casting the film in New York City, filming took place in [[New Jersey]] in the summer of 1979, on an estimated budget of $550,000. A bidding war ensued over the finished film, ending with [[Paramount Pictures]] acquiring the film for domestic distribution, while [[Warner Bros.]] secured European distribution rights.\n\nReleased in May 1980, ''Friday the 13th'' was a major box office success, grossing over $59.8 million worldwide. Critical response was divided, with some praising the film's cinematography, score, and performances, while numerous others derided it for its depiction of graphic violence. Aside from being the first [[independent film]] of its kind to secure distribution in the U.S. by a major studio, its box office success led to [[Friday the 13th (franchise)|a long series of sequels]], [[Freddy vs. Jason|a crossover]] with  ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|a 2009 series reboot]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1958 at Camp Crystal Lake, counselors Barry Jackson and Claudette Hayes sneak inside a storage cabin to have sex, where an unseen assailant murders them. Twenty-one years later, camp counselor Annie Phillips is given a lift halfway to the reopened Camp Crystal Lake by a truck driver named Enos, despite an elderly man named Crazy Ralph warning her. While driving, Enos warns Annie about the camp's past, informing her about a young boy who drowned at Crystal Lake in 1957, the two murders in 1958, several fires after that, and poisoned water in 1962. After being dropped off, she hitches another ride from an unseen person, who chases her into the woods and slashes her throat.\n\nAt the camp, counselors Ned Rubenstein, Jack Burrell, Bill Brown, Marcie Stanler, Brenda Jones, and [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]], along with the owner Steve Christy, refurbish the cabins and facilities. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves the campground to stock supplies. Ned sees someone walk into a cabin and follow. While Jack and Marcie have sex in one of the cabin's bunk beds, they are unaware of Ned's body above them, with his throat slit. When Marcie leaves to use the bathroom, Jack's throat is pierced with an arrow from beneath the bed. The killer follows Marcie into the bathrooms and slams an ax into her face. Brenda hears a voice calling for help and ventures outside to the archery range, where the lights turn on. Later, Steve returns and recognizes the unseen killer, who stabs him.\n\nWorried by their friends' disappearances, Alice and Bill leave the main cabin to investigate. They find the ax in Brenda's bed, the phones disconnected, and the cars inoperable. When the power goes out, Bill goes to check on the generator. Alice heads out to look for him and finds his body pinned with arrows to the generator room's door. She flees to the main cabin to hide, only to be traumatized further when Brenda's body is thrown through the window. Soon after, Alice sees a vehicle pull up and rushes outside, thinking it is Steve. Instead, she is greeted by a middle-aged woman named [[Pamela Voorhees]], who claims to be an old friend of Steve and his family.\n\nShe reveals that her son, [[Jason Voorhees]] was the young boy who drowned in 1957, blaming his death on the counselors who were supposed to be watching him, but they instead were having sex. Revealing herself as the killer, she attempts to kill Alice, but Alice knocks her out. At the shore, she tries to kill her again with a machete, but Alice gains the advantage and decapitates her. Exhausted, Alice boards and falls asleep inside a canoe, which floats out on Crystal Lake. Suddenly Jason's corpse attacks her, dragging her into the lake. She awakens inside a hospital with a police sergeant and medical staff tending to her. When Alice asks about Jason, the sergeant says there was no sign of any boy.

Hogan notes that, \"throughout the film, teenage boys are hideously dispatched, but not with the same buildup and attention to detail that Cunningham and makeup wiz [[Tom Savini]] reserved for nubile young girls.\"{{sfn|Hogan|2016|p=254}}\n\n===Gender of villain===\nThe film has spurred critical discussion in regard to its villain being female, a plot point examined at length by film scholar [[Carol J. Clover]] in her book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]''. Clover notes the revelation of Pamela Voorhees as the killer as \"the most dramatic case of pulling out the gender rug\" in horror film history.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=56}} Commenting on the first-person point-of-view shots from the killer, Clover writes: \"'We' [the audience] stalk and kill a number of teenagers over the course of an hour of movie time without even knowing who 'we' are; we are invited, by conventional expectation and by glimpses of 'our' own bodily parts{{em dash}}a heavily booted foot, a roughly gloved hand{{em dash}}to suppose that 'we' are male, but 'we' are revealed, at the film's end, as a woman.\"{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=56}}\n\nOn the killer's identity, Dimare has noted:\n\n{{quote|Because Cunningham avoids revealing anything about the psychotic killer beyond the fact that the figure is dressed in men's gloves and boots, the audience assumes the slayer is a man ... &nbsp; Cunningham sustains the eerie indeterminacy of the killer's age, social status, and gender deep into his film. The use of this cinematic process of abstraction allows the film to linger over the ambiguous nature of evil until 'sits climactic last act.{{sfn|Dimare|2011|p=186}}}}\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:F13Variety.jpg|thumb|upright|''Friday the 13th'' did not have a completed script when Sean S. Cunningham took out this advertisement in ''Variety'' magazine]]\n''Friday the 13th'' was produced and directed by [[Sean S. Cunningham]], who had previously worked with filmmaker [[Wes Craven]] on the film ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''. Cunningham, inspired by [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'',{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}} wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be shocking, visually stunning and \"[make] you jump out of your seat.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}} Wanting to distance himself from ''The Last House on the Left'', Cunningham wanted ''Friday the 13th'' to be more of a \"roller-coaster ride.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nThe original screenplay was tentatively titled ''A Long Night at Camp Blood''.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} While working on a redraft of the screenplay, Cunningham proposed the title ''Friday the 13th'', after which Miller began redeveloping.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} Cunningham rushed out to place an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' using the ''Friday the 13th'' title.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}} Worried that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. He commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his concept of the ''Friday the 13th'' logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pp=15\u201316}} In the end, Cunningham believed there were \"no problems\" with the title, but distributor George Mansour stated, \"There was a movie before ours called ''Friday the 13th: The Orphan''. It was moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. Either Phil Scuderi paid them off, but it was finally resolved.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}}\n\nThe screenplay was completed in mid-1979{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=18}} by [[Victor Miller (writer)|Victor Miller]], who later went on to write for several television [[soap opera]]s, including ''[[Guiding Light]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and ''[[All My Children]]''; at the time, Miller was living in [[Stratford, Connecticut]], near Cunningham, and the two had begun collaborating on potential film projects.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=17}} Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer who turned out to be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. \"I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted\u2014a mother who would have killed for her kids.\"<ref name=miller/> Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. \"Jason was dead from the very beginning.

Cunningham admits that he was not looking for \"great actors,\" but anyone that was likable, and appeared to be a responsible camp counselor.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=21\u201328}} The way Cunningham saw it, the actors would need to look good, read the dialogue somewhat well, and work cheap. Moss and Hughes were happy to find four actors, [[Kevin Bacon]], [[Laurie Bartram]], Peter Brouwer, and [[Adrienne King]], who had previously appeared on [[soap operas]].{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} The role of [[Alice (Friday the 13th)|Alice Hardy]] was set up as an open casting call, a publicity stunt used to attract more attention to the film. King earned an audition primarily because she was the friend of someone working in Moss and Hughes's office, and Cunningham felt she embodied the qualities of Alice.{{sfn|Norman|2014|p=84}} After she auditioned, Moss recalls Cunningham commenting that they saved the best actress for last.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}} As Cunningham explains, he was looking for people that could behave naturally, and King was able to show that to him in the audition.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I didn't even really think of this movie as a horror film. \"To me, this was a small independent film about carefree teenagers who are having a rip-roaring time at a summer camp where they happen to be working as counselors.

Kevin Bacon, [[Mark Nelson (actor)|Mark Nelson]] and Jeannine Taylor, who had known each other prior to the film, were cast as Jack, Ned, and Marcie respectively. It is Bacon and Nelson's contention that, because the three already knew each other, they already had the specific chemistry the casting director was looking for in the roles of Jack, Ned, and Marcie.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} Taylor has stated that Hughes and Moss were highly regarded while she was an actress, so when they offered her an audition she felt that, whatever the part, it would \"be a good opportunity.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n\n''Friday the 13th'' was Nelson's first feature film, and when he went in for his first audition the only thing he was given to read were some comedic scenes. Nelson received a call back for a second audition, which required him to wear a bathing suit, which Nelson acknowledges made him start to wonder if something was off about this film. He did not fully realize what was going on until he got the part and was given the full script to read. Nelson explains, \"It certainly was not a straight dramatic role, and it was only after they offered me the part that they gave me the full script to read and I realized how much blood was in it.\"{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}} Nelson believes that Ned used humor to hide his insecurities, especially around Brenda, whom the actor believes Ned was attracted to. Nelson recalls an early draft of the script stating that Ned suffered from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and his legs were deformed while his upper body was muscular.{{Sfn|Grove|2005|pages= 36\u201339}} Ned is believed to have given birth to the \"practical joker victim\" of horror films.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=41}} According to author David Grove, there was no equivalent character in [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', or [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' before that. He served as a model for the slasher films that would follow ''Friday the 13th''.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=41}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = I went in to audition for [Moss and Hughes] for something else.

[[Rex Everhart]], who portrays Enos, did not film the truck scenes with Morgan, so she had to either act with an imaginary Enos, or exchange dialogue with Taso Stavrakis\u2014Savini's assistant\u2014who would sit in the truck with her.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=34\u201335}} It was Peter Brouwer's girlfriend that helped him land a role on ''Friday the 13th''. After recently being written off the show ''[[Love of Life]]'', Brouwer moved back to Connecticut to look for work. Learning that his girlfriend was working as an [[assistant director]] for ''Friday the 13th'', Brouwer asked about any openings. Initially told casting was looking for big stars to fill the role of Steve Christy, it was not until Sean Cunningham dropped by to deliver a message to Brouwer's girlfriend, and saw him working in a garden, that Brouwer was hired.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}}\n\n[[Estelle Parsons]] was initially asked to portray the film's killer, Mrs. Voorhees, but eventually declined. Her agent cited that the film was too violent, and did not know what kind of actress would play such a part. Hughes and Moss sent a copy of the script to Betsy Palmer, in hopes that she would accept the part. Palmer could not understand why someone would want her for a part in a horror film, as she had previously starred in films such as ''[[Mister Roberts (1955 film)|Mister Roberts]]'', ''The Angry Man'', and ''[[The Tin Star]]''. Palmer only agreed to play the role because she needed to buy a new car, even when she believed the film to \"be a piece of shit.\"{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} Stavrakis subbed for Betsy Palmer as well, which involved Morgan's character being chased through the woods by Mrs. Voorhees, although the audience only sees a pair of legs running after Morgan. Palmer had just arrived in town when those scenes were about to be filmed, and was not in the physical shape necessary to chase Morgan around the woods. Morgan's training as an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]] assisted her in these scenes, as her character was required to leap out of a moving jeep when she discovers that Mrs. Voorhees does not intend to take her to the camp.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=34\u201335}} Betsy Palmer explains how she developed the character of Mrs. Voorhees:\n\n{{quote|Being an actress who uses the [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavsky method]], I always try to find details about my character. With Pamela ... I began with a class ring that I remember reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex\u2014which is very bad of course\u2014and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having ... babies out of [[Marriage|wedlock]] isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but he turned out to be a very strange boy. [She took] lots of odd jobs and one of those jobs was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble. From that point on, Pamela became very psychotic and puritanical in her attitudes as she was determined to kill all of the immoral camp counselors.{{sfn|Grove|2005|pages=49\u201350}}}}\n\nCunningham wanted to make the Mrs. Voorhees character \"terrifying\", and to that end he believed it was important that Palmer not act \"over the top.\" There was also the fear that Palmer's past credits, as more of a wholesome character, would make it difficult to believe she could be scary.{{sfn|Grove|2005|p=52}} Palmer was paid $1000 per day for her ten days on set.<ref name=freaky>{{cite news|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|pages=D\u20131, {{url|https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938843/pittsburgh_postgazette/|D-5}}|author=Vancheri, Barbara|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|date=February 13, 2009|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/22938812/pittsburgh_postgazette/|title=Freaky Friday}}</ref> Ari Lehman, who had previously auditioned for Cunningham's ''Manny's Orphans'', failing to get the part, was determined to land the role of Jason Voorhees. According to Lehman, he went in very intense and afterward Cunningham told him he was perfect for the part.{{sfn|Grove|2005 |pages=21\u201328}} In addition to the main cast, [[Walt Gorney]] came on as \"Crazy Ralph\", the town's [[Oracle|soothsayer]]. The character of Crazy Ralph was meant to establish two functions: foreshadow the events to come, and insinuate that he could actually be the murderer. Cunningham has stated that he was apprehensive about including the character, and is not sure if he accomplished his goal of creating a new suspect.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|pages=19\u201321}}\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in and around the townships of Hardwick, [[Blairstown, New Jersey|Blairstown]] and [[Hampton, New Jersey|Hope]], [[New Jersey]] in September 1979.

To achieve the unique sound he wanted for the film, Manfredini spoke the two words \"harshly, distinctly and rhythmically into a microphone\" and ran them into an echo reverberation machine.<ref name=\"slash\"/> Manfredini finished the original score after a couple of weeks, and then recorded the score in a friend's basement.{{sfn|Bracke|2006|p=39}} Victor Miller and assistant editor Jay Keuper have commented on how memorable the music is, with Keuper describing it as \"iconographic\".

Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her son could happen again.

{"title_page": "Volatility (finance)", "text_new": "[[File:VIX.png|thumb|The VIX]]\nIn [[finance]], '''volatility''' (symbol ''\u03c3'') is the degree of variation of a trading price series over time, usually measured by the [[standard deviation]] of [[logarithmic return]]s.\n\nHistoric volatility measures a time series of past market prices.  [[Implied volatility]] looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).\n\n== Volatility terminology  ==\nVolatility as described here refers to the '''actual volatility''', more specifically:\n* '''actual current volatility''' of a financial instrument for a specified period (for example 30 days or 90 days), based on historical prices over the specified period with the last observation the most recent price. \n* '''actual historical volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period but with the last observation on a date in the past\n**near synonymous is '''realized volatility''', the [[square root]] of the [[realized variance]], in turn calculated using the sum of squared returns divided by the number of observations.\n* '''actual future volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period starting at the current time and ending at a future date (normally the expiry date of an [[Option (finance)|option]])\nNow turning to [[implied volatility]], we have:\n* '''historical implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from historical prices of the financial instrument (normally options)\n* '''current implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from current prices of the financial instrument\n* '''future implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from future prices of the financial instrument\n\nFor a financial instrument whose price follows a [[Gaussian]] [[random walk]], or [[Wiener process]], the width of the distribution increases as time increases.  This is because there is an increasing [[probability]] that the instrument's price will be farther away from the initial price as time increases. However, rather than increase linearly, the volatility increases with the square-root of time as time increases, because some fluctuations are expected to cancel each other out, so the most likely deviation after twice the time will not be twice the distance from zero.\n\nSince observed price changes do not follow Gaussian distributions, others such as the [[L\u00e9vy distribution]] are often used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Levy_distribution|title=Levy distribution|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref> These can capture attributes such as \"[[fat tail]]s\".\nVolatility is a statistical measure of dispersion  around the average of any random variable such as market parameters etc.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\nFor any fund that evolves randomly with time,  volatility is defined as the [[standard deviation]] of a sequence of random variables, each of which is the return of the fund over some corresponding sequence of (equally sized) times.\n\nThus, \"annualized\" volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>annually</sub> is the standard deviation of an instrument's yearly [[Rate of return#Logarithmic or continuously compounded return|logarithmic returns]].<ref>{{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120330224816/http://www.lfrankcabrera.com/calc-hist-vol.pdf|title= Calculating Historical Volatility: Step-by-Step Example |date= 30 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe generalized volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>''T''</sub> for [[time horizon]] ''T'' in years is expressed as:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{T} = \\sigma_\\text{annually} \\sqrt{T}.</math>\n\nTherefore, if the daily logarithmic returns of a stock have a standard deviation of ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> and the time period of returns is ''P'' in trading days, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{P} = \\sigma_\\text{daily} \\sqrt{P}.</math>\n\nA common assumption is that ''P'' = 252 trading days in any given year. Then, if ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> = 0.01, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{annually} = 0.01 \\sqrt{252} = 0.1587.</math>\n\nThe monthly volatility (i.e., ''T'' = 1/12 of a year or ''P'' = 252/12 = 21 trading days) would be\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.1587 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.01 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{252}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\nThe formulas used above to convert returns or volatility measures from one time period to another assume a particular underlying model or process. These formulas are accurate extrapolations of a [[random walk]], or Wiener process, whose steps have finite variance. However, more generally, for natural stochastic processes, the precise relationship between volatility measures for different time periods is more complicated. Some use the L\u00e9vy stability exponent ''\u03b1'' to extrapolate natural processes:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_T = T^{1/\\alpha} \\sigma.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 you get the [[Wiener process]] scaling relation, but some people believe ''\u03b1''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2 for financial activities such as stocks, indexes and so on. This was discovered by [[Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot]], who looked at cotton prices and found that they followed a [[Stable distribution|L\u00e9vy alpha-stable distribution]] with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.7. (See New Scientist, 19 April 1997.)\n\n== Volatility origin ==\nMuch research has been devoted to modeling and forecasting the volatility of financial returns, and yet few theoretical models explain how volatility comes to exist in the first place.\n\nRoll (1984) shows that volatility is affected by [[market microstructure]].<ref>Roll, R. (1984): \"A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid-Ask Spread in an Efficient Market\", ''Journal of Finance'' '''39''' (4), 1127\u20131139</ref>  Glosten and Milgrom (1985) shows that at least one source of volatility can be explained by the liquidity provision process. When market makers infer the possibility of [[adverse selection]], they adjust their trading ranges, which in turn increases the band of price oscillation.<ref>Glosten, L. R. and P. R. Milgrom (1985): \"Bid, Ask and Transaction Prices in a Specialist Market with Heterogeneously Informed Traders\", ''[[Journal of Financial Economics]]'' '''14''' (1), 71\u2013100</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[JPMorgan Chase]] determined the effect of [[US President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Twitter#Tweets|tweet]]s, and called it the [[Volfefe index]] combining volatility and the [[covfefe]] [[meme]].\n\n== Volatility for investors ==\nInvestors care about volatility for at least eight reasons:\n\n# The wider the swings in an investment's price, the harder emotionally it is to not worry;\n# Price volatility of a trading instrument can define position sizing in a portfolio;\n# When certain cash flows from selling a security are needed at a specific future date, higher volatility means a greater chance of a shortfall;\n# Higher volatility of returns while saving for retirement results in a wider distribution of possible final portfolio values;\n# Higher volatility of return when retired gives withdrawals a larger permanent impact on the portfolio's value;\n# Price volatility presents opportunities to buy assets cheaply and sell when overpriced;\n# Portfolio volatility has a negative impact on the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of that portfolio\n# Volatility affects pricing of [[option (finance)|options]], being a parameter of the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]].\n\nIn today's markets, it is also possible to trade volatility directly, through the use of derivative securities such as options and [[variance swap]]s. See [[Volatility arbitrage]].\n\n== Volatility versus direction ==\n\nVolatility does not measure the direction of price changes, merely their dispersion. This is because when calculating [[standard deviation]] (or [[variance]]), all differences are squared, so that negative and positive differences are combined into one quantity.  Two instruments with different volatilities may have the same expected return, but the instrument with higher volatility will have larger swings in values over a given period of time.\n\nFor example, a lower volatility stock may have an expected (average) return of 7%, with annual volatility of 5%.  This would indicate returns from approximately negative 3% to positive 17% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95% via a two standard deviation rule).  A higher volatility stock, with the same expected return of 7% but with annual volatility of 20%, would indicate returns from approximately negative 33% to positive 47% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95%). These estimates assume a [[normal distribution]]; in reality stocks are found to be [[Kurtosis|leptokurtotic]].\n\n== Volatility over time ==\n\nAlthough the [[Black-Scholes]] equation assumes predictable constant volatility, this is not observed in real markets, and amongst the models are [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Iraj Kani]]'s<ref name=derman>{{cite journal | author=Derman, E., Iraj Kani | title=\"Riding on a Smile.\" RISK, 7(2) Feb.1994, pp. 139\u2013145, pp. 32\u201339. | publisher=Risk | year= 1994 | url=http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/gs-volatility_smile.pdf | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> and  [[Bruno Dupire]]'s [[local volatility]], [[Poisson process]] where volatility jumps to new levels with a predictable frequency, and the increasingly popular Heston model of [[stochastic volatility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Volatility|title=Volatility|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref>\n\nIt is common knowledge that types of assets experience periods of high and low volatility.

Also, a time when prices rise quickly (a possible [[Bubble (economics)|bubble]]) may often be followed by prices going up even more, or going down by an unusual amount.\n\nMost typically, extreme movements do not appear 'out of nowhere'; they are presaged by larger movements than usual. This is termed [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]]. Whether such large movements have the same direction, or the opposite, is more difficult to say. And an increase in volatility does not always presage a further increase\u2014the volatility may simply go back down again.\n\nNot only the volatility depends on the period when it is measured but also on the selected time resolution. The effect is observed due to the fact that the information flow between short-term and long-term traders is asymmetric. As a result, volatility measured with high resolution contains information that is not covered by low resolution volatility and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=Ulrich A.|last2=Dacorogna|first2=Michel|last3=Dave|first3=Rakhal D.|last4=Olsen|first4=Richard|last5=Pictet|first5=Olivier V.|last6=von Weizs\u00e4cker|first6=Jakob|date=1997|title=Volatilities of different time resolutions -- Analyzing the dynamics of market components|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeempfin/v_3a4_3ay_3a1997_3ai_3a2-3_3ap_3a213-239.htm|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=4|issue=2-3|pages=213\u2013239|issn=0927-5398}}</ref>\n\nThe risk parity weighted volatility of the three assets Gold, Treasury bonds and Nasdaq acting as proxy for the Marketportfolio seems to have a low point at 4% after turning upwards for the 8th time since 1974 at this reading in the summer of 2014.\n\n== Alternative measures of volatility ==\nSome authors point out that realized volatility and implied volatility are backward and forward looking measures, and do not reflect current volatility.

Suppose you notice that a market price index, which has a current value near 10,000, has moved about 100 points a day, on average, for many days.  This would constitute a 1% daily movement, up or down.\n\nTo annualize this, you can use the \"rule of 16\", that is, multiply by 16 to get 16% as the annual volatility.  The rationale for this is that 16 is the square root of 256, which is approximately the number of trading days in a year (252).

[[Implied volatility]] looks forward in time, being derived from the market price of a market-traded derivative (in particular, an option).\n\n== Volatility terminology  ==\nVolatility as described here refers to the '''actual volatility''', more specifically:\n* '''actual current volatility''' of a financial instrument for a specified period (for example 30 days or 90 days), based on historical prices over the specified period with the last observation the most recent price. \n* '''actual historical volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period but with the last observation on a date in the past\n**near synonymous is '''realized volatility''', the [[square root]] of the [[realized variance]], in turn calculated using the sum of squared returns divided by the number of observations.\n* '''actual future volatility''' which refers to the volatility of a financial instrument over a specified period starting at the current time and ending at a future date (normally the expiry date of an [[Option (finance)|option]])\nNow turning to [[implied volatility]], we have:\n* '''historical implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from historical prices of the financial instrument (normally options)\n* '''current implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from current prices of the financial instrument\n* '''future implied volatility''' which refers to the implied volatility observed from future prices of the financial instrument\n\nFor a financial instrument whose price follows a [[Gaussian]] [[random walk]], or [[Wiener process]], the width of the distribution increases as time increases.  This is because there is an increasing [[probability]] that the instrument's price will be farther away from the initial price as time increases. However, rather than increase linearly, the volatility increases with the square-root of time as time increases, because some fluctuations are expected to cancel each other out, so the most likely deviation after twice the time will not be twice the distance from zero.\n\nSince observed price changes do not follow Gaussian distributions, others such as the [[L\u00e9vy distribution]] are often used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Levy_distribution|title=Levy distribution|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref> These can capture attributes such as \"[[fat tail]]s\".\nVolatility is a statistical measure of dispersion  around the average of any random variable such as market parameters etc.\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\nFor any fund that evolves randomly with time,  volatility is defined as the [[standard deviation]] of a sequence of random variables, each of which is the return of the fund over some corresponding sequence of (equally sized) times.\n\nThus, \"annualized\" volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>annually</sub> is the standard deviation of an instrument's yearly [[Rate of return#Logarithmic or continuously compounded return|logarithmic returns]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lfrankcabrera.com/calc-hist-vol.pdf|title= Calculating Historical Volatility: Step-by-Step Example |date= 14 July 2011 |accessdate= 15 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe generalized volatility ''\u03c3''<sub>''T''</sub> for [[time horizon]] ''T'' in years is expressed as:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{T} = \\sigma_\\text{annually} \\sqrt{T}.</math>\n\nTherefore, if the daily logarithmic returns of a stock have a standard deviation of ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> and the time period of returns is ''P'' in trading days, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{P} = \\sigma_\\text{daily} \\sqrt{P}.</math>\n\nA common assumption is that ''P'' = 252 trading days in any given year. Then, if ''\u03c3''<sub>daily</sub> = 0.01, the annualized volatility is\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{annually} = 0.01 \\sqrt{252} = 0.1587.</math>\n\nThe monthly volatility (i.e., ''T'' = 1/12 of a year or ''P'' = 252/12 = 21 trading days) would be\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.1587 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_\\text{monthly} = 0.01 \\sqrt{\\tfrac{252}{12}} = 0.0458.</math>\n\nThe formulas used above to convert returns or volatility measures from one time period to another assume a particular underlying model or process. These formulas are accurate extrapolations of a [[random walk]], or Wiener process, whose steps have finite variance. However, more generally, for natural stochastic processes, the precise relationship between volatility measures for different time periods is more complicated. Some use the L\u00e9vy stability exponent ''\u03b1'' to extrapolate natural processes:\n\n: <math>\\sigma_T = T^{1/\\alpha} \\sigma.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 you get the [[Wiener process]] scaling relation, but some people believe ''\u03b1''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2 for financial activities such as stocks, indexes and so on. This was discovered by [[Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot]], who looked at cotton prices and found that they followed a [[Stable distribution|L\u00e9vy alpha-stable distribution]] with ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.7. (See New Scientist, 19 April 1997.)\n\n== Volatility origin ==\nMuch research has been devoted to modeling and forecasting the volatility of financial returns, and yet few theoretical models explain how volatility comes to exist in the first place.\n\nRoll (1984) shows that volatility is affected by [[market microstructure]].<ref>Roll, R. (1984): \"A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid-Ask Spread in an Efficient Market\", ''Journal of Finance'' '''39''' (4), 1127\u20131139</ref>  Glosten and Milgrom (1985) shows that at least one source of volatility can be explained by the liquidity provision process. When market makers infer the possibility of [[adverse selection]], they adjust their trading ranges, which in turn increases the band of price oscillation.<ref>Glosten, L. R. and P. R. Milgrom (1985): \"Bid, Ask and Transaction Prices in a Specialist Market with Heterogeneously Informed Traders\", ''[[Journal of Financial Economics]]'' '''14''' (1), 71\u2013100</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, [[JPMorgan Chase]] determined the effect of [[US President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Twitter#Tweets|tweet]]s, and called it the [[Volfefe index]] combining volatility and the [[covfefe]] [[meme]].\n\n== Volatility for investors ==\nInvestors care about volatility for at least eight reasons:\n\n# The wider the swings in an investment's price, the harder emotionally it is to not worry;\n# Price volatility of a trading instrument can define position sizing in a portfolio;\n# When certain cash flows from selling a security are needed at a specific future date, higher volatility means a greater chance of a shortfall;\n# Higher volatility of returns while saving for retirement results in a wider distribution of possible final portfolio values;\n# Higher volatility of return when retired gives withdrawals a larger permanent impact on the portfolio's value;\n# Price volatility presents opportunities to buy assets cheaply and sell when overpriced;\n# Portfolio volatility has a negative impact on the [[compound annual growth rate]] (CAGR) of that portfolio\n# Volatility affects pricing of [[option (finance)|options]], being a parameter of the [[Black\u2013Scholes model]].\n\nIn today's markets, it is also possible to trade volatility directly, through the use of derivative securities such as options and [[variance swap]]s. See [[Volatility arbitrage]].\n\n== Volatility versus direction ==\n\nVolatility does not measure the direction of price changes, merely their dispersion. This is because when calculating [[standard deviation]] (or [[variance]]), all differences are squared, so that negative and positive differences are combined into one quantity.  Two instruments with different volatilities may have the same expected return, but the instrument with higher volatility will have larger swings in values over a given period of time.\n\nFor example, a lower volatility stock may have an expected (average) return of 7%, with annual volatility of 5%.  This would indicate returns from approximately negative 3% to positive 17% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95% via a two standard deviation rule).  A higher volatility stock, with the same expected return of 7% but with annual volatility of 20%, would indicate returns from approximately negative 33% to positive 47% most of the time (19 times out of 20, or 95%). These estimates assume a [[normal distribution]]; in reality stocks are found to be [[Kurtosis|leptokurtotic]].\n\n== Volatility over time ==\n\nAlthough the [[Black-Scholes]] equation assumes predictable constant volatility, this is not observed in real markets, and amongst the models are [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Iraj Kani]]'s<ref name=derman>{{cite journal | author=Derman, E., Iraj Kani | title=\"Riding on a Smile.\" RISK, 7(2) Feb.1994, pp. 139\u2013145, pp. 32\u201339. | publisher=Risk | year= 1994 | url=http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/gs-volatility_smile.pdf | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref> and  [[Bruno Dupire]]'s [[local volatility]], [[Poisson process]] where volatility jumps to new levels with a predictable frequency, and the increasingly popular Heston model of [[stochastic volatility]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilmottwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Volatility|title=Volatility|work=wilmottwiki.com}}</ref>\n\nIt is common knowledge that types of assets experience periods of high and low volatility.

Also, a time when prices rise quickly (a possible [[Bubble (economics)|bubble]]) may often be followed by prices going up even more, or going down by an unusual amount.\n\nMost typically, extreme movements do not appear 'out of nowhere'; they are presaged by larger movements than usual. This is termed [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]]. Whether such large movements have the same direction, or the opposite, is more difficult to say. And an increase in volatility does not always presage a further increase\u2014the volatility may simply go back down again.\n\nNot only the volatility depends on the period when it is measured but also on the selected time resolution. The effect is observed due to the fact that the information flow between short-term and long-term traders is asymmetric. As a result, volatility measured with high resolution contains information that is not covered by low resolution volatility and vice versa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muller|first=Ulrich A.|last2=Dacorogna|first2=Michel|last3=Dave|first3=Rakhal D.|last4=Olsen|first4=Richard|last5=Pictet|first5=Olivier V.|last6=von Weizs\u00e4cker|first6=Jakob|date=1997|title=Volatilities of different time resolutions -- Analyzing the dynamics of market components|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeempfin/v_3a4_3ay_3a1997_3ai_3a2-3_3ap_3a213-239.htm|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=4|issue=2-3|pages=213\u2013239|issn=0927-5398}}</ref>\n\nThe risk parity weighted volatility of the three assets Gold, Treasury bonds and Nasdaq acting as proxy for the Marketportfolio seems to have a low point at 4% after turning upwards for the 8th time since 1974 at this reading in the summer of 2014.\n\n== Alternative measures of volatility ==\nSome authors point out that realized volatility and implied volatility are backward and forward looking measures, and do not reflect current volatility.

Suppose you notice that a market price index, which has a current value near 10,000, has moved about 100 points a day, on average, for many days.  This would constitute a 1% daily movement, up or down.\n\nTo annualize this, you can use the \"rule of 16\", that is, multiply by 16 to get 16% as the annual volatility.  The rationale for this is that 16 is the square root of 256, which is approximately the number of trading days in a year (252). This also uses the fact that the standard deviation of the sum of ''n'' independent variables (with equal standard deviations) is \u221an times the standard deviation of the individual variables.\n\nThe average magnitude of the observations is merely an approximation of the standard deviation of the market index. Assuming that the market index daily changes are normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation&nbsp;''\u03c3'', the expected value of the [[Absolute deviation|magnitude of the observations]] is \u221a(2/{{pi}})''\u03c3'' =&nbsp;0.798''\u03c3''.

He is an expert in [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]] (HCV) infection and treatment, and in 2016, was the first physician to treat a patient in the [[United States]] with [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[Phage therapy|bacteriophage therapy]] for a systemic [[bacterial infection]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2017-04-25-novel-phage-therapy-saves-patient-with-multidrug-resistant-bacterial-infection.aspx |title=Novel Phage Therapy Saves Patient with Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infection |last=UC San Diego Health |first=Newsroom |date=April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524021018/https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/pages/2017-04-25-novel-phage-therapy-saves-patient-with-multidrug-resistant-bacterial-infection.aspx |archive-date=May 24, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early career ===\nAfter graduating from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] in 1974, Schooley pursued fellowships in infectious disease at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]]. He then focused his research on immunopathogenesis of [[Herpesviridae|herpesvirus]] infections in [[immunocompromised]] patients. In 1981, Schooley joined the faculty at [[Harvard Medical School]] as an associate professor, where he also shifted his research focus to [[HIV/AIDS]]. At this time, the first AIDS cases were identified in [[Boston]]. Schooley's research group in Boston, was one of the first groups to describe the [[Humoral immunity|humoral]] and [[Cellular immune response|cellular immune]] responses to HIV infection and he became heavily involved in the field of [[antiretroviral]] chemotherapy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=BD |date=July 1987 |title=HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in seropositive individuals |journal=Nature |volume=328 |issue=6128 |pages=345\u2013348 |doi=10.1038/328345a0 |pmid=3496541 |bibcode=1987Natur.328..345W}}</ref>\n\n=== HIV research ===\nIn 1990, Schooley was recruited as the head of the Division of Infectious Diseases for the Health Sciences Center at the [[University of Colorado]], and director of the Colorado Center for AIDS Research. While at Colorado, he served as the Chair of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases|NIAID]]\u2019s [[AIDS Clinical Trials Group]] (ACTG) which he headed from 1995\u20132002. At this time, ACTG had an annual budget of over $100&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]]. During his time as Group Chair, the ACTG expanded to include global research sites throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, South Asia and Africa, and is now the largest and most productive multinational clinical and translational research group focusing on the pathogenesis and therapy of HIV and its complications.\n\nIn 2005, he was recruited to the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, where he was the Head of the Division of Infectious Disease until 2017, and currently serves as the Vice Chair of Academic Affairs in the Department of Medicine, Senior Director of International Initiatives, and Co-Director of the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics.\n\n=== Experience with phage therapy ===\nIn 2016, while serving as the Head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, Schooley was approached by his colleague, [[Steffanie A. Strathdee|Dr. Steffanie Strathdee]], to help save her husband's life by using [[bacteriophage]]s (phages). Strathdee's husband, Dr. Tom Patterson, was suffering from a life-threatening [[Multiple drug resistance|multi-drug resistant]] ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' infection, that he had acquired while on vacation in [[Egypt]]. Schooley, acting as the primary infectious disease physician, along with Strathdee and a team of researchers and physicians from [[Texas A&M University]], [http://www.aphage.com/ Adaptive Phage Therapeutics], the [[Navy|US Navy]], UC San Diego School of Medicine, and [[San Diego State University]], worked together to source, purify and administer phages that were active against the strain of bacteria with which Patterson was infected. Schooley was responsible for successfully navigating the [[Food and Drug Administration]]'s emergency [[Investigational New Drug|investigational new drug]] process, to obtain approval to administer the experimental therapy. After multiple phage cocktail administrations, provided from the partnering laboratories and companies, Patterson was cured of his infection and eventually made a full recovery.
