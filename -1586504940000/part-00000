Pastor, p. 146</ref>\n\n*'''Curial group''' \u2013 it included two factions of curial Cardinals: ''Anziani'' \u2013 the small party of the Cardinals created by [[Pope Clement XII]] with his [[Cardinal-nephew]] [[Neri Maria Corsini]] as leader; and ''Zelanti'' \u2013 the group of the conservative Cardinals, headed by Cardinal [[Giuseppe Spinelli]],<ref name=Adams/> who generally opposed any secular influence on the Church.\n*'''Union of Crowns''' \u2013 it included representatives and allies of the Catholic courts. The interests of [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] were represented by Portocarrero, those of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles V of Sicily/Charles VII of Naples]] \u2013 by Orsini, and those of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her consort [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]] by Alessandro Albani (also protector of Sardinia) and von Rodt. The French faction was leaderless at the time of death of Benedict XIV, because Cardinal-protector of France [[Pierre Gu\u00e9rin de Tencin]] died on March 2, 1758. King [[Louis XV of France]] appointed Cardinal [[Prospero Colonna di Sciarra]] as his successor, but this nomination became publicly known only on June 9, almost a month after the beginning of the conclave.\n\nMany cardinals created by Benedict XIV (called \"Juniors\") did not belong to any faction, but majority of them aligned themselves with \"Union of Crowns\", particularly with Spanish protector Portocarrero.\n\nDuring the conclave, however, these two groups mixed with each other. Near the end of the conclave, on the one side there was the Imperial faction together with ''Zelanti'', and on the other side ''Anziani'', together with the Bourbon faction (defending the interests of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] crowns).\n\nBecause of the absence of the political representatives of the main Catholic courts the ambassadors of France and the Empire asked the electors for delay voting until their arrival. This demand was rejected before the conclave began.\n\n===The beginning and the early candidates===\nOnly twenty-seven cardinals entered the conclave on May 15.<ref>L. Pastor, p. 149</ref> Eighteen more cardinals arrived in Rome by June 29. Meantime, however, Cardinal Bardi had to leave the conclave due to illness.\n\nNo serious candidates were proposed in the early ballots. In the first scrutiny on May 16 the greatest number of votes (eight in the ballot and three more in the ''[[accessus]]'') were received [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]] [[Rainiero d'Elci]], who was 88 years old.<ref>L. Pastor, p. 149-150</ref> It does not mean, however, that no efforts to obtain the support for the candidates were made by the leaders present in the conclave. In particular Corsini worked vigorously for the election of [[Giuseppe Spinelli]], leader of the ''Zelanti'', but met with the strong opposition of Orsini, Cardinal Protector of the Kingdom of Naples. The protector of Spain, Portocarrero, also rejected Spinelli, and was able to join many of the \"Juniors\" to his party. Finally, the candidature of Spinelli had to be withdrawn.{{sfn|Pastor|p=150}}\n\nThe first candidate with serious chances for election was [[Alberico Archinto]], Secretary of State and Vice-Chancellor of the deceased pope. He had a strong support both among ''Zelanti'' and some of the \"Crown-Cardinals\", but the faction of Corsini did not agree to support him and produced as counter-candidate [[Marcello Crescenzi]]. Eventually, as had occurred many times before and later, the candidatures of Archinto and Crescenzi eliminated each other.{{sfn|Pastor|p=150}}\n\n===The arrival of the French cardinals and their exclusion against Cavalchini===\nGradually, the representatives of royal courts arrived in Rome with instructions from their monarchs. On June 4 entered Cardinal Luynes with the instructions of [[Louis XV of France]]. Five days later he officially announced the nomination of Cardinal Prospero Colonna di Sciarra to the post of Protector of France.<ref>L. Pastor, p. 151</ref> But the Imperial Cardinal von Rodt was still awaited.\n\nDuring the next days the new candidate [[Carlo Alberto Guidobono Cavalchini]],   received still more votes, promoted by Corsini and Portocarrero working together. On June 19 he obtained twenty-one votes, on June 21 twenty-six, and in the evening of June 22 as many as twenty-eight out of forty-three, which meant that he was only one vote short of being elected. But after that ballot Cardinal Luynes informed the [[Dean of the Sacred College]] Rainiero d\u2019Elci of the [[Jus exclusivae|official veto]] of the King of France against Cavalchini. France opposed Cavalchini because of his support of the beatification of [[Robert Bellarmine]] and in the matters connected with the anti-[[Jansenism|Jansenist]] bull ''[[Unigenitus]]''.<ref>L. Pastor, p. 152-153</ref> The exclusion met with strong protests, but Cavalchini himself said, \"It is a manifest proof that God deems me unworthy to fill the functions of his vicar upon earth\".<ref name=\"Lib\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.saint-mike.org/Library/Papal_Library/ClementXIII/Biography.html |title=Papal Library |access-date=2008-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007143401/http://www.saint-mike.org/Library/Papal_Library/ClementXIII/biography.html |archive-date=2008-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter the collapse of Cavalchini's candidacy, Portocarrero advanced as a new candidate Paolucci, but he was rejected by French, who \u2013 together with the faction of Corsini, voted again for Crescenzi.<ref>L. Pastor, p. 154-155</ref>\n\n===The arrival of Cardinal von Rodt===\nThe arrival of Cardinal von Rodt on June 29 with the instructions of the Imperial Court was the turning point of the conclave. He initially tried to achieve an agreement with the French, but having failed, he turned toward the ''Zelanti'' faction. Direct negotiations between von Rodt and Spinelli resulted in the proposal for election of the Venetian Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of [[Padua]]. On July 6 in the morning the bishop of Padua received eight votes in the ballot and four additional in the ''[[accessus]]''. Portocarrero, Albani and the French cardinals initially opposed, but finally agreed for him. After the consultations of French Cardinals with ambassador Laon it became clear that Rezzonico would be elected to the [[Papacy]].<ref>L. Pastor, p. 155</ref>\n\n==The election of Pope Clement XIII==\nOn July 6 in the evening '''Carlo Rezzonico''' was elected [[Pope]], receiving thirty-one votes out of forty-four, one more than the required majority of two-thirds. The remaining thirteen (including his own) fell to Cardinal Dean [[Rainiero d'Elci]].<ref name=\"Lib\"/> Rezzonico accepted his election and took the name of [[Clement XIII]], in honour of [[Pope Clement XII]], who had elevated him to the cardinalate in 1737.<ref>L.

He initially tried to achieve an agreement with the French, but having failed, he turned toward the ''Zelanti'' faction. Direct negotiations between von Rodt and Spinelli resulted in the proposal for election of the Venetian Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico, bishop of [[Padua]]. On July 6 in the morning the bishop of Padua received eight votes in the ballot and four additional in the ''[[accessus]]''. Portocarrero, Albani and the French cardinals initially opposed, but finally agreed for him. After the consultations of French Cardinals with ambassador Laon it became clear that Rezzonico would be elected to the [[Papacy]].<ref>L.

In 2018, the city's estimated population was 73,964. Flagstaff's combined metropolitan area has an estimated population of 139,097.\n\nFlagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and within the [[San Francisco volcanic field]], along the western side of the largest contiguous [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] forest in the continental United States. The city sits at around {{convert|7000|ft}} and is next to [[Mount Elden]], just south of the [[San Francisco Peaks]], the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. [[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}, is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Flagstaff in [[Kachina Peaks Wilderness]]. The geology of the Flagstaff area includes exposed rock from the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] eras, with [[Moenkopi Formation]] red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The Rio de Flag river runs through the city.\n\nOriginally settled by the [[pre-Columbian]] native [[Sinagua]] people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. The early economy was based on the [[lumber]], railroad, and [[ranching]] industries, and was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. It was also selected as the location for the [[Lowell Observatory]] due to its altitude, from which [[Pluto]] was discovered. The Riordans and Babbitts lobbied for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff; though it brought [[Okie]]s to the city during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Route 66 also presented funding opportunities that ultimately improved the economy in the early 1930s. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose [[Moon landing]] sites for the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]]. Through the 1970s and '80s, downtown fell into disrepair, but was revitalized with a major cultural heritage project in the 1990s.\n\nThe city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as [[Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare]], and is home to the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] Flagstaff Station, and [[Northern Arizona University]]. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Oak Creek Canyon]], the [[Arizona Snowbowl]], [[Meteor Crater]], and [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona#Historic Route 66|Historic Route 66]].\n\n==History==\n=== Early settlements ===\n{{main|Sinagua|Tonto Apache|Yavapai}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Elden Pueblo, 1926.jpg\n| caption1 = Elden Pueblo ruins in 1926\n| image2 = Wukoki Ruin.tif\n| caption2 = Wukoki ruins in 2008\n| image3 = Walnut Canyon National Monument 2015 026.jpg\n| caption3 = Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon in 2015\n| header = Different forms of pre-Columbian structures in the Flagstaff area\n| alt1 = Black and white stone structure in front of trees\n| alt2 = Stone pueblo on shrubland\n| alt3 = Stone structure on side of rockface\n}}\nThe [[Sinagua]] people{{efn|Coined later from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"without water\" ([[wikt:sin#Spanish|sin]] and [[wikt:agua#Spanish|agua]]).<ref name=linoff>{{cite web|last1=Linoff|first1=Lindsay|title=The Sinagua People of Montezuma Castle|url=http://www.mesacc.edu/~thoqh49081/StudentPapers/sinagua.html|publisher=Mesa Community College|accessdate=17 November 2015|date=1998}}</ref>}} were a [[pre-Columbian]] culture that occupied a large area in Arizona from the [[Little Colorado River]], near Flagstaff, to the [[Verde River]], near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], including the [[Verde Valley]], area around the [[San Francisco Peaks]], and significant portions of the [[Mogollon Rim]] country,<ref name=logan>{{cite web|title=Sinagua|url=https://www.beloit.edu/logan_online/exhibitions/virtual_exhibitions/north_america/southwest/sinagua/sinagua.php|website=Logan Museum of Anthropology|publisher=Beloit College}}</ref><ref name=nau>{{cite web|title=The Sinagua|url=http://www2.nau.edu/d-antlab/Soutwestern%20Arch/Sinagua/sinagua.htm|publisher=Anthropology Laboratories of Northern Arizona University|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref> between approximately 500 [[Common Era|CE]] and 1425 CE.<ref name=gibbon>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gibbon|editor1-first=Guy|title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia|date=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/770 770]|isbn=978-0815307259|url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/770}}</ref> Christian E.

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 1928 the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]] opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the [[Okie|unemployed workers]] traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food.<ref name=\":8\" /> Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s 1930 discovery of [[Pluto]] from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL).<ref name=\"USNO\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931\u201332, a rumor that California had closed its borders to [[Midwestern United States|Mid West]] migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.

In 2018, the city's estimated population was 73,964. Flagstaff's combined metropolitan area has an estimated population of 139,097.\n\nFlagstaff lies near the southwestern edge of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and within the [[San Francisco volcanic field]], along the western side of the largest contiguous [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] forest in the continental United States. The city sits at around {{convert|7000|ft}} and is next to [[Mount Elden]], just south of the [[San Francisco Peaks]], the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona. [[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}, is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Flagstaff in [[Kachina Peaks Wilderness]]. The geology of the Flagstaff area includes exposed rock from the [[Mesozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] eras, with [[Moenkopi Formation]] red sandstone having once been quarried in the city; many of the historic downtown buildings were constructed with it. The Rio de Flag river runs through the city.\n\nOriginally settled by the [[pre-Columbian]] native [[Sinagua]] people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. The early economy was based on the [[lumber]], railroad, and [[ranching]] industries, and was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. It was also selected as the location for the [[Lowell Observatory]] due to its altitude, from which [[Pluto]] was discovered. The Riordans and Babbitts lobbied for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff; though it brought [[Okie]]s to the city during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Route 66 also presented funding opportunities that ultimately improved the economy in the early 1930s. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose [[Moon landing]] sites for the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]]. Through the 1970s and '80s, downtown fell into disrepair, but was revitalized with a major cultural heritage project in the 1990s.\n\nThe city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as [[Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare]], and is home to the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|U.S. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] Flagstaff Station, and [[Northern Arizona University]]. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Oak Creek Canyon]], the [[Arizona Snowbowl]], [[Meteor Crater]], and [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona#Historic Route 66|Historic Route 66]].\n\n==History==\n=== Early settlements ===\n{{main|Sinagua|Tonto Apache|Yavapai}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| align = left\n| total_width = 250\n| image1 = Elden Pueblo, 1926.jpg\n| caption1 = Elden Pueblo ruins in 1926\n| image2 = Wukoki Ruin.tif\n| caption2 = Wukoki ruins in 2008\n| image3 = Walnut Canyon National Monument 2015 026.jpg\n| caption3 = Cliff dwellings at Walnut Canyon in 2015\n| header = Different forms of pre-Columbian structures in the Flagstaff area\n| alt1 = Black and white stone structure in front of trees\n| alt2 = Stone pueblo on shrubland\n| alt3 = Stone structure on side of rockface\n}}\nThe [[Sinagua]] people{{efn|Coined later from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"without water\" ([[wikt:sin#Spanish|sin]] and [[wikt:agua#Spanish|agua]]).<ref name=linoff>{{cite web|last1=Linoff|first1=Lindsay|title=The Sinagua People of Montezuma Castle|url=http://www.mesacc.edu/~thoqh49081/StudentPapers/sinagua.html|publisher=Mesa Community College|accessdate=17 November 2015|date=1998}}</ref>}} were a [[pre-Columbian]] culture that occupied a large area in Arizona from the [[Little Colorado River]], near Flagstaff, to the [[Verde River]], near [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], including the [[Verde Valley]], area around the [[San Francisco Peaks]], and significant portions of the [[Mogollon Rim]] country,<ref name=logan>{{cite web|title=Sinagua|url=https://www.beloit.edu/logan_online/exhibitions/virtual_exhibitions/north_america/southwest/sinagua/sinagua.php|website=Logan Museum of Anthropology|publisher=Beloit College}}</ref><ref name=nau>{{cite web|title=The Sinagua|url=http://www2.nau.edu/d-antlab/Soutwestern%20Arch/Sinagua/sinagua.htm|publisher=Anthropology Laboratories of Northern Arizona University|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref> between approximately 500 [[Common Era|CE]] and 1425 CE.<ref name=gibbon>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gibbon|editor1-first=Guy|title=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia|date=1998|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/770 770]|isbn=978-0815307259|url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofpre0000unse/page/770}}</ref> Christian E.

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 1928 the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]] opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the [[Okie|unemployed workers]] traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food.<ref name=\":8\" /> Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s 1930 discovery of [[Pluto]] from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL).<ref name=\"USNO\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931\u201332, a rumor that California had closed its borders to [[Midwestern United States|Mid West]] migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.

The oldest rock types of the area are part of North America's original crust, [[Precambrian]] [[granite]] and [[schist]] from 1.7 to 1.8 billion years ago. On top of this is [[Paleozoic]] [[sandstone]], limestone, [[shale]] and [[siltstone]] deposited on what was then (544 to 248 million years ago) different surfaces, including a shallow seabed, muddy land, and sandy desert. The rock layers from this period are (bottom to top): [[Tapeats Sandstone]], [[Bright Angel Shale]] and [[Muav Limestone]], [[Martin Formation]], [[Redwall Limestone]], [[Supai Group]], [[Coconino Sandstone]], [[Toroweap Formation]], and [[Kaibab Limestone]]. The last three of these are still exposed. On top of the Paleozoic rock is [[Mesozoic]] Moenkopi Formation, from 248 to 65 million years ago. Other Mesozoic layers formed on top of this, but were eroded away.

Around Flagstaff more specifically, this process deformed flat rock layers into folds, and allowed surface rivers to cut deep canyons in the younger rock layers. From about 25 million years ago, more [[Fault (geology)|faults]] were broken again in Flagstaff, and volcanic activity began about 6 million years ago with [[magma]] flowing up these faults to create [[Lava|lava flows]].

The stratovolcano is predominantly formed of [[andesite]]; stratovolcanoes are more commonly found in [[Ring of Fire|highly volatile areas around the Pacific]]. It contains various features of glaciation. Mount Elden is a [[lava dome]] made of [[dacite]]. Sunset Crater and [[S P Crater]] are much geologically younger and have not been weathered very much; Sunset Crater is the youngest feature of the San Francisco volcanic field and formed in the last 1,000 years. S P Crater was formed between 75,000 and 70,000 years ago by piles of [[lapilli]] and [[volcanic bombs]] spouting from a [[lava lake]], while Sunset Crater's formation was an [[explosive eruption]].<ref name=\":23\" /> \n\nMoenkopi Formation red sandstone is a distinctive feature of Flagstaff, as it was used as a building material from the 1880s because of its fire retardant properties. The source used for quarrying most of this rock was a deposit 1 mile east of the town, which fell under the control of Charles Begg in 1887, who then began selling the stone across the southwest \u2013 after he made a successful sale in California that expanded the business, he was replaced in 1888 by a master quarryman. While it was used as building material across the West, some of Flagstaff's most prominent buildings are famous for the stone, including the Bank Hotel,<ref name=\":22\" /> Weatherford Hotel, Babbitt Brothers Building, Coconino County Courthouse,<ref name=\"themetown\" /> and various NAU buildings, including Old Main.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\nIn the 1960s, the geology of the Flagstaff area, including formations like Meteor Crater, was seen as similar to environments that would be encountered on the Moon in terms of [[planetary geology]].

The family gained a period of relatively independent governance during the regency of Peryanayaki Nachiar, who acted on behalf of her underage son, Irudalaya Marudappa Taver, after the death of his father in 1850.
