A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the afternoon seder, the yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the afternoon seder, the yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

One of the most prominent American poets of her generation, she has won many major literary awards in the United States, including the [[National Humanities Medal]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]], [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]], [[National Book Critics Circle Award]], and [[Bollingen Prize]], among others. From 2003 to 2004, she was [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate of the United States]]. Gl\u00fcck is often described as an autobiographical poet; her work is known for its emotional intensity and for frequently drawing on myth, history, or nature to meditate on personal experiences and modern life. \n\nGl\u00fcck was born in New York City and raised on New York's [[Long Island]]. She began to suffer from [[anorexia nervosa]] while in high school and later overcame the illness. She took classes at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[Columbia University]] but did not obtain a degree. In addition to her career as an author, she has had a career in academia as a teacher of poetry at several institutions.\n\nIn her work, Gl\u00fcck has focused on illuminating aspects of trauma, desire, and nature. In exploring these broad themes, her poetry has become known for its frank expressions of sadness and isolation. Scholars have also focused on her construction of poetic personas and the relationship, in her poems, between autobiography and classical myth.\n\nCurrently, Gl\u00fcck is an [[adjunct professor]] and Rosenkranz Writer in Residence at [[Yale University]]. She lives in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/author/|title=Louise Gl\u00fcck {{!}} Authors {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nLouise Gl\u00fcck was born in New York City on April 22, 1943.

A few months later, she was taken out of school in order to focus on her rehabilitation, although she still graduated in 1961.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://achievement.org/achiever/louise-gluck/|title=Louise Gl\u00fcck|website=Academy of Achievement|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Of that decision, she has written, \"I understood that at some point I was going to die.

The poet [[Craig Morgan Teicher]] has described her as a writer for whom \"words are always scarce, hard won, and not to be wasted\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Teicher|first=Craig Morgan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/books/review/a-little-book-on-form-robert-hass-american-originality-louise-gluck.html|title=Deep Dives Into How Poetry Works (and Why You Should Care)|date=2017-08-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The scholar Laura Quinney has argued that her careful use of words has put Gl\u00fcck into \"the line of American poets who value fierce lyric compression,\" from [[Emily Dickinson]] to [[Elizabeth Bishop]].<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v27/n14/laura-quinney/like-dolls-with-their-heads-cut-off|title=Laura Quinney \u00b7 Like Dolls with Their Heads Cut Off: Louise Gl\u00fcck \u00b7 LRB 21 July 2005|last=Quinney|first=Laura|date=2005-07-21|website=London Review of Books|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Gl\u00fcck's poems rarely use rhyme, instead relying on repetition, [[enjambment]], and other techniques to achieve rhythm. \n\nAmong scholars and reviewers, there has been discussion as to whether Gl\u00fcck is properly assessed as a [[Confessional poetry|confessional poet]], owing to the prevalence of the first-person mode in her poems and their intimate subject matter, often inspired by events in Gl\u00fcck's personal life. The scholar Robert Baker has argued that Gl\u00fcck \"is surely a confessional poet in some basic sense,\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Robert|date=2018-06-01|title=Versions of Ascesis in Louise Gl\u00fcck\u2019s Poetry|url=https://academic.oup.com/camqtly/article/47/2/131/5026611|journal=The Cambridge Quarterly|language=en|volume=47|issue=2|pages=131\u2013154|doi=10.1093/camqtly/bfy011|issn=0008-199X}}</ref> while the critic Michael Robbins has argued that Gl\u00fcck's poetry, unlike that of confessional poets [[Sylvia Plath]] or [[John Berryman]], \"depends upon the fiction of privacy\".<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-constant-gardener-on-louise-gluck/|title=The Constant Gardener: On Louise Gl\u00fcck|last=Robbins|first=Michael|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> In other words, she cannot be a confessional poet, Robbins argues, if she does not address an audience. Going further, Quinney argues that, to Gl\u00fcck, the confessional poem is \"odious\".<ref name=\":9\" /> Others have noted that Gl\u00fcck's poems can be viewed as autobiographical, while her technique of using mythology and inhabiting various personas renders her poems more than mere confessions. As the scholar [[Helen Vendler]] has noted: \"In their obliquity and reserve, [Gl\u00fcck's poems] offer an alternative to first-person 'confession', while remaining indisputably personal\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vendler|first=Helen|title=Part of Nature, Part of Us: Modern American Poets|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1980|isbn=9780674654761|location=Cambridge|pages=311}}</ref>\n\n=== Themes ===\nWhile Gl\u00fcck's work is thematically diverse, scholars and critics have identified several themes that are paramount. Most prominently, Gl\u00fcck's poetry can be said to be focused on '''trauma''', as she has written throughout her career about death, loss, rejection, the failure of relationships, and attempts at healing and renewal. The scholar Daniel Morris notes that even a Gl\u00fcck poem that uses traditionally happy or idyllic imagery \"suggests the author's awareness of mortality, of the loss of innocence\".<ref name=\":6\" /> The scholar Joanne Feit Diehl echoes this notion when she argues that \"this 'sense of an ending'\u2026infuses Gl\u00fcck's poems with their retrospective power,\" pointing to her transformation of common objects, such as a baby stroller, into representations of loneliness and loss.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=0472114794|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=6-7}}</ref> Yet, for Gl\u00fcck, trauma is arguably a gateway to a greater appreciation of life, a concept perhaps most obviously explored in ''The Triumph of Achilles''. The triumph to which the title alludes is Achilles' acceptance of mortality\u2014which enables him to become a more fully realized human being.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2012/01/the-ambivalence-of-being-in-glucks-the-triumph-of-achilles-opening-the-box-opening-the-book-opening-the-self-what-ofte.html|title=\"The Ambivalence of Being in Gluck\u2019s The Triumph of Achilles\" [by Caroline Malone]|website=The Best American Poetry|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship between the opposing forces of life and death in Gl\u00fcck's work points to another of her common themes: '''desire'''. Gl\u00fcck has often written explicitly about many forms of desire\u2014for example, the desire for love and attention, for insight, or for the ability to convey truth\u2014but her approach to desire is marked by ambivalence. Morris argues that Gl\u00fcck's poems, which often adopt contradictory points of view, reflect \"her own ambivalent relationship to status, power, morality, gender, and, most of all, language\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73}}</ref> The author Robert Boyer has characterized Gl\u00fcck's ambivalence toward desire as a result of \"strenuous self-interrogation\". He argues that \"Gl\u00fcck's poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection\u2026for a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Boyers|first=Robert|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/writing-without-mattress-louise-glueck/|title=Writing Without a Mattress: On Louise Gl\u00fcck|date=2012-11-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2020-04-07|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref> The tension between competing desires in Gl\u00fcck's work manifests both in her assumption of different personas from poem to poem and in her varied approach to each collection of her poems. This has led the poet and scholar [[James Longenbach]] to declare that \"change is Louise Gl\u00fcck's highest value\" and \"if change is what she most craves, it is also what she most resists, what is most difficult for her, most hard-won\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LONGENBACH|first=JAMES|date=1999|title=Louise Gl\u00fcck's Nine Lives|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/43472558|journal=Southwest Review|volume=84|issue=2|pages=184\u2013198|issn=0038-4712}}</ref> \n\nAnother of Gl\u00fcck's poetic preoccupations is '''nature''', the setting for many of her poems. Famously, in ''The Wild Iris'', the poems take place in a garden where flowers have intelligent, emotive voices. However, Morris points out that ''The House on Marshland'' is also concerned with nature and can be read as a revision of the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] tradition of nature poetry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref> In ''Ararat'', too, \"flowers become a language of mourning,\" useful for both commemoration and competition among mourners to determine the \"ownership of nature as a meaningful system of symbolism\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}</ref> Thus, in Gl\u00fcck's work nature is both something to be regarded critically and embraced. As the author and critic [[Alan Williams (novelist)|Alan Williamson]] has pointed out, it can also sometimes suggest the divine, as when, in the poem \"Celestial Music,\" the speaker states that \"when you love the world you hear celestial music,\" or when, in ''The Wild Iris'', the deity speaks through changes in weather.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Williamson, Alan|first=|title=On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=65-66|chapter=Splendor and Mistrust}}</ref>\n\nThematically, Gl\u00fcck's poetry is also notable for what it avoids. Morris argues that \"Gl\u00fcck's writing most often evades ethnic identification, religious classification, or gendered affiliation. In fact, her poetry often negates critical assessments that affirm identity politics as criteria for literary evaluation. She resists canonization as a hyphenated poet (that is, as a \"Jewish-American\" poet, or a \"feminist\" poet, or a \"nature\" poet), preferring instead to retain an aura of iconoclasm, or in-betweenness\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Influences ===\nGl\u00fcck has pointed to the influence of [[psychoanalysis]] on her work, as well as her early learning in ancient legends, parables, and mythology. In addition, she has credited the influence of L\u00e9onie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Scholars and critics have pointed to the literary influence on her work of [[Robert Lowell]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.literarymatters.org/10-1-sounding-lowell-louise-gluck-and-derek-walcott/|title=Sounding Lowell: Louise Gl\u00fcck and Derek Walcott|last=Gargaillo, Florian|first=|date=2017-09-29|website=Literary Matters|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> [[Rainer Maria Rilke]],<ref name=\":10\" /> and Emily Dickinson,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Diehl|first=Joanne Feit|title=On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=13, 20|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> among others.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|viaf=84538845 }}\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Firstborn'' (The New American Library, 1968)\n*''The House on Marshland'' (The Ecco Press, 1975) ISBN 978-0912946184\n*''Descending Figure'' (The Ecco Press, 1980) ISBN 978-0912946719\n*''The Triumph of Achilles'' (The Ecco Press, 1985) ISBN 978-0880010818\n*''Ararat'' (The Ecco Press, 1990) ISBN 978-0880012478\n*''[[The Wild Iris]]'' (The Ecco Press, 1992) ISBN 978-0880012812\n*''The First Four Books of Poems'' (The Ecco Press, 1995) ISBN 978-0880014212\n*''[[Meadowlands (1997)|Meadowlands]]'' (The Ecco Press, 1997) ISBN 978-0880014526\n*''Vita Nova'' (The Ecco Press, 1999) ISBN 978-0880016346\n*''The Seven Ages'' (The Ecco Press, 2001) ISBN 978-0060185268\n*''[[Averno (poetry)|Averno]]'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2006) ISBN 978-0374107420\n*''A Village Life'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2009) ISBN 978-0374283742\n*''Poems: 1962-2012'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2012) ISBN 978-0374126087\n*''Faithful and Virtuous Night'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2014) ISBN 978-0374152017\n\n=== Chapbooks ===\n\n* ''The Garden'' (Antaeus Editions, 1976)\n* ''October'' (Sarabande Books, 2004) ISBN 978-1932511000\n\n===Prose collections===\n\n*''Proofs and Theories: Essays on Poetry'' (The Ecco Press, 1994) ISBN 978-0880014427\n*''American Originality: Essays on Poetry'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2017) ISBN 978-0374299552\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Burnside, John, ''The Music of Time: Poetry in the Twentieth Century'', London: Profile Books, 2019.\n* Dodd, Elizabeth, ''The Veiled Mirror and the Woman Poet: H.D., Louise Bogan, Elizabeth Bishop, and Louise Gl\u00fcck'', Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1992.\n* Doreski, William, ''The Modern Voice in American Poetry'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1995.\n* Feit Diehl, Joanne, editor, ''On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See'', Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2005.\n* Gosmann, Uta, ''Poetic Memory: The Forgotten Self in Plath, Howe, Hinsey, and Gl\u00fcck'', Madison: Farleigh Dickinson University Press, 2011.\n* Morris, Daniel, ''The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction'', Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2006.\n* Upton, Lee, ''The Muse of Abandonment: Origin, Identity, Mastery in Five American Poets'', Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1998.\n* Vendler, Helen, ''Part of Nature, Part of Us: Modern American Poets'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://thefloatinglibrary.com/averno/ Full text of ''Averno'' available at The Floating Library]\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/gluck/ Louise Gl\u00fcck: Online Resources from the Library of Congress]\n* [http://english.yale.edu/people/adjunct-professors-and-senior-lecturers-creative-writers/louise-gluck Yale University English Department Profile of Gl\u00fcck]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413193136/http://www.bu.edu/writing/people/faculty/louise-gluck/ Boston University Creative Writing Department Profile of Gl\u00fcck]\n* [http://poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/82 Louise Gl\u00fcck at poets.org]\n* [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/gluck/gluck.htm Louise Gl\u00fcck: Online Resources from Modern American Poetry, Department of English, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]\n* [http://www.fsgpoetry.com/fsg/2010/04/louise-gl%C3%BCck-in-conversation.html Louise Gl\u00fcck In Conversation]\n* [http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/shortlists/2010-shortlist/louise-gluck/ Griffin Poetry Prize biography]\n* [http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/see-and-hear-poetry/a-g/louise-gluck/ Griffin Poetry Prize reading, including video clip]\n* [http://www.egwald.ca/ubcstudent/poetry/louisegluck.php Louise Gl\u00fcck &mdash;

One of the most prominent American poets of her generation, she has won many major literary awards in the United States, including the [[National Humanities Medal]], [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]], [[National Book Award for Poetry|National Book Award]], [[National Book Critics Circle Award]], and [[Bollingen Prize]], among others. From 2003 to 2004, she was [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate of the United States]]. Gl\u00fcck is often described as an autobiographical poet; her work is known for its emotional intensity and for frequently drawing on myth, history, or nature to meditate on personal experiences and modern life. \n\nGl\u00fcck was born in New York City and raised on New York's [[Long Island]]. She began to suffer from [[anorexia nervosa]] while in high school and later overcame the illness. She took classes at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[Columbia University]] but did not obtain a degree. In addition to her career as an author, she has had a career in academia as a teacher of poetry at several institutions.\n\nIn her work, Gl\u00fcck has focused on illuminating aspects of trauma, desire, and nature. In exploring these broad themes, her poetry has become known for its frank expressions of sadness and isolation. Scholars have also focused on her construction of poetic personas and the relationship, in her poems, between autobiography and classical myth.\n\nCurrently, Gl\u00fcck is an [[adjunct professor]] and Rosenkranz Writer in Residence at [[Yale University]]. She lives in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/author/|title=Louise Gl\u00fcck {{!}} Authors {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nLouise Gl\u00fcck was born in New York City on April 22, 1943.

The poet [[Craig Morgan Teicher]] has described her as a writer for whom \"words are always scarce, hard won, and not to be wasted\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Teicher|first=Craig Morgan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/books/review/a-little-book-on-form-robert-hass-american-originality-louise-gluck.html|title=Deep Dives Into How Poetry Works (and Why You Should Care)|date=2017-08-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The scholar Laura Quinney has argued that her careful use of words has put Gl\u00fcck into \"the line of American poets who value fierce lyric compression,\" from [[Emily Dickinson]] to [[Elizabeth Bishop]].<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v27/n14/laura-quinney/like-dolls-with-their-heads-cut-off|title=Laura Quinney \u00b7 Like Dolls with Their Heads Cut Off: Louise Gl\u00fcck \u00b7 LRB 21 July 2005|last=Quinney|first=Laura|date=2005-07-21|website=London Review of Books|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Gl\u00fcck's poems rarely use rhyme, instead relying on repetition, [[enjambment]], and other techniques to achieve rhythm. \n\nAmong scholars and reviewers, there has been discussion as to whether Gl\u00fcck is properly assessed as a [[Confessional poetry|confessional poet]], owing to the prevalence of the first-person mode in her poems and their intimate subject matter, often inspired by events in Gl\u00fcck's personal life. The scholar Robert Baker has argued that Gl\u00fcck \"is surely a confessional poet in some basic sense,\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=Robert|date=2018-06-01|title=Versions of Ascesis in Louise Gl\u00fcck\u2019s Poetry|url=https://academic.oup.com/camqtly/article/47/2/131/5026611|journal=The Cambridge Quarterly|language=en|volume=47|issue=2|pages=131\u2013154|doi=10.1093/camqtly/bfy011|issn=0008-199X}}</ref> while the critic Michael Robbins has argued that Gl\u00fcck's poetry, unlike that of confessional poets [[Sylvia Plath]] or [[John Berryman]], \"depends upon the fiction of privacy\".<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-constant-gardener-on-louise-gluck/|title=The Constant Gardener: On Louise Gl\u00fcck|last=Robbins|first=Michael|website=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> In other words, she cannot be a confessional poet, Robbins argues, if she does not address an audience. Going further, Quinney argues that, to Gl\u00fcck, the confessional poem is \"odious\".<ref name=\":9\" /> Others have noted that Gl\u00fcck's poems can be viewed as autobiographical, while her technique of using mythology and inhabiting various personas renders her poems more than mere confessions. As the scholar [[Helen Vendler]] has noted: \"In their obliquity and reserve, [Gl\u00fcck's poems] offer an alternative to first-person 'confession', while remaining indisputably personal\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vendler|first=Helen|title=Part of Nature, Part of Us: Modern American Poets|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1980|isbn=9780674654761|location=Cambridge|pages=311}}</ref>\n\n=== Themes ===\nWhile Gl\u00fcck's work is thematically diverse, scholars and critics have identified several themes that are paramount. Most prominently, Gl\u00fcck's poetry can be said to be focused on '''trauma''', as she has written throughout her career about death, loss, rejection, the failure of relationships, and attempts at healing and renewal. The scholar Daniel Morris notes that even a Gl\u00fcck poem that uses traditionally happy or idyllic imagery \"suggests the author's awareness of mortality, of the loss of innocence\".<ref name=\":6\" /> The scholar Joanne Feit Diehl echoes this notion when she argues that \"this 'sense of an ending'\u2026infuses Gl\u00fcck's poems with their retrospective power,\" pointing to her transformation of common objects, such as a baby stroller, into representations of loneliness and loss.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=0472114794|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=6-7}}</ref> Yet, for Gl\u00fcck, trauma is arguably a gateway to a greater appreciation of life, a concept perhaps most obviously explored in ''The Triumph of Achilles''. The triumph to which the title alludes is Achilles' acceptance of mortality\u2014which enables him to become a more fully realized human being.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2012/01/the-ambivalence-of-being-in-glucks-the-triumph-of-achilles-opening-the-box-opening-the-book-opening-the-self-what-ofte.html|title=\"The Ambivalence of Being in Gluck\u2019s The Triumph of Achilles\" [by Caroline Malone]|website=The Best American Poetry|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\nThe relationship between the opposing forces of life and death in Gl\u00fcck's work points to another of her common themes: '''desire'''. Gl\u00fcck has often written explicitly about many forms of desire\u2014for example, the desire for love and attention, for insight, or for the ability to convey truth\u2014but her approach to desire is marked by ambivalence. Morris argues that Gl\u00fcck's poems, which often adopt contradictory points of view, reflect \"her own ambivalent relationship to status, power, morality, gender, and, most of all, language\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=73}}</ref> The author Robert Boyer has characterized Gl\u00fcck's ambivalence toward desire as a result of \"strenuous self-interrogation\". He argues that \"Gl\u00fcck's poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection\u2026for a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Boyers|first=Robert|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/writing-without-mattress-louise-glueck/|title=Writing Without a Mattress: On Louise Gl\u00fcck|date=2012-11-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2020-04-07|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref> The tension between competing desires in Gl\u00fcck's work manifests both in her assumption of different personas from poem to poem and in her varied approach to each collection of her poems. This has led the poet and scholar [[James Longenbach]] to declare that \"change is Louise Gl\u00fcck's highest value\" and \"if change is what she most craves, it is also what she most resists, what is most difficult for her, most hard-won\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=LONGENBACH|first=JAMES|date=1999|title=Louise Gl\u00fcck's Nine Lives|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/43472558|journal=Southwest Review|volume=84|issue=2|pages=184\u2013198|issn=0038-4712}}</ref> \n\nAnother of Gl\u00fcck's poetic preoccupations is '''nature''', the setting for many of her poems. Famously, in ''The Wild Iris'', the poems take place in a garden where flowers have intelligent, emotive voices. However, Morris points out that ''The House on Marshland'' is also concerned with nature and can be read as a revision of the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] tradition of nature poetry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref> In ''Ararat'', too, \"flowers become a language of mourning,\" useful for both commemoration and competition among mourners to determine the \"ownership of nature as a meaningful system of symbolism\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=6}}</ref> Thus, in Gl\u00fcck's work nature is both something to be regarded critically and embraced. As the author and critic [[Alan Williams (novelist)|Alan Williamson]] has pointed out, it can also sometimes suggest the divine, as when, in the poem \"Celestial Music,\" the speaker states that \"when you love the world you hear celestial music,\" or when, in ''The Wild Iris'', the deity speaks through changes in weather.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Williamson, Alan|first=|title=On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=65-66|chapter=Splendor and Mistrust}}</ref>\n\nThematically, Gl\u00fcck's poetry is also notable for what it avoids. Morris argues that \"Gl\u00fcck's writing most often evades ethnic identification, religious classification, or gendered affiliation. In fact, her poetry often negates critical assessments that affirm identity politics as criteria for literary evaluation. She resists canonization as a hyphenated poet (that is, as a \"Jewish-American\" poet, or a \"feminist\" poet, or a \"nature\" poet), preferring instead to retain an aura of iconoclasm, or in-betweenness\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Daniel|title=The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Influences ===\nGl\u00fcck has pointed to the influence of [[psychoanalysis]] on her work, as well as her early learning in ancient legends, parables, and mythology. In addition, she has credited the influence of L\u00e9onie Adams and Stanley Kunitz. Scholars and critics have pointed to the literary influence on her work of [[Robert Lowell]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.literarymatters.org/10-1-sounding-lowell-louise-gluck-and-derek-walcott/|title=Sounding Lowell: Louise Gl\u00fcck and Derek Walcott|last=Gargaillo, Florian|first=|date=2017-09-29|website=Literary Matters|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> [[Rainer Maria Rilke]],<ref name=\":10\" /> and Emily Dickinson,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Diehl|first=Joanne Feit|title=On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Diehl|editor-first=Joanne Feit|location=Ann Arbor|pages=13, 20|chapter=Introduction}}</ref> among others.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|viaf=84538845 }}\n===Poetry collections===\n*''Firstborn'' (The New American Library, 1968)\n*''The House on Marshland'' (The Ecco Press, 1975) ISBN 978-0912946184\n*''Descending Figure'' (The Ecco Press, 1980) ISBN 978-0912946719\n*''The Triumph of Achilles'' (The Ecco Press, 1985) ISBN 978-0880010818\n*''Ararat'' (The Ecco Press, 1990) ISBN 978-0880012478\n*''[[The Wild Iris]]'' (The Ecco Press, 1992) ISBN 978-0880012812\n*''The First Four Books of Poems'' (The Ecco Press, 1995) ISBN 978-0880014212\n*''[[Meadowlands (1997)|Meadowlands]]'' (The Ecco Press, 1997) ISBN 978-0880014526\n*''Vita Nova'' (The Ecco Press, 1999) ISBN 978-0880016346\n*''The Seven Ages'' (The Ecco Press, 2001) ISBN 978-0060185268\n*''[[Averno (poetry)|Averno]]'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2006) ISBN 978-0374107420\n*''A Village Life'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2009) ISBN 978-0374283742\n*''Poems: 1962-2012'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2012) ISBN 978-0374126087\n*''Faithful and Virtuous Night'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2014) ISBN 978-0374152017\n\n=== Chapbooks ===\n\n* ''The Garden'' (Antaeus Editions, 1976)\n* ''October'' (Sarabande Books, 2004) ISBN 978-1932511000\n\n===Prose collections===\n\n*''Proofs and Theories: Essays on Poetry'' (The Ecco Press, 1994) ISBN 978-0880014427\n*''American Originality: Essays on Poetry'' (Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 2017) ISBN 978-0374299552\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Burnside, John, ''The Music of Time: Poetry in the Twentieth Century'', London: Profile Books, 2019.\n* Dodd, Elizabeth, ''The Veiled Mirror and the Woman Poet: H.D., Louise Bogan, Elizabeth Bishop, and Louise Gl\u00fcck'', Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1992.\n* Doreski, William, ''The Modern Voice in American Poetry'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 1995.\n* Feit Diehl, Joanne, editor, ''On Louise Gl\u00fcck: Change What You See'', Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2005.\n* Gosmann, Uta, ''Poetic Memory: The Forgotten Self in Plath, Howe, Hinsey, and Gl\u00fcck'', Madison: Farleigh Dickinson University Press, 2011.\n* Morris, Daniel, ''The Poetry of Louise Gl\u00fcck: A Thematic Introduction'', Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2006.\n* Upton, Lee, ''The Muse of Abandonment: Origin, Identity, Mastery in Five American Poets'', Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1998.\n* Vendler, Helen, ''Part of Nature, Part of Us: Modern American Poets'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://thefloatinglibrary.com/averno/ Full text of ''Averno'' available at The Floating Library]\n* [https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/gluck/ Louise Gl\u00fcck: Online Resources from the Library of Congress]\n* [http://english.yale.edu/people/adjunct-professors-and-senior-lecturers-creative-writers/louise-gluck Yale University English Department Profile of Gl\u00fcck]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413193136/http://www.bu.edu/writing/people/faculty/louise-gluck/ Boston University Creative Writing Department Profile of Gl\u00fcck]\n* [http://poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/82 Louise Gl\u00fcck at poets.org]\n* [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/gluck/gluck.htm Louise Gl\u00fcck: Online Resources from Modern American Poetry, Department of English, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]\n* [http://www.fsgpoetry.com/fsg/2010/04/louise-gl%C3%BCck-in-conversation.html Louise Gl\u00fcck In Conversation]\n* [http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/awards-and-poets/shortlists/2010-shortlist/louise-gluck/ Griffin Poetry Prize biography]\n* [http://www.griffinpoetryprize.com/see-and-hear-poetry/a-g/louise-gluck/ Griffin Poetry Prize reading, including video clip]\n* [http://www.egwald.ca/ubcstudent/poetry/louisegluck.php Louise Gl\u00fcck &mdash;

The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. They believe the men are messengers of [[Ishtar]], their goddess. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of Ishtar. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] skin who is disdained by the others since she has the \"mark of darkness.\"\n\nWhen one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods. He orders their capture and takes the flashlight to control the Mole People, not knowing it is depleted. The archaeologists are then sent to the Eye of Ishtar just as the Mole People rebel. Adad goes to the Eye only to realize it is really natural light coming from the surface and that the men had survived. They then climb to the surface.

Dr. Bentley states that the [[Flood geology|Biblical flood]] is an established archaeological fact, and the stranding of the Sumerians atop the mountain is a reference to the tale of [[Noah's Ark]].\n\nSimilarly to the protagonists of the movie [[Ishtar]] descends to the underworld.<ref name=\"Jastrow\">[[#Reference-Jastrow|Jastrow]]</ref> There is a Panbabylonic connection between Ishtar's descent and the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. The [[descent to the underworld]] is a common story of world mythologies, as is the [[flood myth]].\n\nThe movie erroneously associates Ishtar and the Sumerians. Ishtar was the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] counterpart of the Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]]. The imagery associated with Ishtar in the movie is entirely fictional: Ishtar's symbol was an eight-pointed star representing Venus rather than the uneven chevron in the movie.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |first=Jeremy |last=Black |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0 |pages=156, 169\u2013170 }}</ref> Viewers might also notice that all of the gods depicted on the temple walls are Egyptian, not Sumerian.\n\n[[Adad]] is an Akkadian (male) storm-god, counterpart to the Sumerian Ishkur.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mole Man]] (1961), character from the Marvel Universe\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Mole People (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0049516|title=The Mole People}}\n* {{Amg movie|33053|The Mole People}}\n* [http://www.mst3kinfo.com/aceg/8/803/ep803.html MST3K Episode Guide: The Mole People]\n* [http://www.altfg.com/blog/film-reviews/mole-people-virgil-vogel/ DVD Review of The Mole People]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mole People, The}}\n[[Category:1950s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1956 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Lost world films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Hollow Earth in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000]]\n[[Category:1956 directorial debut films]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the film|possible homeless people living underground|Mole people|Jennifer Toth's book of that name|Jennifer Toth}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2016}}\n{{missing information|the film's production, theatrical and home media releases, and reception|date=April 2016}}\n{{lead too short|date=April 2016}}\n}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = The Mole People\n| image = Mole People.jpg\n| caption = Poster by Joseph Smith\n| writer = [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00f6r\u00f6g (writer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00f6r\u00f6g]]\n| starring = [[John Agar]]<br>[[Hugh Beaumont]]<br>[[Cynthia Patrick]]\n| director = [[Virgil W.

Dr. Bentley states that the [[Flood geology|Biblical flood]] is an established archaeological fact, and the stranding of the Sumerians atop the mountain is a reference to the tale of [[Noah's Ark]].\n\nSimilarly to the protagonists of the movie [[Ishtar]] descends to the underworld.<ref name=\"Jastrow\">[[#Reference-Jastrow|Jastrow]]</ref> There is a Panbabylonic connection between Ishtar's descent and the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. The [[descent to the underworld]] is a common story of world mythologies, as is the [[flood myth]].\n\nThe movie erroneously associates Ishtar and the Sumerians. Ishtar was the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] counterpart of the Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]].

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old man and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref> In July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old man and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.

He is best known for his membership of the duo [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]] with [[Marc Bolan]]. After breaking with Bolan, he concentrated on his own [[Singer-songwriter|singer-songwriting]] activities, variously as a solo artist or as a [[frontman]] for several [[Musical ensemble|bands]].\n\n==Career==\n===Early life (1949-1967) and Tyrannosaurus Rex (1967\u20131969)===\n{{main|T. Rex (band)}}\n\nTook was born Stephen Ross Porter in [[Eltham]], London, on 28 July 1949, and attended [[Shooters Hill Sixth Form College|Shooters Hill School]]. He took his name from the [[hobbit]] [[Peregrin Took]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. At the age of 17, having played drums for some months with a [[mod (subculture)|mod]] band named the Waterproof Sparrows (bass player John Rains), he answered an advert in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' for [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], the electric band that [[Marc Bolan]] was forming following his departure from [[John's Children]]. After one disastrous concert at the Electric Garden in London,<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan and Took reduced the band to a duo, [[busking]] in [[subway (underpass)|subway]]s on acoustic guitar and [[Bongo drum|bongos]], Took having been obliged to sell his full drum kit to pay the rent until paying gigs started to come in.\n\nThe [[Flower power|flower-power]] unit, championed by [[John Peel]] onto the club and stage circuit and thence into the record shops, released three albums and achieved two [[top 40]] hits. Took contributed harmony backing vocals, which are more noticeable in live recordings than on studio recordings, and provided bongos, African drums, [[kazoo]], [[pixiphone]], and Chinese [[gong]]. Took's arrangements contributed to transforming Bolan's music from the straightforward rock 'n roll it had previously been into an exotic brew of musical styles designed to appeal to Bolan's new audience of [[hippie]]s. Towards the end of his time in the band, as Bolan began returning to the electric guitar, Took returned to a full drum set and also contributed some bass guitar parts.<ref name=\"biog2\" />\n\nThe band\u2019s producer [[Tony Visconti]] credited Took with much of the sound and success of Tyrannosaurus Rex. In an interview for the documentary \u201cMarc Bolan: The Final Word\u201d, Visconti opined that \u201cMarc and Steve were a true 50:50 partnership. Steve was a remarkable musician, he could play many instruments. He played percussion, he could pick up a bass or a guitar. He would also sometimes play some cello parts. And then his backing vocals were great too.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn59mHnXNK8 |title=Tony Visconti on Steve Took |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nTook developed his own songwriting and in early 1969, with recording just complete on Tyrannosaurus Rex's third LP, ''Unicorn'', Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform some of his own material; Bolan refused. By this time, their lifestyles were in direct conflict. Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child, while Took was rapidly forging links with \"revolutionary\" underground acts, such as [[The Deviants (band)|The Deviants]] and [[The Pretty Things]]. The relationship was deteriorating badly\u2014Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they \"cordially detested each other\".<ref name=TR2>{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground, 1961\u201371|url=https://archive.org/details/daysinlifevoices00gree|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Took's friendship with Bolan's idol [[Syd Barrett]] had also developed through their shared interests in both [[LSD]] and \"strange musical noises\". [[Mick Farren]], in his memoir ''Give The Anarchist A Cigarette'', recalled that Took would \"drag a bemused Syd Barrett along\" to events in [[Ladbroke Grove]] in the late 1960s; Took remained friends with Barrett well into the 1970s. Took worked with Syd Barrett on unreleased \"Ramadan\" tracks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|first=David|title=Random Precision: Recording the Music of Syd Barrett, 1965\u20131974}}</ref> While in Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took also appeared as a backing vocalist on a session for [[David Bowie]], the results of which can be heard on the BBC sessions album ''[[Bowie at the Beeb]]''.<ref name=\"biog2\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/bowie.html |title=Steve Took'S Musical Associations With David Bowie |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Took donated two of his songs\u2014Three Little Piggies and The Sparrow Is A Sign\u2014to former [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]] and [[The Pretty Things|Pretty Things]] drummer [[Twink (musician)|Twink]]'s 1969 solo album, ''[[Think Pink]]''.<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex\u2014 Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref>\nConsequently, before the first Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of America, Bolan and his management sacked Took. Another contributing factor was an incident at the launch party for the UK edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', where jugs of [[punch (drink)|punch]] prepared for the event were [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|spiked]] with the [[hallucinogen]] [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|STP]]. Took had already earned himself the nickname \"The Phantom Spiker\" (in which he rejoiced) through previous similar pranks.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan was severely affected by the spiked drink and considered Took to be the prime suspect.<ref name=\"biog2\" />\n\nTook was contractually obliged to go on the US tour, but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs. Additionally, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, he drew from the [[shock rock]] style of [[Iggy Pop]]; as Took explained to the [[NME]] in 1972 \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"<ref name=csm>{{cite web|url=http://stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/nme-murray-1972.html|title=New Musical Express (NME) Interview, October 14 1972|website=stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk|accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>  This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took's behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking. Bolan replaced Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], and after [[A Beard Of Stars|one further album]] renamed the duo [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], later expanding to a full band again.<ref name=\"biog2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-2.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER ONE -BEGINNINGS \u2013 (Steve's life up to his departure from Tyrannosaurus Rex in 1969 and the genesis of his songwriting career) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=28 July 1949 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Pink Fairies (1969\u20131970)===\n{{main|Pink Fairies}}\nAfter being sacked by Bolan, Took formed a prototype version of the [[Pink Fairies]] with [[Twink (musician)|Twink]] and [[Mick Farren]], recently ousted from his own band, the Deviants. This band was named in honour of a drinking club of the same name the three had formed earlier that year, along with other leading lights of the underground scene. Together with Twink's girlfriend Silva Darling, they performed what Farren would later describe as \"less of a gig than a protracted harangue\" at the [[University of Manchester]] in October 1969, which rapidly dissolved into chaos. Took appeared prominently on Farren's first solo album ''[[Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus]]'' (recorded December 1969, released 1970). Twink and the other ex-Deviants then formed a new band called the [[Pink Fairies]] (mark 2), without Took or Farren.<ref name=\"biog3\" />\n\n===Shagrat (1970\u20131971)===\n{{main|Shagrat (band)}}\nIn February 1970, Farren and Took headhunted guitarist [[Larry Wallis|Larry (or \"Lazza\") Wallis]] and bassist Tim Taylor from their underground band, the Entire Sioux Nation. A month later, Farren dropped out, leaving Took in the role of bandleader for the first time in his career. With the addition of drummer Phil Lenoir, Shagrat was formed (named after an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orc]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). They recorded three tracks, \"Peppermint Flickstick\", \"Boo! I Said Freeze\" and \"Steel Abortion\", at [[Strawberry Studios]] and played live at the [[Phun City]] festival, before Lenoir and Taylor left. Took and Wallis continued with drummer Dave Bidwell, rehearsing with various bass players and eventually forming an acoustic trio of Took on vocals and guitar, Wallis on [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic bass]] and Bidwell on [[tambourine]]. This line-up recorded a set of (at least) four home demos, \"Amanda\", \"Strange Sister\", \"Still Yawning Stillborn\" and \"Beautiful Deceiver\", at Wallis's father's home studio in [[South London]], which in the 1990s would be paired with the earlier electric studio session for limited edition vinyl release and later a CD album release in 2001.<ref name=\"biog3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-3.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER 2 \u2013 SHAGRAT STORY \u2013 (Steve's part in the formation of the Pink Fairies \u2013 The Band, and how he came to become an outright frontman for his own group) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=26 July 1970 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nWallis would later take over the leadership of the Pink Fairies for their ''Kings of Oblivion'' LP, substantially transforming the sound and style of the band. He and Took would work together again at various intervals in 1972, 1975\u201376 and 1977.<ref name=\"biog5\" /><ref name=\"biog7\" />\n\n===Solo acoustic performer (1971\u20131972)===\nWith Wallis and Bidwell otherwise committed to [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Savoy Brown]] respectively, the acoustic Shagrat was effectively reduced down to just Took himself performing solo on an acoustic guitar, usually sitting on a stool interspersing his songs with jokes and other onstage monologues. In this format, Took made some headway as a live performer. \"Tookie\" appeared in frequent support slots for [[Hawkwind]] and the Pink Fairies, attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live session on Steve Bradshaw's ''Breakthrough'' programme on [[BBC Radio London]].<ref name=\"biog4\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steve-bradshaw.com/radio.html |title=radio |website=Steve-bradshaw.com|accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref> In December 1971, he headlined a three-date mini-tour of southwest England.<ref name=\"flyer\" />\n\nHe also performed at various benefit events, including the \"Nasty Balls\" benefits for the Nasty Tales magazine<ref name=\"flyer\" /> (whose editors, including Farren, were on trial for obscenity) as well as the 1972 [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] festival at [[Aldermaston]],<ref name=\"flyer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/gig-flyer.html |title=Steve Took \u2013 Gig Flyers, Posters & Adverts |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/aldermaston.html |title=Memories of Aldermaston Free Festival \u2013 Interview By Charles Sharr Murray |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> Steve's account of which was reprinted by [[Charles Shaar Murray]] in his book ''Shots From The Hip''.<ref name=\"biog4\" /> Writing for the [[NME]] in 1972, Murray described Took and his stage act thus: \"Most people know who Steve Peregrine Took is, but few people know what he does.

His contributions to these jams were in the role of third drummer, and he also once played bass guitar for the \"Pinks\", substituting for Duncan Sanderson.<ref name=\"biog4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-4.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER 3 \u2013 A ROCK 'N ROLL SINGER WITHOUT A BAND \u2013 (An account of Steve's career as a solo acoustic performer prior to his association with Tony Secunda) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Management of Tony Secunda (1972\u20131973)===\nDuring 1972, Took was approached by [[Tony Secunda]], recently fired as manager for [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], with a view to recovering [[royalties]] owed to Took from the Tyrannosaurus Rex years. Emerging from these conversations, Secunda became Took's manager, with a view to leading him to stardom to spite Bolan. Initially, Took attempted to rerecord as a single the song \"Amanda\" from the 1971 acoustic Shagrat session (along with two other tracks, ''Blind Owl Blues'' and ''Mr Discrete'') with the assistance of the Pink Fairies rhythm section of Sanderson and Russell Hunter, whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of [[Paul Rudolph (musician)|Paul Rudolph]]. During this session, former [[Junior's Eyes (band)|Junior's Eyes]]/[[David Bowie|Bowie]] guitarist Mick Wayne was recruited as guitarist.<ref name=\"biog5\" />\n\nHowever, none of these tracks were ever completed to Took's satisfaction, due to what Wayne later described as \"[[cannabis (drug)|dope]]-induced thinking\" and consequently, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies. (Wayne was quickly supplanted by Wallis, leading to the Kings of Oblivion era as detailed above). Took and Secunda, meanwhile, embarked upon a different approach.<ref name=\"biog5\" />\n\nTook moved into a basement flat beneath Secunda's Mayfair offices, which he set up as a live-in recording studio to demo material at his own ease. The flat rapidly became a magnet for the cream of musicians on the underground scene, who would contribute to the recordings while visiting Took. As well as old colleagues from Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, Secunda reported that Took received visits from [[Syd Barrett]], who at the time was living in Cambridge, but would shortly relocate back to London. From Secunda's account, it would appear likely that Barrett is on the recordings done in the flat by Took and his friends.<ref name=\"biog5\" />\n\nHighlights of the session tapes were eventually released by [[Cleopatra Records]] in 1995, as ''The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex''. A new version of the 1971 acoustic Shagrat song \"Beautiful Deceiver\" is tracklisted on the CD as \"Syd's Wine\" and a credit for guitar and other noises is given to one Crazy Diamond, an allusion to the 1975 Pink Floyd track \"[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]\", written in tribute to Barrett. Stripped down versions of the track \"Syd's Wine\" reveal a second guitarist in the room and audible vocal noises.<ref name=\"biog5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-5.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER 4 \u2013 SECUNDA AND THE REVENGE MASTERPLAN \u2013 (The story of Steve's association with Tony Secunda, the sessions recorded in his basement flat and the 1972 NME interview with Charles Shaar Murray) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=14 October 1972 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Various projects (1973\u20131976)===\nAfter splitting with Secunda, Took worked with a number of Hawkwind members, most notably [[Robert Calvert]], Adrian Wagner,<ref name=\"pen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/penatration.html |title=Penetration Interview By Paul Welsh |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> and [[Nik Turner]].

He is best known for his membership of the duo [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]] with [[Marc Bolan]]. After breaking with Bolan, he concentrated on his own [[Singer-songwriter|singer-songwriting]] activities, variously as a solo artist or as a [[frontman]] for several [[Musical ensemble|bands]].\n\n==Career==\n===Early life (1949-1967) and Tyrannosaurus Rex (1967\u20131969)===\n{{main|T. Rex (band)}}\n\nTook was born Stephen Ross Porter in [[Eltham]], London, on 28 July 1949, and attended [[Shooters Hill Sixth Form College|Shooters Hill School]]. He took his name from the [[hobbit]] [[Peregrin Took]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. At the age of 17, having played drums for some months with a [[mod (subculture)|mod]] band named the Waterproof Sparrows (bass player John Rains), he answered an advert in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' for [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]], the electric band that [[Marc Bolan]] was forming following his departure from [[John's Children]]. After one disastrous concert at the Electric Garden in London,<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan and Took reduced the band to a duo, [[busking]] in [[subway (underpass)|subway]]s on acoustic guitar and [[Bongo drum|bongos]], Took having been obliged to sell his full drum kit to pay the rent until paying gigs started to come in.\n\nThe [[Flower power|flower-power]] unit, championed by [[John Peel]] onto the club and stage circuit and thence into the record shops, released three albums and achieved two [[top 40]] hits. Took contributed harmony backing vocals, which are more noticeable in live recordings than on studio recordings, and provided bongos, African drums, [[kazoo]], [[pixiphone]], and Chinese [[gong]]. Took's arrangements contributed to transforming Bolan's music from the straightforward rock 'n roll it had previously been into an exotic brew of musical styles designed to appeal to Bolan's new audience of [[hippie]]s. Towards the end of his time in the band, as Bolan began returning to the electric guitar, Took returned to a full drum set and also contributed some bass guitar parts.<ref name=\"biog2\" />\n\nThe band\u2019s producer [[Tony Visconti]] credited Took with much of the sound and success of Tyrannosaurus Rex. In an interview for the documentary \u201cMarc Bolan: The Final Word\u201d, Visconti opined that \u201cMarc and Steve were a true 50:50 partnership. Steve was a remarkable musician, he could play many instruments. He played percussion, he could pick up a bass or a guitar. He would also sometimes play some cello parts. And then his backing vocals were great too.\u201d <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn59mHnXNK8 |title=Tony Visconti on Steve Took |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nTook developed his own songwriting and in early 1969, with recording just complete on Tyrannosaurus Rex's third LP, ''Unicorn'', Took suggested to Bolan that the duo could perform some of his own material; Bolan refused. By this time, their lifestyles were in direct conflict. Bolan was living quietly with wife-to-be June Child, while Took was rapidly forging links with \"revolutionary\" underground acts, such as [[The Deviants (band)|The Deviants]] and [[The Pretty Things]]. The relationship was deteriorating badly\u2014Bolan barely tolerated Took's drug use, and Steve Mann recalled that it was clear they \"cordially detested each other\".<ref name=TR2>{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground, 1961\u201371|url=https://archive.org/details/daysinlifevoices00gree|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Took's friendship with Bolan's idol [[Syd Barrett]] had also developed through their shared interests in both [[LSD]] and \"strange musical noises\". [[Mick Farren]], in his memoir ''Give The Anarchist A Cigarette'', recalled that Took would \"drag a bemused Syd Barrett along\" to events in [[Ladbroke Grove]] in the late 1960s; Took remained friends with Barrett well into the 1970s. Took worked with Syd Barrett on unreleased \"Ramadan\" tracks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|first=David|title=Random Precision: Recording the Music of Syd Barrett, 1965\u20131974}}</ref> While in Tyrannosaurus Rex, Took also appeared as a backing vocalist on a session for [[David Bowie]], the results of which can be heard on the BBC sessions album ''[[Bowie at the Beeb]]''.<ref name=\"biog2\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/bowie.html |title=Steve Took'S Musical Associations With David Bowie |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Took donated two of his songs\u2014Three Little Piggies and The Sparrow Is A Sign\u2014to former [[Tomorrow (band)|Tomorrow]] and [[The Pretty Things|Pretty Things]] drummer [[Twink (musician)|Twink]]'s 1969 solo album, ''[[Think Pink]]''.<ref name=\"TR1\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=T-Rex\u2014 Up Close And Personal|year=2007}}</ref>\nConsequently, before the first Tyrannosaurus Rex tour of America, Bolan and his management sacked Took. Another contributing factor was an incident at the launch party for the UK edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', where jugs of [[punch (drink)|punch]] prepared for the event were [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|spiked]] with the [[hallucinogen]] [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|STP]]. Took had already earned himself the nickname \"The Phantom Spiker\" (in which he rejoiced) through previous similar pranks.<ref name=\"TR1\"/> Bolan was severely affected by the spiked drink and considered Took to be the prime suspect.<ref name=\"biog2\" />\n\nTook was contractually obliged to go on the US tour, but his heart was not in it and he attempted to cope through taking drugs. Additionally, the acoustic duo were overshadowed by the loud electric acts they were billed with. To counter this, he drew from the [[shock rock]] style of [[Iggy Pop]]; as Took explained to the [[NME]] in 1972 \"I took my shirt off in the Sunset Strip where we were playing and whipped myself till everybody shut up. With a belt, y'know, a bit of blood and the whole of Los Angeles shuts up. 'What's going on, man, there's some nutter attacking himself on stage.' I mean, Iggy Stooge had the same basic approach.\"<ref name=csm>{{cite web|url=http://stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/nme-murray-1972.html|title=New Musical Express (NME) Interview, October 14 1972|website=stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk|accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>  This allowed the management to claim subsequently that it was Took's behaviour on stage which had caused the sacking. Bolan replaced Took with [[Mickey Finn (musician)|Mickey Finn]], and after [[A Beard Of Stars|one further album]] renamed the duo [[T. Rex (band)|T.

This band was named in honour of a drinking club of the same name the three had formed earlier that year, along with other leading lights of the underground scene. Together with Twink's girlfriend Silva Darling, they performed what Farren would later describe as \"less of a gig than a protracted harangue\" at the [[University of Manchester]] in October 1969, which rapidly dissolved into chaos. Took appeared prominently on Farren's first solo album ''[[Mona \u2013 The Carnivorous Circus]]'' (recorded December 1969, released 1970). Twink and the other ex-Deviants then formed a new band called the [[Pink Fairies]] (mark 2), without Took or Farren.<ref name=\"biog3\" />\n\n===Shagrat (1970\u20131971)===\n{{main|Shagrat (band)}}\nIn February 1970, Farren and Took headhunted guitarist [[Larry Wallis|Larry (or \"Lazza\") Wallis]] and bassist Tim Taylor from their underground band, the Entire Sioux Nation. A month later, Farren dropped out, leaving Took in the role of bandleader for the first time in his career. With the addition of drummer Phil Lenoir, Shagrat was formed (named after an [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orc]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). They recorded three tracks, \"Peppermint Flickstick\", \"Boo! I Said Freeze\" and \"Steel Abortion\", at [[Strawberry Studios]] and played live at the [[Phun City]] festival, before Lenoir and Taylor left. Took and Wallis continued with drummer Dave Bidwell, rehearsing with various bass players and eventually forming an acoustic trio of Took on vocals and guitar, Wallis on [[acoustic bass guitar|acoustic bass]] and Bidwell on [[tambourine]]. This line-up recorded a set of (at least) four home demos, \"Amanda\", \"Strange Sister\", \"Still Yawning Stillborn\" and \"Beautiful Deceiver\", at Wallis's father's home studio in [[South London]], which in the 1990s would be paired with the earlier electric studio session for limited edition vinyl release and later a CD album release in 2001.<ref name=\"biog3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-3.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER 2 \u2013 SHAGRAT STORY \u2013 (Steve's part in the formation of the Pink Fairies \u2013 The Band, and how he came to become an outright frontman for his own group) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=26 July 1970 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nWallis would later take over the leadership of the Pink Fairies for their ''Kings of Oblivion'' LP, substantially transforming the sound and style of the band.

In this format, Took made some headway as a live performer. \"Tookie\" appeared in frequent support slots for [[Hawkwind]] and the Pink Fairies, attracting some coverage in the UK music press and even performing a live session on Steve Bradshaw's ''Breakthrough'' programme on [[BBC Radio London]].<ref name=\"biog4\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steve-bradshaw.com/radio.html |title=radio |website=Steve-bradshaw.com|accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref> In December 1971, he headlined a three-date mini-tour of southwest England.<ref name=\"flyer\" />\n\nHe also performed at various benefit events, including the \"Nasty Balls\" benefits for the Nasty Tales magazine<ref name=\"flyer\" /> (whose editors, including Farren, were on trial for obscenity) as well as the 1972 [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] festival at [[Aldermaston]],<ref name=\"flyer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/gig-flyer.html |title=Steve Took \u2013 Gig Flyers, Posters & Adverts |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/aldermaston.html |title=Memories of Aldermaston Free Festival \u2013 Interview By Charles Sharr Murray |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> Steve's account of which was reprinted by [[Charles Shaar Murray]] in his book ''Shots From The Hip''.<ref name=\"biog4\" /> Writing for the [[NME]] in 1972, Murray described Took and his stage act thus: \"Most people know who Steve Peregrine Took is, but few people know what he does.

His contributions to these jams were in the role of third drummer, and he also once played bass guitar for the \"Pinks\", substituting for Duncan Sanderson.<ref name=\"biog4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-4.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER 3 \u2013 A ROCK 'N ROLL SINGER WITHOUT A BAND \u2013 (An account of Steve's career as a solo acoustic performer prior to his association with Tony Secunda) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Management of Tony Secunda (1972\u20131973)===\nDuring 1972, Took was approached by [[Tony Secunda]], recently fired as manager for [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], with a view to recovering [[royalties]] owed to Took from the Tyrannosaurus Rex years. Emerging from these conversations, Secunda became Took's manager, with a view to leading him to stardom to spite Bolan. Initially, Took attempted to rerecord as a single the song \"Amanda\" from the 1971 acoustic Shagrat session (along with two other tracks, ''Blind Owl Blues'' and ''Mr Discrete'') with the assistance of the Pink Fairies rhythm section of Sanderson and Russell Hunter, whose band was temporarily defunct following the departure of [[Paul Rudolph (musician)|Paul Rudolph]]. During this session, former [[Junior's Eyes (band)|Junior's Eyes]]/[[David Bowie|Bowie]] guitarist Mick Wayne was recruited as guitarist.<ref name=\"biog5\" />\n\nHowever, none of these tracks were ever completed to Took's satisfaction, due to what Wayne later described as \"[[cannabis (drug)|dope]]-induced thinking\" and consequently, Wayne, Sanderson and Hunter formed a new incarnation of the Pink Fairies. (Wayne was quickly supplanted by Wallis, leading to the Kings of Oblivion era as detailed above). Took and Secunda, meanwhile, embarked upon a different approach.<ref name=\"biog5\" />\n\nTook moved into a basement flat beneath Secunda's Mayfair offices, which he set up as a live-in recording studio to demo material at his own ease. The flat rapidly became a magnet for the cream of musicians on the underground scene, who would contribute to the recordings while visiting Took. As well as old colleagues from Hawkwind and the Pink Fairies, Secunda reported that Took received visits from [[Syd Barrett]], who at the time was living in Cambridge, but would shortly relocate back to London. From Secunda's account, it would appear likely that Barrett is on the recordings done in the flat by Took and his friends.<ref name=\"biog5\" />\n\nHighlights of the session tapes were eventually released by [[Cleopatra Records]] in 1995, as ''The Missing Link To Tyrannosaurus Rex''. A new version of the 1971 acoustic Shagrat song \"Beautiful Deceiver\" is tracklisted on the CD as \"Syd's Wine\" and a credit for guitar and other noises is given to one Crazy Diamond, an allusion to the 1975 Pink Floyd track \"[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]\", written in tribute to Barrett. Stripped down versions of the track \"Syd's Wine\" reveal a second guitarist in the room and audible vocal noises.<ref name=\"biog5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/biography-5.html |title=CAREER HISTORY \u2013 CHAPTER 4 \u2013 SECUNDA AND THE REVENGE MASTERPLAN \u2013 (The story of Steve's association with Tony Secunda, the sessions recorded in his basement flat and the 1972 NME interview with Charles Shaar Murray) |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date=14 October 1972 |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Various projects (1973\u20131976)===\nAfter splitting with Secunda, Took worked with a number of Hawkwind members, most notably [[Robert Calvert]], Adrian Wagner,<ref name=\"pen\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk/penatration.html |title=Penetration Interview By Paul Welsh |website=Stevetook.mercurymoon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> and [[Nik Turner]].

While down there, Took formed a new band, Jolly Roger And The Crimson Gash, with Takahashi now on bass and two local musicians, Brian East on drums and a guitarist called Phil.  This band gigged locally and recorded at least four tracks, produced by Turner at his home studio in [[Westgate on Sea]].<ref>A Trip Through Ladbroke Grove - The Life And Times Of Underground Hero Steve Peregrin Took, by Fee Warner, {{ISBN|978-1-78808-168-9}} pp264-266, 270</ref>\n\n===Steve Took's Horns (1976\u20131978)===\n{{main|Steve Took's Horns}}\nBy 1976, Took was back in London and using the band name Steve Took's Horns, so called after a horned [[pendant]] which he habitually wore. By mid 1977, this had solidified into a steady line-up featuring, in what would be the first of several bands together over many years, [[Trev Thoms|Trevor Thoms]] and [[Dino Ferari|Ermanno Ghisio-Erba]], later better known to [[Inner City Unit]] (ICU) fans as Judge Trev and Dino Ferari.<ref name=\"biog7\" />\n\nThis group, managed by Turner's friend since adolescence Tony Landau, recorded a session of three studio tracks \u2013 It's Over, Average Man and Woman I Need \u2013 at Pathway Studios on 29 November 1977, before going on to perform a gig on 18 June 1978 at [[The Roundhouse]], as part of \"Nik Turner's Bohemian Love-In\".
