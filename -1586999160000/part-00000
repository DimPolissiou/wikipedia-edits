The Rig Veda has a similar coded description of the division of the universe in its early stages.\n\n== Zoroastrianism mythology ==\nAccording to Zoroastrian cosmology, the period of (material) creation, also to last 3,000 years, began after the treaty, when [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]] recited the [[Ahuna Vairya|Ahunwar]] (Av. Ahuna Vairiia) prayer, revealing to [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]] his ultimate defeat and causing him to fall back into the darkness in a stupor, which lasted for the entire period of the creation.  During this time Ohrmazd fashioned his creations in material (''g\u0113t\u012bg'') form, by celebrating a \u201cspiritual ''[[yasna]]''\u201d.  He placed each creation under the protection of one of the seven [[Amesha Spenta|Amahraspands]] (Av. Am\u0259\u0161a Sp\u0259nta).  First he created the sky (protected by [[Shahrevar|\u0160ahrewar]], Av. X\u0161a\u03b8ra Vairiia), which enclosed the world like the shell of an egg.  The second creation was water (protected by [[Haurvatat|Hord\u0101d]], Av. Haurvat\u0101t), which filled the lower half of the \u201cegg.\u201d  The third creation, earth (protected by Spand\u0101rmad, Av. [[Spenta Armaiti|Sp\u0259nta \u0100rmaiti]]), shaped like a flat disk, floated on the primeval waters.  On it stood the fourth, fifth, and sixth creations, respectively the single plant or tree (protected by [[Ameretat|Amurd\u0101d]];  Av. Am\u0259r\u0259t\u0101t), the uniquely created bull (protected by [[Bahman|Wahman]], Av. Vohu Manah), and the first man, [[Keyumars|Gay\u014dmard]] (Av. Gaii\u014d.mar\u0259tan, protected by Ohrmazd himself).  The seventh creation, fire (protected by [[Asha Vahishta|Ardwahi\u0161t]];  Av. A\u1e67a Vahi\u0161ta), was said to have permeated all other creations. During the 3,000 years of the period of material creation these creations were motionless, and the sun stood still in the middle of the sky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-i|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY i. In Zoroastrianism/Mazdaism|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica}}</ref>\n\n== Greek mythology ==\nThe '''[[Orphic Egg]]''' in the ancient Greek [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] is the cosmic egg from which hatched the primordial [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] deity [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]]/Protogonus (variously equated also with [[Zeus]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Eros]], [[Erikepaios]] and [[Bromius]]) who in turn created the other gods.<ref>West, M. L. (1983) ''The Orphic Poems''. Oxford:Oxford University Press. p. 205</ref> The egg is often depicted with a serpent wound around it.\n\nMany threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] was believed to have been hatched from the [[World-Egg]] of [[Chronos]] (Time) and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (Necessity) or [[Nyx]] (Night). His older wife [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the [[sceptre]] to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]] before it passed to [[Cronus]] and then to Zeus, who retained it.\n\n== Egyptian mythology ==\nThe [[ancient Egypt]]ians accepted multiple creation myths as valid, including those of the [[Hermopolis (Lower Egypt)|Hermopolitan]], Heliopolitan, and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] theologies. Under the Hermopolitan theology, there is the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], which represents the conditions before the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] were created (Van Dijk, 1995).\nAn aspect within the Ogdoad is the Cosmic Egg, from which all things are born. Life comes from the Cosmic Egg; the sun god [[Ra]] was born from the primordial egg in a stage known as the first occasion (Dunand, 2004).\n\n== Phoenician mythology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nA philosophical creation story traced to \"the cosmogony of ''[[Taautus]]'', whom [[Philo of Byblos]] explicitly identified with the Egyptian [[Thoth]]&mdash;\"the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records\"&mdash; which begins with [[Erebus]] and Wind, between which ''[[Eros (god)|Eros]]'' 'Desire' came to be. From this was produced ''M\u00f4t'' which seems to be the Phoenician/Ge'ez/Hebrew/Arabic/Ancient Egyptian word for 'Death' but which the account says may mean 'mud'. In a mixed confusion, the germs of life appear, and intelligent animals called ''Zophasemin'' (explained probably correctly as 'observers of heaven') formed together as an egg, perhaps. The account is not clear. Then M\u00f4t burst forth into light and the heavens were created and the various elements found their stations.\n\nFollowing the etymological line of [[Jacob Bryant]] one might also consider with regard to the meaning of ''M\u00f4t'', that according to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians ''[[Ma'at]]'' was the personification of the fundamental order of the universe, without which all of creation would perish. She was also considered the wife of Thoth.\n\n== Chinese mythology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nIn the myth of [[Pangu]], developed by [[Taoist]] [[monk]]s hundreds of years after [[Lao Zi]], the universe began as an egg that symbolizes the primordial state of [[Taiji_(philosophy)|Taiji]].  A primeval [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[giant]] named [[Pangu]], born inside the egg, broke it into two halves: the upper half became the sky, while the lower half became the earth.  As the god grew taller, the sky and the earth grew thicker and were separated further.  Finally Pangu died and his body parts became different parts of the earth.\n\n== Finnish mythology ==\nIn the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] [[national epic]], there is a myth of the world being created from the fragments of an egg laid by a [[diving duck]] on the knee of [[Ilmatar]], [[goddess]] of the air:\n\n: ''One egg's lower half transformed''\n: ''And became the earth below,''\n: ''And its upper half transmuted''\n: ''And became the sky above;''\n: ''From the yolk the sun was made,''\n: ''Light of day to shine upon us;''\n: ''From the white the moon was formed,''\n: ''Light of night to gleam above us;''\n: ''All the colored brighter bits''\n: ''Rose to be the stars of heaven''\n: ''And the darker crumbs changed into''\n: ''Clouds and cloudlets in the sky.''\n\nIn many original folk poems, the duck - or sometimes an eagle - laid its eggs on the knee of [[V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen]].<ref>Martti Haavio: V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen: Suomalaisten runojen keskushahmo. Porvoo: WSOY, 1950</ref>\n\n== Polynesian mythology ==\nIn [[Cook Islands mythology]], deep within [[Avaiki]] (the Underworld), a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell, there dwelt in the deepest depths, the primordial mother goddess, [[Varima-te-takere]]. Her domain was described as being so narrow, that her knees touched her chin. It was from this place that she created the first man, [[Avatea]], a god of light, a hybrid being half man and half fish. He was sent to the Upperworld to shine light in the land of men, and his eyes were believed to be the sun and the moon.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[William Wyatt Gill]]|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n27/mode/2up|date=1876|publisher=London: Henry S. King & Co}}</ref>\n\nIn Samoan and Tahitian mythology, all existence began inside an egg-like shell called Rumia. The first being to exist within Rumia was Tangaloa. Tangaloa instigated the creation of many aspects of reality, the atea/lagi heavens, the papa earth, and additional living creatures (the atua / gods) tightly compressed within the shell. The new creatures eventually worked to release the shell and pushed the heavens and earth apart, resulting in the universe as we know it.\n\n== Dogon mythology ==\n\n\"''In the beginning, Amma, alone, was in the shape of an egg: the four collar bones were fused, dividing the egg into air, earth, fire, and water, establishing also the four cardinal directions. Within this cosmic egg was the material and the structure of the universe, and the 266 signs that embraced the essence of all things. The first creation of the world by Amma was, however, a failure. The second creation began when Amma planted a seed within herself, a seed that resulted in the shape of man. But in the process of its gestation, there was a flaw, meaning that the universe would now have within it the possibilities for incompleteness. Now the egg became two placentas, each containing a set of twins, male and female. After sixty years, one of the males, Ogo, broke out of the placenta and attempted to create his own universe, in opposition to that being created by Amma. But he was unable to say the words that would bring such a universe into being. He then descended, as Amma transformed into the earth the fragment of placenta that went with Ogo into the void. Ogo interfered with the creative potential of the earth by having incestuous relations with it. His counterpart, Nommo, a participant in the revolt, was then killed by Amma, the parts of his body cast in all directions, bringing a sense of order to the world. When, five days later, Amma brought the pieces of Nommo's body together, restoring him to life, Nommo became ruler of the universe. He created four spirits, the ancestors of the [[Dogon people]]; Amma sent Nommo and the spirits to earth in an ark, and so the earth was restored. Along the way, Nommo uttered the words of Amma, and the sacred words that create were made available to humans. In the meantime, Ogo was transformed by Amma into Yuguru, the Pale Fox, who would always be alone, always be incomplete, eternally in revolt, ever wandering the earth seeking his female soul.

The idea comes from a perceived need to reconcile [[Edwin Hubble]]'s observation of an [[expanding universe]] (which was also predicted from [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]]) with the notion that the [[universe]] must be eternally old. Current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological models]] maintain that 13.8 billion years ago, the entire mass of the universe was compressed into a [[gravitational singularity]], the so-called cosmic egg, from which it expanded to its current state (following the [[Big Bang]]).\n\n[[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] proposed in 1927 that the [[cosmos]] originated from what he called the ''primeval atom''.\n\nIn the late 1940s, [[George Gamow]]'s assistant [[Cosmology|cosmological]] researcher [[Ralph Alpher]], proposed the name [[ylem]] for the primordial substance that existed between the [[Big Crunch]] of the previous universe and the [[Big Bang]] of our own universe.<ref>''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75</ref> ''Ylem'' is closely related to the concept of [[supersymmetry]].  <ref>Edward Harrison: Masks of the Universe: Changing Ideas on the Nature of the Cosmos, Cambridge University Press, 08.05.2003, p. 224 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=tSowGCP0kMIC&pg=PA224&lpg=PA224&dq=ylem+supersymmetrie&source=bl&ots=p36VfOjibz&sig=LVrnIUJVcagTU5MYYDVf7b7B5-U&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAr7yZtJfdAhVGPBoKHfyODR4Q6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=ylem%20supersymmetrie&f=false online]) </ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Brahma]]\n* [[Brahman]]\n* [[Brahmanda Purana|Brahmanda]]\n* [[Hiranyagarbha]]\n* [[Orphic egg]]\n* [[Phanes]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Eino Friberg, trans., ''The Kalevala: Epic of the Finnish People''.

During this time Ohrmazd fashioned his creations in material (''g\u0113t\u012bg'') form, by celebrating a \u201cspiritual ''[[yasna]]''\u201d.  He placed each creation under the protection of one of the seven [[Amesha Spenta|Amahraspands]] (Av. Am\u0259\u0161a Sp\u0259nta).  First he created the sky (protected by [[Shahrevar|\u0160ahrewar]], Av. X\u0161a\u03b8ra Vairiia), which enclosed the world like the shell of an egg.  The second creation was water (protected by [[Haurvatat|Hord\u0101d]], Av. Haurvat\u0101t), which filled the lower half of the \u201cegg.\u201d  The third creation, earth (protected by Spand\u0101rmad, Av. [[Spenta Armaiti|Sp\u0259nta \u0100rmaiti]]), shaped like a flat disk, floated on the primeval waters.  On it stood the fourth, fifth, and sixth creations, respectively the single plant or tree (protected by [[Ameretat|Amurd\u0101d]];  Av. Am\u0259r\u0259t\u0101t), the uniquely created bull (protected by [[Bahman|Wahman]], Av. Vohu Manah), and the first man, [[Keyumars|Gay\u014dmard]] (Av. Gaii\u014d.mar\u0259tan, protected by Ohrmazd himself).  The seventh creation, fire (protected by [[Asha Vahishta|Ardwahi\u0161t]];  Av. A\u1e67a Vahi\u0161ta), was said to have permeated all other creations. During the 3,000 years of the period of material creation these creations were motionless, and the sun stood still in the middle of the sky<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-i|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY i. In Zoroastrianism/Mazdaism|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica}}</ref>.\n\n== Greek mythology ==\nThe '''[[Orphic Egg]]''' in the ancient Greek [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic tradition]] is the cosmic egg from which hatched the primordial [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] deity [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]]/Protogonus (variously equated also with [[Zeus]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Eros]], [[Erikepaios]] and [[Bromius]]) who in turn created the other gods.<ref>West, M. L. (1983) ''The Orphic Poems''. Oxford:Oxford University Press. p. 205</ref> The egg is often depicted with a serpent wound around it.\n\nMany threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]] was believed to have been hatched from the [[World-Egg]] of [[Chronos]] (Time) and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (Necessity) or [[Nyx]] (Night). His older wife [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the [[sceptre]] to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]] before it passed to [[Cronus]] and then to Zeus, who retained it.\n\n== Egyptian mythology ==\nThe [[ancient Egypt]]ians accepted multiple creation myths as valid, including those of the [[Hermopolis (Lower Egypt)|Hermopolitan]], Heliopolitan, and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphite]] theologies. Under the Hermopolitan theology, there is the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], which represents the conditions before the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|gods]] were created (Van Dijk, 1995).\nAn aspect within the Ogdoad is the Cosmic Egg, from which all things are born. Life comes from the Cosmic Egg; the sun god [[Ra]] was born from the primordial egg in a stage known as the first occasion (Dunand, 2004).\n\n== Phoenician mythology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nA philosophical creation story traced to \"the cosmogony of ''[[Taautus]]'', whom [[Philo of Byblos]] explicitly identified with the Egyptian [[Thoth]]&mdash;\"the first who thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records\"&mdash; which begins with [[Erebus]] and Wind, between which ''[[Eros (god)|Eros]]'' 'Desire' came to be. From this was produced ''M\u00f4t'' which seems to be the Phoenician/Ge'ez/Hebrew/Arabic/Ancient Egyptian word for 'Death' but which the account says may mean 'mud'. In a mixed confusion, the germs of life appear, and intelligent animals called ''Zophasemin'' (explained probably correctly as 'observers of heaven') formed together as an egg, perhaps. The account is not clear. Then M\u00f4t burst forth into light and the heavens were created and the various elements found their stations.\n\nFollowing the etymological line of [[Jacob Bryant]] one might also consider with regard to the meaning of ''M\u00f4t'', that according to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians ''[[Ma'at]]'' was the personification of the fundamental order of the universe, without which all of creation would perish. She was also considered the wife of Thoth.\n\n== Chinese mythology ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nIn the myth of [[Pangu]], developed by [[Taoist]] [[monk]]s hundreds of years after [[Lao Zi]], the universe began as an egg that symbolizes the primordial state of [[Taiji_(philosophy)|Taiji]].  A primeval [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] [[giant]] named [[Pangu]], born inside the egg, broke it into two halves: the upper half became the sky, while the lower half became the earth.  As the god grew taller, the sky and the earth grew thicker and were separated further.  Finally Pangu died and his body parts became different parts of the earth.\n\n== Finnish mythology ==\nIn the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[Finnish mythology|Finnish]] [[national epic]], there is a myth of the world being created from the fragments of an egg laid by a [[diving duck]] on the knee of [[Ilmatar]], [[goddess]] of the air:\n\n: ''One egg's lower half transformed''\n: ''And became the earth below,''\n: ''And its upper half transmuted''\n: ''And became the sky above;''\n: ''From the yolk the sun was made,''\n: ''Light of day to shine upon us;''\n: ''From the white the moon was formed,''\n: ''Light of night to gleam above us;''\n: ''All the colored brighter bits''\n: ''Rose to be the stars of heaven''\n: ''And the darker crumbs changed into''\n: ''Clouds and cloudlets in the sky.''\n\nIn many original folk poems, the duck - or sometimes an eagle - laid its eggs on the knee of [[V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen]].<ref>Martti Haavio: V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen: Suomalaisten runojen keskushahmo. Porvoo: WSOY, 1950</ref>\n\n== Polynesian mythology ==\nIn [[Cook Islands mythology]], deep within [[Avaiki]] (the Underworld), a place described as resembling a vast hollow coconut shell, there dwelt in the deepest depths, the primordial mother goddess, [[Varima-te-takere]]. Her domain was described as being so narrow, that her knees touched her chin. It was from this place that she created the first man, [[Avatea]], a god of light, a hybrid being half man and half fish. He was sent to the Upperworld to shine light in the land of men, and his eyes were believed to be the sun and the moon.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[William Wyatt Gill]]|title=Myths and Songs from the South Pacific|url=https://archive.org/stream/mythsandsongsfro013889mbp#page/n27/mode/2up|date=1876|publisher=London: Henry S. King & Co}}</ref>\n\nIn Samoan and Tahitian mythology, all existence began inside an egg-like shell called Rumia. The first being to exist within Rumia was Tangaloa. Tangaloa instigated the creation of many aspects of reality, the atea/lagi heavens, the papa earth, and additional living creatures (the atua / gods) tightly compressed within the shell. The new creatures eventually worked to release the shell and pushed the heavens and earth apart, resulting in the universe as we know it.\n\n== Dogon mythology ==\n\n\"''In the beginning, Amma, alone, was in the shape of an egg: the four collar bones were fused, dividing the egg into air, earth, fire, and water, establishing also the four cardinal directions. Within this cosmic egg was the material and the structure of the universe, and the 266 signs that embraced the essence of all things. The first creation of the world by Amma was, however, a failure. The second creation began when Amma planted a seed within herself, a seed that resulted in the shape of man. But in the process of its gestation, there was a flaw, meaning that the universe would now have within it the possibilities for incompleteness. Now the egg became two placentas, each containing a set of twins, male and female. After sixty years, one of the males, Ogo, broke out of the placenta and attempted to create his own universe, in opposition to that being created by Amma. But he was unable to say the words that would bring such a universe into being. He then descended, as Amma transformed into the earth the fragment of placenta that went with Ogo into the void. Ogo interfered with the creative potential of the earth by having incestuous relations with it. His counterpart, Nommo, a participant in the revolt, was then killed by Amma, the parts of his body cast in all directions, bringing a sense of order to the world. When, five days later, Amma brought the pieces of Nommo's body together, restoring him to life, Nommo became ruler of the universe. He created four spirits, the ancestors of the [[Dogon people]]; Amma sent Nommo and the spirits to earth in an ark, and so the earth was restored. Along the way, Nommo uttered the words of Amma, and the sacred words that create were made available to humans. In the meantime, Ogo was transformed by Amma into Yuguru, the Pale Fox, who would always be alone, always be incomplete, eternally in revolt, ever wandering the earth seeking his female soul.

Catching the [[Anemoi#Boreas|north wind]] at her back and, rubbing it between her hands, she warms the ''[[pneuma]]'' and [[spontaneous generation|spontaneously generates]] the serpent [[Ophion]], who mates with her. In the form of a dove upon the waves, she lays the Cosmic Egg and bids Ophion to incubate it by coiling seven times around until it splits in two and hatches \"all things that exist... sun, moon, planets, stars, the earth with its mountains and rivers, its trees, herbs, and living creatures\".<ref name=\"Graves1955\">{{cite book |last=Graves |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Graves |year=1990 |origyear=1955 |title=The Greek Myths |volume=1 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-001026-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xKSxQQAACAAJ}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866527,00.html |title=Books: The Goddess & the Poet |publisher=TIME |accessdate=5 December 2010 |date=July 18, 1955}}</ref>\n\n== In modern cosmology ==\nThe concept was resurrected by modern [[science]] in the 1930s and explored by theoreticians during the following two decades.  The idea comes from a perceived need to reconcile [[Edwin Hubble]]'s observation of an [[expanding universe]] (which was also predicted from [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s equations of [[general relativity]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]]) with the notion that the [[universe]] must be eternally old. Current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological models]] maintain that 13.8 billion years ago, the entire mass of the universe was compressed into a [[gravitational singularity]], the so-called cosmic egg, from which it expanded to its current state (following the [[Big Bang]]).\n\n[[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] proposed in 1927 that the [[cosmos]] originated from what he called the ''primeval atom''.\n\nIn the late 1940s, [[George Gamow]]'s assistant [[Cosmology|cosmological]] researcher [[Ralph Alpher]], proposed the name [[ylem]] for the primordial substance that existed between the [[Big Crunch]] of the previous universe and the [[Big Bang]] of our own universe.<ref>''The Cosmos''--''Voyage Through the Universe'' series, New York:1988 Time-Life Books Page 75</ref> ''Ylem'' is closely related to the concept of [[supersymmetry]].  <ref>Edward Harrison: Masks of the Universe: Changing Ideas on the Nature of the Cosmos, Cambridge University Press, 08.05.2003, p. 224 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=tSowGCP0kMIC&pg=PA224&lpg=PA224&dq=ylem+supersymmetrie&source=bl&ots=p36VfOjibz&sig=LVrnIUJVcagTU5MYYDVf7b7B5-U&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAr7yZtJfdAhVGPBoKHfyODR4Q6AEwBnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=ylem%20supersymmetrie&f=false online]) </ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Brahma]]\n* [[Brahman]]\n* [[Brahmanda Purana|Brahmanda]]\n* [[Hiranyagarbha]]\n* [[Orphic egg]]\n* [[Phanes]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* Eino Friberg, trans., ''The Kalevala: Epic of the Finnish People''.

However, as ''[[aliyah]]'' has brought Jews to Israel from other countries, Israeli representation in the legislature has increased at the expense of non-Israeli Jewish diaspora representation. A Brit Olamit (World Union) must have representation in at least five countries to send a delegation to the Congress.\n\nThere are currently six Zionist World Unions (with full voting rights):\n\n* World Zionist Union: [[Labor Zionist]] Movement \u2013 [[Arzenu]] \u2013 World Union of [[Meretz]]\n* United Faction: [[Kadima]]\u2013[[HaNoar HaTzioni]]\u2013 [[MERCAZ]]\n* World [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]/[[Ichud Le'umi]]/[[Herut]]/[[Yisrael Beytenu]]/[[Moledet]]/[[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]]\n* World [[Likud]]/[[Shas]]\n* [[Hadassah]]/Confederation\n* [[Tzvi Avisar|Over The rainbow]] \u2013 the Zionist movement\n\n===Israeli representatives===\n\nSince the creation of the State of Israel, there are no elections held for Israeli delegates to the  World Zionist Congress. Rather, elections to the [[Knesset]], Israel's parliament, are deemed to fulfill this function, and Zionist parties represented in the Knesset are apportioned a number of Congress delegates proportional to their strength in the Knesset. The late Left Wing leader [[Shulamit Aloni]] on several occasions criticized this practice, stating that \"Most Israeli citizens neither know nor care that when they go to the polls they are among other things also electing delegates to the World Zionist Congress. (...) Had the Zionist Movement been required to do in Israel what it does in other countries - i.e., recruit paying members and get these members to hold specific elections to the World Zionist Congress - there might have been revealed an embarrassing low number of committed Zionists in Israel\".<ref>Shulamit Aloni speech at Meretz rally in Tel Aviv, March 24, 1997</ref>\n\n===Zionist organizations with special status===\nTwo women's organizations have special status in the Zionist Organization and have full voting rights:\n\n* [[WIZO]] \u2013 is an international, non-party Zionist body, which receives global representation by virtue of an agreement entered into in 1964. \n* [[Hadassah]] \u2013 received special status by virtue of a decision of the Zionist General Council, in 1994.<ref name=wzo /> (duplicate?)\n\n===International Jewish organizations===\nThe international Jewish organizations have also been represented in the Zionist Congress since 1972, provided that they accept the [[Jerusalem Program]],<ref>http://www.myselfourisrael.com/faqs/#jerusalem_program</ref> even if not all their members are declared Zionists. These bodies have limited voting rights{{snd}} they do not vote on matters of candidature and elections to the institutions of the WZO.<ref name=wzo />\n\nThe following are the International Jewish Organizations (limited voting rights):\n* [[Bnai Brith]] International\n* [[Maccabi World Union]]\n* [[Na'amat]]\n* [[WIZO]] Women's International Zionist Organization (duplicate?)\n* [[World Council of Conservative Masorti Synagogues]]\n* [[World Emunah]]\n* [[World Organization of Orthodox Synagogues & Communities in Israel and the Diaspora]]\n* [[American Sephardi Federation|World Sephardi Federation]]\n* [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]]\n* [[World Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[Zionist Council in Israel]]\n\n===Other participants in Congress (advisors, observers)===\n* In addition to the delegates with full voting rights participating in Congress, there are also participants in an advisory capacity which can participate in debates but have no voting rights. These may consist of office holders such as members of the Zionist Executive, members of the Zionist General Council who were not elected as delegates to Congress, Chairs of the Zionist Federations, judicial office holders - the President of the Zionist Supreme Court, the Attorney, the Comptroller and representatives of the Aliyah Movement.<ref name=wzo />\n* Observers with no speaking or voting rights can be invited by the Zionist Executive or the Congress Presidium.\n\n==The course of the Congress==\nThe Zionist Congress is conducted by the Congress Presidium. Congress deliberations are divided into five stages:<ref name=wzo />\n* Opening of the Congress, including a speech by the Chairman of the Executive, and other speeches determined in the agenda, election of the Congress Presidium, the report of the President of the Zionist Supreme Court on the election results, reports of the members of the Zionist Executive in supplement to the printed report, election of the Congress committees.\n* Election of the new Executive, according to the proposal of the Congress Standing Committee.\n* Meetings of the committees.\n* Reports of the committees and voting on the draft resolutions presented by them. The report of the Standing Committee and voting on its proposals for members of the Zionist General Council, the Comptroller and the Legal Institutions.\n* Congress closing ceremony.\n\n==History==\nThe Zionist Congress, later to become the World Zionist Congress, was held at intervals of 1 year (1897\u20131901), then 2 years (1903\u20131939) until the outbreak of the Second World War, with an eight-year break (1913\u20131921) due to the First World War.\n[[File:Stamp of Israel - 23rd Zionist Congress.jpg|upright|thumb|23rd Zionist Congress, Israeli postal stamp]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n!

moments===\n* The [[First Zionist Congress]], held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland, had Theodor Herzl acting as chairperson. The Congress was attended by some 200 participants who formulated the Zionist platform, known as the \"Basel programme\", and established the Zionist Organization (ZO). In contrast with the older Hibbat Zion movement, the ZO took a clear stance in favour of political Zionism, stating in its programme that\n:\"Zionism seeks for the Jewish people a publicly recognized legally secured homeland in Palestine.\"\nHerzl wrote in his diary,\n:\"Were I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word - which I shall guard against pronouncing publicly - it would be this: At Basel I founded the Jewish State.\"<ref name=\"1to12\">{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/firstcong.html |title=Zionist Congress: First to Twelfth Zionist Congress (1897 - 1921) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=20 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n* The Twenty-third Zionist Congress, held in 1951 in  Jerusalem, Israel, was the first to be held after the establishment of the State of Israel, and the first held in Jerusalem, which would become the norm. It was opened at the graveside of Theodor Herzl, whose remains had been moved from Vienna and reburied on the top of a hill in Jerusalem that was renamed after him, [[Mount Herzl]]. The Congress issued the \"Jerusalem Program\", placing its main focus on the newly created state as the central unifying element for the Jewish people.<ref name=\"Israel1001\"/>\n\n* [[Ruth Popkin]] was the first woman to be Chair of the Presidium and President of the World Zionist Congress, being elected to both positions in 1987.<ref name=\"jewishjournal1\">{{cite web|last=Tigay |first=Alan |url= http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/ruth_popkin_hadassah_past_national_president_dies_at_101 |title=Ruth Popkin, Hadassah past national president, dies at 101 &#124; Obituaries |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Zionist Congress]]\n* [[World Zionist Organization]]\n* [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs= \n\n<!-- \n  Here are the REF to be used inline. \n  Add page numbers by using <nowiki>{{rp|S.xx}}</nowiki> with xx meaning the actual page number referring to the page number of the printed book\n\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_01.Kongress_1897\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_02.Kongress_1898\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_03.Kongress_1899\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_04.Kongress_1900\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_05.Kongress_1901\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_06.Kongress_1903\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_07.Kongress_1905\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_08.Kongress_1907\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_09.Kongress_1909\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_10.Kongress_1911\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_11.Kongress_1913\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_12.Kongress_1921\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_13.Kongress_1923\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_14.Kongress_1925\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_15.Kongress_1927\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_16.Kongress_1929\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_17.Kongress_1931\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_18.Kongress_1933\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_19.Kongress_1935\"/>\n\n   -->\n\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_01.Kongress_1897\">{{cite web\n|url= http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/3476255  \n|title=Zionisten-Kongress in Basel - am 30. und 31.

Their goal was to build an infrastructure to further the cause of Jewish settlement in Palestine. Since the Second World War, meetings have been held approximately every four years. Also, since the creation of the State of [[Israel]], the Congress has met every four or five years in Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/cong00.html |title=The Zionist Century &#124; Concepts &#124; Zionist Congresses |publisher=Jafi.org.il |accessdate=2008-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821141230/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/concepts/cong00.html |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}<!-- redirects to Jewish Zionist Education and specific article does not seem to be on the website --></ref>\n\nThe upcoming 38th World Zionist Congress will take place in 2020.\n\n==Representatives at the World Zionist Congress==\nThe World Zionist Congress includes representatives of [[#Zionist World Unions|Zionist World Unions]], Women's [[#Zionist Organizations with Special Status|Zionist Organizations with Special Status]] and [[#International Jewish Organizations|International Jewish Organizations]].<ref name=wzo />\n\n===Zionist World Unions===\nZionist participants in the World Zionist Congress are free to form ''Brit Olamit'' or Zionist World Unions (ideological groupings), which are somewhat like [[political party|political parties]]. While Israeli political parties can participate in the Congress, ''brits'' are also organized and voted into the Congress by non-Israelis, making the Congress a multinational deliberative body for the Jewish diaspora. However, as ''[[aliyah]]'' has brought Jews to Israel from other countries, Israeli representation in the legislature has increased at the expense of non-Israeli Jewish diaspora representation. A Brit Olamit (World Union) must have representation in at least five countries to send a delegation to the Congress.\n\nThere are currently six Zionist World Unions (with full voting rights):\n\n* World Zionist Union: [[Labor Zionist]] Movement \u2013 [[Arzenu]] \u2013 World Union of [[Meretz]]\n* United Faction: [[Kadima]]\u2013[[HaNoar HaTzioni]]\u2013 [[MERCAZ]]\n* World [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]/[[Ichud Le'umi]]/[[Herut]]/[[Yisrael Beytenu]]/[[Moledet]]/[[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]]\n* World [[Likud]]/[[Shas]]\n* [[Hadassah]]/Confederation\n* [[Tzvi Avisar|Over The rainbow]] \u2013 the Zionist movement\n\n===Israeli representatives===\n\nSince the creation of the State of Israel, there are no elections held for Israeli delegates to the  World Zionist Congress. Rather, elections to the [[Knesset]], Israel's parliament, are deemed to fulfill this function, and Zionist parties represented in the Knesset are apportioned a number of Congress delegates proportional to their strength in the Knesset. The late Left Wing leader [[Shulamit Aloni]] on several occasions criticized this practice, stating that \"Most Israeli citizens neither know nor care that when they go to the polls they are among other things also electing delegates to the World Zionist Congress. (...) Had the Zionist Movement been required to do in Israel what it does in other countries - i.e., recruit paying members and get these members to hold specific elections to the World Zionist Congress - there might have been revealed an embarrassing low number of committed Zionists in Israel\"<ref>Shulamit Aloni speech at Meretz rally in Tel Aviv, March 24, 1997</ref>.\n\n===Zionist organizations with special status===\nTwo women's organizations have special status in the Zionist Organization and have full voting rights:\n\n* [[WIZO]] \u2013 is an international, non-party Zionist body, which receives global representation by virtue of an agreement entered into in 1964. \n* [[Hadassah]] \u2013 received special status by virtue of a decision of the Zionist General Council, in 1994.<ref name=wzo /> (duplicate?)\n\n===International Jewish organizations===\nThe international Jewish organizations have also been represented in the Zionist Congress since 1972, provided that they accept the [[Jerusalem Program]],<ref>http://www.myselfourisrael.com/faqs/#jerusalem_program</ref> even if not all their members are declared Zionists. These bodies have limited voting rights{{snd}} they do not vote on matters of candidature and elections to the institutions of the WZO.<ref name=wzo />\n\nThe following are the International Jewish Organizations (limited voting rights):\n* [[Bnai Brith]] International\n* [[Maccabi World Union]]\n* [[Na'amat]]\n* [[WIZO]] Women's International Zionist Organization (duplicate?)\n* [[World Council of Conservative Masorti Synagogues]]\n* [[World Emunah]]\n* [[World Organization of Orthodox Synagogues & Communities in Israel and the Diaspora]]\n* [[American Sephardi Federation|World Sephardi Federation]]\n* [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]]\n* [[World Union of Jewish Students]]\n* [[Zionist Council in Israel]]\n\n===Other participants in Congress (advisors, observers)===\n* In addition to the delegates with full voting rights participating in Congress, there are also participants in an advisory capacity which can participate in debates but have no voting rights. These may consist of office holders such as members of the Zionist Executive, members of the Zionist General Council who were not elected as delegates to Congress, Chairs of the Zionist Federations, judicial office holders - the President of the Zionist Supreme Court, the Attorney, the Comptroller and representatives of the Aliyah Movement.<ref name=wzo />\n* Observers with no speaking or voting rights can be invited by the Zionist Executive or the Congress Presidium.\n\n==The course of the Congress==\nThe Zionist Congress is conducted by the Congress Presidium. Congress deliberations are divided into five stages:<ref name=wzo />\n* Opening of the Congress, including a speech by the Chairman of the Executive, and other speeches determined in the agenda, election of the Congress Presidium, the report of the President of the Zionist Supreme Court on the election results, reports of the members of the Zionist Executive in supplement to the printed report, election of the Congress committees.\n* Election of the new Executive, according to the proposal of the Congress Standing Committee.\n* Meetings of the committees.\n* Reports of the committees and voting on the draft resolutions presented by them. The report of the Standing Committee and voting on its proposals for members of the Zionist General Council, the Comptroller and the Legal Institutions.\n* Congress closing ceremony.\n\n==History==\nThe Zionist Congress, later to become the World Zionist Congress, was held at intervals of 1 year (1897\u20131901), then 2 years (1903\u20131939) until the outbreak of the Second World War, with an eight-year break (1913\u20131921) due to the First World War.\n[[File:Stamp of Israel - 23rd Zionist Congress.jpg|upright|thumb|23rd Zionist Congress, Israeli postal stamp]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#CCCCCC;\"\n!

In contrast with the older Hibbat Zion movement, the ZO took a clear stance in favour of political Zionism, stating in its programme that\n:\"Zionism seeks for the Jewish people a publicly recognized legally secured homeland in Palestine.\"\nHerzl wrote in his diary,\n:\"Were I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word - which I shall guard against pronouncing publicly - it would be this: At Basel I founded the Jewish State.\"<ref name=\"1to12\">{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/firstcong.html |title=Zionist Congress: First to Twelfth Zionist Congress (1897 - 1921) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=20 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n* The Twenty-third Zionist Congress, held in 1951 in  Jerusalem, Israel, was the first to be held after the establishment of the State of Israel, and the first held in Jerusalem, which would become the norm. It was opened at the graveside of Theodor Herzl, whose remains had been moved from Vienna and reburied on the top of a hill in Jerusalem that was renamed after him, [[Mount Herzl]]. The Congress issued the \"Jerusalem Program\", placing its main focus on the newly created state as the central unifying element for the Jewish people.<ref name=\"Israel1001\"/>\n\n* [[Ruth Popkin]] was the first woman to be Chair of the Presidium and President of the World Zionist Congress, being elected to both positions in 1987.<ref name=\"jewishjournal1\">{{cite web|last=Tigay |first=Alan |url= http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/ruth_popkin_hadassah_past_national_president_dies_at_101 |title=Ruth Popkin, Hadassah past national president, dies at 101 &#124; Obituaries |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Zionist Congress]]\n* [[World Zionist Organization]]\n* [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs= \n\n<!-- \n  Here are the REF to be used inline. \n  Add page numbers by using <nowiki>{{rp|S.xx}}</nowiki> with xx meaning the actual page number referring to the page number of the printed book\n\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_01.Kongress_1897\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_02.Kongress_1898\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_03.Kongress_1899\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_04.Kongress_1900\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_05.Kongress_1901\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_06.Kongress_1903\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_07.Kongress_1905\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_08.Kongress_1907\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_09.Kongress_1909\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_10.Kongress_1911\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_11.Kongress_1913\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_12.Kongress_1921\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_13.Kongress_1923\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_14.Kongress_1925\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_15.Kongress_1927\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_16.Kongress_1929\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_17.Kongress_1931\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_18.Kongress_1933\"/>\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_19.Kongress_1935\"/>\n\n   -->\n\n<REF name=\"Protokoll_01.Kongress_1897\">{{cite web\n|url= http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/3476255  \n|title=Zionisten-Kongress in Basel - am 30. und 31.

Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Ottoman troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kolokotronis|Edmonds|1892}}.</ref> Theodoros was named in honour of [[Fyodor Orlov]].\n\n[[File:Kolokotronis-01d-by-Karl Krazeisen.jpg|thumb|Lithography of Kolokotronis by [[Karl Krazeisen]] used for the 5000 [[drachma]] banknote]]\n\nPrior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a ''kleft'' (a warrior-bandit), an ''[[armatolos]]'' (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a ''k\u00e1pos'' (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese).<ref name=Clogg>{{harvnb|Clogg|2013|loc=\"Biographies: Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", p. 270}}.</ref> As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the [[Kanellos Deligiannis|Deligiannis]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|1976|p=xviii}}.</ref> He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.<ref name=Clogg/>\n\nIn 1805 he joined the Russian Navy during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]]. In 1806 Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the capture of Tripolitsa, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Siege of Nafplio===\nHe next commanded with [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] the Greek troops in the siege of the fortress of [[Nafplion|Nafplio]], since September 1821, [[Acrocorinth]] (surrendered in January 1822) and later of the fortress of [[Patras]] since February 1822. \n\nGreek forces took the port of Nafplion, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender, before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos. \n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. \n\nDramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis' helmet, weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Evlahos kolokotronis dervenakia.jpg|Statue of Kolokotronis at [[Dervenakia]]\nFile:Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|Portrait by Dionysios Tsokos\nFile:Kolokotronis.jpg|Colocotroni by Giovanni Boggi\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis (1838).jpg|Colocotroni by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville]]\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis monument.jpg|Kolokotronis's monument in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=The Movement for Greek Independence, 1770\u20131821: A Collection of Documents|year=1976|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-0-06-491216-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWJoAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece|year=2013|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-10-765644-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M492AgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=K.E.|title=Greece:A Jewish History|year=2008|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-40-083401-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vIneSflMcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Keridis|first=Dimitris|title=Historical Dictionary of Modern Greece|year=2009|location=|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81-086312-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ERJI1jLruQC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kolokotronis|first1=Theodoros|last2=Edmonds|first2=Elizabeth M.

Their legendary pride and insubordination is commemorated in a well-known folk song of that time:\n\n<poem>\n\"On a horse they go to church,\nOn a horse they kiss the icons,\nOn a horse they receive communion\nFrom the priest's hand.\"\n</poem>\n\nHis father, [[Konstantinos Kolokotronis]], took part in an armed rebellion, the [[Orlov Revolt]], instigated by the administration of [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia. He was killed in 1780 in an engagement with Ottoman troops, along with two of his brothers, George and Apostolis.<ref>{{harvnb|Kolokotronis|Edmonds|1892}}.</ref> Theodoros was named in honour of [[Fyodor Orlov]].\n\n[[File:Kolokotronis-01d-by-Karl Krazeisen.jpg|thumb|Lithography of Kolokotronis by [[Karl Krazeisen]] used for the 5000 [[drachma]] banknote]]\n\nPrior to the Greek Revolution, Theodoros Kolokotronis operated as a ''kleft'' (a warrior-bandit), an ''[[armatolos]]'' (a Christian irregular of the Ottoman military), and as a ''k\u00e1pos'' (a militiaman employed by Greek notables of the Peloponnese).<ref name=Clogg>{{harvnb|Clogg|2013|loc=\"Biographies: Kolokotronis, Theodoros (1770\u20131843)\", p. 270}}.</ref> As a kapos, Kolokotronis worked for the [[Kanellos Deligiannis|Deligiannis]] family.<ref>{{harvnb|Clogg|1976|p=xviii}}.</ref> He acquired wealth by stealing sheep and marrying the daughter of a wealthy Peloponnesian notable.<ref name=Clogg/>\n\nIn 1805 he joined the Russian Navy during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)]]. In 1806 Ottoman attacks against the klefts forced Kolokotronis to flee to the island of [[Zakynthos]] (or Zante).<ref name=Clogg/> When Zakynthos was occupied by the [[British Empire|British]], he obtained useful military experience while serving under the command of Richard Church, a [[philhellene]], in the [[1st Regiment Greek Light Infantry]]; in 1810, Kolokotronis was promoted to the rank of major.<ref name=Clogg/> From his service in the British Army, he adopted his characteristic red helmet. While in the Heptanese (a French protectorate from 1807 to 1815, known as the Septinsular Republic), he came in contact with the revolutionary ideas of the era and was influenced by them:\n\n{{cquote|<br>According to my judgement, the [[French Revolution]] and the doings of [[Napoleon]] opened the eyes of the world. The nations knew nothing before, and the people thought that kings were gods upon the earth and that they were bound to say that whatever they did as well done. Through this present change it is more difficult to rule the people.<ref>{{harvnb|Stavrianos|1963|p=195}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Greek War of Independence==   \n===Outbreak===\n[[File:Siege of Tripolitsa.jpg|thumb|Plan of the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. The detachments of Kolokotronis's division, which have surrounded the town are symbolized by the letter \"O\".]]\n\nKolokotronis returned to the mainland just prior to the outbreak of the war (officially, 25 March 1821) and formed a confederation of irregular Moreot [[klepht]] bands. These he tried to train and organize into something resembling a modern army. In May, he was named ''[[strategos|archistrategos]]'' or commander-in-chief. He was already 50 years old by this time, a fact which contributed to his sobriquet ''O Geros tou Morea'' or \"The Elder of Morea,\" whereby [[Morea]] was another name describing the [[Peloponnese]]. Kolokotronis's first action was the defense of [[Valtetsi]], the village near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]] where his army was mustering. Later, he was also the Commander of the Greek forces during the [[Siege of Tripolitsa]]. After the capture of Tripolitsa, he entered the town, where he was shown a [[plane tree]] in the market-place where the Turks used to hang the Greeks and he ordered that it be cut down.\n\n===Siege of Nafplio===\nHe next commanded with [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] the Greek troops in the siege of the fortress of [[Nafplion|Nafplio]], since September 1821, [[Acrocorinth]] (surrendered in January 1822) and later of the fortress of [[Patras]] since February 1822. \n\nGreek forces took the port of Nafplion, and the Ottoman garrison in the town's twin citadels was running low on supplies, but the disorganized Greek provisional government at [[Argos]], just to the north, could not complete negotiations for its surrender, before a large Ottoman force began marching southward to crush the revolutionaries. Panicked, government officials abandoned Argos and began evacuations by sea at Nafplion. Only an under-strength battalion under [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]] remained to hold Larissa castle, the fortress of Argos. \n\n===As liberator===\n[[File:\u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7, \u039d\u03b1\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf 8209.jpg|thumb|Statue in [[Nafplio]]]]\n[[File:Kolokotronis und seine Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Kolokotronis after the [[Battle of Dervenakia]]]]\n\nKolokotronis gathered the klephts together to march to the relief of Ypsilantis. This was quite a feat in itself, considering the near-collapse of the government and the notoriously quarrelsome nature of the klephtic bands. Even the troublesome [[Souliotes]] lent a hand. The Ottoman army from the north commanded by [[Mahmud Dramali Pasha]], after taking [[Corinth]], had marched to the plain of Argos. The castle of [[Larissa (Argos)|Larissa]] was an excellent position, commanding the whole plain. To leave such a stronghold straddling Ottoman supply lines was far too dangerous. Dramali would have to reduce the fortress before moving on. Scaling the cliffs, breaching the castle's stout walls and overcoming its resolute defenders would be no easy task.\n\nYet, there was one weakness Dramali was unaware of: Larissa, unlike the Acropolis in Athens, had no spring and consequently fresh water had to be supplied from [[cistern]]s. Unfortunately for the Greeks, it was July and no rains were falling to fill the cisterns. Ypsilantis bluffed the Ottomans as long as he could, but towards the end of the month had to sneak his men out in the middle of the night. Dramali's men plundered the castle the next day, and he was now free to march them toward the coast to resupply (the Greeks had pursued a [[scorched earth]] policy, and the large Ottoman force was eating through its food supplies rather quickly). Ypsilantis's defense had bought Kolokotronis and the klephts valuable time.\n\nTo his dismay, Dramali found himself cut off from his supply fleet, which had intended to land at Nafplio but was successfully [[blockade]]d by the Greek fleet under Admiral [[Andreas Miaoulis]]. \n\nDramali reluctantly decided upon a retreat toward Corinth through the [[Dervenaki]] Pass, through which he had just come unmolested. This was exactly what Kolokotronis had been hoping for. In August 1822, his quicker-moving guerrilla forces trapped the Ottomans in the pass and annihilated them in the [[Battle of Dervenakia]].\n\nA devastated Sultan [[Mahmud II]] in [[Constantinople]] was forced to turn to [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], ruler of the nominally Ottoman [[Egypt Eyalet|pashaluk of Egypt]], for help.\n\nThe Greeks resumed the siege against the fortresses at Nafplio, which fell in December. Kolokotronis is said to have ridden his horse up the steep slopes of [[Palamidi]] to celebrate his victory there; a statue in the town square commemorates the event. He is attired in the pseudo-classical uniform of the Greek Light Infantry, which he was fond of wearing.\n\n===Parliamentary crisis===\nFrom December 1823 to February 1825, he took part in the [[Greek civil wars of 1824\u20131825|civil wars]] among the various Greek factions; when his party was finally defeated, he was jailed in [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]] with some of his followers in March 1825, and was released only when an Egyptian army under the command of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] invaded the Morea. His eldest son, [[Panos Kolokotronis]], was killed during the second civil war.\n\n===Against Ibrahim===\n[[File:Kolokotronis statue Athens.jpg|thumb|Statue of Kolokotronis in front of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] in [[Athens]]; work by [[Lazaros Sochos]]]]\n\nIbrahim was fresh from fighting the [[Wahhabi]] rebels in [[Arabia]], and so was used to fighting guerrillas. His troops were armed with the most modern equipment and trained by European experts. The sultan had promised his father the island of [[Crete]] as an [[appanage]] for young Ibrahim if he could crush the rebels. With his eye on the prize, he burned his way through the Peloponnese, gaining much territory but arousing much hostility in western European [[public opinion]], which in the long run proved disastrous for the Ottomans.\n\nThe island of [[Sphacteria]] and [[Pylos|Navarino]] had already fallen into Ibrahim's hands, and to make matters worse for Kolokotronis, he still had to be on guard against the machinations of Petros Mavromichalis even as he was bracing himself against the new threat. \n\nKolokotronis decided to not confront Ibrahim in an open field battle and used guerrilla tactics and [[Scorched earth|scorched earth]] policy against him; but given his limited resources, was unable to prevent the widespread destruction that Ibrahim left in his wake. Still, in 1825, in recognition of his military acumen and many services to the Greek cause, he was appointed commander-in-chief of Greek forces in the Peloponnese.\n\n==Postbellum activities==\nAfter the war, Kolokotronis became a supporter of Count [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] and a proponent of alliance with [[Russia]]. When the count was assassinated on 8 October 1831, Kolokotronis created his own administration in support of [[Otto of Greece|Prince Otto of Bavaria]] as a King of Greece. However, later he opposed the [[Bavaria]]n-dominated [[Regent|regency]] during his rule. On 7 June 1834, he was accused, with [[Dimitrios Plapoutas]], for conspiracy against the regency, charged with [[treason]] and sentenced to death, though they were ultimately pardoned in 1835. \n\nTheodoros Kolokotronis died in 1843 in [[Athens]] one day after his son Konstantinos's (Kollinos) wedding and after a feast at the Royal Palace, in presence of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]].\n\n==Epilogue==\nIn the twilight of his life, Kolokotronis had learned to write in order to complete his [[memoir]]s, which have been a perennial favorite in Greece, and have been translated several times in English and other languages. Kolokotronis's famed helmet, along with the rest of his arms and armor, may today be seen in the [[National Historical Museum of Greece]] in Athens. In addition to the Nafplio statue mentioned earlier, there is another to be seen in Athens, in the forecourt of the [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament building]] on [[Stadiou Street]], near [[Syntagma Square]].\n\n==Legacy==\n*Kolokotronis is also the name of military barracks near [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].\n*\u039a\u03bflokotronis was so famous in popular culture that one can find references about him in strange places, like a gravure sculpted by knife on a stony sterna inside a cave in one of the holes in mount Ntaouli opposite the village [[Lyrkeia]] in the valley of the [[Inachos (river)|Inachos river]].\n*A portrait of Kolokotronis was depicted on the Greek 5000 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1984\u20132002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drachma|publisher=Bank of Greece|year=2008|url=http://www.bankofgreece.gr/Pages/en/Euro/drachma.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Peytier - Kololotronis and his personal escort.jpg|\"Kololotronis and his personal escort\" by Pierre Peytier\nFile:Kolokotronis uniform.jpg|Kolokotronis' helmet, weapons and equipment, [[Old Parliament House, Athens|Old Parliament House]]\nFile:Evlahos kolokotronis dervenakia.jpg|Statue of Kolokotronis at [[Dervenakia]]\nFile:Kolokotronis Theodore.JPG|Portrait by Dionysios Tsokos\nFile:Kolokotronis.jpg|Colocotroni by Giovanni Boggi\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis (1838).jpg|Colocotroni by [[Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville]]\nFile:Theodoros Kolokotronis monument.jpg|Kolokotronis's monument in the [[First Cemetery of Athens]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=The Movement for Greek Independence, 1770\u20131821: A Collection of Documents|year=1976|location=New York|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-0-06-491216-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWJoAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Clogg|first=Richard|title=A Concise History of Greece|year=2013|origyear=1992|location=Cambridge and New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-10-765644-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M492AgAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Fleming|first=K.E.|title=Greece:A Jewish History|year=2008|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-40-083401-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vIneSflMcC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Keridis|first=Dimitris|title=Historical Dictionary of Modern Greece|year=2009|location=|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-81-086312-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ERJI1jLruQC|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Kolokotronis|first1=Theodoros|last2=Edmonds|first2=Elizabeth M.

In most recent years, the nine preliminary rounds of the tournament have been held over three days from 29\u201331 December, with the elimination rounds being held on 2 January and the Grand Final on 3 January.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|title=About the World Universities Debating Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926120735/http://wudc.yaledebate.org/wudctemp/?page_id=114|archive-date=Sep 26, 2018|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the championship has varied from about 150 to 400 teams, depending on the capacity of the host institution. With judges and organisers, this involves 500 to 1,000 participants in all.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe competition involves nine preliminary rounds, which become \"power-paired\" as the tournament progresses, matching the strongest-performing teams against each other. Two teams form the \"government\" (\"proposition\" in the UK and North America) and two the \"opposition\" in each debate room. The process of scoring and pairing these teams is known as \"tabbing\". The scoring of teams is done by judges, most of whom are students or former students from the competing institutions, who return \"ballots\" with their scores to the adjudication team, led by a Chief Adjudicator who is assisted by one or more deputies. The deputies are not members of the host institution.\n\nThe nine preliminary rounds are followed by a \"break\" at which the teams proceeding to elimination rounds are announced. This is traditionally done on [[New Year's Eve]], although this is subject to the timing of the tournament. In the current tournament format, the top 16 teams from the preliminary rounds proceed to the octofinal round. The teams ranked 17-48 also break into a partial double octofinal round, and the winning teams from this round join the teams ranked 1-16 in the octo-finals. While preliminary rounds are usually judged by three to five judges, the break rounds are judged by panels of five, semifinal judged by panels of seven and the finals by panels of nine.\n\nSeparate breaks are announced for the English-as-a-second language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign language (EFL) team competitions, for the individual [[public speaking]] competition, and the \"World Masters\" tournament which is participated in by judges (most of whom are no longer students) representing the countries where they studied or of which they are citizens. In addition, a comedy competition is also open to all participants in Worlds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about The World Universities Debating Championship 2020|last=|first=|date=2019|website=The 40th World Universities Debating Championship|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190822052538/http://www.wudc2020.au.edu/index.php/about-wudc-menu/about-wudc|archive-date=Aug 22, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe World Universities Debating Council consists of representatives of every country that competes at the World Universities Debating Championship. Each country selects one council delegate (the national debating association president, or selected from the participants at Worlds). The Council is responsible for setting the rules and awarding the right to host the championships.\n\nA Worlds Committee is elected to discuss issues during the year as Council only meets at the championships itself.  This Committee consists of a mix of elected officers and regional representatives from [[Africa]], the [[Americas]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], Continental [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], and the [[British Isles]] (referred to in debating as [[Islands of the North Atlantic]] thought more [[Political Correctness|politically acceptable]] than [[British Isles]]).\n\nThe Council formerly operated not unlike the [[United Nations Security Council]], with seven nations holding \"[[charter|charter member]] status\" \u2013 the United States, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.  A two-thirds majority of these countries was required for changes to the championship's [[constitution]], irrespective of how the general vote was tallied. However, as the number of non-charter nations attending grew, many fielding far more teams than some of the upper tier, and the championship began being hosted outside the Charter nations, pressure grew for the distinction to be eliminated.\n\nThe modern championship grants voting strength of between one and four votes per country, based on numbers of institutions attending recent championships. To allow for fluctuations in participation due to the financial difference in attending championships nearer or further in succeeding years, nations lose or gain their voting strength gradually.\n\n== Notable controversies ==\n\n=== Thailand WUDC 2020 ===\nThere was concern over the public debate of Hong Kong in the Open Grand Final motion. This lead to walk-outs during the debate. After the live-stream, all recordings of the debate were deleted and the motion was erased from the tabulation software. Many participants had names removed from the public record retroactively once the competition was over. The organising committee claims this was done to respect participants' privacy and denies pressure from any national body or representative.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cape Town WUDC 2019 ===\nAccusations of racism were made against members of the organising committee over treatment of participants. On the last day of the competition and just before the Open Grand Final was to begin, an organised protest took place and disrupted the event. Rather than delay the Open Grand Final, speakers and judges were relocated to an undisclosed room and the debate took place in private. This action was the subject of further controversy due to perceived undermining of an anti-racist cause.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|title='Racism' mars world university debate championships at UCT|last=|first=|date=Jan 9, 2019|website=Independent Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605055307/https://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/news/racism-mars-world-university-debate-championships-at-uct-18745624|archive-date=Jun 5, 2019|access-date=Apr 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Chennai Worlds 2014|Chennai WUDC 2014]] ===\nThis tournament is notable for several controversies.

The Jews were not allowed to leave the Pale or own land outside it. They were removed from their homes and villages and once resettled, barred from all but a handful of professions. The crowded conditions and legal barriers to self-sufficiency led to deepening poverty for the Pale's four million inhabitants. After the reforms of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in the 1860s, the situation improved for some Jews but those in the Pale remained trapped by economic hardship and dismal conditions. In 1880, [[Samuel Polyakov]], [[Horace de Gunzburg]] and [[Nikolai Bakst]] petitioned [[Tsar Alexander II]] for permission to start an assistance fund which would improve the lives of the millions of Russian Jews then living in poverty. The fund would provide education and training in practical occupations like handicrafts and agricultural skills and would help people to help themselves.\n\nPermission was granted and the appeal was sent out, signed by Poliakov and de Gunzburg as well as Abram Zak, Leon Rosenthal and Meer Fridland, leading to the establishment of the Society for Trades and Agricultural Labor among the Jews in Russia was established. In its first 25 years, ORT raised educational standards and provided training to 25,000 Jews across the [[Russian Empire]]. People trained as artisans in glass-blowing, learned sewing and gardening, trained as mechanics, cabinetmakers, and furniture designers <ref>[http://www.ort.org/asp/article.asp?id=117 About ORT]</ref>\n\nThe first programs created by ORT were dictated by the demands of the market. In 1909, the industrialization in Russia created a need for artisans, so ORT developed courses for electricians in [[Vilna]] where electric streetcars were being introduced. They offered automotive courses in [[St. Petersburg]] when the automobile began taking root there in 1910. ORT\u2019s training programs varied to meet the needs of Jews depending on where they lived and what the gaps in the workforce were. That flexibility and diversity meant that ORT became an established educational leader in many fields within only its first few decades of existence.\n\nAfter World War I, ORT opened agricultural schools to provide tools and training for agricultural enterprises. ORT headquarters moved to [[Berlin]] in 1921, after the Bolshevik Revolution. Initially, the Berlin office dealt mainly with fundraising and support for Jewish education in other countries where the Jews were less well-off. When the Nazis rose to power in 1933, Jewish children were expelled from German schools. ORT sought to open a school in Berlin but encountered difficulties due to the ban on selling property to Jews. Using its international ties, the British branch of ORT purchased a school building and dormitory in the Moabit quarter of Berlin. It received authorization to open in April 1937 after promising that all graduates would leave the country upon graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/the-last-jewish-school-in-berlin-1.423958|title=The last Jewish school in Berlin|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n \nLater ORT headquarters moved to [[France]] and finally to [[Geneva]]. Local groups such as [[American ORT]] and Women's American ORT, ORT Canada and British ORT were formed to support the growing network of programs. In 1938, Stalinist purges forced the closure of ORT programs in the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nDuring World War II, ORT continued to serve Jewish communities, including those under Nazi occupation. In the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], the German authorities gave ORT permission to open vocational training courses. Those courses continued throughout the war and until the liquidation of the Ghetto. They served as a template for similar ORT programs in other Jewish centers like [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] and [[Kaunas]].\n\nAfter the end of World War II, ORT established rehabilitation programs for the survivors.

New computer labs and whiteboard technology provide a new opportunity for students. The program works with local authorities, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, and marks a new phase in ORT\u2019s commitment to bring the best practical education available to the Jewish State.\n* '''Regeneration CIS''': This program aimed to bring quality Judaic and general high school education to Jewish communities throughout the independent sovereign states of the region that was formerly the Soviet Union. In order to complete its mission for the renewed program, ORT ensures that equipment and services in existing centers are maintained and fully operational, to upgrade systems to enable them to deliver enhanced options, to provide school-wide training to ensure that all staff is able to deliver the new materials, and to provide ongoing staffing and resources.

Despite improvement in recent years, the disparity in literacy rates between men and women still remains. In 2001, the rate of literacy for females stood at 42.49%. The low rate of literacy for women can be attributed to the discrimination they face at home.\n\nFemales face gender-based violence and this greatly limits their ability to attend school or receive proper education. Furthermore, religion restricts the opportunities for women to receive education. For example, the majority of the female [[Muslim]] population in Nepal is still deprived of [[basic education]], with only 20% having had any level of education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department for International Development Nepal, DFIDN Nepal Operational Plan: Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Annex|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/nepal-2011-annex.pdf|publisher=Dfid.gov.uk|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe percentage of women from rural areas who have never attended school: 51.1% (CBS, 2008) as compared to the percentage of women from urban areas who have never  attended school is 25% (CBS, 2008). This is reflected in the disparity in literacy rates, between women in rural areas, 36.5%, and those in urban areas, 61.5%. Literacy rates in rural areas are almost half that in urban areas. Although overall female participation in the workforce has increased, the majority of employed women are still heavily concentrated in the low-wage and more labor-intensive industries. Formal sector female participation is 6%. According to the 2008 report from CBS, there were 155 000 male professionals, but only 48 000 female professionals, about 31% of female professionals.

As females, especially girls, are considered to be of the lowest status in the household, they are often the last to eat and thus do not receive the proper nutrition required. Almost 70% of females who have reached puberty suffer from these common illnesses. Also, many women often delay seeking medical help out of fear.\n\nThe [[maternal mortality ratio]] in Nepal, stands at 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2008, according to estimates by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]]/[[UNFPA]]/[[The World Bank]]. Although there has been a significant decrease as compared to the ratio of 539 per 100 000 live births in 2003, the ratio is still one of the highest in the world.\nBecause of the inadequate provision of healthcare for pregnant mothers, they are more susceptible to death during the course of pregnancy and during labor itself. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2001, about 10% of all births are carried out in the presence of a qualified doctor or medical staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr132/fr132.pdf|title=Demographic and Health Survey|publisher=World Summit for Children Indicators, 2001|date=|website=DHS program|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This reflects the prevalence of [[home births]], around 81% of all births, in Nepalese society. Due to the cultural beliefs, women are generally reluctant to allow any outsiders to be present or attend to the birth. [[Geography of Nepal|Geography]] has also greatly limited the availability of health services especially those in rural and mountainous regions. Even though there has been much road development in recent years, females are less impacted by it, as they remain infrequent road users.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics National Planning Commission Secretariat Government of Nepal|title=REPORT ON THE NEPAL LABOUR FORCE SURVEY 2008|url=http://cbs.gov.np/image/data/Surveys/2015/NLFS-2008%20Report.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Gender-Based Violence to women==\n[[Gender-based violence]] (GBV) towards women is a severe issue in [[Nepal]] where its women often find themselves susceptible to both public and domestic violence which constitutes rape, sexual abuse in the workplace and at home, and [[human trafficking]]. There is a persistence of harmful traditional practices deemed life-threatening such as [[Deuki]] (act of offering young girls to Hindu temples to live without proper care or education) and [[Chhaupadi]] (menstruating women are kept in a shed away from the home to live under harsh conditions).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/06/in-nepal-tradition-is-killing-women-chhaupadi-womens-rights-menstruation/|title=In Nepal, Tradition Is Killing Women|last=Cousins|first=Sophie|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref> Based on the study by [[United Nations Population Fund]]\u2019s (UNFPA) entitled Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women in Nepal, abused women are more inclined to suffer from depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and various reproductive health problems.\n\nIn the recently published Nepal Human Rights Yearbook 2012 by Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a study of all 75 districts across the country returned results of 648 women as victims of violence in 2011. In addition, the number of girls under the age of 18 who were affected stands at 379.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insec.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/RS2696_20.-Nepal-Human-Rights-Year-Book-2012-English.pdf|title=Nepal Human Rights Year Book 2012|author=Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC)|date=|website=INSEC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe proportion of Nepali women who have been subjected to domestic violence are estimated at 60 to 70 per cent. Gender-based violence is worse in rural communities where an estimated 81 per cent of women experience recurring domestic violence. These incidences include physical abuse by husbands, [[polygamy]], dowry-related murders, and physical and psychological harassment by household members.\n\nReasons for gender-based violence in Nepal are largely attributed to social taboos and superstitions associated with women and deeply entrenched beliefs that propagate derogatory attitudes toward female such as Chhori ko janma hare ko karma (\"A daughter is born with a doomed fate\"). Likewise, results derived from INSEC\u2019s monitoring of the situation indicated that subjugating women to domestic violence was considered a deep-rooted traditional practice. Survey results also show that 20 and 23 per cent of men and women in Nepal view domestic violence as being acceptable.\n\nDespite efforts of various human rights and women\u2019s rights [[NGOs]], together with international aid agencies, to lobby for the elimination of domestic violence through implementation of more effective measures, the \"Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment)\" bill introduced in 2002 is at a standstill. Complaints by women\u2019s rights activists are directed towards the lackadaisical efforts of the law enforcement agencies in which disputes are settled without any charges pressed against the perpetrators. This is reflected in a statement by activist and former [[National Women's Commission|National Women Commission]] (NWC) chairperson [[Bandana Rana]], \"Often, police and local people try to settle the domestic dispute by pressing the women into accepting their \u2018fate\u2019 as the society is still dominated by Hindu patriarchy with its own set of strict codes\u2014many of which are in conflict with basic rights for women\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Women in Nepal]]\n*[[Third gender rights in Nepal]]\n*[[Bandana Rana]]\n*[[Chhaupadi]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Women's rights in}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights by country]]\n[[Category:Nepalese society]]\n[[Category:Sexism in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Women's rights in Asia|Nepal]]\n[[Category:Feminism in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Women in Nepal]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Nepal]], a Himalayan country situated in [[South Asia]], is [[List of Poorest Countries|one of the poorest countries of the world]].

For example, the majority of the female [[Muslim]] population in Nepal is still deprived of [[basic education]], with only 20% having had any level of education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department for International Development Nepal, DFIDN Nepal Operational Plan: Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Annex|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/nepal-2011-annex.pdf|publisher=Dfid.gov.uk|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe percentage of women from rural areas who have never attended school: 51.1% (CBS, 2008) as compared to the percentage of women from urban areas who have never  attended school is 25% (CBS, 2008). This is reflected in the disparity in literacy rates, between women in rural areas, 36.5%, and those in urban areas, 61.5%. Literacy rates in rural areas are almost half that in urban areas. Although overall female participation in the workforce has increased, the majority of employed women are still heavily concentrated in the low-wage and more labor-intensive industries. Formal sector female participation is 6%. According to the 2008 report from CBS, there were 155 000 male professionals, but only 48 000 female professionals, about 31% of female professionals. This is in stark contrast to female participation in the [[subsistence agricultural]] sector, with female participation almost 160% that of male participation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDue to the growing inequality and violence against women, free legal aid was made available by the government of Nepal through the enactment of Legal Aid Act 1997, though the majority target groups of women, children and disenfranchised are unable to access it.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Becker|first=Margaret|date=3 April 2015|title=Constructing SSLM: Insights from Struggles over Women's Rights in Nepal|journal=Asian Studies Review|volume=39|issue=2|pages=247\u2013265|doi=10.1080/10357823.2015.1021754|issn=1035-7823|doi-access=free}}</ref> Women's rights were only taken seriously once Nepal was under [[Democracy|democratic]] rule post 1990, and a constitution was formed stating equality between men and women as a fundamental right.

As females, especially girls, are considered to be of the lowest status in the household, they are often the last to eat and thus do not receive the proper nutrition required. Almost 70% of females who have reached puberty suffer from these common illnesses. Also, many women often delay seeking medical help out of fear.\n\nThe [[maternal mortality ratio]] in Nepal, stands at 380 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2008, according to estimates by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]]/[[UNFPA]]/[[The World Bank]]. Although there has been a significant decrease as compared to the ratio of 539 per 100 000 live births in 2003, the ratio is still one of the highest in the world.\nBecause of the inadequate provision of healthcare for pregnant mothers, they are more susceptible to death during the course of pregnancy and during labor itself. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2001, about 10% of all births are carried out in the presence of a qualified doctor or medical staff<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/fr132/fr132.pdf|title=Demographic and Health Survey|publisher=World Summit for Children Indicators, 2001|date=|website=DHS program|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. This reflects the prevalence of [[home births]], around 81% of all births, in Nepalese society. Due to the cultural beliefs, women are generally reluctant to allow any outsiders to be present or attend to the birth. [[Geography of Nepal|Geography]] has also greatly limited the availability of health services especially those in rural and mountainous regions. Even though there has been much road development in recent years, females are less impacted by it, as they remain infrequent road users.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics National Planning Commission Secretariat Government of Nepal|title=REPORT ON THE NEPAL LABOUR FORCE SURVEY 2008|url=http://cbs.gov.np/image/data/Surveys/2015/NLFS-2008%20Report.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Gender-Based Violence to women==\n[[Gender-based violence]] (GBV) towards women is a severe issue in [[Nepal]] where its women often find themselves susceptible to both public and domestic violence which constitutes rape, sexual abuse in the workplace and at home, and [[human trafficking]]. There is a persistence of harmful traditional practices deemed life-threatening such as [[Deuki]] (act of offering young girls to Hindu temples to live without proper care or education) and [[Chhaupadi]] (menstruating women are kept in a shed away from the home to live under harsh conditions)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/06/in-nepal-tradition-is-killing-women-chhaupadi-womens-rights-menstruation/|title=In Nepal, Tradition Is Killing Women|last=Cousins|first=Sophie|website=Foreign Policy|language=en-US|access-date=10 March 2020}}</ref>. Based on the study by [[United Nations Population Fund]]\u2019s (UNFPA) entitled Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women in Nepal, abused women are more inclined to suffer from depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, sexual dysfunction and various reproductive health problems.\n\nIn the recently published Nepal Human Rights Yearbook 2012 by Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), a study of all 75 districts across the country returned results of 648 women as victims of violence in 2011. In addition, the number of girls under the age of 18 who were affected stands at 379.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insec.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/RS2696_20.-Nepal-Human-Rights-Year-Book-2012-English.pdf|title=Nepal Human Rights Year Book 2012|author=Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC)|date=|website=INSEC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe proportion of Nepali women who have been subjected to domestic violence are estimated at 60 to 70 per cent. Gender-based violence is worse in rural communities where an estimated 81 per cent of women experience recurring domestic violence. These incidences include physical abuse by husbands, [[polygamy]], dowry-related murders, and physical and psychological harassment by household members.\n\nReasons for gender-based violence in Nepal are largely attributed to social taboos and superstitions associated with women and deeply entrenched beliefs that propagate derogatory attitudes toward female such as Chhori ko janma hare ko karma (\"A daughter is born with a doomed fate\"). Likewise, results derived from INSEC\u2019s monitoring of the situation indicated that subjugating women to domestic violence was considered a deep-rooted traditional practice. Survey results also show that 20 and 23 per cent of men and women in Nepal view domestic violence as being acceptable.\n\nDespite efforts of various human rights and women\u2019s rights [[NGOs]], together with international aid agencies, to lobby for the elimination of domestic violence through implementation of more effective measures, the \"Domestic Violence (Crime and Punishment)\" bill introduced in 2002 is at a standstill. Complaints by women\u2019s rights activists are directed towards the lackadaisical efforts of the law enforcement agencies in which disputes are settled without any charges pressed against the perpetrators. This is reflected in a statement by activist and former [[National Women's Commission|National Women Commission]] (NWC) chairperson [[Bandana Rana]], \"Often, police and local people try to settle the domestic dispute by pressing the women into accepting their \u2018fate\u2019 as the society is still dominated by Hindu patriarchy with its own set of strict codes\u2014many of which are in conflict with basic rights for women\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Women in Nepal]]\n*[[Third gender rights in Nepal]]\n*[[Bandana Rana]]\n*[[Chhaupadi]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Asia topic|Women's rights in}}\n\n[[Category:Women's rights by country]]\n[[Category:Nepalese society]]\n[[Category:Sexism in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Women's rights in Asia|Nepal]]\n[[Category:Feminism in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Women in Nepal]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights_in_Nepal"}
