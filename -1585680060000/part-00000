It begins just before the [[Hundred Days]] period (when [[Napoleon]] returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. His plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty.\n\nThe book is considered a [[literary classic]] today. According to [[Luc Sante]], \"''The Count of Monte Cristo'' has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's flood]], and the story of [[Little Red Riding Hood]].\"<ref>Alexandre Dumas, ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' 2004, Barnes & Noble Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-1-59308-333-5}}. p. xxv (TCMC)</ref>\n\n==Background to the plot==\nDumas wrote<ref>''[http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/bibliotheque/chapitre.php?lid=m1&cid=28 Etat civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo]'' in ''Causeries'', chapter IX (1857). See also the introduction of the ''[[Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade|Pl\u00e9iade]]'' edition of ''Le comte de Monte-Cristo'' (1981)</ref> that the idea of revenge in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' came from a story in a book compiled by [[Jacques Peuchet]], a French police archivist, published in 1838 after the death of the author.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYBAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false Le Diamant et la Vengeance]'' in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYBAAAAAcAAJ M\u00e9moires tir\u00e9s des Archives de la Police de Paris]'', vol. 5, chapter LXXIV, p. 197</ref> Dumas included this essay in one of the editions from 1846.<ref>''True Stories of Immortal Crimes'', H. Ashton-Wolfe, 1931, E. P. Dutton & Co., pp. 16\u201317</ref> Peuchet told of a shoemaker, [[Pierre Picaud]], living in [[N\u00eemes]] in 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the [[Fenestrelle Fort]], where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the cleric died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which were printed the words \"Number One\", and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fianc\u00e9e while Picaud was under arrest.\n\nIn another of the \"True Stories\", Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family. This story, also quoted in the Pleiade edition, obviously served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pleiade edition mentions other sources from real life: [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]] existed and died in 1819 after a life with much resemblance to that of the Faria in the novel. As for Dant\u00e8s, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet's book, since the latter is murdered by the \"Caderousse\" of the plot. But Dant\u00e8s has \"alter egos\" in two other Dumas works; in \"Pauline\" from 1838, and more significantly in \"Georges\" from 1843, where a young man with black ancestry is preparing a revenge against white people who had humiliated him.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This appears to be a plot summary of the abridged edition. Some details as to the unabridged edition would be welcome. -->\n\n===Summary===\nOn the day of his wedding to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]], first mate of the ''Pharaon'', is incorrectly accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned without trial in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'If]], a grim island fortress off [[Marseille]]. A fellow prisoner, Abb\u00e9 Faria, correctly deduces that his jealous rival Fernand Mondego, envious crewmate Danglars, and double-dealing magistrate De Villefort turned him in. Faria inspires his escape and guides him to a fortune in [[treasure]]. As the powerful and mysterious Count of [[Montecristo|Monte Cristo]] ([[Italy]]), he arrives from the Orient to enter the fashionable Parisian world of the 1830s and avenge himself on the men who conspired to destroy him.\n\n===Edmond Dant\u00e8s===\n[[File:Edmond Dant\u00e8s.JPG|thumb|The main character Edmond Dant\u00e8s was a merchant sailor before his imprisonment. (Illustration by [[Pierre-Gustave Staal]])]]\nIn 1815, Edmond Dant\u00e8s, a young [[merchant]] [[sailor]] who has recently been granted the succession of his captain Lecl\u00e8re, returns to [[Marseille]] to marry his [[Catalans|Catalan]] fianc\u00e9e Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. Lecl\u00e8re, a supporter of the exiled [[Napoleon]], found himself dying at sea and charged Dant\u00e8s to deliver two objects: a package to [[Henri Gatien Bertrand|General Bertrand]] (exiled with Napoleon on [[Elba]]), and a letter from Elba to an unknown man in Paris. On the eve of Dant\u00e8s' wedding to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, Fernand Mondego (Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s' cousin and a rival for her affections) is given advice by Dant\u00e8s' colleague Danglars (who is jealous of Dant\u00e8s' rapid rise to captain) to send an anonymous note accusing Dant\u00e8s of being a [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist traitor]]. Caderousse (Dant\u00e8s' cowardly and selfish neighbor) is drunk while the two conspirators set the trap for Dant\u00e8s and stays quiet as Dant\u00e8s is arrested, then sentenced. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, destroys the letter from Elba when he discovers that it is addressed to his own father, Noirtier (who is a Bonapartist), since if this letter came into official hands, it would destroy his ambitions and reputation as a staunch [[Royalist]]. To silence Dant\u00e8s, he condemns him without [[Trial by ordeal|trial]] to life imprisonment.\n\nAfter six years of imprisonment in the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, Dant\u00e8s is on the verge of suicide when he befriends the [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]] (\"The Mad Priest\"), an Italian fellow prisoner who had dug an escape tunnel that ended up in Dant\u00e8s' cell. Over the next eight years, Faria gives Dant\u00e8s an extensive education in language, culture, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and science. Knowing himself to be close to death, Faria tells Dant\u00e8s the location of a treasure on the small island of Monte Cristo. When Faria dies, Dant\u00e8s takes his place in the burial sack. When the guards throw the sack into the sea, Dant\u00e8s breaks through and swims to a nearby island. He is rescued by a [[smuggling]] ship that passes Monte Cristo. Fearing the members of the ship will find him and his treasure, he used the excuse of hunting sheep while he actually went to hunt the treasure. To stay on the island (to furthermore find his treasure for he has not found it yet), Dant\u00e8s pretends he has a broken back. Six days later, the smuggling ship comes back for him and he boards it carrying with him only a few diamonds which are carefully hidden. In port, Dant\u00e8s trades these diamonds for a yacht and then starts sail to Monte Cristo again to claim the rest of his treasure.  After recovering the treasure, Dant\u00e8s returns to Marseille. He later purchases the island of Monte Cristo and the title of [[Count]] from the Tuscan government.\n\n[[File:James O'Neill as Abbe Busoni.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Actor [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]] as the Abb\u00e9 Busoni]]\n\nTraveling as the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, Dant\u00e8s meets Caderousse, now living in poverty, who regrets not intervening and possibly saving Dant\u00e8s from prison. He gives Caderousse a diamond that can be either a chance to redeem himself or a trap that will lead to his ruin. Learning that his old employer Morrel is on the verge of bankruptcy, Dant\u00e8s buys Morrel's debts and gives Morrel three months to fulfill his obligations. At the end of the three months and with no way to repay his debts, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that his debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dant\u00e8s.\n\n===The Count of Monte Cristo===\n\nReappearing as the rich Count of Monte Cristo, Dant\u00e8s begins his revenge on the three men responsible for his unjust imprisonment: Fernand, now Count de Morcerf and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s' husband; Danglars, now a baron and a wealthy banker; and Villefort, now ''[[Prosecutor|procureur du roi]]'' (prosecutor for the king). The Count appears first in Rome, where he becomes acquainted with the Baron Franz d'\u00c9pinay, and Viscount Albert de Morcerf, the son of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and Fernand. Dant\u00e8s arranges for the young Morcerf to be captured by the bandit Luigi Vampa and then seemingly rescues him from Vampa's gang. Albert, feeling a debt of gratitude to the Count for his rescue, agrees to introduce the Count into Parisian society. The Count then moves to Paris and dazzles Danglars with his wealth, persuading him to extend him a credit of six million francs. The Count manipulates the bond market and quickly destroys a large portion of Danglars' fortune. The rest of it begins to rapidly disappear through mysterious bankruptcies, suspensions of payment, and more bad luck in the Stock Exchange.\n\nVillefort had once conducted an affair with Madame Danglars. She became pregnant and delivered the child in the house that the Count has now purchased. To cover up the affair, Villefort told Madame Danglars that the infant was stillborn, smothered the child, and thinking him to be dead, buried him in the garden. While Villefort was burying the child, he was stabbed by the smuggler Bertuccio, who unearthed the child and resuscitated him. Bertuccio's sister-in-law brought the child up, giving him the name \"Benedetto\". Benedetto takes up a life of crime as he grows into adolescence. He robs his adoptive mother (Bertuccio's sister-in-law) and ends up killing her, then runs away. Bertuccio later becomes the Count's servant and informs him of this history.\n\nBenedetto is [[Galley slave#Early modern era|sentenced to the galleys]] with Caderousse, who had sold the diamond but killed both his wife and the buyer out of greed. After Benedetto and Caderousse are freed by Dant\u00e8s, using the alias \"Lord Wilmore,\" the Count induces Benedetto to take the identity of \"Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti\" and introduces him into Parisian society. Andrea ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eug\u00e9nie to Andrea (not knowing they are half-siblings) after cancelling her engagement to Albert. Meanwhile, Caderousse blackmails Andrea, threatening to reveal his past if he doesn't share his new-found wealth. Cornered by \"Abb\u00e9 Busoni\" while attempting to rob the Count's house, Caderousse begs to be given another chance. Dant\u00e8s forces him to write a letter to Danglars exposing Cavalcanti as an impostor and allows Caderousse to leave the house. The moment Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Andrea. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement identifying his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse moments before he dies.\n\nYears before, [[Ali Pasha of Janina]] had been betrayed to the Turks by Fernand. After Ali's death, Fernand sold Ali's wife [[Kyra Vassiliki|Vasiliki]] and his daughter Hayd\u00e9e into slavery. While Vasiliki died shortly thereafter, Dant\u00e8s purchased Hayd\u00e9e. The Count manipulates Danglars into researching the event, which is published in a newspaper. As a result, Fernand is investigated by his peers and disgraced. When Albert blames the Count for his father's downfall and challenges him to a duel, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, having already recognized Monte Cristo as Dant\u00e8s, goes to the Count and begs him to spare her son. During this interview, she learns the truth of his arrest and imprisonment but still convinces the Count not to kill her son. Realizing that Edmond now intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, which causes Albert to make a public apology to the Count. Albert and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s disown Fernand and leave his house. Fernand is confronted with Dant\u00e8s' true identity and shoots himself. Albert and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives.\n\nValentine, Villefort's daughter by his late first wife, stands to inherit the fortune of her grandfather (Noirtier) and of her mother's parents (the Saint-M\u00e9rans), while Villefort's second wife H\u00e9lo\u00efse seeks the fortune for her son \u00c9douard. The Count is aware of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's intentions and introduces her to the technique of poison. H\u00e9lo\u00efse fatally poisons the Saint-M\u00e9rans, so that Valentine inherits their fortune. Valentine is briefly disinherited by Noirtier in an attempt to prevent Valentine's impending marriage with Franz d'\u00c9pinay, whom she does not love; however, the marriage is cancelled when d'\u00c9pinay learns that his father (believed assassinated by Bonapartists) was actually killed by Noirtier in a fair duel. After a failed attempt on Noirtier's life which leaves Noirtier's servant Barrois dead, H\u00e9lo\u00efse targets Valentine so that \u00c9douard will get the fortune. However, Valentine is the prime suspect in her father's eyes in the deaths of the Saint-M\u00e9rans and Barrois. On learning that Morrel's son Maximilien is in love with Valentine, the Count saves her by making it appear as though H\u00e9lo\u00efse's plan to poison Valentine has succeeded and that Valentine is dead. Villefort learns from Noirtier that H\u00e9lo\u00efse is the real murderer and confronts her, giving her the choice of a public execution or committing suicide.\n\nFleeing after Caderousse's letter exposes him, Andrea is arrested and returned to Paris, where Villefort prosecutes him. While in prison awaiting trial, Andrea is visited by Bertuccio, who tells him the truth about his father. At his trial, Andrea reveals that he is Villefort's son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive. Villefort admits his guilt and flees the court. He rushes home to stop his wife's suicide but is too late; she has poisoned her son as well. Dant\u00e8s confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, but this drives Villefort insane. Dant\u00e8s tries but fails to resuscitate \u00c9douard, causing him to question if he has gone too far.\n\nAfter the Count's manipulation of the bond market, Danglars is left with a destroyed reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfil their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. Abandoning his wife, Danglars flees to Italy with the Count's receipt and 50,000 francs. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by the Count's agent Luigi Vampa and is imprisoned. Forced to pay exorbitant prices for food and nearly starved to death, Danglars signs away his ill-gotten gains. Dant\u00e8s anonymously returns the stolen money to the hospitals. Danglars finally repents his crimes, and a softened Dant\u00e8s forgives him and allows him to leave with his freedom and 50,000 francs.\n\nMaximilien Morrel, believing Valentine to be dead, contemplates suicide after her funeral. Dant\u00e8s reveals his true identity and explains that he rescued Morrel's father from bankruptcy years earlier; he then tells Maximilien to reconsider his suicide, and Maximilien is saved.\n\nOn the island of Monte Cristo, Dant\u00e8s presents Valentine to Maximilien and reveals the true sequence of events. Having found peace, Dant\u00e8s now leaves the newly reunited couple part of his fortune on the island and departs for an unknown destination to find comfort and a new life with Hayd\u00e9e, who has declared her love for him. The reader is left with a final thought: \"all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope'\". \n[[File:CountOfMonteCristoRelations.svg|thumb|800px|center| Character relationships in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'']]\n\n==Characters==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n\n===Edmond Dant\u00e8s and his aliases===\n* [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]] (born 1796): A sailor with good prospects, engaged to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.

In the end, she returns to Marseilles, living in the house that belonged to father Dant\u00e8s, given to her by Monte-Cristo himself (to allow the woman a safe and stable place to spend in quietness the rest of her days, with a little financial support: the same francs the young Dant\u00e8s, before the arrest, used to keep aside in view of their wedding, in a little bag remained hidden in the house's garden for all that time), praying for Albert, who left France for Africa as a soldier to start a new and more honorable life. Left all alone, she and Edmond talked for the last time: once young and in love, they choose to take different paths, saying farewell to each other. While the Count went away to complete his plan, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s decides to stay in her hometown, with only her memories left of the happiest years, waiting for Albert's return, wishing for Edmond to find peace for his wounded heart and praying on her husband's grave for his soul.

He would later achieve the high-rank of general in the French army and become a peer of France in the Chambre des Pairs, keeping secret his betrayal to the Pasha Al\u00ec Tebelen, and the selling of both his daughter Hayd\u00e9e and her mother Vasiliki. With the money earned he bought the title of \"Count de Morcerf\" to bring wealth and a more pleasant life to him and his family. Through the book he shows a deep affection and care for his wife and son.

Serialization ran from 28 August 1844 to 15 January 1846. The first edition in book form was published in Paris by ''P\u00e9tion'' in 18 volumes with the first two issued in 1844 and the remaining sixteen in 1845.<ref>David Coward (ed), Oxford's World Classics, Dumas, Alexandre, ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', p. xxv</ref> Most of the Belgian pirated editions, the first Paris edition and many others up to the ''L\u00e9crivain et Toubon'' illustrated edition of 1860 feature a misspelling of the title with \"Christo\" used instead of \"Cristo\". The first edition to feature the correct spelling was the ''L'\u00c9cho des Feuilletons'' illustrated edition, Paris 1846. This edition featured plates by [[Paul Gavarni]] and [[Tony Johannot]] and was said to be \"revised\" and \"corrected\", although only the chapter structure appears to have been altered with an additional chapter entitled ''La Maison des All\u00e9es de Meilhan'' having been created by splitting ''Le D\u00e9part'' into two.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Munro|first=Douglas|title=Alexandre Dumas P\u00e8re: a bibliography of works translated into English to 1910|year=1978|publisher=Garland Pub|pages=91\u201392}}</ref>\n\n===English translations===\n\nThe first appearance of ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' in English was the first part of a serialization by W. Francis Ainsworth in volume VII of ''Ainsworth's Magazine'' published in 1845, although this was an abridged summary of the first part of the novel only and was entitled ''The Prisoner of If''. Ainsworth translated the remaining chapters of the novel, again in abridged form, and issued these in volumes VIII and IX of the magazine in 1845 and 1846 respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Another abridged serialization appeared in ''[[The London Journal]]'' between 1846 and 1847.\n\nThe first single volume translation in English was an abridged edition with woodcuts published by Geo Pierce in January 1846 entitled ''The Prisoner of If or The Revenge of Monte Christo''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn April 1846, volume three of the ''Parlour Novelist'', Belfast, Ireland: Simms and M'Intyre, London: W S Orr and Company, featured the first part of an unabridged translation of the novel by [[Emma Lavinia Gifford|Emma Hardy]]. The remaining two parts would be issued as the Count of Monte Christo volumes I and II in volumes 8 and 9 of the Parlour Novelist respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe most common English translation is an anonymous one originally published in 1846 by [[Chapman and Hall]]. This was originally released in ten weekly installments from March 1846 with six pages of letterpress and two illustrations by M Valentin.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Morning Post Front Page |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|newspaper= The Morning Post|date= February 26, 1846 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> The translation was released in book form with all twenty illustrations in two volumes in May 1846, a month after the release of the first part of the above-mentioned translation by Emma Hardy.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The translation follows the revised French edition of 1846, with the correct spelling of \"Cristo\" and the extra chapter ''The House on the All\u00e9es de Meilhan''.\n\nMost English editions of the novel follow the anonymous translation. In 1889, two of the major American publishers ''Little Brown'' and ''T.Y. Crowell'' updated the translation, correcting mistakes and revising the text to reflect the original serialized version. This resulted in the removal of the chapter\n''The House on the All\u00e9es de Meilhan'', with the text restored to the end of the chapter called ''The Departure''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=The Count of Monte Cristo|url=https://archive.org/details/countmontecrist03fiorgoog|year=1889|publisher=Little Brown and Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=The Count of Monte Cristo : or, The Adventures of Edmond Dant\u00e8s|year=1889|publisher=T.Y Crowell}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, [[HarperCollins|Collins]] published an updated version of the anonymous translation which cut several passages, including a whole chapter entitled ''The Past'', and renamed others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=The Count of Monte Cristo with an introduction by Richard Church |year=1955|publisher=Collins}}</ref> This abridgment was republished by many Collins imprints and other publishers including the [[Modern Library]], [[Vintage Books|Vintage]], and the 1998 [[Oxford World's Classics]] edition (later editions restored the text). In 2008 Oxford released a revised edition with translation by David Coward. The 2009 [[Everyman's Library]] edition reprints the original anonymous English translation that first appeared in 1846, with revisions by Peter Washington and an introduction by Umberto Eco.\n\nIn 1996, [[Penguin Books|Penguin Classics]] published a new translation by Robin Buss. Buss' translation updated the language, making the text more accessible to modern readers, and restored content that was modified in the 1846 translation because of Victorian English social restrictions (for example, references to Eug\u00e9nie's lesbian traits and behavior) to reflect Dumas' original version.\n\nIn addition to the above, there have also been many abridged translations such as an 1892 edition published by F.M. Lupton, translated by Henry L. Williams (this translation was also released by M.J. Ivers in 1892 with Williams using the pseudonym of Professor William Thiese).<ref name=\"auto\"/> A more recent abridgment is the translation by Lowell Bair for ''Bantam Classics'' in 1956.\n\nMany abridged translations omit the Count's enthusiasm for [[hashish]]. When serving a hashish jam to the young Frenchman Franz d'\u00c9pinay, the Count (calling himself [[Sinbad the Sailor]]), calls it, \"nothing less than the ambrosia which [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] served at the table of Jupiter.\" When he arrives in Paris, the Count brandishes an emerald box in which he carries small green pills compounded of hashish and opium which he uses for sleeplessness. (Source: Chapters 31, 32, 38, 40, 53 & 77 in the 117-chapter unabridged Pocket Books edition.) Dumas was a member of the [[Club des Hashischins]].\n\nIn June 2017, Manga Classics, an imprint of UDON Entertainment, published The Count of Monte Cristo as a faithfully adapted Manga edition of the classic novel.<ref>Manga Classics: The Count of Monte Cristo (2017) UDON Entertainment\u00a0{{ISBN|978-1927925614}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese translations===\nThe first Japanese translation by [[Kuroiwa Sh\u016broku]] was entitled \"Shigai Shiden Gankutsu-ou\" (\u53f2\u5916\u53f2\u4f1d\u5dcc\u7a9f\u738b, \"a historical story from outside history, the King of the Cavern\"), and serialized from 1901\u20131902 in the [[Yorozu Chouhou]] newspaper, and released in book form in four volumes by publisher [[Aoki Suusandou]] in 1905. Though later translations use the title \"Monte Cristo-haku\" (\u30e2\u30f3\u30c6\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u4f2f, the Count of Monte Cristo), the \"Gankutsu-ou\" title remains highly associated with the novel and is often used as an alternative. As of March 2016, all movie adaptations of the novel brought to Japan used the title \"Gankutsu-ou\", with the exception of the 2002 film, which has it as a subtitle (with the title itself simply being \"Monte Cristo\").\n\nThe novel is popular in Japan, and has spawned numerous adaptations, the most notable of which are the novels [[Meiji Gankutsu-ou]] by [[Taijirou Murasame]] and [[Shin Gankutsu-ou]] by [[Kaitar\u014d Hasegawa]]. Its influence can also be seen in how one of the first prominent cases of miscarriage of justice in Japan, in which an innocent man was charged with murder and imprisoned for half a century, is known in Japanese as the \"Yoshida Gankutsu-ou incident\" (\u5409\u7530\u5ca9\u7a9f\u738b\u4e8b\u4ef6).\n\nA manga adaptation of the novel, titled ''Monte Cristo Hakushaku'' (jap. \u30e2\u30f3\u30c6\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8, \u4f2f\u7235) and made by Ena Moriyama, was published in November 2015.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe original work was published in serial form in the ''Journal des D\u00e9bats'' in 1844.

In the book, Dumas tells of the 1815 return of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], and alludes to contemporary events when the governor at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'If]] is promoted to a position at the castle of Ham.<ref group='Notes' name='a'>On p. 140 of the Pl\u00e9iade edition the governor at the Ch\u00e2teau d'If is promoted to a position at the castle of [[Ham, Somme|Ham]], which is the castle where Louis Napoleon was imprisoned 1840\u201346.</ref> The attitude of Dumas towards \"bonapartisme\" was conflicted. His father, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]],<ref group='Notes' name='b'>Thomas Alexandre Dumas was also known as Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie.</ref> a [[Haiti]]an of [[Multiracial|mixed descent]], became a successful general during the [[French Revolution]]. New racial-discrimination laws were applied in 1802. The general was consequently dismissed from the army and became profoundly bitter toward Napoleon. In 1840, the body of Napoleon I [[Retour des cendres|was brought to France]] and became an object of veneration in the church of [[Les Invalides]], renewing popular patriotic support for the Bonaparte family.\n\nIn \"Causeries\" (1860), Dumas published a short paper, \"\u00c9tat civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo\", on the genesis of the Count of [[Montecristo|Monte-Cristo]].<ref group='Notes' name='c'>\"\u00c9tat civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo\" is included in the Pl\u00e9iade edition (Paris, 1981) as an \"annexe\".</ref> It appears that Dumas had close contacts with members of the Bonaparte family while living in Florence in 1841. In a small boat, he sailed around the island of Monte-Cristo, accompanied by a young prince, a cousin to [[Napoleon III|Louis Bonaparte]], who was to become Emperor of the French ten years later. During this trip, he promised the prince that he would write a novel with the island's name in the title. At that time, the future emperor was imprisoned at the citadel of Ham \u2013 a name that is mentioned in the novel. Dumas did visit him there,<ref>Pierre Milza (2004) Napol\u00e9on III. Perrin.</ref> although he does not mention it in \"Etat civil\".\n\n===A chronology of ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' and Bonapartism===\n'''During the life of Thomas-Alexandre Dumas:'''\n* 1793: Thomas-Alexandre Dumas is promoted to the rank of general in the army of the First French Republic.\n* 1794: He disapproves of the revolutionary terror in Western France.\n* 1795\u201397: He becomes famous and fights under Napoleon.\n* 1802: Black officers are dismissed from the army.

The first two plays were first performed at Dumas' own [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]] in February 1848, with the performance spread over two nights, each with a long duration (the first evening ran from 18:00 until 00:00). The play was also unsuccessfully performed at Drury Lane in London later that year where rioting erupted in protest at French companies performing in England.\n\nThe adaptation differs from the novel in many respects: several characters, such as Luigi Vampa, are excluded; whereas the novel includes many different plot threads that are brought together at the conclusion, the third and fourth plays deal only with the fate of Mondego and Villefort respectively (Danglars' fate is not featured at all); the play is the first to feature Dant\u00e8s shouting \"the world is mine!\", an iconic line that would be used in many future adaptations.\n\n[[File:Liebler and Co's tremendous production of Monte Cristo with Mr. James O'Neill as Edmond Dantes, a character he has made world famous. LCCN2014636665.jpg|thumb|Poster for a 1900 production of [[Charles Fechter]]'s adaptation of ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', starring [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]]]]\nTwo English adaptations of the novel were published in 1868. The first, by Hailes Lacy, differs only slightly from Dumas' version with the main change being that Fernand Mondego is killed in a duel with the Count rather than committing suicide. Much more radical was the version by Charles Fechter, a notable French-Anglo actor. The play faithfully follows the first part of the novel, omits the Rome section and makes several sweeping changes to the third part, among the most significant being that Albert is actually the son of Dant\u00e8s. The fates of the three main antagonists are also altered: Villefort, whose fate is dealt with quite early on in the play, kills himself after being foiled by the Count trying to kill Noirtier (Villefort's half brother in this version); Mondego kills himself after being confronted by Mercedes; Danglars is killed by the Count in a duel. The ending sees Dant\u00e8s and Mercedes reunited and the character of Haydee is not featured at all. The play was first performed at the Adelphi in London in October 1868. The original duration was five hours, resulting in Fechter abridging the play, which, despite negative reviews, had a respectable sixteen-week run. Fechter moved to the United States in 1869 and Monte Cristo was chosen for the inaugural play at the opening of the Globe Theatre, Boston in 1870. Fechter last performed the role in 1878.\n\nIn 1883, John Stetson, manager of the Booth Theatre and The Globe Theatre, wanted to revive the play and asked [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]] (the father of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]) to perform the lead role. O'Neill, who had never seen Fechter perform, made the role his own and the play became a commercial, if not an artistic success. O'Neill made several abridgments to the play and eventually bought it from Stetson. A motion picture based on Fechter's play, with O'Neill in the title role, was released in 1913 but was not a huge success. O'Neill died in 1920, two years before a more successful motion picture, produced by Fox and partially based on Fechter's version, was released. O'Neill came to despise the role of Monte Cristo, which he performed more than 6000 times, feeling that his typecasting had prevented him from pursuing more artistically rewarding roles.

It is one of the author's more popular works, along with ''[[The Three Musketeers]]''. Like many of his novels, it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating [[ghostwriter]] [[Auguste Maquet]].<ref>Schopp, Claude, ''Genius of Life'', p. 325</ref> Another important work by Dumas, written before his work with Maquet, was the short novel [[Georges (novel)|''Georges'']]; this novel is of particular interest to scholars because Dumas reused many of the ideas and [[plot device]]s later in ''The Count of Monte Cristo''.<ref>\"The Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re Web Site\". Georges.Retrieved 2006-04-06</ref>\n\nThe story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the [[Mediterranean]] during the historical events of 1815\u20131839: the era of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] through the reign of [[Louis-Philippe of France]]. It begins just before the [[Hundred Days]] period (when [[Napoleon]] returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres on a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. His plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty.\n\nThe book is considered a [[literary classic]] today. According to [[Luc Sante]], \"''The Count of Monte Cristo'' has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Genesis flood narrative|Noah's flood]], and the story of [[Little Red Riding Hood]].\"<ref>Alexandre Dumas, ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' 2004, Barnes & Noble Books, New York. {{ISBN|978-1-59308-333-5}}. p. xxv (TCMC)</ref>\n\n==Background to the plot==\nDumas wrote<ref>''[http://www.dumaspere.com/pages/bibliotheque/chapitre.php?lid=m1&cid=28 Etat civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo]'' in ''Causeries'', chapter IX (1857). See also the introduction of the ''[[Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade|Pl\u00e9iade]]'' edition of ''Le comte de Monte-Cristo'' (1981)</ref> that the idea of revenge in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' came from a story in a book compiled by [[Jacques Peuchet]], a French police archivist, published in 1838 after the death of the author.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYBAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA197#v=onepage&q&f=false Le Diamant et la Vengeance]'' in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VYBAAAAAcAAJ M\u00e9moires tir\u00e9s des Archives de la Police de Paris]'', vol. 5, chapter LXXIV, p. 197</ref> Dumas included this essay in one of the editions from 1846.<ref>''True Stories of Immortal Crimes'', H. Ashton-Wolfe, 1931, E. P. Dutton & Co., pp. 16\u201317</ref> Peuchet told of a shoemaker, [[Pierre Picaud]], living in [[N\u00eemes]] in 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the [[Fenestrelle Fort]], where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the cleric died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which were printed the words \"Number One\", and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fianc\u00e9e while Picaud was under arrest.\n\nIn another of the \"True Stories\", Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family. This story, also quoted in the Pleiade edition, obviously served as a model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pleiade edition mentions other sources from real life: [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]] existed and died in 1819 after a life with much resemblance to that of the Faria in the novel. As for Dant\u00e8s, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet's book, since the latter is murdered by the \"Caderousse\" of the plot. But Dant\u00e8s has \"alter egos\" in two other Dumas works; in \"Pauline\" from 1838, and more significantly in \"Georges\" from 1843, where a young man with black ancestry is preparing a revenge against white people who had humiliated him.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- This appears to be a plot summary of the abridged edition. Some details as to the unabridged edition would be welcome. -->\n\n===Summary===\nOn the day of his wedding to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]], first mate of the ''Pharaon'', is incorrectly accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned without trial in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'If]], a grim island fortress off [[Marseille]]. A fellow prisoner, Abb\u00e9 Faria, correctly deduces that his jealous rival Fernand Mondego, envious crewmate Danglars, and double-dealing magistrate De Villefort turned him in. Faria inspires his escape and guides him to a fortune in [[treasure]]. As the powerful and mysterious Count of [[Montecristo|Monte Cristo]] ([[Italy]]), he arrives from the Orient to enter the fashionable Parisian world of the 1830s and avenge himself on the men who conspired to destroy him.\n\n===Edmond Dant\u00e8s===\n[[File:Edmond Dant\u00e8s.JPG|thumb|The main character Edmond Dant\u00e8s was a merchant sailor before his imprisonment. (Illustration by [[Pierre-Gustave Staal]])]]\nIn 1815, Edmond Dant\u00e8s, a young [[merchant]] [[sailor]] who has recently been granted the succession of his captain Lecl\u00e8re, returns to [[Marseille]] to marry his [[Catalans|Catalan]] fianc\u00e9e Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. Lecl\u00e8re, a supporter of the exiled [[Napoleon]], found himself dying at sea and charged Dant\u00e8s to deliver two objects: a package to [[Henri Gatien Bertrand|General Bertrand]] (exiled with Napoleon on [[Elba]]), and a letter from Elba to an unknown man in Paris. On the eve of Dant\u00e8s' wedding to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, Fernand Mondego (Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s' cousin and a rival for her affections) is given advice by Dant\u00e8s' colleague Danglars (who is jealous of Dant\u00e8s' rapid rise to captain) to send an anonymous note accusing Dant\u00e8s of being a [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist traitor]]. Caderousse (Dant\u00e8s' cowardly and selfish neighbor) is drunk while the two conspirators set the trap for Dant\u00e8s and stays quiet as Dant\u00e8s is arrested, then sentenced. Villefort, the deputy crown prosecutor in Marseille, destroys the letter from Elba when he discovers that it is addressed to his own father, Noirtier (who is a Bonapartist), since if this letter came into official hands, it would destroy his ambitions and reputation as a staunch [[Royalist]]. To silence Dant\u00e8s, he condemns him without [[Trial by ordeal|trial]] to life imprisonment.\n\nAfter six years of imprisonment in the Ch\u00e2teau d'If, Dant\u00e8s is on the verge of suicide when he befriends the [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]] (\"The Mad Priest\"), an Italian fellow prisoner who had dug an escape tunnel that ended up in Dant\u00e8s' cell. Over the next eight years, Faria gives Dant\u00e8s an extensive education in language, culture, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, and science. Knowing himself to be close to death, Faria tells Dant\u00e8s the location of a treasure on the small island of Monte Cristo. When Faria dies, Dant\u00e8s takes his place in the burial sack. When the guards throw the sack into the sea, Dant\u00e8s breaks through and swims to a nearby island. He is rescued by a [[smuggling]] ship that passes Monte Cristo. Fearing the members of the ship will find him and his treasure, he used the excuse of hunting sheep while he actually went to hunt the treasure. To stay on the island (to furthermore find his treasure for he has not found it yet), Dant\u00e8s pretends he has a broken back. Six days later, the smuggling ship comes back for him and he boards it carrying with him only a few diamonds which are carefully hidden. In port, Dant\u00e8s trades these diamonds for a yacht and then starts sail to Monte Cristo again to claim the rest of his treasure.  After recovering the treasure, Dant\u00e8s returns to Marseille. He later purchases the island of Monte Cristo and the title of [[Count]] from the Tuscan government.\n\n[[File:James O'Neill as Abbe Busoni.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Actor [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]] as the Abb\u00e9 Busoni]]\n\nTraveling as the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, Dant\u00e8s meets Caderousse, now living in poverty, who regrets not intervening and possibly saving Dant\u00e8s from prison. He gives Caderousse a diamond that can be either a chance to redeem himself or a trap that will lead to his ruin. Learning that his old employer Morrel is on the verge of bankruptcy, Dant\u00e8s buys Morrel's debts and gives Morrel three months to fulfill his obligations. At the end of the three months and with no way to repay his debts, Morrel is about to commit suicide when he learns that his debts have been mysteriously paid and that one of his lost ships has returned with a full cargo, secretly rebuilt and laden by Dant\u00e8s.\n\n===The Count of Monte Cristo===\n\nReappearing as the rich Count of Monte Cristo, Dant\u00e8s begins his revenge on the three men responsible for his unjust imprisonment: Fernand, now Count de Morcerf and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s' husband; Danglars, now a baron and a wealthy banker; and Villefort, now ''[[Prosecutor|procureur du roi]]'' (prosecutor for the king). The Count appears first in Rome, where he becomes acquainted with the Baron Franz d'\u00c9pinay, and Viscount Albert de Morcerf, the son of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and Fernand. Dant\u00e8s arranges for the young Morcerf to be captured by the bandit Luigi Vampa and then seemingly rescues him from Vampa's gang. Albert, feeling a debt of gratitude to the Count for his rescue, agrees to introduce the Count into Parisian society. The Count then moves to Paris and dazzles Danglars with his wealth, persuading him to extend him a credit of six million francs. The Count manipulates the bond market and quickly destroys a large portion of Danglars' fortune. The rest of it begins to rapidly disappear through mysterious bankruptcies, suspensions of payment, and more bad luck in the Stock Exchange.\n\nVillefort had once conducted an affair with Madame Danglars. She became pregnant and delivered the child in the house that the Count has now purchased. To cover up the affair, Villefort told Madame Danglars that the infant was stillborn, smothered the child, and thinking him to be dead, buried him in the garden. While Villefort was burying the child, he was stabbed by the smuggler Bertuccio, who unearthed the child and resuscitated him. Bertuccio's sister-in-law brought the child up, giving him the name \"Benedetto\". Benedetto takes up a life of crime as he grows into adolescence. He robs his adoptive mother (Bertuccio's sister-in-law) and ends up killing her, then runs away. Bertuccio later becomes the Count's servant and informs him of this history.\n\nBenedetto is [[Galley slave#Early modern era|sentenced to the galleys]] with Caderousse, who had sold the diamond but killed both his wife and the buyer out of greed. After Benedetto and Caderousse are freed by Dant\u00e8s, using the alias \"Lord Wilmore,\" the Count induces Benedetto to take the identity of \"Viscount Andrea Cavalcanti\" and introduces him into Parisian society. Andrea ingratiates himself to Danglars, who betroths his daughter Eug\u00e9nie to Andrea (not knowing they are half-siblings) after cancelling her engagement to Albert. Meanwhile, Caderousse blackmails Andrea, threatening to reveal his past if he doesn't share his new-found wealth. Cornered by \"Abb\u00e9 Busoni\" while attempting to rob the Count's house, Caderousse begs to be given another chance. Dant\u00e8s forces him to write a letter to Danglars exposing Cavalcanti as an impostor and allows Caderousse to leave the house. The moment Caderousse leaves the estate, he is stabbed by Andrea. Caderousse dictates a deathbed statement identifying his killer, and the Count reveals his true identity to Caderousse moments before he dies.\n\nYears before, [[Ali Pasha of Janina]] had been betrayed to the Turks by Fernand. After Ali's death, Fernand sold Ali's wife [[Kyra Vassiliki|Vasiliki]] and his daughter Hayd\u00e9e into slavery. While Vasiliki died shortly thereafter, Dant\u00e8s purchased Hayd\u00e9e. The Count manipulates Danglars into researching the event, which is published in a newspaper. As a result, Fernand is investigated by his peers and disgraced. When Albert blames the Count for his father's downfall and challenges him to a duel, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, having already recognized Monte Cristo as Dant\u00e8s, goes to the Count and begs him to spare her son. During this interview, she learns the truth of his arrest and imprisonment but still convinces the Count not to kill her son. Realizing that Edmond now intends to let Albert kill him, she reveals the truth to Albert, which causes Albert to make a public apology to the Count. Albert and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s disown Fernand and leave his house. Fernand is confronted with Dant\u00e8s' true identity and shoots himself. Albert and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s renounce their titles and wealth and depart to begin new lives.\n\nValentine, Villefort's daughter by his late first wife, stands to inherit the fortune of her grandfather (Noirtier) and of her mother's parents (the Saint-M\u00e9rans), while Villefort's second wife H\u00e9lo\u00efse seeks the fortune for her son \u00c9douard. The Count is aware of H\u00e9lo\u00efse's intentions and introduces her to the technique of poison. H\u00e9lo\u00efse fatally poisons the Saint-M\u00e9rans, so that Valentine inherits their fortune. Valentine is briefly disinherited by Noirtier in an attempt to prevent Valentine's impending marriage with Franz d'\u00c9pinay, whom she does not love; however, the marriage is cancelled when d'\u00c9pinay learns that his father (believed assassinated by Bonapartists) was actually killed by Noirtier in a fair duel. After a failed attempt on Noirtier's life which leaves Noirtier's servant Barrois dead, H\u00e9lo\u00efse targets Valentine so that \u00c9douard will get the fortune. However, Valentine is the prime suspect in her father's eyes in the deaths of the Saint-M\u00e9rans and Barrois. On learning that Morrel's son Maximilien is in love with Valentine, the Count saves her by making it appear as though H\u00e9lo\u00efse's plan to poison Valentine has succeeded and that Valentine is dead. Villefort learns from Noirtier that H\u00e9lo\u00efse is the real murderer and confronts her, giving her the choice of a public execution or committing suicide.\n\nFleeing after Caderousse's letter exposes him, Andrea is arrested and returned to Paris, where Villefort prosecutes him. While in prison awaiting trial, Andrea is visited by Bertuccio, who tells him the truth about his father. At his trial, Andrea reveals that he is Villefort's son and was rescued after Villefort buried him alive. Villefort admits his guilt and flees the court. He rushes home to stop his wife's suicide but is too late; she has poisoned her son as well. Dant\u00e8s confronts Villefort, revealing his true identity, but this drives Villefort insane. Dant\u00e8s tries but fails to resuscitate \u00c9douard, causing him to question if he has gone too far.\n\nAfter the Count's manipulation of the bond market, Danglars is left with a destroyed reputation and 5,000,000 francs he has been holding in deposit for hospitals. The Count demands this sum to fulfil their credit agreement, and Danglars embezzles the hospital fund. Abandoning his wife, Danglars flees to Italy with the Count's receipt and 50,000 francs. While leaving Rome, he is kidnapped by the Count's agent Luigi Vampa and is imprisoned. Forced to pay exorbitant prices for food and nearly starved to death, Danglars signs away his ill-gotten gains. Dant\u00e8s anonymously returns the stolen money to the hospitals. Danglars finally repents his crimes, and a softened Dant\u00e8s forgives him and allows him to leave with his freedom and 50,000 francs.\n\nMaximilien Morrel, believing Valentine to be dead, contemplates suicide after her funeral. Dant\u00e8s reveals his true identity and explains that he rescued Morrel's father from bankruptcy years earlier; he then tells Maximilien to reconsider his suicide, and Maximilien is saved.\n\nOn the island of Monte Cristo, Dant\u00e8s presents Valentine to Maximilien and reveals the true sequence of events. Having found peace, Dant\u00e8s now leaves the newly reunited couple part of his fortune on the island and departs for an unknown destination to find comfort and a new life with Hayd\u00e9e, who has declared her love for him. The reader is left with a final thought: \"all human wisdom is contained in these two words, 'Wait and Hope'\". \n[[File:CountOfMonteCristoRelations.svg|thumb|800px|center| Character relationships in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'']]\n\n==Characters==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n\n===Edmond Dant\u00e8s and his aliases===\n* [[Edmond Dant\u00e8s]] (born 1796): A sailor with good prospects, engaged to Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s.

During the course of the novel, he falls in love with Hayd\u00e9e.\n* The Count of Monte Cristo: The identity Dant\u00e8s assumes when he emerges from prison and acquires his vast fortune. As a result, the Count of Monte Cristo is usually associated with a coldness and bitterness that comes from an existence based solely on revenge.\n* Chief Clerk of the banking firm Thomson & French, an Englishman.\n* Lord Wilmore: An Englishman, and the persona in which Dant\u00e8s performs random acts of generosity.\n* Sinbad the Sailor: The persona that Dant\u00e8s assumes when he saves the Morrel family and assumes while mixing with [[smuggler]]s and [[brigand]]s.\n* Abb\u00e9 Busoni: The persona of an Italian priest with religious authority.\n* Monsieur Zaccone: Dant\u00e8s, in the guise of the Abb\u00e9 Busoni, and again as Lord Wilmore, tells an investigator that this is the Count of Monte Cristo's true name.\n* Number 34: The name given to him by the new governor of Ch\u00e2teau d'If. Finding it too tedious to learn Dant\u00e8s' real name, he was called by the number of his cell.\n* The Maltese Sailor: The name he was known by after his rescue by smugglers from the island of Tiboulen.\n\n===Dant\u00e8s' allies===\n* [[Abb\u00e9 Faria]]: Italian priest and sage.

She later marries Fernand and they have a son named Albert. She is consumed with guilt over Edmond's disappearance and is able to recognize him when she meets him again. In the end, she returns to Marseilles, living in the house that belonged to father Dant\u00e8s, given to her by Monte-Cristo himself (to allow the woman a safe and stable place to spend in quietness the rest of her days, with a little financial support: the same francs the young Dant\u00e8s, before the arrest, used to keep aside in view of their wedding, in a little bag remained hidden in the house's garden for all that time), praying for Albert, who left France for Africa as a soldier to start a new and more honorable life. Left all alone, she and Edmond talked for the last time: once young and in love, they choose to take different paths, saying farewell to each other. While the Count went away to complete his plan, Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s decides to stay in her hometown, with only her memories left of the happiest years, waiting for Albert's return, wishing for Edmond to find peace for his wounded heart and praying on her husband's grave for his soul.

He would later achieve the high-rank of general in the French army and become a peer of France in the Chambre des Pairs, keeping secret his betrayal to the Pasha Al\u00ec Tebelen, and the selling of both his daughter Hayd\u00e9e and her mother Vasiliki. With the money earned he bought the title of \"Count de Morcerf\" to bring wealth and a more pleasant life to him and his family. Through the book he shows a deep affection and care for his wife and son. He would meet his tragic end in the last chapters, by committing suicide, in the despair of having lost Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and Albert, disowned by them when they discovered his hidden crimes.\n* Albert de Morcerf: Son of Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s and Fernand, and the Viscount de Morcerf.

Serialization ran from 28 August 1844 to 15 January 1846. The first edition in book form was published in Paris by ''P\u00e9tion'' in 18 volumes with the first two issued in 1844 and the remaining sixteen in 1845.<ref>David Coward (ed), Oxford's World Classics, Dumas, Alexandre, ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', p. xxv</ref> Most of the Belgian pirated editions, the first Paris edition and many others up to the ''L\u00e9crivain et Toubon'' illustrated edition of 1860 feature a misspelling of the title with \"Christo\" used instead of \"Cristo\". The first edition to feature the correct spelling was the ''L'\u00c9cho des Feuilletons'' illustrated edition, Paris 1846. This edition featured plates by [[Paul Gavarni]] and [[Tony Johannot]] and was said to be \"revised\" and \"corrected\", although only the chapter structure appears to have been altered with an additional chapter entitled ''La Maison des All\u00e9es de Meilhan'' having been created by splitting ''Le D\u00e9part'' into two.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|last=Munro|first=Douglas|title=Alexandre Dumas P\u00e8re: a bibliography of works translated into English to 1910|year=1978|publisher=Garland Pub|pages=91\u201392}}</ref>\n\n===English translations===\n\nThe first appearance of ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' in English was the first part of a serialization by W. Francis Ainsworth in volume VII of ''Ainsworth's Magazine'' published in 1845, although this was an abridged summary of the first part of the novel only and was entitled ''The Prisoner of If''. Ainsworth translated the remaining chapters of the novel, again in abridged form, and issued these in volumes VIII and IX of the magazine in 1845 and 1846 respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Another abridged serialization appeared in ''[[The London Journal]]'' between 1846 and 1847.\n\nThe first single volume translation in English was an abridged edition with woodcuts published by Geo Pierce in January 1846 entitled ''The Prisoner of If or The Revenge of Monte Christo''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn April 1846, volume three of the ''Parlour Novelist'', Belfast, Ireland: Simms and M'Intyre, London: W S Orr and Company, featured the first part of an unabridged translation of the novel by [[Emma Lavinia Gifford|Emma Hardy]]. The remaining two parts would be issued as the Count of Monte Christo volumes I and II in volumes 8 and 9 of the Parlour Novelist respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe most common English translation is an anonymous one originally published in 1846 by [[Chapman and Hall]]. This was originally released in ten weekly installments from March 1846 with six pages of letterpress and two illustrations by M Valentin.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Morning Post Front Page |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk|newspaper= The Morning Post|date= February 26, 1846 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> The translation was released in book form with all twenty illustrations in two volumes in May 1846, a month after the release of the first part of the above-mentioned translation by Emma Hardy.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The translation follows the revised French edition of 1846, with the correct spelling of \"Cristo\" and the extra chapter ''The House on the All\u00e9es de Meilhan''.\n\nMost English editions of the novel follow the anonymous translation. In 1889, two of the major American publishers ''Little Brown'' and ''T.Y. Crowell'' updated the translation, correcting mistakes and revising the text to reflect the original serialized version. This resulted in the removal of the chapter\n''The House on the All\u00e9es de Meilhan'', with the text restored to the end of the chapter called ''The Departure''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=The Count of Monte Cristo|url=https://archive.org/details/countmontecrist03fiorgoog|year=1889|publisher=Little Brown and Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=The Count of Monte Cristo : or, The Adventures of Edmond Dant\u00e8s|year=1889|publisher=T.Y Crowell}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, [[HarperCollins|Collins]] published an updated version of the anonymous translation which cut several passages, including a whole chapter entitled ''The Past'', and renamed others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first=Alexandre|title=The Count of Monte Cristo with an introduction by Richard Church |year=1955|publisher=Collins}}</ref> This abridgment was republished by many Collins imprints and other publishers including the [[Modern Library]], [[Vintage Books|Vintage]], and the 1998 [[Oxford World's Classics]] edition (later editions restored the text). In 2008 Oxford released a revised edition with translation by David Coward. The 2009 [[Everyman's Library]] edition reprints the original anonymous English translation that first appeared in 1846, with revisions by Peter Washington and an introduction by Umberto Eco.\n\nIn 1996, [[Penguin Books|Penguin Classics]] published a new translation by Robin Buss. Buss' translation updated the language, making the text more accessible to modern readers, and restored content that was modified in the 1846 translation because of Victorian English social restrictions (for example, references to Eug\u00e9nie's lesbian traits and behavior) to reflect Dumas' original version.\n\nIn addition to the above, there have also been many abridged translations such as an 1892 edition published by F.M. Lupton, translated by Henry L. Williams (this translation was also released by M.J. Ivers in 1892 with Williams using the pseudonym of Professor William Thiese).<ref name=\"auto\"/> A more recent abridgment is the translation by Lowell Bair for ''Bantam Classics'' in 1956.\n\nMany abridged translations omit the Count's enthusiasm for [[hashish]]. When serving a hashish jam to the young Frenchman Franz d'\u00c9pinay, the Count (calling himself [[Sinbad the Sailor]]), calls it, \"nothing less than the ambrosia which [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] served at the table of Jupiter.\" When he arrives in Paris, the Count brandishes an emerald box in which he carries small green pills compounded of hashish and opium which he uses for sleeplessness. (Source: Chapters 31, 32, 38, 40, 53 & 77 in the 117-chapter unabridged Pocket Books edition.) Dumas was a member of the [[Club des Hashischins]].\n\nIn June 2017, Manga Classics, an imprint of UDON Entertainment, published The Count of Monte Cristo as a faithfully adapted Manga edition of the classic novel.<ref>Manga Classics: The Count of Monte Cristo (2017) UDON Entertainment\u00a0{{ISBN|978-1927925614}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese translations===\nThe first Japanese translation by [[Kuroiwa Sh\u016broku]] was entitled \"Shigai Shiden Gankutsu-ou\" (\u53f2\u5916\u53f2\u4f1d\u5dcc\u7a9f\u738b, \"a historical story from outside history, the King of the Cavern\"), and serialized from 1901\u20131902 in the [[Yorozu Chouhou]] newspaper, and released in book form in four volumes by publisher [[Aoki Suusandou]] in 1905. Though later translations use the title \"Monte Cristo-haku\" (\u30e2\u30f3\u30c6\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u4f2f, the Count of Monte Cristo), the \"Gankutsu-ou\" title remains highly associated with the novel and is often used as an alternative. As of March 2016, all movie adaptations of the novel brought to Japan used the title \"Gankutsu-ou\", with the exception of the 2002 film, which has it as a subtitle (with the title itself simply being \"Monte Cristo\").\n\nThe novel is popular in Japan, and has spawned numerous adaptations, the most notable of which are the novels [[Meiji Gankutsu-ou]] by [[Taijirou Murasame]] and [[Shin Gankutsu-ou]] by [[Kaitar\u014d Hasegawa]]. Its influence can also be seen in how one of the first prominent cases of miscarriage of justice in Japan, in which an innocent man was charged with murder and imprisoned for half a century, is known in Japanese as the \"Yoshida Gankutsu-ou incident\" (\u5409\u7530\u5ca9\u7a9f\u738b\u4e8b\u4ef6).\n\nA manga adaptation of the novel, titled ''Monte Cristo Hakushaku'' (jap. \u30e2\u30f3\u30c6\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8, \u4f2f\u7235) and made by Ena Moriyama, was published in November 2015.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nThe original work was published in serial form in the ''Journal des D\u00e9bats'' in 1844. Carlos Javier Villafane Mercado described the effect in Europe:\n\n{{quote|The effect of the serials, which held vast audiences enthralled&nbsp;... is unlike any experience of reading we are likely to have known ourselves, maybe something like that of a particularly gripping television series.

In the book, Dumas tells of the 1815 return of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], and alludes to contemporary events when the governor at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'If]] is promoted to a position at the castle of Ham.<ref group='Notes' name='a'>On p. 140 of the Pl\u00e9iade edition the governor at the Ch\u00e2teau d'If is promoted to a position at the castle of [[Ham, Somme|Ham]], which is the castle where Louis Napoleon was imprisoned 1840\u201346.</ref> The attitude of Dumas towards \"bonapartisme\" was conflicted. His father, [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]],<ref group='Notes' name='b'>Thomas Alexandre Dumas was also known as Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie.</ref> a [[Haiti]]an of [[Multiracial|mixed descent]], became a successful general during the [[French Revolution]]. New racial-discrimination laws were applied in 1802. The general was consequently dismissed from the army and became profoundly bitter toward Napoleon. In 1840, the body of Napoleon I [[Retour des cendres|was brought to France]] and became an object of veneration in the church of [[Les Invalides]], renewing popular patriotic support for the Bonaparte family.\n\nIn \"Causeries\" (1860), Dumas published a short paper, \"\u00c9tat civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo\", on the genesis of the Count of [[Montecristo|Monte-Cristo]].<ref group='Notes' name='c'>\"\u00c9tat civil du Comte de Monte-Cristo\" is included in the Pl\u00e9iade edition (Paris, 1981) as an \"annexe\".</ref> It appears that Dumas had close contacts with members of the Bonaparte family while living in Florence in 1841. In a small boat, he sailed around the island of Monte-Cristo, accompanied by a young prince, a cousin to [[Napoleon III|Louis Bonaparte]], who was to become Emperor of the French ten years later. During this trip, he promised the prince that he would write a novel with the island's name in the title. At that time, the future emperor was imprisoned at the citadel of Ham \u2013 a name that is mentioned in the novel. Dumas did visit him there,<ref>Pierre Milza (2004) Napol\u00e9on III.

The first two plays were first performed at Dumas' own [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Historique]] in February 1848, with the performance spread over two nights, each with a long duration (the first evening ran from 18:00 until 00:00). The play was also unsuccessfully performed at Drury Lane in London later that year where rioting erupted in protest at French companies performing in England.\n\nThe adaptation differs from the novel in many respects: several characters, such as Luigi Vampa, are excluded; whereas the novel includes many different plot threads that are brought together at the conclusion, the third and fourth plays deal only with the fate of Mondego and Villefort respectively (Danglars' fate is not featured at all); the play is the first to feature Dant\u00e8s shouting \"the world is mine!\", an iconic line that would be used in many future adaptations.\n\n[[File:Liebler and Co's tremendous production of Monte Cristo with Mr. James O'Neill as Edmond Dantes, a character he has made world famous. LCCN2014636665.jpg|thumb|Poster for a 1900 production of [[Charles Fechter]]'s adaptation of ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', starring [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]]]]\nTwo English adaptations of the novel were published in 1868. The first, by Hailes Lacy, differs only slightly from Dumas' version with the main change being that Fernand Mondego is killed in a duel with the Count rather than committing suicide. Much more radical was the version by Charles Fechter, a notable French-Anglo actor. The play faithfully follows the first part of the novel, omits the Rome section and makes several sweeping changes to the third part, among the most significant being that Albert is actually the son of Dant\u00e8s. The fates of the three main antagonists are also altered: Villefort, whose fate is dealt with quite early on in the play, kills himself after being foiled by the Count trying to kill Noirtier (Villefort's half brother in this version); Mondego kills himself after being confronted by Mercedes; Danglars is killed by the Count in a duel. The ending sees Dant\u00e8s and Mercedes reunited and the character of Haydee is not featured at all. The play was first performed at the Adelphi in London in October 1868. The original duration was five hours, resulting in Fechter abridging the play, which, despite negative reviews, had a respectable sixteen-week run. Fechter moved to the United States in 1869 and Monte Cristo was chosen for the inaugural play at the opening of the Globe Theatre, Boston in 1870. Fechter last performed the role in 1878.\n\nIn 1883, John Stetson, manager of the Booth Theatre and The Globe Theatre, wanted to revive the play and asked [[James O'Neill (actor, born 1847)|James O'Neill]] (the father of playwright [[Eugene O'Neill]]) to perform the lead role. O'Neill, who had never seen Fechter perform, made the role his own and the play became a commercial, if not an artistic success. O'Neill made several abridgments to the play and eventually bought it from Stetson. A motion picture based on Fechter's play, with O'Neill in the title role, was released in 1913 but was not a huge success. O'Neill died in 1920, two years before a more successful motion picture, produced by Fox and partially based on Fechter's version, was released. O'Neill came to despise the role of Monte Cristo, which he performed more than 6000 times, feeling that his typecasting had prevented him from pursuing more artistically rewarding roles. This discontent later became a plot point in Eugene O'Neill's semi-autobiographical play ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''.\n\n''[[The Count of Monte Cristo (musical)|The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' is a musical based on the novel, with influences from the 2002 film adaptation of the book. The music is written by [[Frank Wildhorn]] and the lyrics and book are by Jack Murphy.

Club\"/> Meaghan Garvey of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: \"Mustard's beats here don't exactly reinvent the wheel, but they serve as hydraulics to YG's low-riding delivery; on \"Too Cocky\", the producer's minimalist West Coast bounce pairs perfectly with YG's unexpected and inspired [[Right Said Fred]] interpolation.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> Jackson Howard of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' saying \"For YG, an artist we've come to expect the unexpected from, someone currently standing at a career-defining intersection, ''Stay Dangerous'' is an exercise in predictability.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\nIn a mixed review, ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]''{{'}}s Chris Gibbons stated: \"''Stay Dangerous'' doesn't quite feel like the grand statement of ''[[Still Brazy]]'' or ''[[My Krazy Life]]''. It's a slight step back from a rapper who is capable of much greater. While the brief glimpses of his personal life aren't quite enough to elevate the project, it's worthwhile to hear him breezing over Mustard beats once again.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/> In another mixed review, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Rachel Aroesti stated: \"YG doesn't cover his subject matter with a huge amount of wit or creativity. Yet the rapper makes up for lyrical dullness with a sound that can be tantalising.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/> Zachary Hoskins of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' said, \"The rigid codes of masculinity

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an [[weighted arithmetic mean|average]] score of 71, based on 16 reviews.<ref name=\"MC\"/> Isaac Feldberg of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the album saying, \"YG's objectives across ''Stay Dangerous'' are more narrow and (for him) natural. Reuniting with long-time producer [[Mustard (record producer)|DJ Mustard]] for around half the album, YG is largely content to low-ride in his lane, swaggering across [[Bloods]]-allegiant bangers (electrifying \"Suu Whoop\") and incisive tell-alls from the hood (\"Too Brazy\" \"Deeper Than Rap\").\"<ref name=\"EW\"/> Jack Riedy of ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' said, \"Though it doesn't quite reach the heights of his first two, his new album, ''Stay Dangerous'', is another solid project from one of the best on the West Coast.\"<ref name=\"COS\">{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/album-review-yg-stay-dangerous/|title=YG \u2013 Stay Dangerous|work=Consequence of Sound|last=Riedy|first=Jack|date=August 9, 2018|access-date=August 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809213128/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/album-review-yg-stay-dangerous/|archive-date=August 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Clayton Purdom of ''[[The A.V.

Club\"/> Meaghan Garvey of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: \"Mustard's beats here don't exactly reinvent the wheel, but they serve as hydraulics to YG's low-riding delivery; on \"Too Cocky\", the producer's minimalist West Coast bounce pairs perfectly with YG's unexpected and inspired [[Right Said Fred]] interpolation.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/> Jackson Howard of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' saying \"For YG, an artist we've come to expect the unexpected from, someone currently standing at a career-defining intersection, ''Stay Dangerous'' is an exercise in predictability.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\nIn a mixed review, ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]''{{'}}s Chris Gibbons stated: \"''Stay Dangerous'' doesn't quite feel like the grand statement of ''[[Still Brazy]]'' or ''[[My Krazy Life]]''. It's a slight step back from a rapper who is capable of much greater. While the brief glimpses of his personal life aren't quite enough to elevate the project, it's worthwhile to hear him breezing over Mustard beats once again.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/> In another mixed review, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Rachel Aroesti stated: \"YG doesn't cover his subject matter with a huge amount of wit or creativity. Yet the rapper makes up for lyrical dullness with a sound that can be tantalising.\"<ref name=\"The Guardian\"/> Zachary Hoskins of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' said, \"The rigid codes of masculinity governing hardcore rap, though, keep YG's lyrics from showing as much range as Mustard's beats.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nIn YG's home country of United States, ''Stay

In gardens, [[ornamental plant]]s are often grown for their [jhbvgtukiuhtr8nchvt8, such as [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[herb]]s, are grown for consumption, for use as [[dye]]s, or for [[Medicine|medicinal]] or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] use. Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.\n\nGardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of [[shrub]]s, [[tree]]s, and [[herbaceous plant]]s, to residential [[back garden]]s including lawns and foundation plantings, and to [[container garden]]s grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]].\n\n==History of gardening==\n{{Main|History of gardening}}\n[[Image:Forestgarden2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]]'s forest garden in [[Shropshire]], England]]\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[Forest gardening]], a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9780754609582}}</ref> Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.<ref>{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9789251028988}}</ref>\n\nAfter the emergence of the first [[civilization]]s, wealthy individuals began to create gardens for aesthetic purposes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb paintings from the [[New Kingdom]] (around 1500 BC) provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental [[horticulture]] and landscape design; they depict [[Egyptian lotus|lotus]] ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of [[acacia]]s and [[palm tree|palms]]. A notable example of ancient ornamental gardens were the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]\u2014one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] \u2014while [[ancient Rome]] had dozens of gardens.\n\nWealthy ancient Egyptians used gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens. Gardens in ancient Egypt were often surrounded by walls with trees planted in rows. Among the most popular species planted were [[date palms]], sycamores, [[Ficus|fir trees]], nut trees, and [[willows]]. These gardens were a sign of higher socioeconomic status. In addition, wealthy ancient Egyptians grew vineyards, as wine was a sign of the higher social classes. [[Rose]]s, poppies, [[Asteraceae|daisies]] and [[Iris (plant)|irises]] could all also be found in the gardens of the Egyptians.\n\n[[Assyria]] was also renowned for its beautiful gardens. These tended to be wide and large, some of them used for hunting game\u2014rather like a game reserve today\u2014and others as leisure gardens. [[Cupressus|Cypresses]] and palms were some of the most frequently planted types of trees.\n\n[[Ancient Roman]] gardens were laid out with hedges and vines and contained a wide variety of flowers\u2014[[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]], [[cornflowers]], [[crocus]], [[cyclamen]], hyacinth, iris, ivy, [[lavender]], lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy, [[rosemary]] and violets<ref name=\"localhistories\">{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html| title=A Brief History of Gardening|accessdate= 2010-06-04}}</ref>\u2014as well as statues and sculptures. Flower beds were popular in the courtyards of rich Romans.\n\n===The Middle Ages===\n[[File:Mendel II 073 v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A gardener at work, 1607]]\nThe [[Middle Age]] represented a period of decline in gardens for aesthetic purposes, with regard to gardening. After the fall of Rome, gardening was done for the purpose of growing [[medicinal herbs]] and/or decorating church [[altars]]. Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. \nGenerally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a \"green court\", a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer's garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.\n\n[[Islamic garden]]s were built after the model of [[Persian gardens]] and they were usually enclosed by walls and divided in four by watercourses. Commonly, the centre of the garden would have a [[reflecting pool]] or [[pavilion]]. Specific to the Islamic gardens are the [[mosaics]] and glazed tiles used to decorate the rills and [[Fountain|fountains]] that were built in these gardens.\n\nBy the late 13th century, rich Europeans began to grow gardens for leisure and for medicinal herbs and vegetables.<ref name=\"localhistories\" /> They surrounded the gardens by walls to protect them from animals and to provide [[seclusion]]. During the next two centuries, Europeans started planting lawns and raising flowerbeds and trellises of roses. Fruit trees were common in these gardens and also in some, there were turf seats. At the same time, the gardens in the [[monasteries]] were a place to grow flowers and medicinal herbs but they were also a space where the [[monks]] could enjoy nature and relax.\n\nThe gardens in the 16th and 17th century were [[symmetric]], proportioned and balanced with a more classical appearance. Most of these gardens were built around a central axis and they were divided into different parts by hedges. Commonly, gardens had flowerbeds laid out in squares and separated by gravel paths.\n\nGardens in Renaissance were adorned with sculptures, [[topiary]] and fountains. In the 17th century, [[knot garden]]s became popular along with the [[hedge maze]]s. By this time, Europeans started planting new flowers such as [[tulips]], marigolds and [[sunflowers]].\n\n===Cottage gardens===\n[[File:XN Kerascoet.jpg|thumb|A cottage garden in [[Brittany]]]]\n[[Cottage garden]]s, which emerged in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]], appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins & Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=978-1-84340-216-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&pg=PA7}}</ref> One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.<ref name=\"Scott-James80\">{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}</ref> According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,<ref>[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.</ref> these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted among them for decoration. Farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden\u2014about {{convert|1|acre}}\u2014where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.<ref>''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600\u20131840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008\n{{ISBN|0-300-12508-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CSyaO-MqYoAC&pg=PA659 p 659]</ref>\n\nAuthentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use\u2014violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[Dianthus barbatus|sweet William]] and [[hollyhock]]s, were grown entirely for their beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6\u20139|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Sheffield Park Gardens, Fletching, Sussex - geograph.org.uk - 1582535.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sheffield Park Garden]], a [[landscape garden]] originally laid out in the 18th century by [[Capability Brown]]]]\nIn the 18th century gardens were laid out more naturally, without any walls. This style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a \"gardenless\" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. The [[English landscape garden]] usually included a lake, lawns set against groves of trees, and often contained shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges and [[folly|follies]] such as mock temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. This new style emerged in [[England]] in the early 18th century, and spread across [[Europe]], replacing the more formal, symmetrical [[garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]] of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.<ref>Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.</ref> The English garden presented an idealized view of nature.

Also, in 1804 the Horticultural Society was formed. \n\nGardens of the 19th century contained plants such as the monkey puzzle or Chile pine. This is also the time when the so-called \"[[gardenesque]]\" style of gardens evolved. These gardens displayed a wide variety of flowers in a rather small space. [[Rock garden]]s increased in popularity in the 19th century.\n\n==Types==\n{{main|List of garden types}}\n[[File:SF Conservatory of Flowers 3.jpg|thumb|right|Conservatory of Flowers in [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]]]]\n[[File:Hanging baskets in thornbury arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hanging basket]]s in [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire]]]]\n[[File:CCHS organic garden.jpg|thumb|An organic garden on a school campus]]\nResidential gardening takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the garden. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located [[roof garden|on a roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], [[Patio|on a patio]] or [[vivarium]].\n\nGardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoo|zoological gardens]]), [[amusement park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.\n* Indoor gardening is concerned with the growing of [[houseplant]]s within a residence or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part of [[air conditioning]] or heating systems. Indoor gardening extends the growing season in the fall and spring and can be used for [[winter gardening]].\n* [[Native plant gardening]] is concerned with the use of [[native plants]] with or without the intent of creating [[wildlife habitat]]. The goal is to create a garden in harmony with, and adapted to a given area. This type of gardening typically reduces water usage, maintenance, and fertilization costs, while increasing [[native fauna]]l interest.\n* [[Water garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog garden]]s are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant(s). In [[aquascaping]], a garden is created within an [[aquarium]] tank.\n* [[Container garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots, [[hanging basket]]s, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.\n* [[H\u00fcgelkultur]] is concerned with growing plants on piles of rotting wood, as a form of [[raised bed gardening]] and composting [[In situ#Biology|in situ]].<ref name=\"richsoil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/|title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds|website=www.richsoil.com}}</ref> An English [[loanword]] from German, it means \"mound garden.\" [[Toby Hemenway]], noted [[permaculture]] author and teacher, considers wood buried in trenches to also be a form of hugelkultur referred to as a dead wood [[Swale (landform)|swale]].<ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

These shared gardens, typically front or back [[yard (land)|yards]], are usually used to produce food that is divided between the two parties.\n* [[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] uses natural, sustainable methods, fertilizers and pesticides to grow non-[[genetically modified crops]].\n\n==Social aspects==\nPeople can express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The lawn vs. garden issue is played out in [[urban planning]] as the debate over the \"[[land ethic]]\" that is to determine urban [[land use]] and whether hyper [[hygiene|hygienist]] [[bylaw]]s (e.g. [[weed control]]) should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] case, \"Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto\", 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]].\n\n[[Community gardening]] comprises a wide variety of approaches to sharing land and gardens.\n\n[[File:Schultenhof Mettingen Bauerngarten 8.jpg|thumb|left|Garden at the Schultenhof in [[Mettingen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany]]\nPeople often surround their house and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are [[privet]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[beech]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[Leyland Cypress|leyland cypress]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[Thuja occidentalis|arborvitae]], [[Berberis|barberry]], [[Buxus|box]], [[holly]], [[Nerium oleander|oleander]], [[forsythia]] and [[lavender]]. The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.\nThe [[Slow Food]] movement has sought in some countries to add an edible [[School garden|school yard]] and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in [[Fergus, Ontario]], where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom. [[Garden sharing]], where urban landowners allow gardeners to grow on their property in exchange for a share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of one's food, and reconnect with soil and community.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/ethicalliving.organics Meet the urban sharecroppers] ''The Guardian'', 4 September 2008</ref>\n\nIn US and British usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called ''[[landscaping]]'', ''[[landscape maintenance]]'' or ''grounds keeping'', while international usage uses the term ''gardening'' for these same activities.\n\nAlso gaining popularity is the concept of \"Green Gardening\" which involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process \u2013 or the flowers and fruits produced thereby \u2013 doesn't adversely affect the environment or people's health in any manner.\n\n==Comparison with farming==\n[[File:Hayes-Valley-Farm by Zoey-Kroll fava-hillside.jpg|thumb|Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm, a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco]]\nGardening for beauty is likely{{original research inline|date=January 2018}} nearly as old as farming for food, however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale, [[subsistence agriculture]] (called [[hoe-farming]]) is largely indistinguishable from gardening. A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish smallholder for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics, [[recreation]] and [[leisure]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Mickey\n| first1 = Thomas J.\n| year = 2003\n| title = Deconstructing Public Relations: Public Relations Criticism\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wxaQAgAAQBAJ\n| series = Routledge Communication Series\n| location = Mahwah, New Jersey\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2008\n| page = 43\n| isbn = 9781135652210\n| access-date = 2018-01-21\n| quote = The number-one leisure activity in the United States is gardening.\n}}\n</ref>\nunder the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Meanwhile, farming has evolved (in developed countries) in the direction of [[commercial agriculture|commercialization]], [[economics of scale]], and [[monocropping]].\n\nIn respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished{{by whom|date=January 2018}} from [[Agriculture|farming]] chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called [[market gardening]], can fit in either category.\n\nThe key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale; gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood{{by whom|date=January 2018}} as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little [[infrastructural capital]], sometimes no more than a few tools, e.g. a [[spade]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[basket]] and [[watering can]]. By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves [[irrigation|irrigation systems]], chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[combine harvester|harvesters]] or at least [[ladder]]s, e.g. to reach up into [[fruit tree]]s. However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.\n\n[[Monty Don]] has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern [[peasantry]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Swift\n| first1 = Joe\n| author-link1 = Joe Swift\n| chapter = Summer at the plot\n| title = Joe's Allotment: Planning and planting a productive plot\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6c3UyYKo1EEC\n| publisher = Random House\n| date = 2012\n| isbn = 9781409070139\n| access-date = 2018-01-20\n| quote = I suppose it is an atavistic connection with the land and the completely honourable peasant mentality, that was lost in Britain with the Industrial Revolution, yet persists in our gardens and allotments.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe term [[precision agriculture]] is sometimes used{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to describe gardening using [[Appropriate technology|intermediate technology]] (more than tools, less than harvesters), especially of [[organic farming|organic varieties]]. Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire villages of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the [[community gardening|community garden]] which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in [[allotment (gardening)]].\n\n==Garden ornaments and accessories==\n{{main|Garden ornament}}\n[[Image:Urn, Palm House.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A classical [[urn]] at Palm House, the [[Belfast Botanic Gardens]], [[Northern Ireland]], as [[garden ornament]]]]\nThere is a wide range of [[garden ornament]]s and accessories available in the market for both the professional gardener and the amateur to exercise their creativity. These are used to add decoration or functionality, and may be made from a wide range of materials such as copper, stone, wood, bamboo, [[stainless steel]], [[clay]], [[stained glass]], concrete, or iron. Examples include [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]], [[garden furniture]], [[Garden sculpture|statues]], [[outdoor fireplace]]s, [[Fountain|fountains]], [[rain chain]]s, [[urns]], [[bird bath]]s and [[Bird feeder|feeders]], [[wind chime]]s, and garden lighting such as candle [[lanterns]] and [[oil lamps]]. The use of these items can be part of the expression of a gardener's gardening personality.\n\n==Gardens as art==\n{{See also|Landscape architecture}}\n[[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. Garden design can include different themes such as perennial, [[Butterfly gardening|butterfly]], [[Wildlife garden|wildlife]], [[Japanese garden|Japanese]], [[Water garden|water]], [[Tropical garden|tropical]], or [[Shade garden|shade]] gardens. \n\nIn Japan, [[Samurai]] and [[Zen|Zen monks]] were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like [[floristry|flower arrangement]] known as ''[[ikebana]]''. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[Garden design|formal gardens]] or landscaped park lands, such as at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France, or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces. In the US, professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.<ref>[http://www.apld.org APLD.org]</ref>\n\n==Garden pests==\nGarden pests are generally [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[animal]]s (frequently [[insect]]s) that engage in activity that the gardener considers undesirable. A pest may crowd out desirable plants, disturb soil, stunt the growth of young seedlings, steal or damage fruit, or otherwise kill plants, hamper their growth, damage their appearance, or reduce the quality of the edible or ornamental portions of the plant. [[Aphid]]s, [[spider mite]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[ant]]s, [[bird]]s, and even [[cat]]s are commonly considered to be garden pests.\n\n[[File:Tropaeolum speciosum Poeppig and Endl. (AM AK294005-1).jpg|thumb|The flame flower (''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]''), climbs  over other plants to a sunlit position]]\nBecause gardeners may have different goals, organisms considered \"garden pests\" vary from gardener to gardener. ''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]'', for example, may be considered a desirable and ornamental garden plant, or it may be considered a pest if it [[seed]]s and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As another example, in [[lawn]]s, moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns, [[lichen]]s, especially very damp lawn lichens such as ''[[Peltigera]] lactucfolia'' and ''P. membranacea'', can become difficult to control and are considered pests.\n\n===Garden pest control===\nThere are many ways by which unwanted pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on the pest, the gardener's goals, and the gardener's philosophy. For example, snails may be dealt with through the use of a chemical pesticide, an organic pesticide, hand-picking, barriers, or simply growing snail-resistant plants.\n\n[[Pest control]] is often done through the use of [[pesticides]], which may be either [[Organic agriculture|organic]] or artificially synthesized. Pesticides may affect the [[ecology]] of a garden due to their effects on the populations of both target and non-target species. For example, unintended exposure to some [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides has been proposed as a factor in the recent decline in [[honey bee]] populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/03/28/science.1215039| title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees|accessdate= 2012-03-29}}</ref> A mole vibrator can deter mole activity in a garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/1998/04/mole-ested?page=0,2| title=Mole-ested|accessdate= 2014-05-28}}</ref>\n\nOther means of control include the removal of infected plants, using fertilizers and biostimulants to improve the health and vigour of plants so they better resist attack, practising [[crop rotation]] to prevent pest build-up, using [[companion planting]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation |accessdate=2010-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918114758/http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |archivedate=18 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> and practising good garden hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and clearing debris and [[weed]]s which may harbour pests.\n\n===Garden guns===\n{{main|Garden guns}}\n[[File:.22LR ratshot.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|CCI .22LR snake shot loaded with #12 shot]]\n\n[[Garden guns]] are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire [[.22 caliber]] [[snake shot]], and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. Garden guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past {{convert|15|yard}} to {{convert|20|yard}}, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure [[livestock]] with a [[ricochet]]. They are also used for pest control at [[airport]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], etc.<ref name=\"Eger\">{{cite web|last1=Eger|first1=Christopher|title=Marlin 25MG Garden Gun|url=http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|website=Marlin Firearms Forum|publisher=Outdoor Hub LLC|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918005923/http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arboretum]]\n* [[Bonsai]]\n* [[Compost]]\n* [[Cottage garden]]\n* [[Cultigen]]\n* [[Garden design]]\n* [[Growbag]]\n* [[Houseplant]]\n* [[Introduced species]]\n* [[Impact gardening]]\n* [[List of gardening topics]]\n* [[List of horticulture and gardening books]]\n* [[List of professional gardeners]]\n* [[Market garden]]\n* [[Master gardener program]]\n* [[No-dig gardening]]\n* [[Orchard]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{portalbar|Gardening|Agriculture}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wmog|gardening}}\n{{Commons category|Gardening}}\n* [http://www.garden.org National Gardening Association] (USA)\n* {{dmoz|Home/Gardening}}\n\n{{Horticulture and Gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Horticulture and gardening| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Practice of growing and cultivating plants}}\n{{about||planting a plain-text to be encrypted by an adversary|Gardening (cryptanalysis)|persons who garden|Gardener}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Cementerio, Tulc\u00e1n, Ecuador, 2015-07-21, DD 60.JPG|thumb|A gardener maintaining [[topiary]] in [[Tulc\u00e1n]], Ecuador]]\n'''Gardening''' is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of [[horticulture]]. In gardens, [[ornamental plant]]s are often grown for their [[flower]]s, [[leaf|foliage]], or overall appearance; useful plants, such as [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]], [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, and [[herb]]s, are grown for consumption, for use as [[dye]]s, or for [[Medicine|medicinal]] or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] use. Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity.\n\nGardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of [[shrub]]s, [[tree]]s, and [[herbaceous plant]]s, to residential [[back garden]]s including lawns and foundation plantings, and to [[container garden]]s grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from [[Agriculture|farming]] or [[forestry]].\n\n==History of gardening==\n{{Main|History of gardening}}\n[[Image:Forestgarden2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Robert Hart (horticulturist)|Robert Hart]]'s forest garden in [[Shropshire]], England]]\n\n===Ancient times===\n[[Forest gardening]], a forest-based food production system, is the world's oldest form of gardening.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9780754609582}}</ref> Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of families improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved while undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually foreign species were also selected and incorporated into the gardens.<ref>{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1#v=onepage|isbn=9789251028988}}</ref>\n\nAfter the emergence of the first [[civilization]]s, wealthy individuals began to create gardens for aesthetic purposes. [[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb paintings from the [[New Kingdom]] (around 1500 BC) provide some of the earliest physical evidence of ornamental [[horticulture]] and landscape design; they depict [[Egyptian lotus|lotus]] ponds surrounded by symmetrical rows of [[acacia]]s and [[palm tree|palms]]. A notable example of ancient ornamental gardens were the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]\u2014one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]] \u2014while [[ancient Rome]] had dozens of gardens.\n\nWealthy ancient Egyptians used gardens for providing shade. Egyptians associated trees and gardens with gods, believing that their deities were pleased by gardens. Gardens in ancient Egypt were often surrounded by walls with trees planted in rows. Among the most popular species planted were [[date palms]], sycamores, [[Ficus|fir trees]], nut trees, and [[willows]]. These gardens were a sign of higher socioeconomic status. In addition, wealthy ancient Egyptians grew vineyards, as wine was a sign of the higher social classes. [[Rose]]s, poppies, [[Asteraceae|daisies]] and [[Iris (plant)|irises]] could all also be found in the gardens of the Egyptians.\n\n[[Assyria]] was also renowned for its beautiful gardens. These tended to be wide and large, some of them used for hunting game\u2014rather like a game reserve today\u2014and others as leisure gardens. [[Cupressus|Cypresses]] and palms were some of the most frequently planted types of trees.\n\n[[Ancient Roman]] gardens were laid out with hedges and vines and contained a wide variety of flowers\u2014[[Acanthus (plant)|acanthus]], [[cornflowers]], [[crocus]], [[cyclamen]], hyacinth, iris, ivy, [[lavender]], lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy, [[rosemary]] and violets<ref name=\"localhistories\">{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/gardening.html| title=A Brief History of Gardening|accessdate= 2010-06-04}}</ref>\u2014as well as statues and sculptures. Flower beds were popular in the courtyards of rich Romans.\n\n===The Middle Ages===\n[[File:Mendel II 073 v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A gardener at work, 1607]]\nThe [[Middle Age]] represented a period of decline in gardens for aesthetic purposes, with regard to gardening. After the fall of Rome, gardening was done for the purpose of growing [[medicinal herbs]] and/or decorating church [[altars]]. Monasteries carried on a tradition of garden design and intense horticultural techniques during the medieval period in Europe. \nGenerally, monastic garden types consisted of kitchen gardens, infirmary gardens, cemetery orchards, cloister garths and vineyards. Individual monasteries might also have had a \"green court\", a plot of grass and trees where horses could graze, as well as a cellarer's garden or private gardens for obedientiaries, monks who held specific posts within the monastery.\n\n[[Islamic garden]]s were built after the model of [[Persian gardens]] and they were usually enclosed by walls and divided in four by watercourses. Commonly, the centre of the garden would have a [[reflecting pool]] or [[pavilion]]. Specific to the Islamic gardens are the [[mosaics]] and glazed tiles used to decorate the rills and [[Fountain|fountains]] that were built in these gardens.\n\nBy the late 13th century, rich Europeans began to grow gardens for leisure and for medicinal herbs and vegetables.<ref name=\"localhistories\" /> They surrounded the gardens by walls to protect them from animals and to provide [[seclusion]]. During the next two centuries, Europeans started planting lawns and raising flowerbeds and trellises of roses. Fruit trees were common in these gardens and also in some, there were turf seats. At the same time, the gardens in the [[monasteries]] were a place to grow flowers and medicinal herbs but they were also a space where the [[monks]] could enjoy nature and relax.\n\nThe gardens in the 16th and 17th century were [[symmetric]], proportioned and balanced with a more classical appearance. Most of these gardens were built around a central axis and they were divided into different parts by hedges. Commonly, gardens had flowerbeds laid out in squares and separated by gravel paths.\n\nGardens in Renaissance were adorned with sculptures, [[topiary]] and fountains. In the 17th century, [[knot garden]]s became popular along with the [[hedge maze]]s. By this time, Europeans started planting new flowers such as [[tulips]], marigolds and [[sunflowers]].\n\n===Cottage gardens===\n[[File:XN Kerascoet.jpg|thumb|A cottage garden in [[Brittany]]]]\n[[Cottage garden]]s, which emerged in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan times]], appear to have originated as a local source for herbs and fruits.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryrie|first=Charlie|title=The Cottage Garden: How to Plan and Plant a Garden That Grows Itself|publisher=[[Collins & Brown]]|year=2004|page=7|isbn=978-1-84340-216-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VfO_WIAx0wC&pg=PA7}}</ref> One theory is that they arose out of the [[Black Death]] of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages with personal gardens.<ref name=\"Scott-James80\">{{cite book|last=Scott-James|first=Anne|author2=Osbert Lancaster|title=The Pleasure Garden: An Illustrated History of British Gardening|publisher=[[Frances Lincoln Publishers]]|year=2004|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbhwIo3m3mQC&pg=PA80|isbn=978-0-7112-2360-8}}</ref> According to the late 19th-century legend of origin,<ref>[[Anne Scott-James]], ''The Cottage Garden'' (London: Lane) 1981, de-mythologised the origins of the English cottage garden, and its treasured [[topiary]] among the vegetables and flowers, popularly supposed to represent heirlooms from the seventeenth century.</ref> these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, to provide them with food and herbs, with flowers planted among them for decoration. Farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden\u2014about {{convert|1|acre}}\u2014where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.<ref>''A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600\u20131840'', Howard Colvin, [[Yale University Press]], 2008\n{{ISBN|0-300-12508-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CSyaO-MqYoAC&pg=PA659 p 659]</ref>\n\nAuthentic gardens of the [[Yeoman|yeoman cottager]] would have included a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, along with a well. The peasant cottager of medieval times was more interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use\u2014violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); [[calendula]]s and [[primula vulgaris|primroses]] were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as [[Dianthus barbatus|sweet William]] and [[hollyhock]]s, were grown entirely for their beauty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lloyd|first=Christopher|author2=Richard Bird|others=Jacqui Hurst|title=The Cottage Garden|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=1999|pages=6\u20139|isbn=978-0-7513-0702-3}}</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Sheffield Park Gardens, Fletching, Sussex - geograph.org.uk - 1582535.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sheffield Park Garden]], a [[landscape garden]] originally laid out in the 18th century by [[Capability Brown]]]]\nIn the 18th century gardens were laid out more naturally, without any walls. This style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scattering of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers, were a new style within the English landscape, a \"gardenless\" form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles. The [[English landscape garden]] usually included a lake, lawns set against groves of trees, and often contained shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges and [[folly|follies]] such as mock temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. This new style emerged in [[England]] in the early 18th century, and spread across [[Europe]], replacing the more formal, symmetrical [[garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise]] of the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.<ref>Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe'', Citadelles and Mazenod, Paris, 2006.</ref> The English garden presented an idealized view of nature.

Also, in 1804 the Horticultural Society was formed. \n\nGardens of the 19th century contained plants such as the monkey puzzle or Chile pine. This is also the time when the so-called \"[[gardenesque]]\" style of gardens evolved. These gardens displayed a wide variety of flowers in a rather small space. [[Rock garden]]s increased in popularity in the 19th century.\n\n==Types==\n{{main|List of garden types}}\n[[File:SF Conservatory of Flowers 3.jpg|thumb|right|Conservatory of Flowers in [[Golden Gate Park]], [[San Francisco]]]]\n[[File:Hanging baskets in thornbury arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hanging basket]]s in [[Thornbury, South Gloucestershire]]]]\n[[File:CCHS organic garden.jpg|thumb|An organic garden on a school campus]]\nResidential gardening takes place near the home, in a space referred to as the garden. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located [[roof garden|on a roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], [[Patio|on a patio]] or [[vivarium]].\n\nGardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoo|zoological gardens]]), [[amusement park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.\n* Indoor gardening is concerned with the growing of [[houseplant]]s within a residence or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated as part of [[air conditioning]] or heating systems. Indoor gardening extends the growing season in the fall and spring and can be used for [[winter gardening]].\n* [[Native plant gardening]] is concerned with the use of [[native plants]] with or without the intent of creating [[wildlife habitat]]. The goal is to create a garden in harmony with, and adapted to a given area. This type of gardening typically reduces water usage, maintenance, and fertilization costs, while increasing [[native fauna]]l interest.\n* [[Water garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog garden]]s are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant(s). In [[aquascaping]], a garden is created within an [[aquarium]] tank.\n* [[Container garden]]ing is concerned with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots, [[hanging basket]]s, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in atriums and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.\n* [[H\u00fcgelkultur]] is concerned with growing plants on piles of rotting wood, as a form of [[raised bed gardening]] and composting [[In situ#Biology|in situ]].<ref name=\"richsoil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/|title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds|website=www.richsoil.com}}</ref> An English [[loanword]] from German, it means \"mound garden.\" [[Toby Hemenway]], noted [[permaculture]] author and teacher, considers wood buried in trenches to also be a form of hugelkultur referred to as a dead wood [[Swale (landform)|swale]].<ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

These shared gardens, typically front or back [[yard (land)|yards]], are usually used to produce food that is divided between the two parties.\n* [[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] uses natural, sustainable methods, fertilizers and pesticides to grow non-[[genetically modified crops]].\n\n==Social aspects==\nPeople can express their political or social views in gardens, intentionally or not. The lawn vs. garden issue is played out in [[urban planning]] as the debate over the \"[[land ethic]]\" that is to determine urban [[land use]] and whether hyper [[hygiene|hygienist]] [[bylaw]]s (e.g. [[weed control]]) should apply, or whether land should generally be allowed to exist in its natural wild state. In a famous [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] case, \"Sandra Bell vs. City of Toronto\", 1997, the right to cultivate all native species, even most varieties deemed noxious or allergenic, was upheld as part of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]].\n\n[[Community gardening]] comprises a wide variety of approaches to sharing land and gardens.\n\n[[File:Schultenhof Mettingen Bauerngarten 8.jpg|thumb|left|Garden at the Schultenhof in [[Mettingen]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Germany]]\nPeople often surround their house and garden with a hedge. Common hedge plants are [[privet]], [[Crataegus|hawthorn]], [[beech]], [[Taxus|yew]], [[Leyland Cypress|leyland cypress]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], [[Thuja occidentalis|arborvitae]], [[Berberis|barberry]], [[Buxus|box]], [[holly]], [[Nerium oleander|oleander]], [[forsythia]] and [[lavender]]. The idea of open gardens without hedges may be distasteful to those who enjoy privacy.\nThe [[Slow Food]] movement has sought in some countries to add an edible [[School garden|school yard]] and garden classrooms to schools, e.g. in [[Fergus, Ontario]], where these were added to a public school to augment the kitchen classroom. [[Garden sharing]], where urban landowners allow gardeners to grow on their property in exchange for a share of the harvest, is associated with the desire to control the quality of one's food, and reconnect with soil and community.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/ethicalliving.organics Meet the urban sharecroppers] ''The Guardian'', 4 September 2008</ref>\n\nIn US and British usage, the production of ornamental plantings around buildings is called ''[[landscaping]]'', ''[[landscape maintenance]]'' or ''grounds keeping'', while international usage uses the term ''gardening'' for these same activities.\n\nAlso gaining popularity is the concept of \"Green Gardening\" which involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process \u2013 or the flowers and fruits produced thereby \u2013 doesn't adversely affect the environment or people's health in any manner.\n\n==Comparison with farming==\n[[File:Hayes-Valley-Farm by Zoey-Kroll fava-hillside.jpg|thumb|Berms of fava beans have been planted at Hayes Valley Farm, a community-built farm on the former Central freeway ramps of San Francisco]]\nGardening for beauty is likely{{original research inline|date=January 2018}} nearly as old as farming for food, however for most of history for the majority of people there was no real distinction since the need for food and other useful products trumped other concerns. Small-scale, [[subsistence agriculture]] (called [[hoe-farming]]) is largely indistinguishable from gardening. A patch of potatoes grown by a Peruvian peasant or an Irish smallholder for personal use could be described as either a garden or a farm. Gardening for average people evolved as a separate discipline, more concerned with aesthetics, [[recreation]] and [[leisure]],<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Mickey\n| first1 = Thomas J.\n| year = 2003\n| title = Deconstructing Public Relations: Public Relations Criticism\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wxaQAgAAQBAJ\n| series = Routledge Communication Series\n| location = Mahwah, New Jersey\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2008\n| page = 43\n| isbn = 9781135652210\n| access-date = 2018-01-21\n| quote = The number-one leisure activity in the United States is gardening.\n}}\n</ref>\nunder the influence of the pleasure gardens of the wealthy.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}  Meanwhile, farming has evolved (in developed countries) in the direction of [[commercial agriculture|commercialization]], [[economics of scale]], and [[monocropping]].\n\nIn respect to its food-producing purpose, gardening is distinguished{{by whom|date=January 2018}} from [[Agriculture|farming]] chiefly by scale and intent. Farming occurs on a larger scale, and with the production of salable goods as a major motivation. Gardening happens on a smaller scale, primarily for pleasure and to produce goods for the gardener's own family or community. There is some overlap between the terms, particularly in that some moderate-sized vegetable growing concerns, often called [[market gardening]], can fit in either category.\n\nThe key distinction between gardening and farming is essentially one of scale; gardening can be a hobby or an income supplement, but farming is generally understood{{by whom|date=January 2018}} as a full-time or commercial activity, usually involving more land and quite different practices. One distinction is that gardening is labor-intensive and employs very little [[infrastructural capital]], sometimes no more than a few tools, e.g. a [[spade]], [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], [[basket]] and [[watering can]]. By contrast, larger-scale farming often involves [[irrigation|irrigation systems]], chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[combine harvester|harvesters]] or at least [[ladder]]s, e.g. to reach up into [[fruit tree]]s. However, this distinction is becoming blurred with the increasing use of power tools in even small gardens.\n\n[[Monty Don]] has speculated on an atavistic connection between present-day gardeners and pre-modern [[peasantry]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Swift\n| first1 = Joe\n| author-link1 = Joe Swift\n| chapter = Summer at the plot\n| title = Joe's Allotment: Planning and planting a productive plot\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6c3UyYKo1EEC\n| publisher = Random House\n| date = 2012\n| isbn = 9781409070139\n| access-date = 2018-01-20\n| quote = I suppose it is an atavistic connection with the land and the completely honourable peasant mentality, that was lost in Britain with the Industrial Revolution, yet persists in our gardens and allotments.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe term [[precision agriculture]] is sometimes used{{by whom|date=January 2018}} to describe gardening using [[Appropriate technology|intermediate technology]] (more than tools, less than harvesters), especially of [[organic farming|organic varieties]]. Gardening is effectively scaled up to feed entire villages of over 100 people from specialized plots. A variant is the [[community gardening|community garden]] which offers plots to urban dwellers; see further in [[allotment (gardening)]].\n\n==Garden ornaments and accessories==\n{{main|Garden ornament}}\n[[Image:Urn, Palm House.JPG|thumb|left|upright|A classical [[urn]] at Palm House, the [[Belfast Botanic Gardens]], [[Northern Ireland]], as [[garden ornament]]]]\nThere is a wide range of [[garden ornament]]s and accessories available in the market for both the professional gardener and the amateur to exercise their creativity. These are used to add decoration or functionality, and may be made from a wide range of materials such as copper, stone, wood, bamboo, [[stainless steel]], [[clay]], [[stained glass]], concrete, or iron. Examples include [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]], [[garden furniture]], [[Garden sculpture|statues]], [[outdoor fireplace]]s, [[Fountain|fountains]], [[rain chain]]s, [[urns]], [[bird bath]]s and [[Bird feeder|feeders]], [[wind chime]]s, and garden lighting such as candle [[lanterns]] and [[oil lamps]]. The use of these items can be part of the expression of a gardener's gardening personality.\n\n==Gardens as art==\n{{See also|Landscape architecture}}\n[[Garden design]] is considered to be an art in most cultures, distinguished from gardening, which generally means ''garden maintenance''. Garden design can include different themes such as perennial, [[Butterfly gardening|butterfly]], [[Wildlife garden|wildlife]], [[Japanese garden|Japanese]], [[Water garden|water]], [[Tropical garden|tropical]], or [[Shade garden|shade]] gardens. \n\nIn Japan, [[Samurai]] and [[Zen|Zen monks]] were often required to build decorative gardens or practice related skills like [[floristry|flower arrangement]] known as ''[[ikebana]]''. In 18th-century Europe, country estates were refashioned by landscape gardeners into [[Garden design|formal gardens]] or landscaped park lands, such as at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], France, or [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]], England. Today, [[landscape architect]]s and [[garden designer]]s continue to produce artistically creative designs for private garden spaces. In the US, professional landscape designers are certified by the Association of Professional Landscape Designers.<ref>[http://www.apld.org APLD.org]</ref>\n\n==Garden pests==\nGarden pests are generally [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], or [[animal]]s (frequently [[insect]]s) that engage in activity that the gardener considers undesirable. A pest may crowd out desirable plants, disturb soil, stunt the growth of young seedlings, steal or damage fruit, or otherwise kill plants, hamper their growth, damage their appearance, or reduce the quality of the edible or ornamental portions of the plant. [[Aphid]]s, [[spider mite]]s, [[slug]]s, [[snail]]s, [[ant]]s, [[bird]]s, and even [[cat]]s are commonly considered to be garden pests.\n\n[[File:Tropaeolum speciosum Poeppig and Endl. (AM AK294005-1).jpg|thumb|The flame flower (''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]''), climbs  over other plants to a sunlit position]]\nBecause gardeners may have different goals, organisms considered \"garden pests\" vary from gardener to gardener. ''[[Tropaeolum speciosum]]'', for example, may be considered a desirable and ornamental garden plant, or it may be considered a pest if it [[seed]]s and starts to grow where it is not wanted. As another example, in [[lawn]]s, moss can become dominant and be impossible to eradicate. In some lawns, [[lichen]]s, especially very damp lawn lichens such as ''[[Peltigera]] lactucfolia'' and ''P. membranacea'', can become difficult to control and are considered pests.\n\n===Garden pest control===\nThere are many ways by which unwanted pests are removed from a garden. The techniques vary depending on the pest, the gardener's goals, and the gardener's philosophy. For example, snails may be dealt with through the use of a chemical pesticide, an organic pesticide, hand-picking, barriers, or simply growing snail-resistant plants.\n\n[[Pest control]] is often done through the use of [[pesticides]], which may be either [[Organic agriculture|organic]] or artificially synthesized. Pesticides may affect the [[ecology]] of a garden due to their effects on the populations of both target and non-target species. For example, unintended exposure to some [[neonicotinoid]] pesticides has been proposed as a factor in the recent decline in [[honey bee]] populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/03/28/science.1215039| title=A Common Pesticide Decreases Foraging Success and Survival in Honey Bees|accessdate= 2012-03-29}}</ref> A mole vibrator can deter mole activity in a garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdc.mo.gov/conmag/1998/04/mole-ested?page=0,2| title=Mole-ested|accessdate= 2014-05-28}}</ref>\n\nOther means of control include the removal of infected plants, using fertilizers and biostimulants to improve the health and vigour of plants so they better resist attack, practising [[crop rotation]] to prevent pest build-up, using [[companion planting]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation |accessdate=2010-08-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918114758/http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/2010/08/11/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/ |archivedate=18 September 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> and practising good garden hygiene, such as disinfecting tools and clearing debris and [[weed]]s which may harbour pests.\n\n===Garden guns===\n{{main|Garden guns}}\n[[File:.22LR ratshot.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|CCI .22LR snake shot loaded with #12 shot]]\n\n[[Garden guns]] are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire [[.22 caliber]] [[snake shot]], and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for pest control. Garden guns are short range weapons that can do little harm past {{convert|15|yard}} to {{convert|20|yard}}, and they're relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to a standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly injure [[livestock]] with a [[ricochet]]. They are also used for pest control at [[airport]]s, [[warehouse]]s, [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], etc.<ref name=\"Eger\">{{cite web|last1=Eger|first1=Christopher|title=Marlin 25MG Garden Gun|url=http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|website=Marlin Firearms Forum|publisher=Outdoor Hub LLC|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=28 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918005923/http://www.marlinforum.com/Marlin-25MG-Garden-Gun.html|archive-date=18 September 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Arboretum]]\n* [[Bonsai]]\n* [[Compost]]\n* [[Cottage garden]]\n* [[Cultigen]]\n* [[Garden design]]\n* [[Growbag]]\n* [[Houseplant]]\n* [[Introduced species]]\n* [[Impact gardening]]\n* [[List of gardening topics]]\n* [[List of horticulture and gardening books]]\n* [[List of professional gardeners]]\n* [[Market garden]]\n* [[Master gardener program]]\n* [[No-dig gardening]]\n* [[Orchard]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{portalbar|Gardening|Agriculture}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wmog|gardening}}\n{{Commons category|Gardening}}\n* [http://www.garden.org National Gardening Association] (USA)\n* {{dmoz|Home/Gardening}}\n\n{{Horticulture and Gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Horticulture and gardening| ]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:aa12:d57e:a780:bdcd:9833:14a3:ecb6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(izv3hiuhtvqiu9u9n)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardening"}
