These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

They could have established a parliamentary system like the \"historical nationalities\", or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.<ref name=perez/><ref name=clavero/>\n\nOnce the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the \"federation of autonomous communities\".

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences. The autonomic regime is characterized by an equilibrium between homogeneity and diversity ...

These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

They could have established a parliamentary system like the \"historical nationalities\", or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.<ref name=perez/><ref name=clavero/>\n\nOnce the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the \"federation of autonomous communities\".

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences.

There had been a [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|reconnaissance expedition]] the previous year but the 1922 expedition was the first attempt to conquer the summit. The main team members were [[Charles Granville Bruce|General Charles Granville Bruce]], [[Edward Lisle Strutt]], [[George Mallory]], [[George Ingle Finch]], [[Edward Felix Norton]], [[Henry Treise Morshead]], [[Howard Somervell]], Arthur Wakefield, and the photographer and movie maker [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]]. Making up the rest of the team was a large group of Tibetan and Nepalese Sherpa's and porters who tendered the pace of donkey's laden with food and equipment. The party arrived by steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station from where they trekked the short distance up the hillside to St Andrew's Colonial Home for three days relaxation. There was much excitement among the staff and children at St Andrew's, with football games, golf, and group evening sing-alongs taking place in the main school hall. Aeneas, his wife Clara, and their two 6-year-old children were at the centre of the hospitality, with Wolseley House (among other houses in the school compound) providing temporary accommodation for the lead mountaineers.<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Level 15 Special Archives, Kalimpong Papers: Files ACC 6039, Box 15 (1) \u2018Everest Climbers\u2019 1922, pages 37\u201340, documents the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition visit to St Andrew\u2019s Colonial Home (within the hand-typed biography of St Andrew\u2019s Colonial Home).

They reached their base camp at [[Rongbuk Glacier]] on 1 May. Sadly, the expedition's attempt to ascent [[Everest]] turned out to be unsuccessful. John Noel produced a movie of the expedition titled ''Climbing Mount Everest (1922)''.<ref>''Climbing Mount Everest'' (1922) \u2013 Directed by [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]] \u2013 housed at the [[British Film Institute]]: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-climbing-mt-everest-1922-online</ref> The movie shows the team arriving in a steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station and at St. Andrew's Colonial Home, although footage taken within the school compound is not included in the movie. The 1922 expedition did establish a new world record climbing height of 8,326 metres (27,320 ft). The teams next attempt to conquer [[Everest]] took place in 1924. It was during this expedition that [[George Mallory]] and his companion [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt to reach the summit together but at some point died in a fall, although until this day it is still unsure whether or not the pair did actually reach the summit? Mallory's body was only retrieved in 1999; Irvine's body has never been found.\n\nIn 1923, Sheldon Press published Aeneas Williams\u2019 instructional hardback ''Everyone's Book of the Weather''.<ref>''Everyone's Book of the Weather'' by A.

Aeneas and Clara immediately took Chinese language lessons and both became fluent in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. The port of [[Ichang]] was one of four ports open to foreign trade, and the highest reached by steamers. The city of [[Ichang]] was situated right in the center of China, on a low promontory on the North bank of the [[River Yangtze]]. It was a prefectural city of considerable importance in the province of [[Hupeh]], and conveniently situated as a mart for the tea trade of Hoh-fung-chow. [[Opium]] was also grown in the district as was the [[tung tree]], from which tung oil is extracted. \u2018The China Inland Mission possessed a number of unique features which set it apart from established missionary societies and gave it an intensity and, perhaps, a glamour, which other more conventional organisations must have envied.\u2019<ref>Dr. Rosemary Seton, former Archivist, School of Oriental and African Studies: China Inland Mission, 1865\u20131951 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London: http://www.ampltd.co.uk/collections_az/CIM-2/highlights.aspx</ref> During his stay in China, Aeneas wrote the poem ''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)''.<ref>''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'', p. 46-48</ref> In December 1926, Aeneas received a worrying letter from the [[Church of Scotland]] offices in [[Edinburgh]] talking of anxious happenings in [[Hankow]] and the possibility of a General Strike in China.<ref>Letter to Aeneas Francon Williams from the [[Church of Scotland]] office in [[Edinburgh]] dated 30 November 1926 stored in the Dr. Graham Kalimpong Archive held at the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.</ref> In the [[House of Commons]] the [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Austen Chamberlain]] intimated that the British Government were talking of taking immediate steps for the protection of U.K. nationals stationed in [[China]].

The main objectives of the conference were to revive the interest of the churches in the work of the Guild, and to demonstrate anew the value and usefulness of such an organization as auxiliary of Church life. Two halls had been booked for the occasion, the Beveridge and Adam Smith Halls, and on Friday evening Aeneas gave a missionary address at the Beveridge Hall about his work in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], and in [[Ichang]], [[China]].<ref>''Fife Free Press & Kirkcaldy Guardian'', Saturday 15 October 1927, page 7 \u2013 Church of Scotland Young Men's Guild Conference in Kirkcaldy (1927) report (retrieved 6 March 2018)</ref> It was at the 1888 meeting of the Guild held in the same town of Kirkcaldy that Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]] made the momentous decision and choice to establish a charitable school for destitute children in [[India]], and was thus ordained as the first missionary supported by the Guild.<ref>''The Meaning of White: Race, Class, and the 'Domiciled Community' in British India 1858\u20131930'' by Satoshi Mizutani, publ.

The Central Committee of Management of the Guild headed by the chairman Rev. T.B. Stewart Thomson had compiled an interesting program of events throughout the weekend. The conference opened with a civic reception by the Provost and Magistrates at the Beveridge Hall on the Friday, followed by a welcoming tea, after which Aeneas gave his missionary address at Beveridge Hall. The conference concluded on the Sunday evening with a public meeting at the Adam Smith Hall with guest speakers the Right Hon. [[William Murdoch Adamson]] M.P. and the Very Rev Dr. [[John White (minister)|John White]] DD LLD, ex-[[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].\n\n===Mahakalguri, West Bengal===\nIn late 1927, Aeneas and Clara returned to [[India]] where they were stationed at Mahakalguri, Eastern [[Dooars]] (Duars). Here Aeneas took on the role of missionary Pastor. Their two children Alfred and Clara remained in [[Edinburgh]] in order to continue their studies at [[George Watson's College]]. The [[Church of Scotland]] ran a children\u2019s home in the little country village of [[Duddingston]], near [[Edinburgh]], which was founded specifically for children of foreign missionaries, where the parents were unable to take their children abroad with them. The home was called Home House and was under the care of Miss Paterson (a Deaconess of the [[Church of Scotland]]) and her sister Minnie. The two sisters were referred to as \u2018Aunty\u2019 by the children.<ref>''Alice Maxwell Deaconess'' by Mrs. Horatio Macrae, published by Hodder & Stoughton, 1920 \u2013 pages 180-181</ref> The house in Old Church Lane had a large rear garden and was close enough to [[Edinburgh]] for the children to attend school there, yet surrounded by the bracing fresh air of the open countryside.<ref>Home-House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston \u2013 Category B Listed building: http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB29462</ref> It was at Home House that Alfred and Beatrice boarded during part of their education at [[George Watson\u2019s College]]. \n[[File:The former Home House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The former '''Home House''', Old Church Lane, [[Duddingston]], [[Edinburgh]]]]\n\nIn 1928, Aeneas Francon Williams was licensed by the Presbytery of [[Eastern Himalaya]] and in November of that same year he took his holy orders and was ordained by the Presbytery at [[Siliguri]], in [[North Bengal]]. The Presbytery of Edinburgh admitted Williams to the [[Church of Scotland]] on 28 May 1932.\n\n===Matelli, West Bengal===\nIn 1929, Aeneas was stationed at the [[Church of Scotland]] Guild Mission in [[Matelli]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district of [[West Bengal]] where he was the Minister of the [[Jalpaiguri]] Parish. At the Mission compound in Matelli, Aeneas and his family resided at the Manse. Through its schools \u2013 St. Ninian's 'Middle' school, St. Margaret's 'High' school, and its boys and girls Day Schools in Calcutta, boys school in Chinsura, the Abbey School, and various primary schools in Budge Budge, and its College \u2013 the Church of Scotland Mission offered Christian education from the kindergarten to the University stage.\n\nIn 1930, ''Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech'' by Aeneas Francon Williams was published. The book was intended for the use of Christians of the [[Mech Tribe]]s living at the foot of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district and was the first Hymn Book to be published in this regional dialect of [[Hindi]].<ref>The One Hundred and First Report of the Calcutta Christian Tract and Book Society (Incorporated) 1930/1931, page 7 & 10:(retrieved document 16 July 2017): The document mentions 2,000 copies of Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech by Aeneas Francon Williams were purchased by the Book Society for distribution: http://images.library.yale.edu/divinitycontent/dayrep/Calcutta%20Christian%20Tract%20and%20Book%20Society%201930-1931%20v101.pdf</ref>\nWhile Aeneas was living in [[Matelli]] he owned a [[Cinchona]] ([[quinine]]) plantation.\n\nOn 7 March 1930, Clara, being the only female along with two Babu's, was appointed under the provisions of rule 63(2), Chapter IV of the Bengal Jail Code, as a non-official visitor of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail in the [[Jalpaiguri district]] of [[West Bengal]] for a period of two years.<ref>''The Calcultta Gazette'', 13 March 1930 page 390, No. 886J: Babu Manish Chandra Roy, Babu Lalit Behari Ghosh, and Mrs. Francon Williams are appointed as non-official visitors of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.45159/2015.45159.The-Calcutta-Gazette-1930-January---June#page/n873/mode/2up/search/Francon+williams</ref> The appointment of the three non-official visitors was to help in the rehabilitation of the inmates by helping to change the offender's values, motivations, and attitudes, so that they could become contributing members of society upon their release.

In late-September, Williams showed his support for the \u2018Forward Movement\u2019 campaign launched by [[West Lothian]] Churches. At the campaign he gave a powerful speech detailing his all-absorbing work in [[India]] as a missionary.<ref>''Edinburgh Evening News'', Friday 23 September 1932, page 7 \u2013 Forward Movement (report) Campaign by West Lothian Churches</ref> On 3 October, Williams attended the Young Men's Guild of the Linlithgow and Falkirk Council at which he addressed the large attendance with more stories of his work and adventures as a missionary in [[North Bengal]]. \u2018Mr. Williams\u2019 address brought out in a wonderful way the romance of the mission fields, and the speaker dealt in a most interesting manner with his own particular work among the depressed races in the Eastern Duars.\u2019<ref>''Linlithgowshire Gazette'', Friday 7 October 1932, page 5 \u2013 Young Men's Guild (report)</ref> In 1934, Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred at the age of eighteen enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he would study medicine for the next six years.\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Aeneas and Clara, accompanied by their two offspring, Alfred (a medical student) and Beatrice (a nurse), sailed from [[Dooars]], [[India]], to America where they arrived in [[New York City]] on 16 August 1937 aboard SS ''Caledonia'' II.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com \u2013 New York Passenger Lists, 1820\u20131957 \u2013 Aeneas Francon Williams arrived New York on 16 August 1937 aboard SS Caledonia II.

The book was dedicated to his wife Clara. The suggestion of a priest being perceived as a \u2018young lover\u2019 was a bold move on both Williams and the publisher's part. It was certainly uncommon for a member of the cloth to reveal a poetic side that included talk of lovemaking. ''The Dundee Courier'' in their appraisal of the work noted that, \u2018Mr. Williams' poems reveal their author in many moods, as a nature lover, sportsman, and lover. Only an angler could have written his poems on ''Fishing'' and ''Wound Up''. There is a whimsical, almost \u2018Barriesque\u2019 ([[James M.

It was while Aeneas was in the [[Cardamom Hills]] that he wrote his poem ''Flowers''.<ref>''Flowers'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'' p. 34</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1946, in the New Year Indian Honours List, Clara (Mrs. Francon Williams) was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]] (Emperor of India) Bronze Medal for her work during [[WWII]] being in-charge of [[Red Cross]] work in [[Dooars]], [[Bengal]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical News |journal=The Indian Medical Gazette |date=December 1945 |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=629\u2013632 |pmc=5218119 |pmid=29015760 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, when [[India]] was granted Independence, Clara returned to [[Scotland]] to set up home in [[Edinburgh]]. Aeneas remained in India at the Mission during the handover. \nAfter the inauguration of [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] on 15 August 1947, Aeneas wrote 'Report 1947, The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During a Momentous Year', documenting what he saw and encountered in [[India]] during and after the handover. Much rejoicing took place in all the Mission institutions. The new Constitution (not yet fully adopted) guaranteed freedom 'to profess, practice and propagate' any religion. When pupils were asked, now that India was free would they rather there was no teaching about Christianity in school, the answer was always the same, that it was because of such teachings that they wished to study at the Mission. In fact, the Mission had since Independence Day been besieged with new applications for admission. However, Aeneas noted the College was experiencing a communal 'low' in staffing levels, with the shortage of Christian professors becoming an 'anxiety.' The Mission staffing levels had also fallen (to eight women and four men) and the Foreign Mission Committee was doing everything in its power to find new recruits.\nLooking ahead, Aeneas spoke of a 'partnership,' a 'Home Mission,' uniting the Mission of the [[Church of Scotland]] in India with the Church in India, and in his Report 1947 Aeneas stated: ''The Indian Church is now alive to her missionary responsibilities in this land and is heartily in favor of the new proposals, but the task is out of all proportion to her present resources, and it is only if the Church of Scotland continues her support in personnel and in finances that it can be accomplished. For the Church as for the nation it may be that a new day is dawning.''<ref>Report 1947: The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During A Momentous Year (1947), pamphlet, published Church of Scotland, 1947 \u2013 Centre for the Study of World Christianity Library, University of Edinburgh, Pamphlet \u2013 Reference: Pamphlet BV3280.

Chu</ref>\n\nIn 1948 after the handover, Aeneas sold his [[Cinchona]] plantation and other personal property and returned to the U.K. to join his wife in [[Edinburgh]], where they resided at 46 Belgrave Road. When Aeneas and Clara returned to Edinburgh for good they brought with them their pet chimpanzee named \u2018Glyris\u2019, which lived with them at their home at Belgrave Road.\n\nAeneas and Clara's son Alfred married Jane Warhurst (n\u00e9e Smith) on 29 March 1950 at St. Aidan's Church, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Marriage announcement in ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, Thursday 30 March 1950, page 10.</ref> Jane is a second cousin once removed of the author [[David Herbert Lawrence]] through her mother Lillian's sister Aunt Ada (n\u00e9e Rex) who married George Beardsall.\n\n==Later life==\nAeneas and Clara were both bilingual; Aeneas spoke eight languages fluently including [[Hindi]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. In Edinburgh, Aeneas was Chaplain of Edinburgh Social Services Department from 1952 and was affiliated with several churches including the former Stockbridge Free Church and [[St. Giles Cathedral]]. He was assistant Chaplain of [[HMP Edinburgh]] (Saughton) from 1948 to 1954. \nAs a youngster, Aeneas grew up in a literary household (his father John Francon Williams was a newspaper and journal editor and a published writer of many books) and as such Aeneas was encouraged by his father to pursue writing. Throughout Aeneas's life he had many books published in various fields of knowledge and was also a published poet. In 1942, upon the death of Dr [[John Anderson Graham]], Aeneas was commissioned by [[Oxford University Press]] to write Dr Graham's biography for inclusion in their ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]].''\n\nClara Anne Williams died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 January 1959 and is buried at [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.\n\nAfter Clara passed away, Aeneas sold their house at Belgrave Road and spent time travelling the world, circumnavigating it several times. There is evidence contained in correspondence between Aeneas and the London publishing house [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan & Co. Ltd.]] that he wrote two books during these travels. His regular visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]], and especially [[Tasmania]] \u2013 where his daughter Beatrice lived in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] with her husband Dr. Stephen Pugh and their daughter Andrea<ref>Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh & family: North Isles Family History archive:\nhttps://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> \u2013 appear to have sparked his imagination. Original correspondence from Aeneas to [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] held at The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], mentions two new manuscripts he had written relating to his travels that he\u2019d submitted to the publishing house. Whether MacMillan or another company published these books is unclear from the letters, as the books identify with [[Australasia]] and may only have been published in that territory, or could have remained unpublished.

Aeneas, his wife Clara, and their two 6-year-old children were at the centre of the hospitality, with Wolseley House (among other houses in the school compound) providing temporary accommodation for the lead mountaineers.<ref>[[National Library of Scotland]], Level 15 Special Archives, Kalimpong Papers: Files ACC 6039, Box 15 (1) \u2018Everest Climbers\u2019 1922, pages 37\u201340, documents the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition visit to St Andrew\u2019s Colonial Home (within the hand-typed biography of St Andrew\u2019s Colonial Home).

They reached their base camp at [[Rongbuk Glacier]] on 1 May. Sadly, the expedition's attempt to ascent [[Everest]] turned out to be unsuccessful. John Noel produced a movie of the expedition titled ''Climbing Mount Everest (1922)''.<ref>''Climbing Mount Everest'' (1922) \u2013 Directed by [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]] \u2013 housed at the [[British Film Institute]]: https://player.bfi.org.uk/free/film/watch-climbing-mt-everest-1922-online</ref> The movie shows the team arriving in a steam train at [[Kalimpong]] Road Station and at St. Andrew's Colonial Home, although footage taken within the school compound is not included in the movie. The 1922 expedition did establish a new world record climbing height of 8,326 metres (27,320 ft). The teams next attempt to conquer [[Everest]] took place in 1924. It was during this expedition that [[George Mallory]] and his companion [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Andrew Irvine]] made an attempt to reach the summit together but at some point died in a fall, although until this day it is still unsure whether or not the pair did actually reach the summit? Mallory's body was only retrieved in 1999; Irvine's body has never been found.\n\nIn 1923, Sheldon Press published Aeneas Williams\u2019 instructional hardback ''Everyone's Book of the Weather''.<ref>''Everyone's Book of the Weather'' by A.

The port of [[Ichang]] was one of four ports open to foreign trade, and the highest reached by steamers. The city of [[Ichang]] was situated right in the center of China, on a low promontory on the North bank of the [[River Yangtze]]. It was a prefectural city of considerable importance in the province of [[Hupeh]], and conveniently situated as a mart for the tea trade of Hoh-fung-chow. [[Opium]] was also grown in the district as was the [[tung tree]], from which tung oil is extracted. \u2018The China Inland Mission possessed a number of unique features which set it apart from established missionary societies and gave it an intensity and, perhaps, a glamour, which other more conventional organisations must have envied.\u2019<ref>Dr. Rosemary Seton, former Archivist, School of Oriental and African Studies: China Inland Mission, 1865\u20131951 from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London: http://www.ampltd.co.uk/collections_az/CIM-2/highlights.aspx</ref> During his stay in China, Aeneas wrote the poem ''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)''.<ref>''Voice of an Oracle (in Old China)'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'', p. 46-48</ref> In December 1926, Aeneas received a worrying letter from the [[Church of Scotland]] offices in [[Edinburgh]] talking of anxious happenings in [[Hankow]] and the possibility of a General Strike in China.<ref>Letter to Aeneas Francon Williams from the [[Church of Scotland]] office in [[Edinburgh]] dated 30 November 1926 stored in the Dr. Graham Kalimpong Archive held at the National Library of Scotland, Edinburgh.</ref> In the [[House of Commons]] the [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Austen Chamberlain]] intimated that the British Government were talking of taking immediate steps for the protection of U.K. nationals stationed in [[China]].

The main objectives of the conference were to revive the interest of the churches in the work of the Guild, and to demonstrate anew the value and usefulness of such an organization as auxiliary of Church life. Two halls had been booked for the occasion, the Beveridge and Adam Smith Halls, and on Friday evening Aeneas gave a missionary address at the Beveridge Hall about his work in [[Kalimpong]], [[India]], and in [[Ichang]], [[China]].<ref>''Fife Free Press & Kirkcaldy Guardian'', Saturday 15 October 1927, page 7 \u2013 Church of Scotland Young Men's Guild Conference in Kirkcaldy (1927) report (retrieved 6 March 2018)</ref> It was at the 1888 meeting of the Guild held in the same town of Kirkcaldy that Dr. [[John Anderson Graham]] made the momentous decision and choice to establish a charitable school for destitute children in [[India]], and was thus ordained as the first missionary supported by the Guild.<ref>''The Meaning of White: Race, Class, and the 'Domiciled Community' in British India 1858\u20131930'' by Satoshi Mizutani, publ.

The Central Committee of Management of the Guild headed by the chairman Rev. T.B. Stewart Thomson had compiled an interesting program of events throughout the weekend. The conference opened with a civic reception by the Provost and Magistrates at the Beveridge Hall on the Friday, followed by a welcoming tea, after which Aeneas gave his missionary address at Beveridge Hall. The conference concluded on the Sunday evening with a public meeting at the Adam Smith Hall with guest speakers the Right Hon. [[William Murdoch Adamson]] M.P. and the Very Rev Dr. [[John White (minister)|John White]] DD LLD, ex-[[Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]].\n\n===Mahakalguri, West Bengal===\nIn late 1927, Aeneas and Clara returned to [[India]] where they were stationed at Mahakalguri, Eastern [[Dooars]] (Duars). Here Aeneas took on the role of missionary Pastor. Their two children Alfred and Clara remained in [[Edinburgh]] in order to continue their studies at [[George Watson's College]]. The [[Church of Scotland]] ran a children\u2019s home in the little country village of [[Duddingston]], near [[Edinburgh]], which was founded specifically for children of foreign missionaries, where the parents were unable to take their children abroad with them. The home was called Home House and was under the care of Miss Paterson (a Deaconess of the [[Church of Scotland]]) and her sister Minnie. The two sisters were referred to as \u2018Aunty\u2019 by the children.<ref>''Alice Maxwell Deaconess'' by Mrs. Horatio Macrae, published by Hodder & Stoughton, 1920 \u2013 pages 180-181</ref> The house in Old Church Lane had a large rear garden and was close enough to [[Edinburgh]] for the children to attend school there, yet surrounded by the bracing fresh air of the open countryside.<ref>Home-House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston \u2013 Category B Listed building: http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB29462</ref> It was at Home House that Alfred and Beatrice boarded during part of their education at [[George Watson\u2019s College]]. \n[[File:The former Home House, Old Church Lane, Duddingston, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The former '''Home House''', Old Church Lane, [[Duddingston]], [[Edinburgh]]]]\n\nIn 1928, Aeneas Francon Williams was licensed by the Presbytery of [[Eastern Himalaya]] and in November of that same year he was ordained by the Presbytery at [[Siliguri]], in [[North Bengal]]. The Presbytery of Edinburgh admitted Williams to the [[Church of Scotland]] on 28 May 1932.\n\n===Matelli, West Bengal===\nIn 1929, Aeneas was stationed at the [[Church of Scotland]] Guild Mission in [[Matelli]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district of [[West Bengal]] where he was the Minister of the [[Jalpaiguri]] Parish. At the Mission compound in Matelli, Aeneas and his family resided at the Manse. Through its schools \u2013 St. Ninian's 'Middle' school, St. Margaret's 'High' school, and its boys and girls Day Schools in Calcutta, boys school in Chinsura, the Abbey School, and various primary schools in Budge Budge, and its College \u2013 the Church of Scotland Mission offered Christian education from the kindergarten to the University stage.\n\nIn 1930, ''Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech'' by Aeneas Francon Williams was published. The book was intended for the use of Christians of the [[Mech Tribe]]s living at the foot of the [[Himalayas]] in the [[Jalpaiguri]] district and was the first Hymn Book to be published in this regional dialect of [[Hindi]].<ref>The One Hundred and First Report of the Calcutta Christian Tract and Book Society (Incorporated) 1930/1931, page 7 & 10:(retrieved document 16 July 2017): The document mentions 2,000 copies of Hymn Book in Jalpaiguri Mech by Aeneas Francon Williams were purchased by the Book Society for distribution: http://images.library.yale.edu/divinitycontent/dayrep/Calcutta%20Christian%20Tract%20and%20Book%20Society%201930-1931%20v101.pdf</ref>\nWhile Aeneas was living in [[Matelli]] he owned a [[Cinchona]] ([[quinine]]) plantation.\n\nOn 7 March 1930, Clara, being the only female along with two Babu's, was appointed under the provisions of rule 63(2), Chapter IV of the Bengal Jail Code, as a non-official visitor of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail in the [[Jalpaiguri district]] of [[West Bengal]] for a period of two years.<ref>''The Calcultta Gazette'', 13 March 1930 page 390, No. 886J: Babu Manish Chandra Roy, Babu Lalit Behari Ghosh, and Mrs. Francon Williams are appointed as non-official visitors of the Alipur Duar Suli Jail: https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.45159/2015.45159.The-Calcutta-Gazette-1930-January---June#page/n873/mode/2up/search/Francon+williams</ref> The appointment of the three non-official visitors was to help in the rehabilitation of the inmates by helping to change the offender's values, motivations, and attitudes, so that they could become contributing members of society upon their release.

In late-September, Williams showed his support for the \u2018Forward Movement\u2019 campaign launched by [[West Lothian]] Churches. At the campaign he gave a powerful speech detailing his all-absorbing work in [[India]] as a missionary.<ref>''Edinburgh Evening News'', Friday 23 September 1932, page 7 \u2013 Forward Movement (report) Campaign by West Lothian Churches</ref> On 3 October, Williams attended the Young Men's Guild of the Linlithgow and Falkirk Council at which he addressed the large attendance with more stories of his work and adventures as a missionary in [[North Bengal]]. \u2018Mr. Williams\u2019 address brought out in a wonderful way the romance of the mission fields, and the speaker dealt in a most interesting manner with his own particular work among the depressed races in the Eastern Duars.\u2019<ref>''Linlithgowshire Gazette'', Friday 7 October 1932, page 5 \u2013 Young Men's Guild (report)</ref> In 1934, Aeneas and Clara's son Alfred at the age of eighteen enrolled at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he would study medicine for the next six years.\n\nIn the summer of 1937, Aeneas and Clara, accompanied by their two offspring, Alfred (a medical student) and Beatrice (a nurse), sailed from [[Dooars]], [[India]], to America where they arrived in [[New York City]] on 16 August 1937 aboard SS ''Caledonia'' II.<ref>http://www.ancestry.com \u2013 New York Passenger Lists, 1820\u20131957 \u2013 Aeneas Francon Williams arrived New York on 16 August 1937 aboard SS Caledonia II.

The book was dedicated to his wife Clara. The suggestion of a priest being perceived as a \u2018young lover\u2019 was a bold move on both Williams and the publisher's part. It was certainly uncommon for a member of the cloth to reveal a poetic side that included talk of lovemaking. ''The Dundee Courier'' in their appraisal of the work noted that, \u2018Mr. Williams' poems reveal their author in many moods, as a nature lover, sportsman, and lover.

It was while Aeneas was in the [[Cardamom Hills]] that he wrote his poem ''Flowers''.<ref>''Flowers'' by Aeneas Francon Williams, ''Let Poets Sing'' p. 34</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1946, in the New Year Indian Honours List, Clara (Mrs. Francon Williams) was awarded the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal]] (Emperor of India) Bronze Medal for her work during [[WWII]] being in-charge of [[Red Cross]] work in [[Dooars]], [[Bengal]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Medical News |journal=The Indian Medical Gazette |date=December 1945 |volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=629\u2013632 |pmc=5218119 |pmid=29015760 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1947, when [[India]] was granted Independence, Clara returned to [[Scotland]] to set up home in [[Edinburgh]]. Aeneas remained in India at the Mission during the handover. \nAfter the inauguration of [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] on 15 August 1947, Aeneas wrote 'Report 1947, The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During a Momentous Year', documenting what he saw and encountered in [[India]] during and after the handover. Much rejoicing took place in all the Mission institutions. The new Constitution (not yet fully adopted) guaranteed freedom 'to profess, practice and propagate' any religion. When pupils were asked, now that India was free would they rather there was no teaching about Christianity in school, the answer was always the same, that it was because of such teachings that they wished to study at the Mission. In fact, the Mission had since Independence Day been besieged with new applications for admission. However, Aeneas noted the College was experiencing a communal 'low' in staffing levels, with the shortage of Christian professors becoming an 'anxiety.' The Mission staffing levels had also fallen (to eight women and four men) and the Foreign Mission Committee was doing everything in its power to find new recruits.\nLooking ahead, Aeneas spoke of a 'partnership,' a 'Home Mission,' uniting the Mission of the [[Church of Scotland]] in India with the Church in India, and in his Report 1947 Aeneas stated: ''The Indian Church is now alive to her missionary responsibilities in this land and is heartily in favor of the new proposals, but the task is out of all proportion to her present resources, and it is only if the Church of Scotland continues her support in personnel and in finances that it can be accomplished. For the Church as for the nation it may be that a new day is dawning.''<ref>Report 1947: The Work of the Church of Scotland Mission in Bengal During A Momentous Year (1947), pamphlet, published Church of Scotland, 1947 \u2013 Centre for the Study of World Christianity Library, University of Edinburgh, Pamphlet \u2013 Reference: Pamphlet BV3280.

When Aeneas and Clara returned to Edinburgh for good they brought with them their pet chimpanzee named \u2018Glyris\u2019, which lived with them at their home at Belgrave Road.\n\nAeneas and Clara's son Alfred married Jane Warhurst (n\u00e9e Smith) on 29 March 1950 at St. Aidan's Church, [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]].<ref>Marriage announcement in ''The Scotsman'' newspaper, Thursday 30 March 1950, page 10.</ref> Jane is a second cousin once removed of the author [[David Herbert Lawrence]] through her mother Lillian's sister Aunt Ada (n\u00e9e Rex) who married George Beardsall.\n\n==Later life==\nAeneas and Clara were both bilingual; Aeneas spoke eight languages fluently including [[Hindi]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. In Edinburgh, Aeneas was Chaplain of Edinburgh Social Services Department from 1952 and was affiliated with several churches including the former Stockbridge Free Church and [[St. Giles Cathedral]]. He was assistant Chaplain of [[HMP Edinburgh]] (Saughton) from 1948 to 1954. \nAs a youngster, Aeneas grew up in a literary household (his father John Francon Williams was a newspaper and journal editor and a published writer of many books) and as such Aeneas was encouraged by his father to pursue writing. Throughout Aeneas's life he had many books published in various fields of knowledge and was also a published poet. In 1942, upon the death of Dr [[John Anderson Graham]], Aeneas was commissioned by [[Oxford University Press]] to write Dr Graham's biography for inclusion in their ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]].''\n\nClara Anne Williams died in [[Edinburgh]] on 25 January 1959 and is buried at [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.\n\nAfter Clara passed away, Aeneas sold their house at Belgrave Road and spent time travelling the world, circumnavigating it several times. There is evidence contained in correspondence between Aeneas and the London publishing house [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan & Co. Ltd.]] that he wrote two books during these travels. His regular visits to Australia and [[New Zealand]], and especially [[Tasmania]] \u2013 where his daughter Beatrice lived in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] with her husband Dr. Stephen Pugh and their daughter Andrea<ref>Dr. Stephen Ian Pugh & family: North Isles Family History archive:\nhttps://www.bayanne.info/Shetland/getperson.php?personID=I390221&tree=ID1</ref> \u2013 appear to have sparked his imagination. Original correspondence from Aeneas to [[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]] held at The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], mentions two new manuscripts he had written relating to his travels that he\u2019d submitted to the publishing house. Whether MacMillan or another company published these books is unclear from the letters, as the books identify with [[Australasia]] and may only have been published in that territory, or could have remained unpublished. The two books in question are ''Tasmanian Apples'' and ''Kiwiland''. The later work is possibly associated with the flightless [[Kiwi]] bird, which Aeneas had grown particularly fond of during his visits to [[New Zealand]]. \u2018I fed these interesting flightless birds in Wellington Zoo,\u2019 Aeneas writes keenly to MacMillan. He also fed the [[tuatara]], courtesy of his friend \u2018the Superintendent Mr. Curtis,\u2019 who told him where he could see the \u2018pre-historic little tuatara, the only true Saurian left on this earth, whose ancestors were at least 3,000,000 years on this planet, long before we were.\u2019<ref>Letters: Williams, Aeneas Francon ~ 1960\u20131961 ~ former ref: Second series: The Museum of English Rural Life and Special Collections at the [[University of Reading]], Redlands Road, Reading, RG1 5EX: https://www.reading.ac.uk/web/files/special-collections/MAC_W.pdf</ref> Aeneas also mentions to his publisher that his friend Henry Kelly of the New Zealand Wildlife Department was arranging \u2018to send us a live [[Kiwi]], the very first Kiwi to be in Scotland.\u2019<ref>''i-Newspaper'', 15 June 2018, page 18 \u2013 Manuscripts and Kiwis Scarce (Reader's Grandfather helped bring first Kiwi to Scotland) (retrieved 16 June 2018): https://www.pressreader.com/uk/i-newspaper/20180615</ref> After returning from his travels abroad, Aeneas moved into 10 Carlton Street, [[Stockbridge, Edinburgh|Stockbridge]], Edinburgh, where he lived until his early-80s, before moving to [[Sheffield]], Yorkshire, to live with his son Alfred.\n[[File:Clara Anne Rendall and Aeneas Francon Williams gravestone Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Clara Anne Rendall and Aeneas Francon Williams' gravestone at [[Dean Cemetery]], [[Edinburgh]]]]\nAeneas died in [[Sheffield]] in 1971 and is buried with his wife Clara in [[Dean Cemetery]], Edinburgh.\n\nAeneas Francon Williams is the brother of artist [[David Dougal Williams]] and the grandfather of writer Iain Cameron Williams.<ref>Iain Cameron Williams: http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4751.Iain_Cameron_Williams</ref><ref>Iain Cameron Williams World Catalogue: http://www.worldcat.org/title/underneath-a-harlem-moon-the-harlem-to-paris-years-of-adelaide-hall/oclc/51780394&referer=brief_results</ref>\n\nA cousin of Aeneas's named Jane Williams married American [[Edward Burton Hughes]].
