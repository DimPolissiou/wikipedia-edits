His liberation was forced by a [[Loyalty Day (Argentina)|massive popular demonstration]], and he went on to win the [[Argentine general election, 1946|1946 election]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Per\u00f3n [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

[[Arturo Frondizi]] from the UCR won the [[Argentine general election, 1958|following elections]].{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=353\u2013379}} He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic [[trade deficit]] and lifted Peronism proscription; yet his efforts to stay on good terms with Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=34}} But Senate Chief [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guido]] reacted swiftly and applied the anti-[[power vacuum]] legislation, becoming president instead; elections were repealed and Peronism proscribed again. [[Arturo Illia]] was [[Argentine general election, 1963|elected in 1963]] and led to an overall increase in prosperity; however his attempts to legalize Peronism resulted in his overthrow in 1966 by the [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]]-led [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] called the [[Argentine Revolution]], creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]]'s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per\u00f3n's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423\u201365}}\n\nOn the day Per\u00f3n returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76\u201377}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).\nPer\u00f3n died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucum\u00e1n province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Per\u00f3n was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.\n\nIn 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]].

In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Rancher\u00eda'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Argentina}}\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in [[Latin American cinema]], along with those produced in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl J.|last=Mora|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOwdFIQiTv8C&pg=PA196|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|page=196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |title=Argentina \u2013 Cultura \u2013 Cine |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141530/http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.{{sfn|King|2000|p=36}} The world's first [[list of animated feature films|animated feature films]] were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]], in 1917 and 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|title=Quirino Cristiani, The Untold Story of Argentina's Pioneer Animator|first=Giannalberto|last=Bendazzi|publisher=Animation World Network|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121624/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|caption_align=center\n|image1=Andr\u00e9s Muschietti.jpg|caption1=[[Andy Muschietti]], director of ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', the highest-grossing horror film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|title=Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever|last=Mumford|first=Gwilym|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114000256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|title='Blade Runner 2049' Launches With $50M Overseas; 'It' Tops $600M WW; 'Despicable 3' Hops Past 'Zootopia' \u2013 Intl Box Office|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205909/http://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|image2=Marcelo Pont Verg\u00e9s.jpg|caption2=The art director of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' won the [[Academy Award]] for that film.\n}}\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], for ''[[The Official Story]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009), from seven nominations:\n* ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'' (''La tregua'') in 1974\n* ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' in 1984\n* ''[[The Official Story]]'' (''La historia oficial'') in 1985\n* ''[[Tango (1998 film)|Tango]]'' in 1998\n* ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (''El hijo de la novia'') in 2001\n* ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (''El secreto de sus ojos'') in 2009\n* ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (''Relatos salvajes'') in 2015\n\nIn addition, Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov]] and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]] shared in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for 2014.

He [[nationalization|nationalized]] strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full [[external debt]] and achieved nearly [[full employment]]. The economy, however, began to decline in 1950 because of over-expenditure. His highly popular wife, [[Eva Per\u00f3n]], played a central political role. She pushed Congress to enact [[women's suffrage]] in 1947,{{sfn|Barnes|1978|p=3}} and developed an unprecedented social assistance to the most vulnerable sectors of society.{{sfn|Barnes|1978|pp=113ff}} However, her declining health did not allow her to run for the vice-presidency in 1951, and she died of cancer the following year. Per\u00f3n [[Argentine general election, 1951|was reelected in 1951]], surpassing even his 1946 performance. In 1955 the Navy [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo|bombed the Plaza de Mayo]] in an ill-fated attempt to kill the President. A few months later, during the self-called [[Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora|Liberating Revolution]] coup, he resigned and went into [[exile]] in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

Trade unionists were targeted for assassination by the Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n]]'s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (translates to Operation of Independence) in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the ''[[Cordobazo]]'' and the ''[[Rosariazo]]''. The terrorist guerrilla organization [[Montoneros]] kidnapped and executed Aramburu.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=127}} The newly chosen head of government, [[Alejandro Agust\u00edn Lanusse]], seeking to ease the growing political pressure, let [[H\u00e9ctor Jos\u00e9 C\u00e1mpora]] be the Peronist candidate instead of Per\u00f3n. C\u00e1mpora won the [[Argentine general election, March 1973|March 1973 election]], issued a [[amnesty|pardon]] for condemned guerrilla members and then secured Per\u00f3n's return from his exile in Spain.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol. II|pp=423\u201365}}\n\nOn the day Per\u00f3n returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions\u2014[[right-wing]] union leaders and [[left-wing]] youth from Montoneros\u2014resulted in the [[Ezeiza Massacre]]. C\u00e1mpora resigned, overwhelmed by political violence, and Per\u00f3n won the [[Argentine general election, September 1973|September 1973 election]] with his third wife [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n|Isabel]] as vice-president. He [[expulsion of Montoneros from Plaza de Mayo|expelled Montoneros from the party]]{{sfn|Robben|2011|pp=76\u201377}} and they became once again a clandestine organization. [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]] organized the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA) to fight against them and the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP).\nPer\u00f3n died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion,{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=145}} [[Operation Independence|stopping ERP's attempt]] to start a rural insurgence in Tucum\u00e1n province.{{sfn|Robben|2011|p=148}} [[March 1976 coup|Isabel Per\u00f3n was ousted]] one year later by a junta of the three armed forces, led by army general [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. They initiated the [[National Reorganization Process]], often shortened to ''Proceso''.{{sfn|Galasso|2011|loc=vol.

By the end of 1976 Montoneros had lost near 2,000 members; by 1977, the ERP was completely defeated. A severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly annihilated, ending the guerrilla threat. Nevertheless, the junta stayed in power.\n\nIn 1982, the then head of state, General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], authorised the invasion of the British territories of South Georgia and, on 2 April, of the [[Operation Rosario|Falkland Islands]].

In this stage, in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''Siripo'' had its premiere. ''Siripo'' is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''La Rancher\u00eda'' theatre operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation's longest-continuously operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century. The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage performances. Antonio Petalardo's successful 1871 gambit on the opening of the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main|Cinema of Argentina}}\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in [[Latin American cinema]], along with those produced in [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Cinema of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl J.|last=Mora|title=Mexican Cinema: Reflections of a Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pOwdFIQiTv8C&pg=PA196|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04304-6|page=196}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |title=Argentina \u2013 Cultura \u2013 Cine |language=Spanish |date=16 October 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216141530/http://www.argentina.ar/_es/cultura/cine/index.php |archivedate=16 December 2008}}</ref> Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s.{{sfn|King|2000|p=36}} The world's first [[list of animated feature films|animated feature films]] were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]], in 1917 and 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|title=Quirino Cristiani, The Untold Story of Argentina's Pioneer Animator|first=Giannalberto|last=Bendazzi|publisher=Animation World Network|year=1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928121624/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.4/articles/bendazzi1.4.html|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|caption_align=center\n|image1=Andr\u00e9s Muschietti.jpg|caption1=[[Andy Muschietti]], director of ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'', the highest-grossing horror film of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|title=Stephen King's It scares off The Exorcist to become highest-grossing horror ever|last=Mumford|first=Gwilym|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 29, 2017|accessdate=October 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114000256/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/29/stephen-king-it-the-exorcist-highest-grossing-horror-film-ever|archive-date=14 November 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|title='Blade Runner 2049' Launches With $50M Overseas; 'It' Tops $600M WW; 'Despicable 3' Hops Past 'Zootopia' \u2013 Intl Box Office|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008205909/http://deadline.com/2017/10/blade-runner-2049-it-movie-horror-record-despicable-me-3-kingsman-never-say-die-weekend-results-international-box-office-1202184382/|archive-date=8 October 2017|url-status = live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|image2=Marcelo Pont Verg\u00e9s.jpg|caption2=The art director of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' won the [[Academy Award]] for that film.\n}}\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]], for ''[[The Official Story]]'' (1985) and ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009), from seven nominations:\n* ''[[The Truce (1974 film)|The Truce]]'' (''La tregua'') in 1974\n* ''[[Camila (film)|Camila]]'' in 1984\n* ''[[The Official Story]]'' (''La historia oficial'') in 1985\n* ''[[Tango (1998 film)|Tango]]'' in 1998\n* ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (''El hijo de la novia'') in 2001\n* ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (''El secreto de sus ojos'') in 2009\n* ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (''Relatos salvajes'') in 2015\n\nIn addition, Argentine composers [[Luis Enrique Bacalov]] and [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] have been honored with [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Academy Awards for Best Original Score]], and [[Armando B\u00f3 (screenwriter)|Armando B\u00f3]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone]] shared in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]] for 2014.

It is run at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in Surrey over a distance of one mile, four [[furlong]]s and 6 yards (2,420 metres), on the first Saturday of June each year.<ref name=\"century\">{{cite book|last1 = Morris | first1 = Tony |last2=Randall|first2=John|title=A Century of Champions|publisher= Portway Press|year=1999|isbn=1-90157015-0}}</ref>\n\nIt is Britain's richest horse race, and the most prestigious of the five [[British Classic Races|Classics]]. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Riband\" of the turf. The race serves as the middle leg of the historically significant [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|Triple Crown]] of British horse racing, preceded by the [[2000 Guineas Stakes|2000 Guineas]] and followed by the [[St Leger Stakes|St&nbsp;Leger]], although the feat of winning all three is rarely attempted in the modern era due to changing priorities in racing and breeding, and the demands it places on horses.\n\nThe name \"Derby\" has become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times, notably by the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the United States. The Derby run at Epsom is the original and in Great Britain is invariably referred to as \"the Derby\". It is one of Britain's great national sporting events<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-33034503|title=Crowds flock to Epsom for Derby Day|work=BBC News}}</ref> and has a large worldwide TV audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportcal.com/News/PressReleases/8990?sportID=159&size=50|title=BBC Worldwide Offers International TV Rights to Epsom Derby|publisher=Sportcal}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Stanley family, Earls of Derby, had a long history of horse-racing, and [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]], who gained the Lordship of Mann in 1627, instituted horse-racing on the [[Langness Peninsula]] on the [[Isle of Man]], donating a cup for what became known as the \"[[Manx Derby]]\".<ref>''Mona Miscellany'' Second Series, Volume 21 pp183-187, The Manx Society (1873), [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol21/p183.htm]</ref>\n \nThe Derby originated at a celebration following the first running of the [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks Stakes]] in 1779. A new race was planned, and it was decided that it should be named after either the host of the party, the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|12th Earl of Derby]], or one of his guests, [[Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet|Sir Charles Bunbury]] (the [[Bunbury Cup]] run at Newmarket would later be named in his honour). According to legend the decision was made by the toss of a coin, but it is probable that Bunbury, the Steward of the [[Jockey Club]], deferred to his host.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/epsom_derby/1347923.stm |title=The Epsom Derby uncovered |work=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2001|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> The inaugural running of the Derby was held on Thursday 4 May 1780. It was won by [[Diomed]], a colt owned by Sir Charles Bunbury, who collected prize money of \u00a31,065 15s. The first four runnings were contested over 1 mile, but this was amended to the current distance of 1\u00bd miles in 1784. Lord Derby achieved his first success in the event in 1787, with a horse called [[Sir Peter Teazle]].\n\nThe starting point of the race was moved twice during the 19th century. The first move, suggested by [[Lord George Bentinck]], was in 1848, and the second was in 1872. It was discovered in 1991 that the exact length of the race was one mile, four furlongs and 10 yards.<ref name=\"century\"/>\n\nInitially, the Derby was run on a Thursday in late May or early June, depending on when Easter occurred. In 1838 the race was moved to a Wednesday to fit in with the railways' [[timetables]], but still followed the moveable feast of Easter. In the 20th century, the race was run on the first Wednesday in June from 1900 until 1995, not including 1915 to 1918 (during the [[First World War]]), when it was on a Tuesday. During the [[Second World War]], from 1942 until 1945 the race was run on a Saturday, as it was in the post-war years of 1947 to 1950 and again in 1953.<ref name=\"century\"/> In 1995 the day was changed from the first Wednesday in June to the first Saturday,<ref name=SpiritsUp>{{cite news|author=Telegraph View |date=3 June 2011|title=Epsom Derby: Spirits up on the Downs |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/8555678/Epsom-Derby-Spirits-up-on-the-Downs.html|accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> and since then all the races have taken place on that day.\n\nThe Derby has been run at Epsom in all years except during the [[world war]]s. From 1915 to 1918 and from 1940 to 1945, the Derby was run at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]. These races are known as the 'New Derby'.\n\nThe Derby has inspired many similar events around the world. European variations include the [[Derby Italiano]], the [[Deutsches Derby]], the [[Irish Derby]] and the [[Prix du Jockey Club]] (popularly known in the British Isles as the \"French Derby\"). Several races in the United States include the \"Derby\" name, including the oldest, the [[Kentucky Derby]]. Other national equivalents include the [[Australian Derby]], the [[New Zealand Derby]], and the [[Tokyo Y\u016bshun]].\n\n==Epsom Fair==\n[[File:William Powell Frith - The Derby Day - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Derby Day]]'' by [[William Powell Frith]] (1858)]]\nFor many years the Derby was run on a Wednesday or a Thursday and on the day huge crowds would come from London, not only to see the race but to enjoy other entertainment (during some of the 19th century and most of the 20th Parliament would adjourn to allow members to attend the meeting).<ref name=SpiritsUp/><ref name=Malden>{{cite book|ref=harv |editor-last=Malden |editor-first=Henry Elliot|year=1902 |title=The Victoria history of the county of Surrey |location=Westminster |publisher=A.

It is run at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] in Surrey over a distance of one mile, four [[furlong]]s and 6 yards (2,420 metres), on the first Saturday of June each year.<ref name=\"century\">{{cite book|last1 = Morris | first1 = Tony |last2=Randall|first2=John|title=A Century of Champions|publisher= Portway Press|year=1999|isbn=1-90157015-0}}</ref>\n\nIt is Britain's richest horse race, and the most prestigious of the five [[British Classic Races|Classics]]. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Riband\" of the turf. The race serves as the middle leg of the historically significant [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|Triple Crown]] of British horse racing, preceded by the [[2000 Guineas Stakes|2000 Guineas]] and followed by the [[St Leger Stakes|St&nbsp;Leger]], although the feat of winning all three is rarely attempted in the modern era due to changing priorities in racing and breeding, and the demands it places on horses.\n\nThe name \"Derby\" has become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times, notably by the [[Kentucky Derby]] in the United States. The Derby run at Epsom is the original and in Great Britain is invariably referred to as \"the Derby\". It is one of Britain's great national sporting events<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-33034503|title=Crowds flock to Epsom for Derby Day|work=BBC News}}</ref> and has a large worldwide TV audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportcal.com/News/PressReleases/8990?sportID=159&size=50|title=BBC Worldwide Offers International TV Rights to Epsom Derby|publisher=Sportcal}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Stanley family, Earls of Derby, had a long history of horse-racing, and [[James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby]], who gained the Lordship of Mann in 1627, instituted horse-racing on the [[Langness Peninsula]] on the [[Isle of Man]], donating a cup for what became known as the \"[[Manx Derby]]\".<ref>''Mona Miscellany'' Second Series, Volume 21 pp183-187, The Manx Society (1873), [http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/manxsoc/msvol21/p183.htm]</ref>\n \nThe Derby originated at a celebration following the first running of the [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks Stakes]] in 1779. A new race was planned, and it was decided that it should be named after either the host of the party, the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby|12th Earl of Derby]], or one of his guests, [[Sir Charles Bunbury, 6th Baronet|Sir Charles Bunbury]] (the [[Bunbury Cup]] run at Newmarket would later be named in his honour). According to legend the decision was made by the toss of a coin, but it is probable that Bunbury, the Steward of the [[Jockey Club]], deferred to his host.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/in_depth/2001/epsom_derby/1347923.stm |title=The Epsom Derby uncovered |work=BBC Sport |date=2 June 2001|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> The inaugural running of the Derby was held on Thursday 4 May 1780. It was won by [[Diomed]], a colt owned by Sir Charles Bunbury, who collected prize money of \u00a31,065 15s. The first four runnings were contested over 1 mile, but this was amended to the current distance of 1\u00bd miles in 1784. Lord Derby achieved his first success in the event in 1787, with a horse called [[Sir Peter Teazle]].\n\nThe starting point of the race was moved twice during the 19th century. The first move, suggested by [[Lord George Bentinck]], was in 1848, and the second was in 1872. It was discovered in 1991 that the exact length of the race was one mile, four furlongs and 10 yards.<ref name=\"century\"/>\n\nInitially, the Derby was run on a Thursday in late May or early June, depending on when Easter occurred. In 1838 the race was moved to a Wednesday to fit in with the railways' [[timetables]], but still followed the moveable feast of Easter. In the 20th century, the race was run on the first Wednesday in June from 1900 until 1995, not including 1915 to 1918 (during the [[First World War]]), when it was on a Tuesday. During the [[Second World War]], from 1942 until 1945 the race was run on a Saturday, as it was in the post-war years of 1947 to 1950 and again in 1953.<ref name=\"century\"/> In 1995 the day was changed from the first Wednesday in June to the first Saturday,<ref name=SpiritsUp>{{cite news|author=Telegraph View |date=3 June 2011|title=Epsom Derby: Spirits up on the Downs |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/8555678/Epsom-Derby-Spirits-up-on-the-Downs.html|accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref> and since then all the races have taken place on that day.\n\nThe Derby has been run at Epsom in all years except during the [[world war]]s. From 1915 to 1918 and from 1940 to 1945, the Derby was run at [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket]]. These races are known as the 'New Derby'.\n\nThe Derby has inspired many similar events around the world. European variations include the [[Derby Italiano]], the [[Deutsches Derby]], the [[Irish Derby]] and the [[Prix du Jockey Club]] (popularly known in the British Isles as the \"French Derby\"). Several races in the United States include the \"Derby\" name, including the oldest, the [[Kentucky Derby]].

The new legislation also removes the right of mining companies to resort to international arbitration. The tax dispute with [[Acacia Mining]], accused of having significantly undervalued its gold production for years, finally resulted in an agreement: Tanzania obtains 16% of the shares in the mines held by the multinational. However, this anti-corruption policy has also \"frightened investors, who now fear they will have to deal with Tanzanian justice, and weakened growth,\" according to [[Zitto Kabwe]], one of the leaders of the opposition [[Alliance for Change and Transparency|ACT]] party. With one of the highest economic growth rates on the African continent (5.8% in 2018 and an estimated 6% for 2019 according to the IMF), the Tanzanian government is embarking on a vast program of infrastructure development, particularly rail infrastructure.

He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th century]]. As a [[stallion|sire]] of sires, his impact on the breed is still felt worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer won the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and the [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada and the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York, and was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]].\n\nAt three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer then became the first Canadian-bred to ever win the [[Kentucky Derby]], following up with a win in the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a bay [[stallion]] with a crooked white blaze and three white socks.<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian [[business magnate]] [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of [[Windfields Farm]]. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]]<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/> and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> Northern Dancer's paternal grandsire was the Italian-bred horse [[Nearco]], two-time [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=\"Nearco\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Nearco (horse)|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/nearco-ity.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good conformation, Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his $25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters, plus excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen who had met him estimated his height as between {{hands|15}} and {{hands|15.1}}.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he was weighed at {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlong]] [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled horses. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven 2-year-olds for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight lengths.

Anything.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=Joe|title=Canada's greatest racing horse still an influence in the sport of kings|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadas-greatest-racing-horse-still-an-influence-in-the-sport-of-kings|website=nationalpost.com|accessdate=5 July 2016|date=2011-05-28}}</ref>\n\nWearing blinkers for the first time, Northern Dancer made his next start was on August 17 in the [[Vandal Stakes]]. Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> He next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and the horse is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, Northern Dancer led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''Daily Racing Form'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion. His time of 1:35{{frac|3|5}} for one mile was a new stakes record.<ref name=Remsen>{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=Joe |title=MARGIN IN REMSEN IS TWO LENGTHS; Northern Dancer, Despite a Hoof Injury, Sets Stake Record at Aqueduct A Hoof Ailment Six in Race |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/11/28/archives/margin-in-remsen-is-two-lengths-northern-dancer-despite-a-hoof.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=7 December 2019 |date=28 November 1963}}</ref> Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.\"<ref>Hunter, pg.92</ref>\n\nHis record of seven victories in nine starts earned Northern Dancer the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt|Canadian Juvenile Championship]]. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American [[Experimental Free Handicap]], he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]]. <ref name=\"ACP\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Northern Dancer|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/northern-dancer-can.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1964: Three-year-old season===\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a [[vulcanized rubber]] patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; FLAMINGO CHOICE 7\u2010LENGTH VICTOR; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural. He wasn't quite so seasoned as some of the other horses.\"<ref name=\"Flamingo\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Takes $138,200 Flamingo by 2 Lengths; SHOEMAKER RIDES EVEN-MONEY COLT |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/04/archives/northern-dancer-takes-138200-flamingo-by-2-lengths-shoemaker-rides.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=4 March 1964}}</ref>\n\nHe then entered a seven-furlong allowance race at [[Gulfstream Park]] on March 28 as a prep for the [[Florida Derby]]. Shoemaker was unable to ride due to a previous commitment, so Ycaza got the ride. Northern Dancer won easily by four lengths, equaling the track record of 1:22{{frac|2|5}}.<ref name=Allowance>{{cite news |title=Cedar Key Takes Gulfstream Race |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/29/cedar-key-takes-gulfstream-race.html |work=The New York Times |agency=The Associated Press |date=29 March 1964}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Florida Derby]] on April 4, Northern Dancer was the 3-10 favourite in a field of eight. With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length. Shoemaker said later that the colt was improving.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer, The Scoundrel \u2013 and Mr. Moon|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/04/13/614442/the-dancer-the-scoundreland-mr-moon|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref> However, his time was a disappointing 1:50{{frac|4|5}}, the slowest Florida Derby since 1955. Joe Hirsch of the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race\u2014Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker chose a colt he had never ridden named [[Hill Rise]] as his Derby mount. The unbeaten Hill Rise had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker campaigned hard to get Hill Rise as his mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101-103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby; HARTACK TO RIDE BIG STAKES VICTOR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland Race Course]] on April 23, Northern Dancer with his new jockey was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"<ref name=\"BlueGrass\">{{cite web |title=Favored Northern Dancer Takes Blue Grass by Half a Length Under Hartack; VICTOR GAINS LEAD AT STRETCH TURN |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/24/archives/favored-northern-dancer-takes-blue-grass-by-half-a-length-under.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=24 April 1964}}</ref><ref>Hunter, pg. 104</ref>\n\n====Bidding for the Triple Crown====\nFor the [[1964 Kentucky Derby]], run at a distance of {{frac|1|1|4}} miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7-2 behind Hill Rise at 7-5.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00{{frac|2|5}} on April 20.<ref >Hunter, pp. 105-107</ref>\n\nOn the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108-109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground.<ref name=SIKentucky>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=The Dancer Dazzles Old Kentucky|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/11/607195/the-dancer-dazzles-old-kentucky|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Author [[Kevin Chong]] later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Izenberg|first1=Dafna|title=Northern Dancer: a legendary Canadian horse|url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/books/living-on-the-coast-waiting-for-the-big-one/|website=macleans.ca|accessdate=3 July 2016|date=17 April 2014}}</ref> as he ran down the stretch.

He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\"<ref name=\"NYT-KDerby\">{{cite web |title=NORTHERN DANCER WINS KENTUCKY DERBY BY A NECK |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/05/03/archives/northern-dancer-wins-kentucky-derby-by-a-neck-yanks-lose-to.html |website=The New York Times |first=Joe|last=Nichols|accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=3 May 1964}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Preakness Stakes]] being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at [[Pimlico Race Course|Pimlico]] was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2-1 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2-1 and Quadrangle at 13-2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28{{frac|2|5}} was just two-fifths of a second off the track record.<ref name=NYT-Belmont /><ref name=\"SIBelmont\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=SI Vault \u2013 Taken for a Virginia Reel|url=https://www.si.com/vault/issue/42846/44/2|website=www.si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nHartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"<ref name=NYT-Belmont />\n\n====Return to Canada====\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of [[Toronto]] declared June 8, 1964 to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down [[Bay Street]] was nixed due to the colt's high strung temperament.)<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\" /><ref>Lennox, p. 104</ref> E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot.

He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer \"zoomed\" past the early leaders, then drew off to win by {{frac|7|1|2}} lengths.

Nine others also became stakes winners, an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127-129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''[[The Blood-Horse]]''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second-crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland.

He is considered a Canadian icon, and was inducted into the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, ''[[The Blood-Horse]]'' ranked him as one of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century|top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th century]]. As a [[stallion|sire]] of sires, he has been called the leading male-line progenitor of modern Thoroughbreds worldwide.\n\nAt age two, Northern Dancer won the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] and the [[Coronation Futurity]] in Canada and the [[Remsen Stakes]] in New York, and was named the [[Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt]].\n\nAt three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the [[Flamingo Stakes]], [[Florida Derby]], and [[Blue Grass Stakes]]. Northern Dancer then became the first Canadian-bred to ever win the [[Kentucky Derby]], following up with a win in the [[Preakness Stakes]]. With a chance at the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|American Triple Crown]], he finished third in the [[Belmont Stakes]]. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he then won the [[Queen's Plate]] in what proved to be his last race.\n\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at [[Windfields Farm]] in Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968, and the success of his second crop, led by [[English Triple Crown]] winner [[Nijinsky (horse)|Nijinsky]], brought his name to the international stage. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\n\n==Background==\nNorthern Dancer was a bay [[stallion]] with a crooked white blaze and three white socks.<ref name=\"KingOfCanada\">{{cite web |title=The King of Canada: Northern Dancer |url=https://horsenetwork.com/2017/06/king-canada-northern-dancer/ |website=Horse Network |accessdate=13 January 2020 |date=28 June 2017}}</ref> He was bred in [[Ontario]] by Canadian [[business magnate]] [[E. P. Taylor|Edward P. Taylor]], owner of [[Windfields Farm]]. He was from the first crop of [[Nearctic (horse)|Nearctic]]<ref name=\"Nearctic\"/> and was the first foal out of the mare [[Natalma]], whose sire was [[Native Dancer]].<ref name=\"Almahmoud\" /> Northern Dancer's paternal grandsire was the Italian-bred horse [[Nearco]], two-time [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=\"Nearco\">{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Avalyn|title=Nearco (horse)|url=http://www.americanclassicpedigrees.com/nearco-ity.html|website=American Classic Pedigrees|accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season on May 27, 1961. He was only {{hands|14}} high when Windfields Farm offered all of its [[Yearling (horse)|yearlings]] for sale at its annual auction. Despite a strong pedigree and good conformation, Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his $25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.<ref name=KingOfCanada /><ref name=\"CHoF\" />\n\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful quarters, plus excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as {{hands|15.2}}, but most horsemen personally familiar with Northern Dancer estimated his height as between {{hands|15}} and {{hands|15.1}}.<ref name=ACP /> Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he was weighed at {{convert|940|lb|kg}}.<ref name=NYT-KDerby /> Like Nearctic and Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks,\" said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer [[Horatio Luro]] originally wanted to [[gelding|geld]] the colt, but Taylor refused.<ref name=\"Kocher\" />\n\nSportswriter Jim Murray of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"<ref name=Kocher />\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1963: Two-year-old season===\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at [[Fort Erie Race Track]] in a {{frac|5|1|2}} [[furlong]] [[maiden race]] for Canadian foaled horses. He was ridden by apprentice jockey [[Ron Turcotte]], who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\".<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web|title=Northern Dancer a Very Unlikely Hero {{!}} Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame (archived version)|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119152234/http://www.canadianhorseracinghalloffame.com:80/northern-dancer-timeline/|website=horseracinghalloffame.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hunter86 /> He beat seven 2-year-olds for a purse of $2,100.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Erie Race Track \u2013 Our History|url=http://www.forterieracing.com/about-us1/our-history/|website=www.forterieracing.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight lengths.

Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to win.<ref name=Hunter86 /> After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\"<ref name=Timeline /> He next entered the [[Summer Stakes (Canada)|Summer Stakes]] on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at [[Fort Erie]]. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and the horse is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, Northern Dancer led from the start and hung on for the win.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the {{frac|1|1|16}} mile [[Cup and Saucer Stakes]] on September 28 over the [[Woodbine Racetrack|Woodbine]] turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length.<ref name=Timeline /> Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left fore. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"<ref name=\"Hunter, pg. 90\">Hunter, pg. 90</ref>\n\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by {{frac|1|1|2}} lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn October 12, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the [[Coronation Futurity]], the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by {{frac|6|1|4}} lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"<ref>Lennox, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven furlong Carleton Stakes at [[Greenwood Raceway|Greenwood]] on a muddy track. He won by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths, but the ''Daily Racing Form'' called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a [[quarter crack]]. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months.<ref name=\"Timeline\" />\n\nNonetheless, the colt was shipped to [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by [[Manuel Ycaza]], and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the [[Belmont Futurity]]. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a [[bar shoe]] on his left front [[horse hoof|hoof]] to stabilize the foot.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the [[Remsen Stakes]], despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in [[Glossary of North American horse racing#W|wire-to-wire]] fashion.

He was rated at 123 pounds on the [[Experimental Free Handicap]] for American juveniles of 1963, three pounds below champion [[Raise a Native]].

Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January.<ref name=Timeline />\n\nHis first race at three was on February 10, 1964 in a six-furlong prep at [[Hialeah Park]] under a new jockey, [[Bobby Ussery]], who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider.<ref name=Timeline /> \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"<ref name=\"SILuro\">{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Alfred|title=The Continental Touch of Horation Luro|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606807/the-continental-touch-of-senor-horatio-luro|website=si.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23{{frac|2|5}}. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36{{frac|2|5}} and nine furlongs in 1:50{{frac|4|5}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Beats Chieftain, Trader in Hialeah Test; FLAMINGO CHOICE 7\u2010LENGTH VICTOR; Canadian Colt's Stock Rises After Impressive Triumph in 7\u2010Furlong Workout |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/02/25/archives/northern-dancer-beats-chieftain-trader-in-hialeah-test-flamingo.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=25 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nFor his next start in the [[Flamingo Stakes]] on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey [[Bill Shoemaker]] and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47{{frac|4|5}} was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only [[Bold Ruler]]'s time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural.

With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Norther Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length.

Joe Hirsch of the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\"<ref name=\"Timeline\" /> Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.<ref name=\"FlaDerby\">{{cite web |title=Northern Dancer Wins Big Gulfstream Race\u2014Shoemaker Aboard |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/05/archives/the-scoundrel-2d-northern-dancer-wins-big-gulfstream-raceshoemaker.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=5 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the [[Kentucky Derby]]. But Shoemaker chose a colt he had never ridden named [[Hill Rise]] as his Derby mount. The unbeaten Hill Rise had won the [[San Felipe Stakes]] and the [[Santa Anita Derby]] in California. Shoemaker campaigned hard to get Hill Rise as his mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on [[Bill Hartack]], who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, [[Decidedly]].<ref>Hunter, pp. 101-103</ref> \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Derby Jockeys in a Shift; Shoemaker Switches From Northern Dancer to Hill Rise for Kentucky Derby; HARTACK TO RIDE BIG STAKES VICTOR |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/07/archives/kentucky-derby-jockeys-in-a-shift-shoemaker-switches-from-northern.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=8 December 2019 |date=7 April 1964}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Blue Grass Stakes]] at [[Keeneland Race Course]] on April 23, Northern Dancer with his new jockey was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49{{frac|4|5}} and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03.

As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly.<ref name=Timeline /><ref>Hunter, pp. 108-109</ref> After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds.

Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35{{frac|3|5}} to sharpen his speed.<ref name=\"SIPreakness\">{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=Three for the Triple Crown|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/25/625173/three-for-the-triple-crown|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2-1 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus [[Quadrangle (horse)|Quadrangle]]. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.<ref name=SIPreakness />\n\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tower|first1=Whitney|title=One More to Make It Nine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/06/08/606850/one-more-to-make-it-nine|website=si.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the [[Belmont Stakes]] on June 6, run that year at [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2-1 and Quadrangle at 13-2. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39{{frac|1|5}}, Quadrangle's jockey made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim.

The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including [[Viceregal (horse)|Viceregal]], who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became stakes winners, an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop.<ref>Hunter, pp. 127-129</ref> \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of ''[[The Blood-Horse]]''. \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\" <ref name=Kocher />\n\nAlthough his second-crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer [[Vincent O'Brien]] at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 [[English Triple Crown]], the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, [[Fanfreluche]] was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.<ref>Hunter, pp. 130-134</ref>\n\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farms and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included [[Claiborne Farm]], [[Allaire du Pont]], [[Greentree Stable|Greentree Stud]], [[J. Louis Levesque]], [[Paul Mellon]], [[Spendthrift Farm]], [[Tartan Stable|Tartan Farm]] and [[Alfred G.

As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.
