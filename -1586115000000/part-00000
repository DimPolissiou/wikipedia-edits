Their aim was to produce children's videos which conveyed Christian moral themes and taught Biblical values and lessons. The animated feature involved stories told by a group of recurring fruit and vegetable characters who lived on a kitchen countertop. The program was offered in the direct-to-video market, with the first 30-minute program, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]],'' released in December 1993.<ref name=\"MeMyselfBob\">{{cite book|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Me, Myself, & Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables|date=2008|publisher=T.

His first animation model was an [[anthropomorphic]] candy bar. When his wife suggested that parents might prefer a hero who promoted [[healthy diet|healthier eating habit]]s, he began designing the characters based on fruits and vegetables. The cast of voice actors of the early VeggieTales videos predominantly came from friends of Phil Vischer such as Dan Anderson ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Dad and Mom Asparagus|Dad Asparagus]]) and Jim Poole ([[List of VeggieTales characters#Scooter|Scooter the Carrot]]) who collaborated with Vischer on dramas at their local church.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Episode 200: THE BIG 2-0-0!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzD_J03KcuY|via=YouTube|accessdate=January 22, 2017|date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Softimage 3D was used for further episodes until 1999 when it was replaced with [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Noell Wolfgram|title=VeggieTales: What's the Big Idea?|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Features/bigideap.html|accessdate=January 6, 2018|work=Digital Media FX|year=2003}}</ref>\n\n[[Lyrick Studios]] sued Big Idea in January 2002 claiming Big Idea \"abruptly walked away\" from a 1997 deal to manufacture and distribute VeggieTales merchandise.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2002/01/21/story1.html|title=Lawsuit over verbal pact pits Lyrick Studios, VeggieTales|last=Patrick|first=Stephanie|work=[[Dallas Business Journal]]|date=January 20, 2002|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref> Big Idea, which had no written contract, made a new deal with [[Warner Home Video]].

Bob, [[Larry the Cucumber]], and other Veggie characters then sing the show's theme song as they hop to Bob's front door. The theme song ends with a character making a random comment, such as Pa Grape commenting on Archibald's new sweater. Bob and Larry then wait for the mailman, Jimmy Gourd, to deliver a letter. When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet, Paco the Storytelling Mule, and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and thanking the kids for coming to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple \"Good-bye\".\n\nAccording to the [[Los Angeles Times]], \"Veggietales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks.

The program was offered in the direct-to-video market, with the first 30-minute program, ''[[Where's God When I'm S-Scared?]],'' released in December 1993.<ref name=\"MeMyselfBob\">{{cite book|last1=Vischer|first1=Phil|title=Me, Myself, & Bob: A True Story About God, Dreams, and Talking Vegetables|date=2008|publisher=T.

His first animation model was an [[anthropomorphic]] candy bar.

The ''Silly Songs'' are generally introduced with a [[title card]] and a [[voice-over]] saying, \"And now it's time for Silly Songs with Larry, the part of the show where Larry comes out and sings a silly song.\" Some ''Silly Songs'' have alternate titles, such as \"Love Songs with Mr. Lunt,\" or \"Ukulele Karaoke with Bob,\" where another character sings the song instead.<ref>{{Citation|last=VeggieTales Official|title=VeggieTales {{!}} Monkey Silly Song {{!}} Silly Songs With Larry {{!}} Kids Cartoon {{!}} Kids Videos {{!}} Kids Movies|date=April 30, 2019|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv9YwNGUSSU|access-date=May 1, 2019}}</ref> The ''Silly Song'', if one appears, is usually in the middle of the program, often at a [[cliffhanger]] moment or in between two stories (although the LarryBoy videos, in particular, often lack this segment, with the exception of ''League of Incredible Vegetables'').

Bob, [[Larry the Cucumber]], and other Veggie characters then sing the show's theme song as they hop to Bob's front door. The theme song ends with a character making a random comment, such as Pa Grape commenting on Archibald's new sweater. Bob and Larry then wait for the mailman, Jimmy Gourd, to deliver a letter. When Jimmy comes, he happily sings his Mail Song, which Bob and Larry both find tedious. Similar to the opening counter top sequence of the ''VeggieTales'' videos, Bob and Larry read the letter and the cast tries to decide how to solve the viewer's problem through one of three regular segments: Archibald reads a story from his Big Book of Oddities, Pa Grape shows an old film, or Mr. Lunt appears with his stick puppet, Paco the Storytelling Mule, and tells a story. The result always proves disastrous, as the story or film makes no sense. Bob and Larry then intervene with a story from a VeggieTales video. The show ends with Bob and Larry wrapping things up by reiterating the story's lesson and thanking the kids for coming to his house. NBC episodes end with characters bidding the audience a simple \"Good-bye\".\n\nAccording to the [[Los Angeles Times]], \"Veggietales has been very successful for NBC in a Saturday morning time slot that has traditionally been difficult for the networks.

Volume 30 covers [[Yel\u00fc Dashi]], who fled and founded of the state of [[Qara Khitai]] also known as the Western Liao at the dissolution of the Liao dynasty. Biran describes  volume 30 of the text as the one of the most important sources for the history of the Qara Khitai.{{sfnp|Biran|2005|page=4}}\n\nTreatises are covered in volumes 31-62. The [[Administrative divisions of the Liao dynasty|administrative divisions of the Liao]] are described in volumes 37 through 41 under the title Geography (\u5730\u7406), organized by the five primary level circuits (\u9053). Official posts (\u767e\u5b98) are described in volumes 45-48. Standen gives English translations for some of the official posts in a glossary.{{sfnp|Standen|2007|pages=241-247}}\n\nVolumes 63-70 are tables including the lineage of the ruling [[Yel\u00fc]] clan as well as other clans in volume 63, tribes (\u90e8\u65cf) in volume 69, and vassal states (\u5c6c\u570b) in volume 70.\n\nNotable figures included in the Biographies section include [[Han Yanhui]], Liao chancellor of Han origin in volume 74; [[Zhao Yanshou]] general from the Later Tang who also served the Liao in volume 76; and Wang Jizhong \u738b\u7e7c\u5fe0, who helped broker the [[Chanyuan Treaty]] of 1004-1005 in volume 81.{{sfnp|Standen|2007|pages=158-166}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe debate about the legacy of the Liao as a legitimate dynasty continued after the completion of the text. Around the time of publication [[Yang Weizhen]] stated that only the Song was a legitimate dynasty and the Liao and Jin were usurpers. {{sfnp|Chan|2014|page=89}} He continued to argue this point and composed an essay titled 'On legitimate Succession' \u6b63\u7d71\u8faf. Ming scholar Wang Zhu \u738b\u6d19 wrote an alterative history of the Song titled ''Verified History of the Song'' \u5b8b\u53f2\u8cea in which the Liao and Jin states were relegated to treatises on foreign states. However, Wang Chu's text received criticism itself from Qing scholars who viewed it as an intentional distortion of history. {{sfnp|Chan|2014|pages=98-100}} In addition, the text ''Great Outline of Historical Records'' by Ming scholar Shao Jingbang \u90b5\u7d93\u90a6 (1491-1561) gave the Liao and Jin the status of alien usurpers.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{Wikisourcelang|zh|\u907c\u53f2|''History of Liao'' (in Chinese)}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |first=Michal |last=Biran |title = The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World |location=Cambridge; New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |ref=Biran }}\n* Marsone, Pierre.

Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.\n\n===Front Range===\n\n[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]\n\nRoughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The \"Front Range\" includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in Western Colorado (which is not considered the \"Front Range\") are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].\n\n===Continental Divide===\n\n[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]\n\nThe [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nWithin the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.\n\n===Southern region===\n\n\nIn southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.\n[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]\n\n[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America, at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]]]]\n\n===Peaks===\n\n{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}\n\nTo the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]\n\nThe Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.\n\nMuch of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.\n[[File:BlackCanyon.JPG|thumb|[[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]] near [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]]]]\n[[File:East rim arch.jpg|thumb|left|Rim Arch in the [[Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness]] in western Colorado]]\n[[File:Redcanyon.JPG|thumb|left|Sandstone cliffs along the Colorado River north of [[Wolcott, Colorado|Wolcott]]]]\n[[File:Lake CO.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Lake]] near [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]]]]\n\n===Colorado Western Slope===\n\n[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The city of Grand Junction, in the heart of The Grand Valley]]\n\nThe Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.\n\nFrom west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger|pid=5689|name=Pikes Peak, Colorado|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref> The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which not only is a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado. Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].\n\nThe Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.\n[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.]]\n[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]]. [[Ute Mountain]] is in the distance.]]\n\n[[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.\n\nThe Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].\n\nHigher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.\n\nThe [[Four Corners Monument]] in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]]; the only such place in the United States.\n{{See also|Colorado cities and towns|List of counties in Colorado|Colorado municipalities|Colorado rivers|Four Corners Monument}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\n\n[[File:Colorado K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Colorado]]\n\nThe [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.\n\nAs a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.\n\n===Eastern Plains===\n\nThe climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"usgsFRUC1978\">{{cite report |last=Hansen |first=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) and often 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"Climate of Colorado\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22124 to \u221223&nbsp;\u00b0C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher in the winter.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 48&nbsp;\u00b0F (9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (20&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n===Front range foothills===\n\nJust west of the plains and into the foothills, there are a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090433/http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Extreme weather===\n\n[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains]]\n\nExtreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state.

It is said to have been built by the Ancient Pueblo peoples.]]\n\nThe region that is today the state of Colorado has been inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for more than 13,000 years. The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the valleys and mesas of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>\"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]\", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].\n[[File:La conquista del Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] discovering Colorado in 1540, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]. [[Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas]] can be seen overlooking the [[Grand Canyon]].]]\n\nThe Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to U.S. involvement in the region. The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.\n\nThe U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835\u201336 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.\n[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Mexican Cession]], with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [[Republic of Texas]]) after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]\n\nMost American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].\n[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.\n\nThe gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.\n\n===Territory act===\n\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Colorado Territory}}\n[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]\n\nThirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments. The name Colorado was chosen because it was commonly believed that the [[Colorado River]] originated in the territory.<ref name=Colorado_River>Early explorers identified the [[Gunnison River]] in Colorado as the [[headwaters]] of the Colorado River. The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> In 1859, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa F\u00e9, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.\n\nIn 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Blood & treasure : Confederate Empire in the Southwest|last=Frazier |first=Donald Shaw |date=1995|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|isbn=0585303304|edition=1st|location=College Station|oclc=45732362}}</ref> The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.\n\nIn 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].\n[[File:Mount of the Holy Cross.jpeg|thumb|[[Mount of the Holy Cross]], photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1874]]\n\nIn the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent.

From [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] came [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]] beer in 1873, [[CoorsTek]] industrial ceramics in 1920, and [[Jolly Rancher]] candy in 1949. [[Colorado Fuel and Iron|CF&I]] railroad rails, wire, nails, and pipe debuted in [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]] in 1892. [[Imperial Sugar|Holly Sugar]] was first milled from beets in [[Holly, Colorado|Holly]] in 1905, and later moved its headquarters to Colorado Springs. The present-day [[Swift & Company|Swift]] packed meat of [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]] evolved from Monfort of Colorado, Inc., established in 1930. [[Estes Industries|Estes]] model rockets were launched in [[Penrose, Colorado|Penrose]] in 1958. [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] has been the home of [[Woodward Governor Company]]'s motor controllers (governors) since 1870, and [[Oral irrigator|Waterpik]] dental water jets and showerheads since 1962.

The Colorado uranium industry has seen booms and busts, but continues to this day. Not counting byproduct uranium from phosphate, Colorado is considered to have the third-largest uranium reserves of any U.S. state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico.\n\nUranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted a number of companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. Price drops and financing problems in late 2008 forced these companies to cancel or scale back uranium-mining project. Currently, there are no uranium producing mines in Colorado.\n\nColorado's high Rocky Mountain ridges and eastern plains offer [[wind power]] potential, and geologic activity in the mountain areas provides potential for [[geothermal electricity|geothermal power]] development. Much of the state is sunny, and could produce [[solar power in Colorado|solar power]]. Major rivers flowing from the Rocky Mountains offer [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] resources.

Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the \"Rio Grande\" acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.\n\nColorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage.

There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.\n\nSome of the more notable Colorado districts are:\n* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties\n* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties\n** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).\n** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.\n** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three \"tiers\" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.\n*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.\n*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.\n*** Tier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.\n** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.\n* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]\n* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of southeast Jefferson and Boulder counties\n* The Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District, approved by voters to pay for and help build the [[Colorado Rockies]]' stadium [[Coors Field]]\n* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, Gunnison County\n\n==Politics==\n\n{{Main|Politics of Colorado}}\n{{See also|Political party strength in Colorado|United States presidential elections in Colorado}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | Colorado registered voters {{as of|2016|April|1|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/VoterRegNumbers/2016/March/VotersByPartyStatus.pdf|title=Total Registered Voters By Party Affiliation and Status As of Fri Apr 01 2016 03:07:45 GMT-0600 (MDT)|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nColorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties.

Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.\n\n===Front Range===\n\n[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]\n\nRoughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The \"Front Range\" includes Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, Loveland, Castle Rock, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in Western Colorado (which is not considered the \"Front Range\") are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].\n\n===Continental Divide===\n\n[[File:Continental-Divide Monarch-Pass 2012-10-28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at [[Monarch Pass]]]]\n\nThe [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] into the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nWithin the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.\n\n===Southern region===\n\n\nIn southmost Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]], and consists of large desert lands that eventually run into the mountains. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.\n[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|right|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]\n\n[[File:Mt Herard sand.JPG|thumb|left|The tallest dunes in North America, at [[Great Sand Dunes National Park]]]]\n\n===Peaks===\n\n{{main|Mountain peaks of Colorado}}\n\nTo the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Evans]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n[[File:SANJUANMTNS.JPG|thumb|Peaks of the [[San Juan Mountains]]]]\n\nThe Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 peaks that are {{convert|14000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} or higher in elevation above sea level, known as [[Colorado fourteeners|fourteeners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=U.S. Forest Service|title=Rocky Mountain Region 14ers |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/recreation/14ers/ |accessdate=November 6, 2009}}</ref> These mountains are largely covered with trees such as [[conifer]]s and [[aspen]]s up to the [[tree line]], at an elevation of about {{convert|12000|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in southern Colorado to about {{convert|10500|ft|m|0|sp=us}} in northern Colorado. Above this tree line only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.\n\nMuch of the alpine snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America all lie within the state.\n[[File:BlackCanyon.JPG|thumb|[[Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park]] near [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]]]]\n[[File:East rim arch.jpg|thumb|left|Rim Arch in the [[Black Ridge Canyons Wilderness]] in western Colorado]]\n[[File:Redcanyon.JPG|thumb|left|Sandstone cliffs along the Colorado River north of [[Wolcott, Colorado|Wolcott]]]]\n[[File:Lake CO.JPG|thumb|[[Hanging Lake]] near [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]]]]\n\n===Colorado Western Slope===\n\n[[File:Grand Valley, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The city of Grand Junction, in the heart of The Grand Valley]]\n\nThe Western Slope area of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the state to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west of the mountains. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.\n\nFrom west to east, the land of Colorado consists of desert lands, desert plateaus, alpine mountains, National Forests, relatively flat grasslands, scattered forests, buttes, and canyons in the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. The famous [[Pikes Peak]] is located just west of [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Its isolated peak is visible from nearly the Kansas border on clear days, and also far to the north and the south.<ref>{{cite peakbagger|pid=5689|name=Pikes Peak, Colorado|accessdate=October 10, 2009}}</ref> The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which not only is a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado. Desert lands in Colorado are located in and around areas such as the [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[Canon City, Colorado|Canon City]], [[Florence, Colorado|Florence]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Canyon of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Hovenweep National Monument]], [[Ute Mountain]], [[Delta, Colorado|Delta]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Colorado National Monument]], and other areas surrounding the [[Uncompahgre Plateau]] and [[Uncompahgre National Forest]].\n\nThe Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]), or by evaporation in its arid areas. The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located. Also prominent in or near the southern portion of the Western Slope are the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]], a high arid region that borders Southern Utah.\n[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|right|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.]]\n[[File:Four Corners Monument (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Four Corners Monument]]. [[Ute Mountain]] is in the distance.]]\n\n[[Grand Junction, Colorado]] is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located along [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]], the only major highway in Western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s [[California Zephyr]] passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction via a route on which there are no continuous highways.\n\nThe Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].\n\nHigher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.\n\nThe [[Four Corners Monument]] in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]]; the only such place in the United States.\n{{See also|Colorado cities and towns|List of counties in Colorado|Colorado municipalities|Colorado rivers|Four Corners Monument}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Climate==\n\n[[File:Colorado K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Colorado]]\n\nThe [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect local climate.\n\nAs a general rule, with an increase in elevation comes a decrease in temperature and an increase in precipitation. Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.\n\n===Eastern Plains===\n\nThe climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semiarid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"usgsFRUC1978\">{{cite report |last=Hansen |first=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |accessdate=March 21, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) and often 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"Climate of Colorado\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=April 1, 2016}}</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22124 to \u221223&nbsp;\u00b0C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |accessdate=July 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warm the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (21&nbsp;\u00b0C) or higher in the winter.<ref name=\"Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America\" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the afternoon.

Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090433/http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Extreme weather===\n\n[[File:October Snow in Colorado.jpg|thumb|Snow highlights the rugged mountains, as well as the urban and agricultural landscapes of the Colorado plains]]\n\nExtreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state.

The [[Lindenmeier Site]] in [[Larimer County, Colorado|Larimer County]] contains [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] dating from approximately 11200 BC to 3000 BC. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a [[Human migration|major migration route]] that was important to the spread of early peoples throughout the Americas. The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] lived in the valleys and mesas of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref>\"[http://news.discovery.com/archaeology/genocide-native-americans-ethnic-cleansing.html Genocide Wiped Out Native American Population ]\", Discovery News, September 20, 2010.</ref> The [[Ute Nation]] inhabited the mountain valleys of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Western Rocky Mountains]], even as far east as the Front Range of present day. The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. At times, the [[Arapaho Nation]] and the [[Cheyenne Nation]] moved west to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]].\n[[File:La conquista del Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] discovering Colorado in 1540, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]. [[Garc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de C\u00e1rdenas]] can be seen overlooking the [[Grand Canyon]].]]\n\nThe Spanish Empire claimed Colorado as part of its New Mexico province prior to U.S. involvement in the region. The U.S. acquired a territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]] as the exclusive trading zone of its colony of [[Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his men were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.\n\nThe U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the [[United States|Union]] as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became unorganized territory, and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams-On\u00eds Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835\u201336 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the war in 1848.\n[[File:Mexican Cession in Mexican View.PNG|thumb|Map of the [[Mexican Cession]], with the white representing the territory the United States received from Mexico (plus land ceded to the [[Republic of Texas]]) after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Well over half of Colorado was received during this treaty.]]\n\nMost American [[settler]]s traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new goldfields of California, or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government, because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and sanctioned [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Mexican American]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], later to become Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]].\n[[File:Anasazi Heritage Center.jpg|thumb|The Anasazi Heritage Center in [[Dolores, Colorado|Dolores]]]]\n\nIn 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.\n\nThe gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.\n\n===Territory act===\n\n{{Main|Organic act#List of organic acts|Colorado Territory}}\n[[File:1860 colorado territory map.png|thumb|left|The territories of [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]], [[Utah Territory|Utah]], [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and [[Nebraska Territory|Nebraska]] before the creation of the [[Territory of Colorado]]]]\n\nThirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments.

The [[Colorado River|Grand River]] in Colorado was later tentatively identified as the primary headwaters of the river. Finally in 1916, [[E.C. LaRue]], the Chief Hydrologist of the [[United States Geological Survey]], identified the Green River in southwestern Wyoming as the proper headwaters of the actual, overall Colorado River.</ref> In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante]] recorded that [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref> In 1859, a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa F\u00e9, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.\n\nIn 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt the gold fields of Colorado and California and to seize ports on the Pacific Ocean for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Blood & treasure : Confederate Empire in the Southwest|last=Frazier |first=Donald Shaw |date=1995|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|isbn=0585303304|edition=1st|location=College Station|oclc=45732362}}</ref> The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe.

The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.\n\nIn 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his men to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].\n[[File:Mount of the Holy Cross.jpeg|thumb|[[Mount of the Holy Cross]], photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1874]]\n\nIn the midst and aftermath of Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juans the following year.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Georgetown loop 1899.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgetown Loop]] of the [[Colorado Central Railroad]] as photographed by [[William Henry Jackson]] in 1899]]\n\nThe [[Forty-third United States Congress|United States Congress]] passed an enabling act on March 3, 1875, specifying the requirements for the [[Territory of Colorado]] to become a state.<ref name=ColoradoEnablingAct>{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/PROCEEDINGS%20OF%20THE%20CONSTITUTIONAL%20CONVENTION_0.pdf|title=An Act to Enable the People of Colorado to Form a Constitution and State Government, and for the Admission of the Said State into the Union on an Equal Footing with the Original States |format=PDF |author=Forty-third United States Congress |author-link=Forty-third United States Congress |date=March 3, 1875|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref> On August 1, 1876 (four weeks after the [[Centennial of the United States]]), U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum|popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered.

By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. Census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.\n\nThree warships of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the USS ''[[USS Colorado|Colorado]]''.

In 1988 the \"Rio Grande\" acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.\n\nColorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606044205/https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |archivedate=June 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\nIn August 2014, Colorado began to issue driver licenses to [[Alien (law)|aliens]] [[Illegal immigration to the United States|not lawfully in the United States]] who lived in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nicholson |first=Kieran |date=August 1, 2014 |title=Immigrants here illegally begin receiving Colorado driver licenses |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26257608/immigrants-here-illegally-begin-receiving-colorado-driver-licenses |newspaper=Denver Post |access-date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> In September 2014, [[KCNC]] reported that 524 non-citizens were issued Colorado driver licenses that are normally issued to U.S. citizens living in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line. --> |title=524 Non-Citizens Received Regular Colorado Driver's Licenses, DMV Says |url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/09/12/524-non-citizens-received-regular-colorado-drivers-licenses-dmv-says/ |newspaper=KCNC |location=Denver |date=September 12, 2014 |access-date=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Main|Government of Colorado}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n! colspan = 6 | State Executive Officers\n|-\n!| Office\n!

This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.\n\nSome of the more notable Colorado districts are:\n* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties\n* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties\n** It is a 0.1% retail sales and use tax (one penny on every $10).\n** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history or cultural history.\n** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three \"tiers\" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.\n*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the Denver Art Museum, the Denver Botanic Gardens, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the Denver Zoo, and the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. It receives 65.5%.\n*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.\n*** Tier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, and natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding to the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.\n** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes.

Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years. In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state by the turn of the century, and voted consecutively for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as well as Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nColorado politics has the contrast of conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and a few western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.\n\nColorado is represented by two [[United States Senate|United States Senators]]:\n* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 2]], [[Cory Gardner]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015\u2013\n* [[Classes of United States Senators|United States Senate Class 3]], [[Michael Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2009\u2013\nColorado is represented by seven [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]], [[Diana DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 1997\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district]], [[Joe Neguse]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019-\n* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district]], [[Scott Tipton]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2011\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]], [[Ken Buck]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2015\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district]], [[Doug Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) 2007\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]], [[Jason Crow]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2019\u2013\n* [[Colorado's 7th congressional district]], [[Ed Perlmutter]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]) 2007\u2013\n\n===Significant bills passed in Colorado===\n\nOn the November 8, 1932 ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified.\n\nIn 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting [[Colorado Amendment 64|\"personal use\" of marijuana for adults]], establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in a manner similar to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].

The new settlers initially developed riverfront land along the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] and Black rivers for cotton plantations, primarily worked by enslaved African Americans. The slaves were brought by planters with them from the [[Upper South]] or transported in the domestic [[slave trade]]. In total, more than one million African Americans were transported to the [[Deep South]], breaking up many families. The African-descended slaves soon constituted the majority of the Holmes County population.\n\nOn court days, the town served as a trading center for the county and attracted retail merchants. Lexington was a destination in the 1830s of some German-Jewish immigrants, who often became merchants. They were joined much later in the century by Russian Jewish immigrants. The Jewish community built Temple Beth El in Lexington in 1905; it closed in 2009 because of declining population.<ref name=\"daily\">[http://forward.com/articles/114913/ \"A Final Yom Kippur in the Delta for Mississippi Community Begun in 1830s\"], ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''</ref> During the plantation era, the city was bustling, as planters grew wealthy from the booming demand for [[cotton]] in the North and Europe.\n\nAmong the early settlers in the 1830s was German-Jewish immigrant Jacob Sontheimer, who first worked caring for an elderly planter. After being bequeathed land, Sontheimer later became a merchant in town. His two daughters, Rose and Bettie, also became merchants, managing the Sontheimer business. He was joined by other Jewish immigrants from Germany, totaling about 20 by the late 1870s and 50 by 1900. In the later years Jewish immigrants also came from eastern Europe to Lexington. They developed tailoring and grocery businesses; the Lewis Grocery Store developed into a major wholesaler in the state.<ref name=\"daily\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isjl.org/mississippi-lexington-encyclopedia.html|title=ISJL - Mississippi Lexington Encyclopedia|website=Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, [[freedmen]] in Holmes County, who constituted the majority of the population, joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and elected several county sheriffs and other local officers. They sought education and some became landowners, clearing land in the bottomlands and selling their timber to raise money for purchase. This progress was before 1890, when they were essentially [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|deprived of the vote]] by the state legislature passing a new constitution, which created barriers to voter registration and forced them out of politics for decades into the late 20th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financial recession and lack of political clout meant that many freedmen lost their land; within a generation they had regressed to the status of [[sharecropper]] and [[tenant farmer]].\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[Edmund F. Noel]], an attorney in Lexington, was a son of planters Leland and Margaret Noel, from Virginia and North Carolina, respectively. His father had developed cotton plantations in Holmes County in the antebellum period. The younger Noel became a politician, elected as a state legislator and later as District Attorney. In 1906 he was elected as governor of Mississippi, serving through 1912. His house at North Street is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for its distinctive architecture, and is known as the \"Gov. Edmond F. Noel House\". It was bequeathed to him by his mother.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Mississippi planters recruited Chinese immigrant workers to satisfy the demand for farm labor, and some came to Holmes County. As the area suffered from the [[boll weevil]] infestation, the cotton crops suffered. Agricultural mechanization reduced the need for farm labor, leading to a decline in county and town populations from the 1930s on. Many African Americans left the South for northern and midwestern industrial cities, seeking more opportunities and escape from the violence of [[lynching]]s and oppression of [[Jim Crow]] rules.\n\nIn the 1940s, two lynchings of black men took place in or near Lexington: singer [[B.B. King]] later recounted having seen a youth hanged in the courthouse square during the short time he was living there as a teenager, about 1942\u20131944. The body of 35-year-old Leon McTatie was found on 24 July 1946 in a bayou in nearby Sunflower County. He was beaten to death for allegedly stealing a saddle. Six white men were charged in his lynching but quickly acquitted at trial.<ref name=\"charge\">[http://depts.washington.edu/moves/CRC_genocide.shtml Susan Glenn, \" 'We Charge Genocide': The 1951 Black Lives Matter Campaign\"], ''Mapping American Social Movements through the 20th Century'', University of Washington website; retrieved 9 March 2018</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NoMEb-QV2_8C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=1945+lynching+of+McTatie&source=bl&ots=Rd4c-DXr3O&sig=0PB_1CNMaMWeJZ-hrBwehpwy5Qg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSo9aV7d_ZAhXOtlMKHYQ2DbwQ6AEIZDAF#v=onepage&q=1945%20lynching%20of%20McTatie&f=false Jason Sokol, ''There Goes My Everything: White Southerners in the Age of Civil Rights, 1945-1975''], Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2008, p. 28</ref>\n\nLexington was distinguished by two nationally known women: [[Arenia Mallory]], an African-American music teacher from Illinois, started teaching at the newly established [[Saints Academy (Mississippi)|Saints Academy]] in Lexington in 1926, which was affiliated with the [[Church of God in Christ]]. She led the school for more than 50 years, expanding its programs to grades 1-12, and establishing a junior college. She developed the school from the early 20th century as a model of academic excellence for African-American students. During her long tenure, she also founded an associated junior college. During the 1960s, she was appointed by President John F. Kennedy to national positions and committees in the federal government.\n\n[[Hazel Brannon Smith]], a white woman from an upper-class family, was based in Lexington, where she owned and published several rural newspapers. She promoted integration and change in the region during the civil rights era, winning a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for her editorials in 1964, the year of [[Freedom Summer]] and the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]], organized by African Americans before the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 was passed by Congress.\n\n==Geography==\nLexington is in the center of Holmes County on the north side of the valley of Black Creek, a west-flowing tributary of the [[Yazoo River]].

The new settlers initially developed riverfront land along the [[Yazoo River|Yazoo]] and Black rivers for cotton plantations, primarily worked by enslaved African Americans. The slaves were brought by planters with them from the [[Upper South]] or transported in the domestic [[slave trade]]. In total, more than one million African Americans were transported to the [[Deep South]], breaking up many families. The African-descended slaves soon constituted the majority of the Holmes County population.\n\nOn court days, the town served as a trading center for the county and attracted retail merchants. Lexington was a destination in the 1830s of some German-Jewish immigrants, who often became merchants. They were joined much later in the century by Russian Jewish immigrants. The Jewish community built Temple Beth El in Lexington in 1905; it closed in 2009 because of declining population.<ref name=\"daily\">[http://forward.com/articles/114913/ \"A Final Yom Kippur in the Delta for Mississippi Community Begun in 1830s\"], ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]''</ref> During the plantation era, the city was bustling, as planters grew wealthy from the booming demand for [[cotton]] in the North and Europe.\n\nAmong the early settlers in the 1830s was German-Jewish immigrant Jacob Sontheimer, who first worked caring for an elderly planter. After being bequeathed land, Sontheimer later became a merchant in town. His two daughters, Rose and Bettie, also became merchants, managing the Sontheimer business. He was joined by other Jewish immigrants from Germany, totaling about 20 by the late 1870s and 50 by 1900. In the later years Jewish immigrants also came from eastern Europe to Lexington. They developed tailoring and grocery businesses; the Lewis Grocery Store developed into a major wholesaler in the state.<ref name=\"daily\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isjl.org/mississippi-lexington-encyclopedia.html|title=ISJL - Mississippi Lexington Encyclopedia|website=Goldring/Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, [[freedmen]] in Holmes County, who constituted the majority of the population, joined the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and elected several county sheriffs and other local officers. They sought education and some became landowners, clearing land in the bottomlands and selling their timber to raise money for purchase. This progress was before 1890, when they were essentially [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|deprived of the vote]] by the state legislature passing a new constitution, which created barriers to voter registration and forced them out of politics for decades into the late 20th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financial recession and lack of political clout meant that many freedmen lost their land; within a generation they had regressed to the status of [[sharecropper]] and [[tenant farmer]].\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[Edmund F. Noel]], an attorney in Lexington, was a son of planters Leland and Margaret Noel, from Virginia and North Carolina, respectively. His father had developed cotton plantations in Holmes County in the antebellum period. The younger Noel became a politician, elected as a state legislator and later as District Attorney. In 1906 he was elected as governor of Mississippi, serving through 1912. His house at North Street is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for its distinctive architecture, and is known as the \"Gov. Edmond F. Noel House\". It was bequeathed to him by his mother.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Mississippi planters recruited Chinese immigrant workers to satisfy the demand for farm labor, and some came to Holmes County. As the area suffered from the [[boll weevil]] infestation, the cotton crops suffered. Agricultural mechanization reduced the need for farm labor, leading to a decline in county and town populations from the 1930s on. Many African Americans left the South for northern and midwestern industrial cities, seeking more opportunities and escape from the violence of [[lynching]]s and oppression of [[Jim Crow]] rules.\n\nIn the 1940s, two lynchings of black men took place in or near Lexington: singer [[B.B.

The lead voice, usually one in the upper register, often sang over the driving, wordless chords of the other singers or interacted with them in a [[call-and-response]] exchange.

It was most often performed by a group, frequently a quartet, as in the black gospel tradition; utilizing close harmonies, this style was nearly always performed in a slow to medium tempo. The lead voice, usually one in the upper register, often sang over the driving, wordless chords of the other singers or interacted with them in a [[call-and-response]] exchange.

Soul and funk bands such as [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]] released the single  (\"[[Doo Wa Ditty (Blow That Thing)/A Touch of Jazz (Playin' Kinda Ruff Part II)]]\"). The last doo-wop record to reach the top ten on the U.S. pop charts was \"[[It's All Right|It's Alright]]\" by [[Huey Lewis and the News]], a cover of [[The Impressions]]' 1963 Top 5 smash hit. It reached number 7 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]] chart in June 1993. Much of the album had a doo-wop flavor. Another song from the ''By The Way'' sessions to feature a doo-wop influence was a cover of \"Teenager In Love\", originally recorded by [[Dion and The Belmonts]].\n\nDoo-wop is popular among [[Barbershop quartet|barbershoppers]] and [[collegiate a cappella]] groups due to its easy adaptation to an all-vocal form. Doo-wop experienced a resurgence in popularity at the turn of the 20th century with the airing of PBS's doo-wop concert programs: ''[[Doo Wop 50]]'', ''Doo Wop 51'', and ''Rock, Rhythm, and Doo Wop''. These programs brought back, live on stage, some of the better known doo-wop groups of the past.

The population is 300,911 (2017 est.) in an area of 581&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>[https://archive.is/20150916103418/http://cod.ibge.gov.br/233OQ Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica]</ref> The elevation is 588&nbsp;m. It is 154&nbsp;km from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the state capital, and 1011&nbsp;km from [[Brasilia]], Brazil's capital. The city can be easily reached from S\u00e3o Paulo by two highways: [[Rodovia Anhanguera]] and [[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes]].\n\nOnce an important and strategical pole of the [[coffee culture]], Limeira was also known as the \"Brazilian [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] capital\" due to the great [[citrus]] production that occurred in the past, although now the main crop cultivated in the city is the [[sugar cane]]. Afterwards, it became recognized by its new plated [[jewelry]] and semi-jewelry{{Clarify|date=February 2014|reason=Does this mean 'costume jewelry'?}} industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of \"Brazil's plated jewelry capital\". There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of Brazil's exports in this sector.\n\nThere is a famous farm located in Limeira, [[Fazenda Ibicaba]], that belonged to [[Nicolau de Campos Vergueiro]], who brought the first [[immigrant]]s from [[Europe]], especially from Germany, [[Portugal]], Switzerland and Belgium, to replace the [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[African-Brazilian]] workers, which was basically a government effort to \"bleach\" the race, as it was feared Brazil would become a \"black country\". Limeira is thus said to have accomplished the first positive experience with immigrant workers in Brazil. Probably because Northern Europeans preferred to run their own farms rather than to subject themselves to indentured work and the Portuguese tended to work in commerce, [[Italy|Italian]] immigrants were brought to work the fields. Such immigrant groups were greater in numbers than all the others all over S\u00e3o Paulo state. Northern Europeans and the first Italians to arrive in the country often came with the promise of being granted lands in exchange for their work, but the last ones were treated socially only better than the slaves themselves. The latter, nonetheless, had nowhere to go for jobs as slavery ended and many begged to be rehired for food. The situation of some of them improved when the British installed the railway in the country and gave them prestigious jobs with housing. Today, Limeira is located in a prosperous region in S\u00e3o Paulo State.\n\n[[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica Internacional (Limeira)|A.A. Internacional]] is a traditional football club based in Limeira, along with [[Independente Futebol Clube|Independente F.C.]] The city's biggest stadium is the [[Est\u00e1dio Major Jos\u00e9 Levy Sobrinho|Major Jos\u00e9 Levy Sobrinho stadium]], built in 1977.\n\nThe city's basketball team is [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Limeirense de Basquete]], which plays in the [[Novo Basquete Brasil]] and the [[Liga Sudamericana]]. Its home arena is the ''Gin\u00e1sio \"V\u00f4\" Lucato''.\n\n==History==\n\nThe history of Limeira begins with the economic exploitation in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], more precisely in mid-1826, which marks the founding of the region of Limeira. But also includes a period before this year involving a legend which tries to explain the origin of the current name of the city.\n\n===Legendary origin===\n\nThe origin of the name involves a popular myth enshrined in its population. Tradition says that the pioneers used to rest in a guesthouse-situated 150&nbsp;km from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], around the river Tatuibi, which the name in [[Tupi-Guarani]] means small armadillo. This landing was called Blue Hill Ranch (''Rancho Morro Azul'') since it was near an elevation that in the distance is seen in shades of blue.\n\nIt is said that in 1781 a caravan was headed to the wilds of [[Araraquara]] and while passing through Limeira, camped near the stream of the Bladder \u2013 C\u00f3rrego do Bexiga (where today is the Market Model). In this caravan there was a Franciscan, Fr. Jo\u00e3o das Merc\u00eas, which carried a ''picu\u00e1 de limas'' (a kind of lime orange), which claimed to cure and prevent fevers.\n\nBut at night he began to feel ill, blaming the ''limas'' which he said had been poisoned. Eventually he died during the night and the next day he would have been buried there, along with his Picu\u00e1 de Lima's that no one wanted to eat because could be poisoned, as he said. Then there would have sprung a lime tree, born from the limes of the Fr. Jo\u00e3o das Merc\u00eas. Years later, the Blue Hill Ranch (''Rancho do [[Morro Azul]]'') would be called the Ranch of the Lime Orange Tree (''Rancho de Limeira'').<ref>[http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/secretarias/cultura/limeira.html History of Limeira on Cityhall Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415150821/http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/secretarias/cultura/limeira.html |date=2012-04-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Historical facts===\n\nLimeira came in cleared land near the path known as the Picad\u00e3o de Cuiab\u00e1, road flow of troops who were trading and sourcing supplies to the mines of [[Mato Grosso]].\n\n[[File:Ibicaba 1856.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Ibicaba Farm during 19th century]]\nFrom the observation of standard trees (indicating the fertility of the land) that existed along the road in still virgin lands, planters and noble farmers that were living in \u2018Cidade da Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019 (town of the Constitution, today Piracicaba), Itu, Porto Feliz and Atibaia, know where the best lands were and managed to gain allotments from the provincial government. This occurred from 1799 to 1820 in the region.\n\nThe beginning of the village took place then with the installation of mills, the coming of slaveholders and slaves and also with the expulsion of squatters who had in the area. It is possible to observe that, by the census of 1822, in the Town of New Constitution ([[Piracicaba]]), the region of [[Morro Azul]] and Tatuibi (both Limeira) had a population of 951 free people and 546 slaves.\n\nThe roads that link these properties to the capital were precarious making [[Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro]] to lead a group of farmers like Manuel Bento de Barros, Jos\u00e9 Ferraz de Campos and others to ask the provincial government to construct a road that facilitates the flow of production of the mills in the region of Piracicaba and Limeira.\n\nThis road was opened in 1826, while around it came a housing project, the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora das Dores do Tatuibi (Parish of Our Lady of Sorrows of Tatuibi), formalized by provincial law on December 9, 1930.<ref>[http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/dtbs/saopaulo/limeira.pdf IBGE: Hist\u00f3ria de Limeira]</ref> The traffic of the road facilitated the growth of trade and other activities and marks the founding of the municipality of Limeira. The core was built on land donated by Captain Luis Manuel Bastos da Cunha, he is considered the founder of the city.\n\nIn 1842 the region was elevated to village, but only in 1844 the city council land was installed and Limeira gained its first president, Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho. Limeira was elevated to city on April 18, 1863. On April 20, 1875 it was created the county of Limeira. Officially, the city's anniversary is September 15 and it is considered to be founded in 1826.\n\n===Origin of the private-sponsored European immigration===\n\nLimeira is one of the first cities in Brazil to receive private-sponsored European immigration. Through the pioneering effort undertaken by the then owner of the Mill Ibicaba in 1840, Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro (known as [[Senator Vergueiro]]), eighty Portuguese came to work on its lands. This was the first positive experience in developing the partnership system in Brazil.\n\nThe immigrants would replace the slave labor, still in use at this time, but they would receive benefits, unlike the slaves. In 1846, Germans came to work in Ibicaba and Senator Vergueiro became an important figure in replacement of slave labor with free European labor.\n\nThe farm [[Ibicaba]] was during a period the largest producer of coffee in [[Brazil]]. Today it is an important historical ensemble formed by its headquarters, slave quarters, terraces, dams and other facilities as part of the set of the city's historic farms.\n\n== Climate ==\nLimeira experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Cwa), with distinctive wet and dry seasons lasting from October to March and from April to September, respectively, and warm to hot temperatures year-round. The average temperature is 19.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (67.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) and yearly precipitation stands at 1300.5&nbsp;mm (51.2&nbsp;in).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jornaldotempo.uol.com.br/climatologia.html/Limeira-SP//|title=Jornal do Tempo {{!}} Climatologia para Limeira-SP|website=jornaldotempo.uol.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-04-15}}</ref> In 17 October 2014, temperatures in the city reached a record high of 38.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (101.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) and its coldest day was 9 July 2011, with a low of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C (32.1&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Limeira, Brazil (1961&ndash;1990)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 27.2\n|Feb high C = 27.2\n|Mar high C = 27.2\n|Apr high C = 25.5\n|May high C = 23.5\n|Jun high C = 22.3\n|Jul high C = 22.1\n|Aug high C = 24.0\n|Sep high C = 24.6\n|Oct high C = 24.8\n|Nov high C = 26.0\n|Dec high C = 25.4\n|year high C = 24.9\n|Jan low C = 17.8\n|Feb low C = 17.8\n|Mar low C = 17.2\n|Apr low C = 15.2\n|May low C = 12.9\n|Jun low C = 11.4\n|Jul low C = 10.9\n|Aug low C = 12.0\n|Sep low C = 13.8\n|Oct low C = 14.6\n|Nov low C = 16.0\n|Dec low C = 16.9\n|year low C = 14.7\n|Jan precipitation mm = 235.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 211.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 138.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 53.6\n|May precipitation mm = 41.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 41.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 19.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 24.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 120.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 140.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 210.8\n|year precipitation mm = 1300.5\n|source 1 = Climatologia para Limeira-SP - Jornal do Tempo - UOL\n|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Industry==\n\nBy the year of 1850, agricultural equipment started to be produced in Limeira and during the [[Paraguayan War]] instruments to the soldiers were also produced. Between the years of 1907 and 1922 important industries, such as '[[Chap\u00e9us Prada]]' (1907), '[[Caf\u00e9 K\u00fchl]]' (1920) and 'Ind\u00fastria de Papel Santa Cruz' (1922) started their production in Limeira. However, it was after the 1940s that Limeira became well known for its industry.\n\n[[File:Prada.jpg|left|250px|thumb| The old industry building of [[Chap\u00e9us Prada]], now Limeira's City Hall]]\nBetween the 1940s and 1970s many citrus companies started producing orange and orange juice in Limeira to export to inside and outside of [[Brazil]], including to USA and Europe, this commerce gave to the city the title of 'The City of Orange'. Citrobrasil (1940) and Citrosuco (1966) were the biggest companies in Limeira in orange production, however when the United States started its policy to protect and encourage the nacional industry of orange in California, the production of orange in Limeira collapsed. Also after the Second World War the automotive industries took place in the city with 'Freios Varga' (today TRW) in 1945 and 'Rodas Fumagalli' in 1946.\n\nAfter the 1970s, the industrial section area started to grow faster and some multinational companies came to Limeira, such as: [[Ajinomoto]]; the American company [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] bought [[Fumagalli]] in 1974, and 'Freios Varga' joined the English Group Lucas in 2000. Recently, some Japanese and  Korean automotive companies have settled in Limeira, for example: [[Yacchyio]] do Brasil, Stanley, Mando, DAS and [[Faurecia]], which is a French company that has been building a new plant in the city. Recently, [[Samsung]] invested U$300 million in building an industry in Limeira.<ref>[http://www.valor.com.br/empresas/1011338/samsung-investe-us-300-milhoes Valor Econ\u00f4mico article]</ref>\n\nLimeira is also known for its new plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of \"Brazil's plated jewelry capital.\" There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of Brazil's exportation in this sector.\n\nThe city has been trying to become more attractive to industries related to incentive programs. This policy tries to reduce the unemployment and the informal jobs, which has been growing together with its population. Part of the population works in cities nearby, including [[Piracicaba]] and [[Americana, S\u00e3o Paulo|Americana]]. According to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), Limeira has a GDP of R$5.6 billion (2010), around U$3.6 billion.<ref>[http://www.gazetadelimeira.com.br/Noticia.asp?ID=44584 Gazeta de Limeira article based on IBGE database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330113406/http://www.gazetadelimeira.com.br/Noticia.asp?ID=44584 |date=2012-03-30 }}</ref> The industrial sector accounts for approximately 50% of registered jobs in the city. Thus, Limeira took its industrial vocation with its incentive program, which guided the development and implementation of its current industrial park.\n\nThe city has a number of favorable conditions for their development, such as the extension of Highway Bandeirantes ([[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes]]), the implementation of the Tiet\u00ea-Paran\u00e1 waterway, and the installation of the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline.<ref>[http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm Cityhall official website: Information about Limeira's Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415151542/http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm |date=2012-04-15 }}</ref>\n\nAll these factors, combined with their potential and possibilities, specified multiple paths for the development of the industrial sector of the city: \n* Limeira is inserted in the [[Campinas]] region, an area marked by a strong industrial concentration and has a GDP that is larger than many states in the country, such as [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], for example.\n* In the formal economy has approximately 1,000 industries, employing more than 22,000 registered employees, with a significant share of skilled labor.\n\nThe size of the business is diversified, with a production quite varied, including brake systems, automotive wheels, exhausts, metal products, machinery for processing of agricultural products, paper and cardboard packaging, hats, and more. Limeira also has the largest concentration of production of machine tools in [[Latin America]] and the largest sugar refining industry in [[South America]]. However, the main segment that has been standing out in the city after the 1990s is to jewelry and lapidary stones, consisting mainly of micro and small businesses with family investment.\n\nCurrently, the largest industries in operation are:\n\n* [[Ajinomoto]] Interamericana Ind.

The implementation of the Shopping Center, in the 1980s, along the [[Rodovia Anhanguera]] (Anhanguera Road), came to further boost the development of the tertiary sector in the city. Allied to this and following the world trend of globalization and outsourcing observed the emergence of many companies included in the modernization process, which now act as support for the industries of the city. After the 1990s, the mall closed, but there is still a shopping mall located in downtown (Shopping Patio Limeira). By the end of 2012 Another two malls will probably be operating, one on Piracicaba road and other on Anhanguera Road.\n\nIn the area of public services, Limeira presents itself as home to several organizations and government agencies in regional performance as the [[Caixa Economica Federal]], Delegacia da Receita Federal, [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], [[CETESB]], Delegacia de Ensino do Estado, Inspetoria Fiscal da Secretaria da Fazenda do Estado, Comando da Pol\u00edcia Militar and Secretary of Agriculture of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo; there is also private institutions, such as [[CIESP]], [[SENAI]], [[SESI]], [[SENAC]] e JUCESP.\n\nThe main concern is the competition around the city. There is a big competition from neighbor cities because of diversity, variety and comfort. Sometimes, people prefer to travel to [[Campinas]] or [[Piracicaba]] for consumption.\n\nNumber of companies in Limeira by sector ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] 2001):<ref>[http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm Information of the City about number of Companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415151542/http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm |date=2012-04-15 }}</ref>\n* Agriculture and forestry - 37 companies\n* Fishery - 1 company\n* Extractive Industries - 10 companies\n* Manufacturing Industry - 1266 companies\n* Production and Distribution of electricity, Gas and Water - 3 companies\n* Construction - 170 companies\n* Trade, repair of motor vehicles, personal effects and household - 4,088 companies\n* Accommodation and Food - 605 companies\n* Transport, Storage and Communications - 238 companies\n* Financial Intermediation - 73 companies\n* Real Estate activities, Rentals and Business Services - 779 companies\n* Public Administration, Defense and Social Security - 6 companies\n* Education - 106 companies\n* Health and Social Services - 114 companies\n* Other Collective, Social and Personal - 405 companies\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nCurrently, Limeira has more than 2,000 farms. Rural production remains strongly marked by the [[sugar cane]] ([[Ethanol]] production) and orange/citrus, which has remained virtually unchanged over the past two decades, with a slight decline. The sugar cane production reaches more than 1 million tons per year and [[citrus]] (orange, lemon and tangerine), more than 1.4 billion units. On a smaller scale for production there are avocados, corn, rice and beans. The city is considered the first producer of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] citrus industry, and it is recognized by its production of seedlings, especially citrus.\n\nDuring the last three decades Limeira gained a large center of commerce of plants and seedlings on Geada, located on [[Limeira-Piracicaba Road]], approximately km 120. The biggest companies are F\u00e9lix Plantas,<ref>[http://felixplantas.com.br/ F\u00e9lix Plantas]</ref> Bonin Plantas,<ref>[http://www.boninplantas.com.br/ Bonin Plantas]</ref> Dierberger <ref>[http://www.fazendacitra.com.br/ Dierberger]</ref> and Ch\u00e1cara Roseira,<ref>[http://www.chacararoseira.com.br/ Ch\u00e1cara Roseira]</ref>\n\n==Local media==\n\nThere are two daily newspapers in the city: \"[[A Gazeta de Limeira]]\",<ref>[http://www.gazetainfo.com.br/ \"Gazeta de Limeira\" official website]</ref> created in 1831, and \"O Jornal de Limeira\",<ref>[http://jlmais.com/ \"Jornal de Limeira\" official website]</ref> created in 1982.

The population is 300,911 (2017 est.) in an area of 581&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>[https://archive.is/20150916103418/http://cod.ibge.gov.br/233OQ Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica]</ref> The elevation is 588&nbsp;m. It is 154&nbsp;km from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], the state capital, and 1011&nbsp;km from [[Brasilia]], Brazil's capital. The city can be easily reached from S\u00e3o Paulo by two highways: [[Rodovia Anhanguera]] and [[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes]].\n\nOnce an important and strategical pole of the [[coffee culture]], Limeira was also known as the \"Brazilian [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] capital\" due to the great [[citrus]] production that occurred in the past, although now the main crop cultivated in the city is the [[sugar cane]]. Afterwards, it became recognized by its new plated [[jewelry]] and semi-jewelry{{Clarify|date=February 2014|reason=Does this mean 'costume jewelry'?}} industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of \"Brazil's plated jewelry capital\". There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of Brazil's exports in this sector.\n\nThere is a famous farm located in Limeira, [[Fazenda Ibicaba]], that belonged to [[Nicolau de Campos Vergueiro]], who brought the first [[immigrant]]s from [[Europe]], especially from Germany, [[Portugal]], Switzerland and Belgium, to replace the [[Slavery|enslaved]] [[African-Brazilian]] workers, which was basically a government effort to \"bleach\" the race, as it was feared Brazil would become a \"black country\". Limeira is thus said to have accomplished the first positive experience with immigrant workers in Brazil. Probably because Northern Europeans preferred to run their own farms rather than to subject themselves to indentured work and the Portuguese tended to work in commerce, [[Italy|Italian]] immigrants were brought to work the fields. Such immigrant groups were greater in numbers than all the others all over S\u00e3o Paulo state. Northern Europeans and the first Italians to arrive in the country often came with the promise of being granted lands in exchange for their work, but the last ones were treated socially only better than the slaves themselves. The latter, nonetheless, had nowhere to go for jobs as slavery ended and many begged to be rehired for food. The situation of some of them improved when the British installed the railway in the country and gave them prestigious jobs with housing. Today, Limeira is located in a prosperous region in S\u00e3o Paulo State.\n\n[[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica Internacional (Limeira)|A.A. Internacional]] is a traditional football club based in Limeira, along with [[Independente Futebol Clube|Independente F.C.]] The city's biggest stadium is the [[Est\u00e1dio Major Jos\u00e9 Levy Sobrinho|Major Jos\u00e9 Levy Sobrinho stadium]], built in 1977.\n\nThe city's basketball team is [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Limeirense de Basquete]], which plays in the [[Novo Basquete Brasil]] and the [[Liga Sudamericana]]. Its home arena is the ''Gin\u00e1sio \"V\u00f4\" Lucato''.\n\n==History==\n\nThe history of Limeira begins with the economic exploitation in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], more precisely in mid-1826, which marks the founding of the region of Limeira. But also includes a period before this year involving a legend which tries to explain the origin of the current name of the city.\n\n===Legendary origin===\n\nThe origin of the name involves a popular myth enshrined in its population. Tradition says that the pioneers used to rest in a guesthouse-situated 150&nbsp;km from [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], around the river Tatuibi, which the name in [[Tupi-Guarani]] means small armadillo. This landing was called Blue Hill Ranch (''Rancho Morro Azul'') since it was near an elevation that in the distance is seen in shades of blue.\n\nIt is said that in 1781 a caravan was headed to the wilds of [[Araraquara]] and while passing through Limeira, camped near the stream of the Bladder \u2013 C\u00f3rrego do Bexiga (where today is the Market Model). In this caravan there was a Franciscan, Fr. Jo\u00e3o das Merc\u00eas, which carried a ''picu\u00e1 de limas'' (a kind of lime orange), which claimed to cure and prevent fevers.\n\nBut at night he began to feel ill, blaming the ''limas'' which he said had been poisoned. Eventually he died during the night and the next day he would have been buried there, along with his Picu\u00e1 de Lima\u2019s that no one wanted to eat because could be poisoned, as he said. Then there would have sprung a lime tree, born from the limes of the Fr. Jo\u00e3o das Merc\u00eas. Years later, the Blue Hill Ranch (''Rancho do [[Morro Azul]]'') would be called the Ranch of the Lime Orange Tree (''Rancho de Limeira'').<ref>[http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/secretarias/cultura/limeira.html History of Limeira on Cityhall Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415150821/http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/secretarias/cultura/limeira.html |date=2012-04-15 }}</ref>\n\n===Historical facts===\n\nLimeira came in cleared land near the path known as the Picad\u00e3o de Cuiab\u00e1, road flow of troops who were trading and sourcing supplies to the mines of [[Mato Grosso]].\n\n[[File:Ibicaba 1856.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Ibicaba Farm during 19th century]]\nFrom the observation of standard trees (indicating the fertility of the land) that existed along the road in still virgin lands, planters and noble farmers that were living in \u2018Cidade da Constitui\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019 (town of the Constitution, today Piracicaba), Itu, Porto Feliz and Atibaia, know where the best lands were and managed to gain allotments from the provincial government. This occurred from 1799 to 1820 in the region.\n\nThe beginning of the village took place then with the installation of mills, the coming of slaveholders and slaves and also with the expulsion of squatters who had in the area. It is possible to observe that, by the census of 1822, in the Town of New Constitution ([[Piracicaba]]), the region of [[Morro Azul]] and Tatuibi (both Limeira) had a population of 951 free people and 546 slaves.\n\nThe roads that link these properties to the capital were precarious making [[Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro]] to lead a group of farmers like Manuel Bento de Barros, Jos\u00e9 Ferraz de Campos and others to ask the provincial government to construct a road that facilitates the flow of production of the mills in the region of Piracicaba and Limeira.\n\nThis road was opened in 1826, while around it came a housing project, the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora das Dores do Tatuibi (Parish of Our Lady of Sorrows of Tatuibi), formalized by provincial law on December 9, 1930.<ref>[http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/dtbs/saopaulo/limeira.pdf IBGE: Hist\u00f3ria de Limeira]</ref> The traffic of the road facilitated the growth of trade and other activities and marks the founding of the municipality of Limeira. The core was built on land donated by Captain Luis Manuel Bastos da Cunha, he is considered the founder of the city.\n\nIn 1842 the region was elevated to village, but only in 1844 the city council land was installed and Limeira gained its first president, Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho. Limeira was elevated to city on April 18, 1863. On April 20, 1875 it was created the county of Limeira. Officially, the city's anniversary is September 15 and it is considered to be founded in 1826.\n\n===Origin of the private-sponsored European immigration===\n\nLimeira is one of the first cities in Brazil to receive private-sponsored European immigration. Through the pioneering effort undertaken by the then owner of the Mill Ibicaba in 1840, Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro (known as [[Senator Vergueiro]]), eighty Portuguese came to work on its lands. This was the first positive experience in developing the partnership system in Brazil.\n\nThe immigrants would replace the slave labor, still in use at this time, but they would receive benefits, unlike the slaves. In 1846, Germans came to work in Ibicaba and Senator Vergueiro became an important figure in replacement of slave labor with free European labor.\n\nThe farm [[Ibicaba]] was during a period the largest producer of coffee in [[Brazil]]. Today it is an important historical ensemble formed by its headquarters, slave quarters, terraces, dams and other facilities as part of the set of the city's historic farms.\n\n== Climate ==\nLimeira experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Cwa), with distinctive wet and dry seasons lasting from October to March and from April to September, respectively, and warm to hot temperatures year-round. The average temperature is 19.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (67.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) and yearly precipitation stands at 1300.5&nbsp;mm (51.2&nbsp;in).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jornaldotempo.uol.com.br/climatologia.html/Limeira-SP//|title=Jornal do Tempo {{!}} Climatologia para Limeira-SP|website=jornaldotempo.uol.com.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2017-04-15}}</ref> In 17 October 2014, temperatures in the city reached a record high of 38.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (101.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) and its coldest day was 9 July 2011, with a low of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C (32.1&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Limeira, Brazil (1961&ndash;1990)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 27.2\n|Feb high C = 27.2\n|Mar high C = 27.2\n|Apr high C = 25.5\n|May high C = 23.5\n|Jun high C = 22.3\n|Jul high C = 22.1\n|Aug high C = 24.0\n|Sep high C = 24.6\n|Oct high C = 24.8\n|Nov high C = 26.0\n|Dec high C = 25.4\n|year high C = 24.9\n|Jan low C = 17.8\n|Feb low C = 17.8\n|Mar low C = 17.2\n|Apr low C = 15.2\n|May low C = 12.9\n|Jun low C = 11.4\n|Jul low C = 10.9\n|Aug low C = 12.0\n|Sep low C = 13.8\n|Oct low C = 14.6\n|Nov low C = 16.0\n|Dec low C = 16.9\n|year low C = 14.7\n|Jan precipitation mm = 235.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 211.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 138.9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 53.6\n|May precipitation mm = 41.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 41.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 19.6\n|Aug precipitation mm = 24.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 61.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 120.5\n|Nov precipitation mm = 140.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 210.8\n|year precipitation mm = 1300.5\n|source 1 = Climatologia para Limeira-SP - Jornal do Tempo - UOL\n|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Industry==\n\nBy the year of 1850, agricultural equipment started to be produced in Limeira and during the [[Paraguayan War]] instruments to the soldiers were also produced. Between the years of 1907 and 1922 important industries, such as '[[Chap\u00e9us Prada]]' (1907), '[[Caf\u00e9 K\u00fchl]]' (1920) and 'Ind\u00fastria de Papel Santa Cruz' (1922) started their production in Limeira. However, it was after the 1940s that Limeira became well known for its industry.\n\n[[File:Prada.jpg|left|250px|thumb| The old industry building of [[Chap\u00e9us Prada]], now Limeira's City Hall]]\nBetween the 1940s and 1970s many citrus companies started producing orange and orange juice in Limeira to export to inside and outside of [[Brazil]], including to USA and Europe, this commerce gave to the city the title of 'The City of Orange'. Citrobrasil (1940) and Citrosuco (1966) were the biggest companies in Limeira in orange production, however when the United States started its policy to protect and encourage the nacional industry of orange in California, the production of orange in Limeira collapsed. Also after the Second World War the automotive industries took place in the city with 'Freios Varga' (today TRW) in 1945 and 'Rodas Fumagalli' in 1946.\n\nAfter the 1970s, the industrial section area started to grow faster and some multinational companies came to Limeira, such as: [[Ajinomoto]]; the American company [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] bought [[Fumagalli]] in 1974, and 'Freios Varga' joined the English Group Lucas in 2000. Recently, some Japanese and  Korean automotive companies have settled in Limeira, for example: [[Yacchyio]] do Brasil, Stanley, Mando, DAS and [[Faurecia]], which is a French company that has been building a new plant in the city. Recently, [[Samsung]] invested U$300 million in building an industry in Limeira.<ref>[http://www.valor.com.br/empresas/1011338/samsung-investe-us-300-milhoes Valor Econ\u00f4mico article]</ref>\n\nLimeira is also known for its new plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of \"Brazil's plated jewelry capital.\" There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of Brazil's exportation in this sector.\n\nThe city has been trying to become more attractive to industries related to incentive programs. This policy tries to reduce the unemployment and the informal jobs, which has been growing together with its population. Part of the population works in cities nearby, including [[Piracicaba]] and [[Americana, S\u00e3o Paulo|Americana]]. According to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), Limeira has a GDP of R$5.6 billion (2010), around U$3.6 billion.<ref>[http://www.gazetadelimeira.com.br/Noticia.asp?ID=44584 Gazeta de Limeira article based on IBGE database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330113406/http://www.gazetadelimeira.com.br/Noticia.asp?ID=44584 |date=2012-03-30 }}</ref> The industrial sector accounts for approximately 50% of registered jobs in the city. Thus, Limeira took its industrial vocation with its incentive program, which guided the development and implementation of its current industrial park.\n\nThe city has a number of favorable conditions for their development, such as the extension of Highway Bandeirantes ([[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes]]), the implementation of the Tiet\u00ea-Paran\u00e1 waterway, and the installation of the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline.<ref>[http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm Cityhall official website: Information about Limeira's Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415151542/http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm |date=2012-04-15 }}</ref>\n\nAll these factors, combined with their potential and possibilities, specified multiple paths for the development of the industrial sector of the city: \n* Limeira is inserted in the [[Campinas]] region, an area marked by a strong industrial concentration and has a GDP that is larger than many states in the country, such as [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]], for example.\n* In the formal economy has approximately 1,000 industries, employing more than 22,000 registered employees, with a significant share of skilled labor.\n\nThe size of the business is diversified, with a production quite varied, including brake systems, automotive wheels, exhausts, metal products, machinery for processing of agricultural products, paper and cardboard packaging, hats, and more. Limeira also has the largest concentration of production of machine tools in [[Latin America]] and the largest sugar refining industry in [[South America]]. However, the main segment that has been standing out in the city after the 1990s is to jewelry and lapidary stones, consisting mainly of micro and small businesses with family investment.\n\nCurrently, the largest industries in operation are:\n\n* [[Ajinomoto]] Interamericana Ind.

The implementation of the Shopping Center, in the 1980s, along the [[Rodovia Anhanguera]] (Anhanguera Road), came to further boost the development of the tertiary sector in the city. Allied to this and following the world trend of globalization and outsourcing observed the emergence of many companies included in the modernization process, which now act as support for the industries of the city. After the 1990s, the mall closed, but there is still a shopping mall located in downtown (Shopping Patio Limeira). By the end of 2012 Another two malls will probably be operating, one on Piracicaba road and other on Anhanguera Road.\n\nIn the area of public services, Limeira presents itself as home to several organizations and government agencies in regional performance as the [[Caixa Economica Federal]], Delegacia da Receita Federal, [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], [[CETESB]], Delegacia de Ensino do Estado, Inspetoria Fiscal da Secretaria da Fazenda do Estado, Comando da Pol\u00edcia Militar and Secretary of Agriculture of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo; there is also private institutions, such as [[CIESP]], [[SENAI]], [[SESI]], [[SENAC]] e JUCESP.\n\nThe main concern is the competition around the city. There is a big competition from neighbor cities because of diversity, variety and comfort. Sometimes, people prefer to travel to [[Campinas]] or [[Piracicaba]] for consumption.\n\nNumber of companies in Limeira by sector ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] 2001):<ref>[http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm Information of the City about number of Companies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415151542/http://www.limeira.sp.gov.br/municipio/09.htm |date=2012-04-15 }}</ref>\n* Agriculture and forestry - 37 companies\n* Fishery - 1 company\n* Extractive Industries - 10 companies\n* Manufacturing Industry - 1266 companies\n* Production and Distribution of electricity, Gas and Water - 3 companies\n* Construction - 170 companies\n* Trade, repair of motor vehicles, personal effects and household - 4,088 companies\n* Accommodation and Food - 605 companies\n* Transport, Storage and Communications - 238 companies\n* Financial Intermediation - 73 companies\n* Real Estate activities, Rentals and Business Services - 779 companies\n* Public Administration, Defense and Social Security - 6 companies\n* Education - 106 companies\n* Health and Social Services - 114 companies\n* Other Collective, Social and Personal - 405 companies\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nCurrently, Limeira has more than 2,000 farms. Rural production remains strongly marked by the [[sugar cane]] ([[Ethanol]] production) and orange/citrus, which has remained virtually unchanged over the past two decades, with a slight decline. The sugar cane production reaches more than 1 million tons per year and [[citrus]] (orange, lemon and tangerine), more than 1.4 billion units. On a smaller scale for production there are avocados, corn, rice and beans. The city is considered the first producer of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] citrus industry, and it is recognized by its production of seedlings, especially citrus.\n\nDuring the last three decades Limeira gained a large center of commerce of plants and seedlings on Geada, located on [[Limeira-Piracicaba Road]], approximately km 120. The biggest companies are F\u00e9lix Plantas,<ref>[http://felixplantas.com.br/ F\u00e9lix Plantas]</ref> Bonin Plantas,<ref>[http://www.boninplantas.com.br/ Bonin Plantas]</ref> Dierberger <ref>[http://www.fazendacitra.com.br/ Dierberger]</ref> and Ch\u00e1cara Roseira,<ref>[http://www.chacararoseira.com.br/ Ch\u00e1cara Roseira]</ref>\n\n==Local media==\n\nThere are two daily newspapers in the city: \"[[A Gazeta de Limeira]]\",<ref>[http://www.gazetainfo.com.br/ \"Gazeta de Limeira\" official website]</ref> created in 1831, and \"O Jornal de Limeira\",<ref>[http://jlmais.com/ \"Jornal de Limeira\" official website]</ref> created in 1982.

Its main products are [[wire]] and stranded [[electrical cable]] made from its Copperweld brand [[copper-covered steel|copper-clad steel]] (\"CCS\") or [[copper-covered aluminum wire|copper-clad aluminium]] (\"CCA\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kinderhook.com/portfolio-company/copperweld/}}</ref> In addition to its American operations, Copperweld maintains a production facility in [[Telford]], [[England]], and a distribution hub in [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Belgium]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nA group of engineers (S. E. Bramer, Jacob Roth, F. R. S. Kaplan, Simon Loeb and William Smith, Sr.) in the [[Pittsburgh]] industrial town of [[Rankin, Pennsylvania]] first created a permanent [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] bond between [[copper]] and [[steel]] in 1915.  This bond originally was made under a molten [[welding|weld]] process.  Their product, a CCS wire patented under the brand name Copperweld, was soon adopted as an alternative to solid copper wire in many [[electrical conductivity|conductor]] applications, particularly those where copper would be too [[ductility|ductile]] or would not offer the [[breaking strength]] of steel.  The original use, however, was for [[watch]] [[Spring (device)|spring]]s: the copper cladding prevented [[corrosion]].  The company was founded as the '''Copper-Clad Steel Company''', but in 1924, changed its name to the '''Copperweld Steel Company'''.\n\nIn 1927, the company installed itself in a former [[axe]] factory in [[Glassport, Pennsylvania]].  Copperweld Steel [[initial public offering|went public]] for the first time in 1929, shortly before the onset of the [[Great Depression]], but its [[share (finance)|share]]s were eventually withdrawn.\n\nThe United States government was the company's major client throughout the Depression and [[World War II]], and its patronage is largely responsible for keeping the company solvent in that time of severe economic downturn.  The company was listed on the [[New York Curb Exchange]] in 1937, and on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1940.  It would continue to trade on the NYSE until 1999.\n\nIn 1939, Copperweld would open its second factory in [[Warren, Ohio]], manufacturing steel [[Bar stock|billet]]s.\n\n===Post-war growth and diversification===\nAfter the war, the resurgence of the American economy helped Copperweld thrive.  The company's management offices relocated from Glassport to downtown [[Pittsburgh]] soon after the war.  Although there was considerable [[investment]] in existing divisions, [[takeover|acquisition]] became another of the company's major growth paths.  In 1951, the company acquired the Flexo Wire Co. of [[Oswego, New York]].  The next year, Copperweld entered into the steel [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|tube]] manufacturing business with the acquisition of Ohio Seamless Tubing Company of [[Shelby, Ohio]].  In 1957, the company merged with [[stainless steel]] finisher Superior Steel Company, but sold off the division after five years of poor performance.\n\nIn conjunction with [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], the company developed a second bimetallic product line, an [[aluminum]]-covered steel wire that it branded as Alumoweld\u00ae in 1959.  The new product was successful, and the company engaged in its first international [[joint venture]] in 1966, with the creation of the Japan Alumoweld Company of [[Numazu, Shizuoka|Numazu]], [[Japan]].  Copperweld's stake was 45%, with the remainder owned by Japanese wire and cable manufacturer [[Fujikura|Fujikura Ltd.]]\n\nIn 1972, Copperweld Steel Co. acquired the  [[Chicago]]-based Regal Tube division of [[Lear-Siegler]].\n\n===A new name===\nNow truly diversified, the company changed its name in 1973 to '''Copperweld Corporation'''. The company expanded into the primary and secondary metallurgical products market, offering a diversified product range that included steel pipe and tube; bimetallic wire, strand and strip; steel bars and plates; solder and skiving, and employed thousands at multiple facilities in the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. The bimetallic process moved beyond simple copper and steel, and eventually also combined metals and [[alloy]]s such as aluminum, [[tin]], [[brass]], [[gold]], [[nickel]] and [[silver]].\n\nIn 1974, the company's third foray into bimetallics was realized when the company opened a CCA wire manufacturing plant in [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]].  That division, Copperweld Southern, would go on to become the focus of the company's bimetallic wire operation.\n\n===Takeover===\n[[France|French]] [[holding company]] Im\u00e9tal S.A. (today known as [[Imerys]]), owned by the [[Rothschild family]], acquired [[controlling interest]] of Copperweld Corporation in 1975. Im\u00e9tal's acquisition of Copperweld represented the first [[hostile takeover]] of an American company by a foreign entity.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|author=The New Yorker|date=1977-02-07|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=14655&startpage=page0000082|title=The Marts of Trade: Retaking Pittsburgh}}</ref>  Im\u00e9tal vowed not to interfere with the theretofore successful company's direction.\n\nIn 1978, the company expanded its bimetallic wire production to [[Campinas, Brazil]] in a joint venture with Erico International Corp.  Copperweld would buy the entire operation from its partner just three years later.  Also in 1978 the firm announced the layoff of its [[Glassport, Pennsylvania]] facility along with 548 full-time jobs, prompting the mayor of Pittsburgh and the head of the [[RIDC]] to have a 2-hour meeting with company executives in an attempt to save the facility.<ref>{{Citation| last = Snyder| first = Thomas P.| author-link = | title = County hopes to save jobs at Copperweld| newspaper = Pittsburgh Press| location = Pittsburgh, PA| volume = | issue = | date = February 25, 1978| page = | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PTQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rFkEAAAAIBAJ&dq=regional%20industrial%20hiram%20milton&pg=4029%2C3189064}}</ref>\n\nA new division and revenue stream were created in 1980 with the advent of Copperweld Energy, which bought stakes in [[Houston]]-based [[Guardian Oil Company]].  The ostensible purpose of Copperweld's involvement in the energy business was to drill for [[natural gas]] on the grounds of (or near) its operations in Ohio and Pennsylvania, to ensure a steady supply for its factories.  That same year, the company acquired American Seamless Tubing of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].\n\nIn 1984, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Copperweld in a landmark antitrust case, ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]'', that a parent company is incapable of conspiracy with a [[wholly owned subsidiary]].\n\nThe severe [[steel crisis]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s hit Copperweld hard.  The venerable Glassport facility would close entirely in 1983.  In 1986, the Oswego fine wire division was shut down.  Both operations were relocated to Copperweld Southern in Fayetteville, largely due to cheaper labor costs in the [[Southern United States|South]].\n\n===Two Copperwelds===\nIn a bold move to shed the company of its crippled steel manufacturing operations and concentrate on fabricated steel products, Im\u00e9tal spun off Copperweld's Warren, Ohio operation into a separate publicly traded company in 1986.  That company, '''CSC Industries''', would continue to operate as the Copperweld Steel Company, causing confusion.  For some time, two \"Copperwelds\" existed.\n\nHowever, Im\u00e9tal's gamble paid off.  Copperweld Corporation returned to profitability just one year after the spin-off of CSC Industries, which, by contrast, was doomed.  The newly formed company never turned a profit in its entire history, and went bankrupt in 1993.  The assets of CSC Industries were acquired in a [[bidding war]] by Ohio-based Hamlin Holdings in 1995, and they discontinued use of the Copperweld name.\n\nThe late 1980s saw a much healthier Copperweld Corporation divest of its operations in Brazil and sell its tubing operation in Baltimore.  Expansion was again on the horizon, with the 1988 announcement of a $90 million upgrade to its plant in Shelby, Ohio, and the construction of another tube plant in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  The company also bought [[National Standard Company]]'s Copperply division, giving it control of a competing brand in bimetallic wire.\n\nIn 1989, Copperweld and Fujikura announce a second joint venture together, the United States Alumoweld Company, to be located in [[Duncan, South Carolina]].  In 1992, the  Copperweld Corporation [[divestiture|divested]] itself of the Alumoweld\u00ae business altogether, selling its shares and the rights to the brand to Fujikura.\n\nFurther growth by acquisition continued in the company's tube sector in the 1990s as it acquired [[Piqua, Ohio]]-based Miami Industries in 1993 and two [[Canada|Canadian]] steel tube companies, Standard Tube Canada and Sonco Steel Tube in 1997.  That same year, the Shelby plant was the subject of another important expansion.  In 1998, the company announced the building of a stainless steel tube plant in [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]].\n\nThe bimetallic wire division also prospered, with a drastic increase in demand of bimetallic wires for the [[cellular telephony]] boom.  In 1995, the company bought Metallon Engineered Materials Corporation of [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] in 1995.  There was a major expansion of the Fayetteville facility in 1997, and it purchased Sayton Fine Wires of Telford, England in 1998.\n\n===LTV===\nIn 1999, [[Cleveland, Ohio]]-based [[Ling-Temco-Vought|LTV Steel]] acquired Copperweld Corporation from Im\u00e9tal for $650 million, and the subsidiary became known as '''LTV Copperweld.'''  At that time, the company was the largest producer of structural steel tubing in North America with 23 plants and employing 3,500 people.<ref name=\"bankruptcydocs\">{{cite web|author=Bankrupt.com|date=2011-07-07|url=http://bankrupt.com/ltv.txt|title=LTV Bankruptcy News}}</ref>  But LTV was drowning in debt, and at the end of 2000, LTV, along with 48 subsidiaries, including Copperweld, [[bankruptcy|filed voluntary petitions for relief]] under [[Chapter 11]] of the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Code]].\n\nUnder the order of conservators, LTV's various subsidiaries were sold off.  But because the LTV Copperweld division maintained profitable operations throughout LTV's bankruptcy proceeding, it was able to secure separate [[debtor-in-possession financing]] through [[GE Commercial Finance]].  In late 2003, LTV Copperweld emerged from bankruptcy.\n\n===Dofasco===\n[[Dofasco]] (today a division of [[Arcelor Mittal]]) acquired most of the LTV Copperweld assets,<ref name=\"dofascobuy\">{{cite web|author=Arcelor Mittal |date=2005-10-04 |url=http://www.dofasco.ca/bins/content_page.asp?cid=2347-2349-86744 |title=Arcelor Mittal Press Release |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927063049/http://www.dofasco.ca/bins/content_page.asp?cid=2347-2349-86744 |archivedate=2011-09-27}}</ref> including 50% of the bimetallic wire division, which would in turn be sold to a private investor David S.

It was the only division of the previous conglomerate to continue to operate under the Copperweld name, and kept the established brand as a registered trademark for its copper-clad steel conductors.\n\n===Fushi===\nIn August 2007, however, the owner sold the company for US$22.5 million to '''Fushi International,''' founded by Li Fu in 2001. The acquisition is significant because it represents the first major investment in the state of [[Tennessee]] for a mainland Chinese company.  By acquiring Copperweld, it not only opened up a worldwide distribution channel, it also gained product diversification by the presence of CCS wire in its new subsidiary's lineup. Three months later, Fushi International was listed on the [[Nasdaq]], and changed its name to '''Fushi Copperweld''', capilizing on the established brand name in the [[Western world|west]].\n\nA group of investors headed by Chairman Fu Li delisted from the Nasdaq on December 27, 2012, returning the company to private ownership gain.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/FSIN.O%5EL12/key-developments/article/2666985|title=Fushi Copperweld Completes 'Going Private' Transaction|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2012-12-26 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Kinderhook===\nIn October 2019, Kinderhook Industries LLC announced its acquisition of Copperweld, citing the company's proprietary manufacturing and differentiated products that provide an array of compelling growth avenues to pursue, particularly in the automotive.

Its main products are [[wire]], stranded [[electrical cable]], and [[busbar]] made from its Copperweld brand [[copper clad steel|copper-clad steel]] (\"CCS\") or [[copper-clad aluminium wire|copper-clad aluminium]] (\"CCA\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biz.yahoo.com/e/100316/fsin10-k.html |title=Form 10-K for Fushi Copperweld (FSIN) |accessdate=2010-05-01 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100913124244/http://biz.yahoo.com/e/100316/fsin10-k.html |archivedate=2010-09-13 |df= }}</ref> In addition to its Chinese and American operations, Fushi Copperweld maintains a production facility in [[Telford]], [[England]], and a distribution hub in [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Belgium]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nA group of engineers (S. E. Bramer, Jacob Roth, F. R. S. Kaplan, Simon Loeb and William Smith, Sr.) in the [[Pittsburgh]] industrial town of [[Rankin, Pennsylvania]] first created a permanent [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] bond between [[copper]] and [[steel]] in 1915.  This bond originally was made under a molten [[welding|weld]] process.  Their product, a CCS wire patented under the brand name Copperweld, was soon adopted as an alternative to solid copper wire in many [[electrical conductivity|conductor]] applications, particularly those where copper would be too [[ductility|ductile]] or would not offer the [[breaking strength]] of steel.  The original use, however, was for [[watch]] [[Spring (device)|spring]]s: the copper cladding prevented [[corrosion]].  The company was founded as the '''Copper-Clad Steel Company''', but in 1924, changed its name to the '''Copperweld Steel Company'''.\n\nIn 1927, the company installed itself in a former [[axe]] factory in [[Glassport, Pennsylvania]].  Copperweld Steel [[initial public offering|went public]] for the first time in 1929, shortly before the onset of the [[Great Depression]], but its [[share (finance)|share]]s were eventually withdrawn.\n\nThe United States government was the company's major client throughout the Depression and [[World War II]], and its patronage is largely responsible for keeping the company solvent in that time of severe economic downturn.  The company was listed on the [[New York Curb Exchange]] in 1937, and on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in 1940.  It would continue to trade on the NYSE until 1999.\n\nIn 1939, Copperweld would open its second factory in [[Warren, Ohio]], manufacturing steel [[Bar stock|billet]]s.\n\n===Post-war growth and diversification===\nAfter the war, the resurgence of the American economy helped Copperweld thrive.  The company's management offices relocated from Glassport to downtown [[Pittsburgh]] soon after the war.  Although there was considerable [[investment]] in existing divisions, [[takeover|acquisition]] became another of the company's major growth paths.  In 1951, the company acquired the Flexo Wire Co. of [[Oswego, New York]].  The next year, Copperweld entered into the steel [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|tube]] manufacturing business with the acquisition of Ohio Seamless Tubing Company of [[Shelby, Ohio]].  In 1957, the company merged with [[stainless steel]] finisher Superior Steel Company, but sold off the division after five years of poor performance.\n\nIn conjunction with [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], the company developed a second bimetallic product line, an [[aluminum]]-covered steel wire that it branded as Alumoweld\u00ae in 1959.  The new product was successful, and the company engaged in its first international [[joint venture]] in 1966, with the creation of the Japan Alumoweld Company of [[Numazu, Shizuoka|Numazu]], [[Japan]].  Copperweld's stake was 45%, with the remainder owned by Japanese wire and cable manufacturer [[Fujikura|Fujikura Ltd.]]\n\nIn 1972, Copperweld Steel Co. acquired the  [[Chicago]]-based Regal Tube division of [[Lear-Siegler]].\n\n===A new name===\nNow truly diversified, the company changed its name in 1973 to '''Copperweld Corporation'''. The company expanded into the primary and secondary metallurgical products market, offering a diversified product range that included steel pipe and tube; bimetallic wire, strand and strip; steel bars and plates; solder and skiving, and employed thousands at multiple facilities in the United States, Canada, Japan and Britain. The bimetallic process moved beyond simple copper and steel, and eventually also combined metals and [[alloy]]s such as aluminum, [[tin]], [[brass]], [[gold]], [[nickel]] and [[silver]].\n\nIn 1974, the company's third foray into bimetallics was realized when the company opened a CCA wire manufacturing plant in [[Fayetteville, Tennessee]].  That division, Copperweld Southern, would go on to become the focus of the company's bimetallic wire operation.\n\n===Takeover, crisis and breakup===\n[[France|French]] [[holding company]] Im\u00e9tal S.A. (today known as [[Imerys]]), owned by the [[Rothschild family]], acquired [[controlling interest]] of Copperweld Corporation in 1975. Im\u00e9tal's acquisition of Copperweld represented the first [[hostile takeover]] of an American company by a foreign entity.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|author=The New Yorker|date=1977-02-07|url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=14655&startpage=page0000082|title=The Marts of Trade: Retaking Pittsburgh}}</ref>  Im\u00e9tal vowed not to interfere with the theretofore successful company's direction.\n\nIn 1978, the company expanded its bimetallic wire production to [[Campinas, Brazil]] in a joint venture with Erico International Corp.  Copperweld would buy the entire operation from its partner just three years later.  Also in 1978 the firm announced the layoff of its [[Glassport, Pennsylvania]] facility along with 548 full-time jobs, prompting the mayor of Pittsburgh and the head of the [[RIDC]] to have a 2-hour meeting with company executives in an attempt to save the facility.<ref>{{Citation| last = Snyder| first = Thomas P.| author-link = | title = County hopes to save jobs at Copperweld| newspaper = Pittsburgh Press| location = Pittsburgh, PA| volume = | issue = | date = February 25, 1978| page = | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PTQcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rFkEAAAAIBAJ&dq=regional%20industrial%20hiram%20milton&pg=4029%2C3189064}}</ref>\n\nA new division and revenue stream were created in 1980 with the advent of Copperweld Energy, which bought stakes in [[Houston]]-based [[Guardian Oil Company]].  The ostensible purpose of Copperweld's involvement in the energy business was to drill for [[natural gas]] on the grounds of (or near) its operations in Ohio and Pennsylvania, to ensure a steady supply for its factories.  That same year, the company acquired American Seamless Tubing of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].\n\nIn 1984, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of Copperweld in a landmark antitrust case, ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]'', that a parent company is incapable of conspiracy with a [[wholly owned subsidiary]].\n\nThe severe [[steel crisis]] of the late 1970s and early 1980s hit Copperweld hard.

In 2011, Fushi Copperweld announced a continuation of its agreement with [[Nexans]] to license its proprietary method of producing CCA.  The company is able to draw the bimetallic wire down to sizes as fine as 0.03 millimeters, or one-fifth the [[diameter]] of a human [[hair]].\n\nIn late 2013, Copperweld Bimetallics LLC, the company's American subsidiary, purchased most of the assets of its biggest American competitor, the Bimetals division of [[CommScope]], relocating their equipment from [[Statesville, North Carolina]] to Copperweld's plant in Fayetteville, Tennessee.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies of China]]\n[[Category:Companies with year of establishment missing]]\n[[Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ]]\n", "name_user": "PowerGridManager", "label": "safe", "comment": "Update reflecting purchase by NY firm, Kinderhook Industries; Corrections to PRC messaging", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushi_Copperweld"}
