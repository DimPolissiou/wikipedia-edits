To avoid detection, he performs the surgery at his house, much to the chagrin of his wife '''Ghazala''' ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), who questions his allegiance. The following day, during a military raid, Hilaal is accused of harbouring terrorists. A shootout ensues at his home, during which Ikhlaque is killed and Hilaal is taken away for questioning. The doctor's house is bombed subsequently to kill any other militant hiding inside. Several days later Ghazala's son, '''Haider''' ([[Shahid Kapoor]]), returns from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] to seek answers about his father's disappearance. Upon arrival, he is shocked to find his mother singing and laughing along with her brother-in-law, '''Khurram''' ([[Kay Kay Menon]]). Unable to understand his mother's behaviour, he begins searching for his father in various police stations and detention camps with the help of his childhood sweetheart '''Arshia Lone''' ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), a journalist.\n\nSaddened by the growing closeness between Ghazala and Khurram, and unable to find any leads, Haider begins to lose hope. However, Arshia encounters a stranger, Roohdar, who asks her to inform Haider that he will be able to provide information about Hilaal. Haider contacts '''Roohdar''' ([[Irrfan]]), who turns out to be part of a separatist group. Roohdar then narrates the story of how he met Hilaal in one of the detention centers, where they both were tortured. Hilaal attributes his imprisonment to his brother, Khurram. Roohdaar then tells the story of how Hilaal was brutally murdered by Khurram's made-up terrorist group and how Roohdar survived after being shot and thrown into the river with Hilaal, which stopped his bleeding and allowed him to escape, though Hilaal died. Roohdaar then tells Haider that he simply wanted to pass on his father's message to him: revenge for Khurram's betrayal. Thereafter, angry and swearing to avenge the injustice done to his father, Haider breaks down at Hilaal's grave site and becomes mentally and emotionally shattered. He starts suffering from the effects of a [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], shaving his head and behaving strangely. Khurram, after learning of the meeting between Haider and Roohdar, tells him that Roohdar was the one who killed his father. Haider is now confused as to whom to believe despite knowing the truth himself, and discloses his dilemma to Arshia, adding that Roohdar gave him a gun to kill Khurram. Arshia confides this to her father Pervez, who informs Khurram about the gun. Khurram, at a ceremony related to his marriage with Ghazala, which has now been solemnised, immediately orders his men to corner Haider and send him to a mental institution.\n\nThe following morning, Haider is all set to kill Khurram but cannot accomplish it because Khurram is offering [[Salat|prayers]] and Haider's morals prevent it. He is captured by Pervez who orders him to be executed, but Haider manages to escape, although not before mercilessly killing his captors, the Salmans. He contacts Roohdar, who suggests getting trained in Pakistan to avenge his father's death, and Haider agrees. He calls his mother and informs her about it to which she asks him to meet her once before going to the other side of [[Indo-Pakistani border|border]]. During the meeting, Ghazala discloses that she had told Khurram about the terrorists hiding in their house not knowing that he was an informer of the Indian army. Pervez traces them and is about to shoot Haider when Haider shoots him dead and escapes.\n\nTormented byPervez's death at the hands of Haider, Arshia is emotionally traumatized and commits suicide. Meanwhile, Ghazala finds Roohdar's contact number from Arshia's diary and calls him. Haider goes to his pickup point, the graveyard where his father was buried. At the graveyard, Haider contemplates about the universal nature of mortality. On seeing Arshia's brother Liyaqat in the graveyard, he realises that the corpse is of Arshia. He runs towards her body where Liyaqat sees him and informs Khurram. A fight ensues between Haider and Liyaqat, resulting in the latter's death. Khurram arrives with full force and a gunfight ensues; meanwhile Roohdar drops Ghazala at the graveyard. A fierce exchange of bullets and bombs leaves only Haider and few men on Khurram's side alive. Just when Khurram is about to kill Haider, Ghazala pleads for a chance to convince Haider to surrender. She confronts her son who says that he cannot die before avenging his father's death. Ghazala tells him that revenge only results in revenge and there is no end to this cycle, but Haider, who is bent on revenge, does not understand. Ghazala kisses Haider goodbye and steps outside, only to reveal that she is wearing a suicide vest, given to her by Roohdar. Khurram and Haider rush towards her but she pulls the pins of the [[hand grenade]] resulting in a big explosion, killing herself along with the rest of Khurram's men and gravely injuring Khurram himself, while Haider is only slightly thrown back from the force of the explosion. Haider goes to his mother's remains, weeps by her side and goes to kill Khurram, whose legs have been severed from his body.\n\nHe is reminded of his mother's words that \"revenge only results in revenge\" and thus decides to let Khurram live. Khurram begs Haider to kill him to free him from the burden of guilt and to avenge his father's death, but Haider doesn't oblige Khurram, and instead ignores him and leaves just as Khurram dies.\n\n== Cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Based on\n|-\n|[[Shahid Kapoor]]\n| Haider Meer\n|[[Prince Hamlet]]\n|-\n|[[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] \n| Ghazala Meer (Haider's Mother)\n|[[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]\n|-\n| [[Shraddha Kapoor]]\n| Arshia Lone\n| [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]\n|-\n| [[Narendra Jha]]\n| Dr. Hilal Meer (Haider's Father) \n| [[King Hamlet]]\n|-\n| [[Irrfan Khan]]\n| Roohdaar\n| [[Ghost (Hamlet)]]\n|-\n| [[Kay Kay Menon]]\n| Khurram Meer\n| [[King Claudius|Claudius]]\n|-\n| [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]\n| Hussain Meer \n|\n|-\n| [[Lalit Parimoo]]\n| Pervez Lone \n|[[Polonius]]\n|-\n| [[Ashish Vidyarthi]]\n| [[Brigadier]] T.

His wife was deeply moved after reading the book. Bharadwaj didn't immediately read the book but was aware about its content. Later, Bhardwaj desired to change the synopsis. Remembering Basharat's book, he contacted him and they started the work.<ref name=iedev1/> Bhardwaj quoted importance of Basharat in the film as, \"If Basharat was not a part of the film, ''Haider'' wouldn't be made or it wouldn't be made this way.\"<ref name=iedev1/> The film is Peer's first film project.

There were sections of the ''[[To be, or not to be]]'' speech that was translated directly in Hindi. Due to constraints of time they had to omit the [[Clothes Make the Man|Apparel maketh a man]] soliloquy though.<ref name=fpbp/> They retained and translated the section where \"Hamlet\" meets [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] and speaks about Denmark being in prison. Further, new soliloquies were created to convey \"Hamlet\"'s madness and the veiled political satire in it.<ref name=fpbp/> This was brought in when \"Haider\" with his head shaved, dressed in torn, shabby clothes rants on a traffic roundabout in [[Srinagar]] and apart from a few senseless jokes, reads out the bare act of the [[Armed Forces Special Powers Act]].<ref name=fpbp/> Apart from this, Peer explained that an adaptation doesn't exactly follow the original, like the part of [[Fortinbras]] was barely there in ''Haider''. The world of [[King Claudius]] and [[Polonius]] is portrayed as the counter-insurgency and government-run, counter-insurgent militias in ''Haider'' and thematically dominates the action.<ref name=fpbp>{{cite web|last=Pal|first=Deepanjana|title=Writing 3D Kashmiri: Basharat Peer on the challenges of co-scripting Haider|url=http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/writing-a-3d-kashmiri-basharat-peer-on-the-challenges-of-co-scripting-haider-1738665.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Tdjwya8u|archivedate=27 October 2014|publisher=Firstpost|accessdate=3 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|\"It was the political turmoil and the 25 years of tragedy of [[Kashmir]] that compelled me.

In his previous outing of [[Othello]]'s adaptation, ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'' (2006), he removed the last monologue due to the fact that it was more suited for a stage play sequence but retained that type of monologue for ''Haider''. Shahid Kapoor learnt a six-page monologue for the climatic scene where his character \"Haider\" turns mad. He put forth the delivery of that monologue in front of a crowd of 5000 listening.

To avoid detection, he performs the surgery at his house, much to the chagrin of his wife '''Ghazala''' ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), who questions his allegiance. The following day, during a military raid, Hilaal is accused of harbouring terrorists. A shootout ensues at his home, during which Ikhlaque is killed and Hilaal is taken away for questioning. The doctor's house is bombed subsequently to kill any other militant hiding inside. Several days later Ghazala's son, '''Haider''' ([[Shahid Kapoor]]), returns from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] to seek answers about his father's disappearance. Upon arrival, he is shocked to find his mother singing and laughing along with her brother-in-law, '''Khurram''' ([[Kay Kay Menon]]). Unable to understand his mother's behaviour, he begins searching for his father in various police stations and detention camps with the help of his childhood sweetheart '''Arshia Lone''' ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), a journalist.\n\nSaddened by the growing closeness between Ghazala and Khurram, and unable to find any leads, Haider begins to lose hope. However, Arshia encounters a stranger, Roohdar, who asks her to inform Haider that he will be able to provide information about Hilaal. Haider contacts '''Roohdar''' ([[Irrfan]]), who turns out to be part of a separatist group. Roohdar then narrates the story of how he met Hilaal in one of the detention centers, where they both were tortured. Hilaal attributes his imprisonment to his brother, Khurram. Roohdaar then tells the story of how Hilaal was brutally murdered by Khurram's made-up terrorist group and how Roohdar survived after being shot and thrown into the river with Hilaal, which stopped his bleeding and allowed him to escape, though Hilaal died. Roohdaar then tells Haider that he simply wanted to pass on his father's message to him: revenge for Khurram's betrayal. Thereafter, angry and swearing to avenge the injustice done to his father, Haider breaks down at Hilaal's grave site and becomes mentally and emotionally shattered. He starts suffering from the effects of a [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], shaving his head and behaving strangely. Khurram, after learning of the meeting between Haider and Roohdar, tells him that Roohdar was the one who killed his father. Haider is now confused as to whom to believe despite knowing the truth himself, and discloses his dilemma to Arshia, adding that Roohdar gave him a gun to kill Khurram. Arshia confides this to her father Pervez, who informs Khurram about the gun. Khurram, at a ceremony related to his marriage with Ghazala, which has now been solemnised, immediately orders his men to corner Haider and send him to a mental institution.\n\nThe following morning, Haider is all set to kill Khurram but cannot accomplish it because Khurram is offering [[Salat|prayers]] and Haider's morals prevent it. He is captured by Pervez who orders him to be executed, but Haider manages to escape, although not before mercilessly killing his captors, the Salmans. He contacts Roohdar, who suggests getting trained in Pakistan to avenge his father's death, and Haider agrees. He calls his mother and informs her about it to which she asks him to meet her once before going to the other side of [[Indo-Pakistani border|border]]. During the meeting, Ghazala discloses that she had told Khurram about the terrorists hiding in their house not knowing that he was an informer of the Indian army. Pervez traces them and is about to shoot Haider when Haider shoots him dead and escapes.\n\nTormented byPervez's death at the hands of Haider, Arshia is emotionally traumatized and commits suicide. Meanwhile, Ghazala finds Roohdar's contact number from Arshia's diary and calls him. Haider goes to his pickup point, the graveyard where his father was buried. At the graveyard, Haider contemplates about the universal nature of mortality. On seeing Arshia's brother Liyaqat in the graveyard, he realises that the corpse is of Arshia. He runs towards her body where Liyaqat sees him and informs Khurram. A fight ensues between Haider and Liyaqat, resulting in the latter's death. Khurram arrives with full force and a gunfight ensues; meanwhile Roohdar drops Ghazala at the graveyard. A fierce exchange of bullets and bombs leaves only Haider and few men on Khurram's side alive. Just when Khurram is about to kill Haider, Ghazala pleads for a chance to convince Haider to surrender. She confronts her son who says that he cannot die before avenging his father's death. Ghazala tells him that revenge only results in revenge and there is no end to this cycle, but Haider, who is bent on revenge, does not understand. Ghazala kisses Haider goodbye and steps outside, only to reveal that she is wearing a suicide vest, given to her by Roohdar. Khurram and Haider rush towards her but she pulls the pins of the [[hand grenade]] resulting in a big explosion, killing herself along with the rest of Khurram's men and gravely injuring Khurram himself, while Haider is only slightly thrown back from the force of the explosion. Haider goes to his mother's remains, weeps by her side and goes to kill Khurram, whose legs have been severed from his body.\n\nHe is reminded of his mother's words that \"revenge only results in revenge\" and thus decides to let Khurram live. Khurram begs Haider to kill him to free him from the burden of guilt and to avenge his father's death, but Haider doesn't oblige Khurram, and instead ignores him and leaves just as Khurram dies.\n\n== Cast ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Actor\n!Role\n!Based on\n|-\n|[[Shahid Kapoor]]\n| Haider Meer\n|[[Prince Hamlet]]\n|-\n|[[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] \n| Ghazala Meer (Haider's Mother)\n|[[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]\n|-\n| [[Shraddha Kapoor]]\n| Arshia Lone\n| [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]]\n|-\n| [[Narendra Jha]]\n| Dr. Hilal Meer (Haider's Father) \n| [[King Hamlet]]\n|-\n| [[Irrfan Khan]]\n| Roohdaar\n| [[Ghost (Hamlet)]]\n|-\n| [[Kay Kay Menon]]\n| Khurram Meer\n| [[King Claudius|Claudius]]\n|-\n| [[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]\n| Hussain Meer \n|\n|-\n| [[Lalit Parimoo]]\n| Pervez Lone \n|[[Polonius]]\n|-\n| [[Ashish Vidyarthi]]\n| [[Brigadier]] T.

Remembering Basharat's book, he contacted him and they started the work.<ref name=iedev1/> Bhardwaj quoted importance of Basharat in the film as, \"If Basharat was not a part of the film, ''Haider'' wouldn't be made or it wouldn't be made this way.\"<ref name=iedev1/> The film is Peer's first film project.

There were sections of the ''[[To be, or not to be]]'' speech that was translated directly in Hindi. Due to constraints of time they had to omit the [[Clothes Make the Man|Apparel maketh a man]] soliloquy though.<ref name=fpbp/> They retained and translated the section where \"Hamlet\" meets [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] and speaks about Denmark being in prison. Further, new soliloquies were created to convey \"Hamlet\"'s madness and the veiled political satire in it.<ref name=fpbp/> This was brought in when \"Haider\" with his head shaved, dressed in torn, shabby clothes rants on a traffic roundabout in [[Srinagar]] and apart from a few senseless jokes, reads out the bare act of the [[Armed Forces Special Powers Act]].<ref name=fpbp/> Apart from this, Peer explained that an adaptation doesn't exactly follow the original, like the part of [[Fortinbras]] was barely there in ''Haider''.

In his previous outing of [[Othello]]'s adaptation, ''[[Omkara (2006 film)|Omkara]]'' (2006), he removed the last monologue due to the fact that it was more suited for a stage play sequence but retained that type of monologue for ''Haider''.

Employee benefit plans were also getting costlier \u2014 making hospitalizations, prescription meds, and dental and eye care harder to afford. In the employee assistance part of his business, he saw a rising anxiety among Canadians, and a matched increase in mental health challenges.

{"title_page": "List of DOS commands", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nThis article presents a list of commands used by [[DOS]] [[operating system]]s, especially as used on [[x86]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s (PCs). [[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.\n\nIn DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Command processing==\nThe command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal \u2014 built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.\n\nExternal commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.\n\nIn the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''<kbd>[[filespec]]</kbd>'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''<kbd>filename</kbd>'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a \"/\" or a \"-\" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.\n\nThe command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.\n\nMany commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.\n\n==DOS commands==\nA partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] follows below.\n\n===APPEND===\nSets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. \nThe APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\n===ASSIGN===\n{{Further|Drive letter assignment}}\nThe command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 2 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ATTRIB===\n{{Main|ATTRIB}}\nAttrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files and also process all files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BACKUP and RESTORE===\nThese are commands to [[backup]] and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BASIC and BASICA===\n{{Main|IBM BASIC}}\n\nAn implementation of the [[BASIC]] programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.\n\n[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.\n\nMicrosoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.\n\nBASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.\n\n===BREAK===\nThis command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the {{Keypress|Ctrl}} and {{Keypress|Break}} keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CALL===\n{{See also|start (command)}}\nStarts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CD and CHDIR===\n{{Main|cd (command)}}\n\nThe CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHCP===\nThe command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHKDSK===\n{{Main|CHKDSK}}\n\nCHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity.

Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty, the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.\n\nThe <code>deltree</code> command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s.  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.\n\n===DIR===\n{{Main|dir (command)}}\n\nThe DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk.

Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.\n\nAnother important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the <code>@echo off</code> statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a \"tidier\" output (the <code>@</code> symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EDIT===\n{{Main|MS-DOS Editor}}\n\nEDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the [[E (PC DOS)|DOS ''E'' Editor]] and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.\n\n===EDLIN===\n{{Main|Edlin}}\n\nDOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.\n\nIn DOS 5, an extra command \"?\" was added to give the user much-needed help.\n\nDOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install.

It is an internal command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 4 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== MEMMAKER ===\nStarting with version 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> MS-DOS included the external program MemMaker which was used to free system memory (especially [[Conventional memory]]) by automatically reconfiguring the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] and [[CONFIG.SYS]] files. This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = [[Que Publishing]] | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in [[MS-DOS 7]] ([[Windows 95]]); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft's FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools. \n\nPC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.

Unlike the <code>move</code> command, this command cannot be used to rename subdirectories, or rename files across drives. Mass renames can be accomplished by the use of the wildcards characters asterisk (*) and question mark (?).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490987.aspx |title=Microsoft TechNet Rename (ren) article}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== REPLACE ===\n{{Main|replace (command)}}\n\nA command that is used to replace one or more existing [[computer file]]s or add new files to a target [[directory (computing)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== RESTORE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#BACKUP and RESTORE|BACKUP and RESTORE]]\n\n=== SCANDISK ===\n{{Main|Microsoft ScanDisk}}\n\nDisk diagnostic utility. Scandisk was a replacement for the <code>chkdsk</code> utility, starting with MS-DOS version 6.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> Its primary advantages over <code>chkdsk</code> is that it is more reliable and has the ability to run a surface scan which finds and marks bad clusters on the disk. It also provided mouse point-and-click [[Text user interface|TUI]], allowing for interactive session to complement command-line batch run.\n<code>chkdsk</code> had surface scan and bad cluster detection functionality included, and was used again on Windows NT based operating systems.\n\n=== SELECT ===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe SELECT command formats a disk and installs country-specific information and keyboard codes.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and 4 and IBM PC DOS releases 3 through 3.3.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\nThis command is no longer included in DOS Version 6 and later.\n\n=== SET ===\nSets [[environment variable]]s.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n[[cmd.exe]] in Windows NT 2000, 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, and a number of third-party solutions allow direct entry of environment variables from the command prompt. From at least Windows 2000, the <code>set</code> command allows for the evaluation of strings into variables, thus providing ''inter alia'' a means of performing integer arithmetic.<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Karp\n| first      = David Aaron\n| author2    = [[Tim O'Reilly]]\n| author3    = Troy Mott\n| title      = Windows XP in a nutshell\n| url        = https://archive.org/details/windowsxpinnutsh00karp\n| url-access = registration\n| accessdate = 2010-11-26\n| edition    = 2\n| series     = Nutshell handbook\n| year       = 2005\n| publisher  = [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n| isbn       = 978-0-596-00900-7\n| page       = [https://archive.org/details/windowsxpinnutsh00karp/page/422 422]\n}}</ref>\n\n=== SETUP ===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\nThis command does a computer setup. With all computers running DOS versions 5 and\nlater, it runs the computer setup, such as Windows 95 setup and Windows 98 setup.\n\n=== SETVER ===\n{{See also|ver (command)}}\n\nSetVer is a [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program designed to return a different value to the version of DOS that is running.  This allows programs that look for a specific version of DOS to run under a different DOS.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SHARE ===\n{{Main|share (command)}}\n\nInstalls support for file sharing and locking capabilities.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SHIFT ===\nThe SHIFT command increases number of [[replaceable parameter]]s to more than the standard ten for use in [[batch file]]s.\nThis is done by changing the position of replaceable parameters. It replaces each of the replacement parameters with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SIZER ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe external command SIZER.EXE is not intended to be started directly from the command prompt. Is used by [[MemMaker]] during the memory-optimization process.\n\n=== SMARTDRV ===\n{{Main|SmartDrive}}\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SORT ===\nA [[Filter (software)|filter]] to sort lines in the input data stream and send them to the output data stream. Similar to the Unix command <code>[[Sort (Unix)|sort]]</code>. Handles files up to 64k. This sort is always case insensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722869.aspx|title=Microsoft on \"sort\"|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SUBST ===\n{{Main|SUBST}}\n\nA utility to map a subdirectory to a drive letter.<ref name=\"murdock\" /> The opposite can be achieved via the [[#JOIN|JOIN]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SYS ===\n{{Main|SYS (command)}}\n\nA utility to make a volume bootable.  Sys rewrites the Volume Boot Code (the first sector of the partition that SYS is acting on) so that the code, when executed, will look for [[IO.SYS]].  SYS also copies the core DOS system files, IO.SYS, [[MSDOS.SYS]], and [[COMMAND.COM]], to the volume.  SYS does ''not'' rewrite the Master Boot Record, contrary to widely held belief.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TELNET ===\nThe Telnet Client is a tool for developers and administrators to help manage and test network connectivity. <ref> Client must be activated from Admin </ref>\n\n=== TIME ===\n{{Main|TIME (command)}}\n\nDisplay the [[system time]] and waits for the user to enter a new time.  Complements the [[#DATE|DATE]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TITLE===\n{{Main|title (command)}}\nEnables a user to change the title of their MS-DOS window.\n\n=== TREE ===\n{{Main|tree (command)}}\nIt is an external command, graphically displays the path of each directory and sub-directories on the specified drive.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TRUENAME ===\nThe TRUENAME command will expand the name of a file, directory, or drive, and display the result. It will expand an abbreviated form which the command processor can recognise into its full form. It can see through <kbd>SUBST</kbd> and <kbd>JOIN</kbd> to find the actual directory.\n\nMS-DOS can find files and directories given their names, without full path information, if the search object is on a path specified by the environment variable [[PATH (environment variable)|PATH]]. For example, if <kbd>PATH</kbd> includes <kbd>C:\\PROGRAMS</kbd>, and file <kbd>MYPROG.EXE</kbd> is on this directory, then if <code>MYPROG</code> is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute <code>C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE</code>. In this case,\n\n TRUENAME MYPROG\n\nwould display\n\n C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE\n\nThis command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch \"<kbd>/?</kbd>\" defines it as a \"Reserved command name\". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the [[which (command)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name. The C library function <code>realpath</code> performs this function. The Microsoft Windows command processors do not support this command.\n<real code.st>\n\n=== TYPE ===\n{{Main|TYPE (DOS command)}}\n\nDisplays a file. The <kbd>[[List of DOS commands#MORE|more]]</kbd> command is frequently used in conjunction with this command, e.g. <kbd>type ''long-text-file'' | more</kbd>. TYPE can be used to concatenate files (type file1 file2 > file3); however this won't work for large files{{dubious|date=November 2014}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\u2014use copy command instead.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== UNDELETE ===\n{{Main|Undeletion}}\n\nRestores file previously deleted with <kbd>del</kbd>. By default all recoverable files in the working directory are restored; options are used to change this behavior. If the MS-DOS <kbd>mirror</kbd> [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program is used, then deletion tracking files are created and can be used by <kbd>undelete</kbd>.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== UNFORMAT ===\n{{See also|format (command)}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe UNFORMAT command is used to undo the effects of formatting a disk.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VER ===\n{{Main|ver (command)}}\n\nAn internal DOS command, that reports the DOS version presently running, and since MS-DOS 5, whether DOS is loaded high.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VERIFY ===\nEnables or disables the feature to determine if files have been correctly written to disk. If no parameter is provided, the command will display the current setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~murdock/verify.html|title=DOS Command: VERIFY|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VOL ===\n{{Main|vol (command)}}\n\nAn internal command that displays the disk volume label and serial number.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VSAFE ===\n{{Main|MSAV}}\n\nA [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program that continuously monitors the computer for viruses.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== XCOPY ===\n{{Main|XCOPY}}\n\nCopy entire directory trees. Xcopy is a version of the copy command that can move files and directories from one location to another.\n\nXCOPY usage and attributes can be obtained by typing \"XCOPY /?\" in the DOS Command line.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> \n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:Windows commands]]\n* [[Command-line interface]]\n* [[List of CONFIG.SYS directives]]\n* [[Timeline of DOS operating systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book|author-last=Cooper|author-first=Jim|title=Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition|date=2001|publisher=[[Que Publishing]]|isbn=978-0789725738}}\n* {{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=MS-DOS Commands: Microsoft Quick Reference, 4th Revised edition|date=1990|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-1556152894}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikibooks|Guide to Windows Commands}}\n*[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands Command-Line Reference]  : Microsoft TechNet Database \"Command-Line Reference\"\n*[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx The MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference on TechNet] contains the official Microsoft MS-DOS 6 command reference documention.\n*[http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/ DR-DOS 7.03 online manual]\n*[http://www.mdgx.com/secrets.htm MDGx MS-DOS Undocumented + Hidden Secrets]\n\nThere are several guides to DOS commands available that are licensed under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]:\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130612114615/http://fd-doc.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php The FreeDOS Spec] at SourceForge is a [[plaintext]] specification, written in 1999, for how DOS commands should work in FreeDOS\n*[http://www.computerhope.com/msdos.htm MS-DOS commands]\n*[http://www.windows-commandline.com/windows-cmd-commands-reference/ Reference for windows commands with examples]\n*[http://www.textfiles.com/hacking/MICROSOFT/dosundoc.txt A Collection of Undocumented and Obscure Features in Various MS-DOS Versions]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Dos Commands}}\n[[Category:DOS commands]]\n[[Category:Microsoft lists|DOS commands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nThis article presents a list of commands used by [[DOS]] [[operating system]]s, especially as used on [[x86]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s (PCs). [[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.\n\nIn DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Command processing==\nThe command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal \u2014 built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.\n\nExternal commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.\n\nIn the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''<kbd>[[filespec]]</kbd>'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''<kbd>filename</kbd>'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a \"/\" or a \"-\" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.\n\nThe command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.\n\nMany commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.\n\n==DOS commands==\nA partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] follows below.\n\n===APPEND===\nSets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. \nThe APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\n===ASSIGN===\n{{Further|Drive letter assignment}}\nThe command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 2 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ATTRIB===\n{{Main|ATTRIB}}\nAttrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files and also process all files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BACKUP and RESTORE===\nThese are commands to [[backup]] and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BASIC and BASICA===\n{{Main|IBM BASIC}}\n\nAn implementation of the [[BASIC]] programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.\n\n[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.\n\nMicrosoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.\n\nBASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.\n\n===BREAK===\nThis command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the {{Keypress|Ctrl}} and {{Keypress|Break}} keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CALL===\n{{See also|start (command)}}\nStarts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CD and CHDIR===\n{{Main|cd (command)}}\n\nThe CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHCP===\nThe command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHKDSK===\n{{Main|CHKDSK}}\n\nCHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity. The command has the ability to fix errors on a volume and recover information from defective [[disk sector]]s of a volume.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHOICE===\n{{Main|choice (command)}}\n\nThe CHOICE command is used in batch files to prompt the user to select one item from a set of single-character ''choices''. Choice was introduced as an external command with MS-DOS 6.0;<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/choicehl.htm|title=MS-DOS choice command help|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> [[Novell DOS]] 7<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/usergeng/07ugch7.htm|title=Caldera DR-DOS 7.03 User Guide|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> and PC DOS 7.0. Earlier versions of [[DR DOS]] supported this function with the built-in ''switch'' command (for numeric choices) or by beginning a command with a question mark.<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\" /> This command was formerly called ync (yes-no-cancel).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===CLS===\n{{Main|cls (command)}}\n\nThe CLS or CLRSCR command clears the [[Computer terminal|terminal screen]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMMAND===\n{{Main|COMMAND.COM}}\n\nStart a new instance of the command interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMP===\n{{Main|comp (command)}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 1 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COPY===\n{{Main|copy (command)}}\n\nMakes copies of existing files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CTTY===\nDefines the [[Computer terminal|terminal]] device (for example, COM1) to use for input and output.<ref> Does not automatically appear in Help </ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n\n===DATE===\nDisplays the [[system date]] and prompts the user to enter a new date. Complements the [[#TIME|TIME]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DBLBOOT===\n(Not a command: This is a batch file added to DOS 6.X Supplemental Disks to help create DoubleSpace boot floppies - see https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/100/Q100021/)\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n===DBLSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.0 (released in 1993) and version 6.2.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DEBUG===\n{{Main|debug (command)}}\n\nA very primitive assembler and disassambler.\n\n===DEFRAG===\n{{Main|Microsoft Drive Optimizer}}\n\nThe command has the ability to analyze the file fragmentation on a disk drive or to [[Defragmentation|defragment]] a drive. This command is called DEFRAG in MS-DOS/PC DOS and <kbd>diskopt</kbd> in [[DR-DOS]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DEL and ERASE===\n{{Main|del (command)}}\n\nDEL (or the alternative form ERASE) is used to delete one or more files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DELTREE===\n{{Main|DELTREE}}\n\nDeletes a directory along with all of the files and subdirectories that it contains. Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty, the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.\n\nThe <code>deltree</code> command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s.  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.\n\n===DIR===\n{{Main|dir (command)}}\n\nThe DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk. The command is one of the few commands that exist from the first versions of DOS.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> The command can display files in subdirectories. The resulting directory listing can be sorted by various criteria and filenames can be displayed in a chosen format.\n\n===DISKCOMP===\n{{Main|diskcomp}}\n\nA command for comparing the complete contents of a [[floppy disk]] to another one.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DISKCOPY===\n{{Main|diskcopy}}\n\nA command for copying the complete contents of a diskette to another diskette.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DOSKEY===\n{{Main|DOSKEY}}\n\nA command that adds [[command history]], [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] functionality, and improved editing features to the command-line interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DRVSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.22.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ECHO===\n{{Main|echo (command)}}\n\nThe ECHO command prints its own arguments back out to the DOS equivalent of the [[Standard streams|standard output stream.]] (Hence the name, ECHO) Usually, this means directly to the screen, but the output of ''echo'' can be redirected, like any other command, to files or devices. Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.\n\nAnother important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the <code>@echo off</code> statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a \"tidier\" output (the <code>@</code> symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EDIT===\n{{Main|MS-DOS Editor}}\n\nEDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the [[E (PC DOS)|DOS ''E'' Editor]] and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.\n\n===EDLIN===\n{{Main|Edlin}}\n\nDOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.\n\nIn DOS 5, an extra command \"?\" was added to give the user much-needed help.\n\nDOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install. Windows NT 32-bit, and OS/2 have Edlin.\n\n===EMM386===\n{{Main|EMM386}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe EMM386 command enables or disables EMM386 expanded-memory support on a computer with an [[80386]] or higher processor. \n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== ERASE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#DEL and ERASE|DEL and ERASE]]\n\n===EXE2BIN===\n{{Main|exe2bin}}\n\nConverts an [[executable]] ([[.exe]]) file into a [[binary file]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] [[COM file|.com]], which is a memory image of the program.\n\nThe size of the resident [[Code segment|code]] and [[Data segment|data sections]] combined in the input .exe file must be less than 64 KB. The file must also have no [[Call stack|stack segment]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 through 5. It is available separately for version 6 on the Supplemental Disk.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EXIT===\n{{Main|exit (command)}}\n\nExits the current command processor.

This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = [[Que Publishing]] | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in [[MS-DOS 7]] ([[Windows 95]]); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft's FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools. \n\nPC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.

For example, if <kbd>PATH</kbd> includes <kbd>C:\\PROGRAMS</kbd>, and file <kbd>MYPROG.EXE</kbd> is on this directory, then if <code>MYPROG</code> is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute <code>C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE</code>. In this case,\n\n TRUENAME MYPROG\n\nwould display\n\n C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE\n\nThis command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch \"<kbd>/?</kbd>\" defines it as a \"Reserved command name\". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the [[which (command)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name.

Together with [[Alfred Ewing|Sir Alfred Ewing]] he was responsible for the establishment of the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] [[codebreaking]] operation, [[Room 40]], which decoded the [[Zimmermann telegram]], a major factor in the entry of the United States in [[World War I]].\n\n==Royal Navy career==\nReginald Hall was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, eldest son of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[William Henry Hall]], the first head of Naval Intelligence, who married the daughter of the reverend George Armfield from Armley, Leeds.  Hall decided on a naval career for himself when taken on a cruise on board {{HMS|Flamingo|1876|6}} by his father. He joined the training ship [[Britannia Royal Naval College|HMS ''Britannia'']] in 1884 and two years later was appointed to the armoured cruiser  [[HMS Northampton (1876)|''Northampton'']]. After a year he was transferred to the ironclad battleship [[HMS Bellerophon (1865)|''Bellerophon'']] which was part of the [[North America and West Indies Station|North American Station]]. In 1889 he became acting sub-lieutenant before attending courses for his Lieutenants examinations at Greenwich, the gunnery school and torpedo school where he achieved first class grades in all five of the subjects. Now as Lieutenant he was posted to the [[China Station]] where he served on the flagship, the armoured cruiser  [[HMS Imperieuse (1883)|''Imperieuse'']]. In 1892 he was recommended to train as a gunnery officer, which involved a course in mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], followed by a year's course at the gunnery school at [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], a shore establishment at [[Whale Island, Hampshire|Whale Island]], Portsmouth. Having qualified, he remained for a year on the staff.<ref>James p. 2-5</ref>\n\nIn 1894 Hall married Ethel Wootton de Wiveslie Abney, daughter of Sir William.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=William Milbourne|title=The code breakers of Room 40: the story of Admiral Sir William Hall, genius of British counter-intelligence|year=1956|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc4DAAAAMAAJ&q=Ethel+de+Wiveslie&dq=Ethel+de+Wiveslie&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tIEJUc6NEIKThge5m4CoDw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA|edition=Reprint|authorlink=William Milbourne James|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>  The engagement had begun when he was aged 19, five years before, but at the time this was still considered a young age for a naval officer to get married. In 1895 he was appointed as gunnery lieutenant on the cruiser [[HMS Australia (1886)|''Australia'']] where he served for two years before being appointed to the senior staff at Whale Island.  He was promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] 1 January 1901, in recognition of services with naval forces in South Africa,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27263 |date=4 January 1901 |page=82 }}</ref> and later served on the battleship [[HMS Magnificent (1894)|''Magnificent'']], flagship of the second in command of the [[Channel Fleet]].<ref>James p.5</ref>\n\nIn 1904 he became commander of the [[predreadnought]] battleship [[HMS Cornwallis (1901)|''Cornwallis'']] which was commissioning with a new crew to operate in the Mediterranean. Hall had a reputation  as a strict disciplinarian with an ability to get the best out of a crew, so he was given some of the worst sailors to bring up to scratch. A trick of disaffected sailors was to remove gunsights and throw them overboard, and indeed this happened. Hall instructed the master at arms to look out for two sailors who had previously been friends but who now avoided each other. He took one, told him that the other had confessed they had removed the sights, and the sailor duly confessed. Behaviour on board improved. Although Hall imposed discipline strictly, he also showed concern for the men he commanded and for their welfare, which was unusual for that time. He took particular care for the boys and junior seamen.<ref>James p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn December 1905 he was promoted to Captain and appointed by the First Sea Lord, Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]] as Inspecting Captain of the new Mechanical Training Establishments, which Fisher had established to give engineering training to ordinary sailors (1906-7). He was next appointed  captain of the cadet training ship [[HMS Wellesley (1815)|HMS ''Cornwall'']]. Although not a conventional warship, this now involved Hall in intelligence work. The ship visited foreign ports, particularly in Germany which was now seen as the navy's greatest potential enemy, and Hall started the tour with a long list of places to investigate. In Kiel he was tasked with discovering how many slips had been constructed for building large vessels. To do this he devised a ruse with the help of the Duke of Westminster, who was visiting the port and agreed to lend his motor boat for the task. Hall and a couple of officers dressed down as sailors and took the yacht on a full speed circuit of the harbour, pretending to break down by the naval dockyard. A concealed camera was then used to take photographs of the installations. More information was discovered by careful questions ashore.<ref>James p.7-8</ref>\n\nIn 1910 two officers, Lieutenant Brandon and Captain Trench, who had been part of Hall's crew gathering intelligence were sent on  a 'holiday' in Germany to collect information about coastal defences by Captain Regnart of the intelligence division. The two were captured and served two and a half years of a four-year sentence, before being pardoned in May 1913 as part of a visit by King [[George V]] to Germany. The admiralty then denied any responsibility for what had happened to the pair and their considerable financial loss as a result. When appointed director of intelligence, Hall arranged for them to be compensated.<ref>James p.8</ref>\n\nHall was appointed to  the armoured cruiser [[HMS Natal (1905)|''Natal'']] following the death of her captain, F.C.A. Ogilvy. Ogilvy had obtained a high reputation for his ship  which had beaten all records at gunnery but Hall managed to step into Ogilvy's place, retaining the confidence of the crew and bettering the gunnery record the following year. His reputation for unorthodox treatment of his men continued to grow, making it his business to reform recalcitrant sailors rather than simply punishing them. He had the knack of threatening men with punishments he could not deliver (such as dismissal from the service) if they did not reform, and succeeded. ''Natal'' was called upon to assist  a sailing ship, the ''Celtic Race'', which had lost most of her sails in a storm and was in danger of sinking. Despite the risk to his own ship, he escorted ''Celtic Race'' into Milford Haven. He was rewarded by the owners and underwriters, being presented with a silver table centrepiece by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool on their behalf.<ref>James p.10-14</ref>\n\nFrom 1911 to 1913 he served as assistant to the [[Third Sea Lord|Controller]] of the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1913 he became captain of the [[battle cruiser]] [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]. When he took over he was asked to take part in an experiment by the admiralty to dispense with ships police, transferring their duties to petty officers. He also introduced an innovation of his own, to divide the ship's crew into three watches rather than the customary two. Hall believed that in the war with Germany which he expected, it would be impossible to run a ship continuously with just two watches. The change attracted much ridicule but when war came it was adopted on all large ships. A religious man, he arranged that a chapel was provided on board the ship, and this innovation too was adopted generally. He felt it important that the authority of petty officers should be  boosted, and he did this by improving their quarters. He arranged for washing machines on board, for the convenience of the officers who no longer had to pay for laundry ashore, and to the benefit of sailors who were 'tipped' to carry out the washing. He introduced a bookstore on board, and the navy's first shipboard cinema. Inadequacies in the water supply meant that it took an hour for all the stokers to finish washing after duty.  Hall insisted that his engineers find a solution to provide enough hot water that they could all wash in 15 minutes, giving them more free time. These changes too became standard. Hall was criticised for being too soft with his crews, but his requirements for discipline were not relaxed. Rather, he believed that reward was necessary as well as punishment. Living conditions in society were improving generally and he believed the navy must keep pace with standards ashore.<ref>James p. 14-18</ref>\n\n''Queen Mary'' took part in the battlecruiser squadron's visit to [[Cronstadt]], where the fleet officers and sailors were entertained by the Russian royal family, and a lavish ball was held on board ship as the culmination of the visit. It was the last such visit before World War I commenced and the battlecruisers transferred to their initial wartime base at [[Scapa Flow]]. Ships spent large amounts of time at sea, before the strategic situation became clearer and the fear of immediate German raids diminished. ''Queen Mary'' took part in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]], where the battlecruisers were called upon to support a raid by destroyers and cruisers against German patrol ships operating off Heligoland. The raid was hailed as a British success, although behind the scenes it was marred by poor communications between the British forces involved.<ref>James p. 20</ref>\n\nHall's health had deteriorated under the stress of continuous sea service, and after three months matters had reached the point where he was obliged to request posting away from the ship.\n\n==Director of the Intelligence Divisions==\nHis seagoing career cut short by ill-health, Hall was appointed [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of the Intelligence Division]] (DID) by the [[Admiralty]] in October 1914, replacing Captain [[Henry Oliver]].

Together with [[Alfred Ewing|Sir Alfred Ewing]] he was responsible for the establishment of the [[Royal Navy|Royal Navy's]] [[codebreaking]] operation, [[Room 40]], which decoded the [[Zimmermann telegram]], a major factor in the entry of the United States in [[World War I]].\n\n==Royal Navy career==\nReginald Hall was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, eldest son of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[William Henry Hall]], the first head of Naval Intelligence, who married the daughter of the reverend George Armfield from Armley, Leeds.  Hall decided on a naval career for himself when taken on a cruise on board {{HMS|Flamingo|1876|6}} by his father. He joined the training ship [[Britannia Royal Naval College|HMS ''Britannia'']] in 1884 and two years later was appointed to the armoured cruiser  [[HMS Northampton (1876)|''Northampton'']]. After a year he was transferred to the ironclad battleship [[HMS Bellerophon (1865)|''Bellerophon'']] which was part of the [[North America and West Indies Station|North American Station]]. In 1889 he became acting sub-lieutenant before attending courses for his Lieutenants examinations at Greenwich, the gunnery school and torpedo school where he achieved first class grades in all five of the subjects. Now as Lieutenant he was posted to the [[China Station]] where he served on the flagship, the armoured cruiser  [[HMS Imperieuse (1883)|''Imperieuse'']]. In 1892 he was recommended to train as a gunnery officer, which involved a course in mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], followed by a year's course at the gunnery school at [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], a shore establishment at [[Whale Island, Hampshire|Whale Island]], Portsmouth. Having qualified, he remained for a year on the staff.<ref>James p. 2-5</ref>\n\nIn 1894 Hall married Ethel de Wiveslie Abbey, daughter of Sir William.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=William Milbourne|title=The code breakers of Room 40: the story of Admiral Sir William Hall, genius of British counter-intelligence|year=1956|publisher=St. Martin's Press|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc4DAAAAMAAJ&q=Ethel+de+Wiveslie&dq=Ethel+de+Wiveslie&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tIEJUc6NEIKThge5m4CoDw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA|edition=Reprint|authorlink=William Milbourne James|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>  The engagement had begun when he was aged 19, five years before, but at the time this was still considered a young age for a naval officer to get married. In 1895 he was appointed as gunnery lieutenant on the cruiser [[HMS Australia (1886)|''Australia'']] where he served for two years before being appointed to the senior staff at Whale Island.  He was promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] 1 January 1901, in recognition of services with naval forces in South Africa,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27263 |date=4 January 1901 |page=82 }}</ref> and later served on the battleship [[HMS Magnificent (1894)|''Magnificent'']], flagship of the second in command of the [[Channel Fleet]].<ref>James p.5</ref>\n\nIn 1904 he became commander of the [[predreadnought]] battleship [[HMS Cornwallis (1901)|''Cornwallis'']] which was commissioning with a new crew to operate in the Mediterranean. Hall had a reputation  as a strict disciplinarian with an ability to get the best out of a crew, so he was given some of the worst sailors to bring up to scratch. A trick of disaffected sailors was to remove gunsights and throw them overboard, and indeed this happened. Hall instructed the master at arms to look out for two sailors who had previously been friends but who now avoided each other. He took one, told him that the other had confessed they had removed the sights, and the sailor duly confessed. Behaviour on board improved. Although Hall imposed discipline strictly, he also showed concern for the men he commanded and for their welfare, which was unusual for that time. He took particular care for the boys and junior seamen.<ref>James p. 5-6</ref>\n\nIn December 1905 he was promoted to Captain and appointed by the First Sea Lord, Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]] as Inspecting Captain of the new Mechanical Training Establishments, which Fisher had established to give engineering training to ordinary sailors (1906-7). He was next appointed  captain of the cadet training ship [[HMS Wellesley (1815)|HMS ''Cornwall'']]. Although not a conventional warship, this now involved Hall in intelligence work. The ship visited foreign ports, particularly in Germany which was now seen as the navy's greatest potential enemy, and Hall started the tour with a long list of places to investigate. In Kiel he was tasked with discovering how many slips had been constructed for building large vessels. To do this he devised a ruse with the help of the Duke of Westminster, who was visiting the port and agreed to lend his motor boat for the task. Hall and a couple of officers dressed down as sailors and took the yacht on a full speed circuit of the harbour, pretending to break down by the naval dockyard. A concealed camera was then used to take photographs of the installations. More information was discovered by careful questions ashore.<ref>James p.7-8</ref>\n\nIn 1910 two officers, Lieutenant Brandon and Captain Trench, who had been part of Hall's crew gathering intelligence were sent on  a 'holiday' in Germany to collect information about coastal defences by Captain Regnart of the intelligence division. The two were captured and served two and a half years of a four-year sentence, before being pardoned in May 1913 as part of a visit by King [[George V]] to Germany. The admiralty then denied any responsibility for what had happened to the pair and their considerable financial loss as a result. When appointed director of intelligence, Hall arranged for them to be compensated.<ref>James p.8</ref>\n\nHall was appointed to  the armoured cruiser [[HMS Natal (1905)|''Natal'']] following the death of her captain, F.C.A. Ogilvy. Ogilvy had obtained a high reputation for his ship  which had beaten all records at gunnery but Hall managed to step into Ogilvy's place, retaining the confidence of the crew and bettering the gunnery record the following year. His reputation for unorthodox treatment of his men continued to grow, making it his business to reform recalcitrant sailors rather than simply punishing them. He had the knack of threatening men with punishments he could not deliver (such as dismissal from the service) if they did not reform, and succeeded. ''Natal'' was called upon to assist  a sailing ship, the ''Celtic Race'', which had lost most of her sails in a storm and was in danger of sinking. Despite the risk to his own ship, he escorted ''Celtic Race'' into Milford Haven. He was rewarded by the owners and underwriters, being presented with a silver table centrepiece by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool on their behalf.<ref>James p.10-14</ref>\n\nFrom 1911 to 1913 he served as assistant to the [[Third Sea Lord|Controller]] of the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1913 he became captain of the [[battle cruiser]] [[HMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']]. When he took over he was asked to take part in an experiment by the admiralty to dispense with ships police, transferring their duties to petty officers. He also introduced an innovation of his own, to divide the ship's crew into three watches rather than the customary two. Hall believed that in the war with Germany which he expected, it would be impossible to run a ship continuously with just two watches. The change attracted much ridicule but when war came it was adopted on all large ships. A religious man, he arranged that a chapel was provided on board the ship, and this innovation too was adopted generally. He felt it important that the authority of petty officers should be  boosted, and he did this by improving their quarters. He arranged for washing machines on board, for the convenience of the officers who no longer had to pay for laundry ashore, and to the benefit of sailors who were 'tipped' to carry out the washing. He introduced a bookstore on board, and the navy's first shipboard cinema. Inadequacies in the water supply meant that it took an hour for all the stokers to finish washing after duty.  Hall insisted that his engineers find a solution to provide enough hot water that they could all wash in 15 minutes, giving them more free time. These changes too became standard. Hall was criticised for being too soft with his crews, but his requirements for discipline were not relaxed. Rather, he believed that reward was necessary as well as punishment. Living conditions in society were improving generally and he believed the navy must keep pace with standards ashore.<ref>James p. 14-18</ref>\n\n''Queen Mary'' took part in the battlecruiser squadron's visit to [[Cronstadt]], where the fleet officers and sailors were entertained by the Russian royal family, and a lavish ball was held on board ship as the culmination of the visit. It was the last such visit before World War I commenced and the battlecruisers transferred to their initial wartime base at [[Scapa Flow]]. Ships spent large amounts of time at sea, before the strategic situation became clearer and the fear of immediate German raids diminished. ''Queen Mary'' took part in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]], where the battlecruisers were called upon to support a raid by destroyers and cruisers against German patrol ships operating off Heligoland. The raid was hailed as a British success, although behind the scenes it was marred by poor communications between the British forces involved.<ref>James p. 20</ref>\n\nHall's health had deteriorated under the stress of continuous sea service, and after three months matters had reached the point where he was obliged to request posting away from the ship.\n\n==Director of the Intelligence Divisions==\nHis seagoing career cut short by ill-health, Hall was appointed [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of the Intelligence Division]] (DID) by the [[Admiralty]] in October 1914, replacing Captain [[Henry Oliver]].  According to Oliver, Hall's wife wrote to him on behalf of her husband requesting that he replace Oliver in the Intelligence Division.<ref>{{cite book |title=Room 40 |last=Beesly |page=36 }}</ref>  Hall served as DID (the title eventually reverted to the pre-1911 \"DNI\") until January 1919 when he retired from active duty.

Today, such a twitch is also thought to be symptomatic of a mild form of [[Dyspraxia]].\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* [[Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]]\n* [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]]\n* [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star]] (Japan)\n* Commander of the [[Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazarus]] (Italy)<ref name=nhlg>{{cite web | last = Smith\n | first = Gordon \n | authorlink = \n | coauthors = \n | title = FOREIGN DECORATIONS AWARDED TO ROYAL NAVY, London Gazette editions January 1918-December 1920\n | work = Naval-History.Net\n | publisher = \n | date = 29 December 2010\n | url = http://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritishLGDecorations1918Foreign.htm\n | doi = \n | accessdate =1 July 2011 }}\n</ref>\n* Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] (France)<ref name=nhlg />\n* [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]]<ref name=nhlg />\n* Grand Officer of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]]<ref name=nhlg />\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book |last=Andrew |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Andrew (historian) |title=Her Majesty's Secret Service: The Making of the British Intelligence Community |year=1986 |publisher=Viking |location=New York |isbn=0-670-80941-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hermajestyssecre00andr }}\n*{{cite book |last=Beesly |first=Patrick |title=Room 40: British Naval Intelligence 1914\u20131918 |year=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=London |isbn=0-19-281468-0 }}\n*{{cite book |last=James |first=Admiral Sir William |title=The Eyes of the Navy: A Biographical Study of Admiral Sir Reginald Hall |url=https://archive.org/details/eyesofnavybiogra0000jame |url-access=registration |year=1955 |publisher=Methuen & Co. |location=London }}\n*{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first=David |title='Blinker' Hall: Spymaster: The Man who Brought America into World War I |year=2008 |publisher=The History Press |location=Stroud |isbn=1-86227-465-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/blinkerhallspyma0000rams }}\n*{{cite book|title=A Clear Case of Genius: Admiral Sir Reginald 'Blinker' Hall's Autobiography'|year=2017|publisher=The History Press|location=Stroud}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0014%2FHALL The Papers of William Reginald Hall] are held at [[Churchill Archives Centre]] in Cambridge and are accessible to the public.\n* {{DP-xlink|http://dreadnoughtproject.org/tfs/index.php/William_Reginald_Hall}}\n*[http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/hall.htm First World War.com - ''Who's Who'' entry]\n* {{Hansard-contribs | admiral-sir-william-hall | Sir William Hall }}\n* {{Rayment-hc|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Henry Oliver]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of Naval Intelligence]]|years=1914\u20131919}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Hugh Sinclair]]}}\n|-\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{succession box\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Liverpool West Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool West Derby]]\n  | years  = [[1919 Liverpool West Derby by-election|1919]]\u2013[[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923]]\n  | before = Sir [[F.

Inspired by a plastic toy made in [[Hong Kong]],<ref name=\"hongkong\">[[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]], \"Ecology of the Rust Monster.\" ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #88 (TSR, 1984).

''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Supplement I: Greyhawk]]'' (TSR, 1975)</ref> the creature has since appeared in every subsequent [[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons|edition]] of the game. Owlbears, or similar beasts, also appear in several other fantasy role-playing games, video games and other media.\n\n==Creation==\nIn the early 1970s, [[Gary Gygax]] was playing ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a wargame that bore some precursors of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. In order to give his players as many different challenges as possible, Gygax was always on the look-out for new monsters. Although he was able to draw on [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] and [[sword and sorcery]] stories for many of them, he also looked through [[dime stores]] for figurines that could be used in battle. On one of those occasions, he came across a bag of small plastic toys euphemistically labeled \"prehistoric animals\". Made in [[Hong Kong]], the set included monsters from [[Japan]]ese \"[[Kaiju]]\" films such as [[Ultraman]] and the [[Godzilla]] franchise. Several of these were odd enough to catch his eye, and he used them to represent several new monsters, including the owlbear, the [[bulette]] and the [[rust monster]].<ref>Gygax: \"There was a set of plastic toys laughlingly labelled as dinosaurs [if I remember right]. I frequented the local dime stores back in the late 60s and early 70s searching for toys that would suit tabletop fantasy gaming. The said bag contained three we incorporated\u2014the bulette, the owl bear, and the rust monster.\"{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part I, Page 8) | publisher = EN World | date = 2002-09-06 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/167680-gary-gygax-q-part-xi-13.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe owlbear is depicted as an eight to ten foot (2.5\u20133 meter) tall cross between a [[bear]] and an [[owl]].

In the game's third edition, it was categorized as a \"[[Magical beast (Dungeons & Dragons)|magical beast]]\".\n\nThe actual in-game origin of the owlbear has never been definitively revealed, but the various ''[[Monster Manual]]'' editions indicate that it is probably the product of a wizard's experiments. Within the franchise's mythology, the [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]] Thessalar claims to have created them, but his insanity and egomania put the accuracy of this claim in doubt.<ref>[[James Jacobs (game designer)|Jacobs, James]]. \"Into the Wormcrawl Fissure.\" Dungeon #134 (Pazio Publishing, 2006)</ref> In the 5th edition, some [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]] claim that owlbears have existed for millennia and older [[Fey (Dungeons & Dragons)|fey]] say that they have always existed in the [[Feywild]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Dungeons and Dragons 5E Monster Manual|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=249|via=}}</ref>\n\nWithin the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' system and in other [[role-playing game]]s, the owlbear usually serves as a \"monster\". Within the context of [[Role-playing game|RPG]]s, \"monster\" is a generic term to describe potentially hostile beings and obstacles for the players to overcome.<ref>Slavicsek, Bill and Richard Baker.

Owlbears, or similar beasts, also appear in several other fantasy role-playing games, video games and other media.\n\n==Creation==\nIn the early 1970s, [[Gary Gygax]] was playing ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'', a wargame that bore some precursors of ''Dungeons & Dragons''. In order to give his players as many different challenges as possible, Gygax was always on the look-out for new monsters. Although he was able to draw on [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] and [[sword and sorcery]] stories for many of them, he also looked through [[dime stores]] for figurines that could be used in battle. On one of those occasions, he came across a bag of small plastic toys euphemistically labeled \"prehistoric animals\". Made in [[Hong Kong]], the set included monsters from [[Japan]]ese \"[[Kaiju]]\" films such as [[Ultraman]] and the [[Godzilla]] franchise. Several of these were odd enough to catch his eye, and he used them to represent several new monsters, including the owlbear, the [[bulette]] and the [[rust monster]].<ref>Gygax: \"There was a set of plastic toys laughlingly labelled as dinosaurs [if I remember right]. I frequented the local dime stores back in the late 60s and early 70s searching for toys that would suit tabletop fantasy gaming. The said bag contained three we incorporated\u2014the bulette, the owl bear, and the rust monster.\"{{cite web | title = Gary Gygax: Q & A (Part I, Page 8) | publisher = EN World | date = 2002-09-06 | url = http://www.enworld.org/forum/archive-threads/167680-gary-gygax-q-part-xi-13.html | accessdate = 2009-03-15}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe owlbear is depicted as an eight to ten foot (2.5\u20133 meter) tall cross between a [[bear]] and an [[owl]].

In the game's third edition, it was categorized as a \"[[Magical beast (Dungeons & Dragons)|magical beast]]\".\n\nThe actual in-game origin of the owlbear has never been definitively revealed, but the various ''[[Monster Manual]]'' editions indicate that it is probably the product of a wizard's experiments. Within the franchise's mythology, the [[Lich (Dungeons & Dragons)|lich]] Thessalar claims to have created them, but his insanity and egomania put the accuracy of this claim in doubt.<ref>[[James Jacobs (game designer)|Jacobs, James]]. \"Into the Wormcrawl Fissure.\" Dungeon #134 (Pazio Publishing, 2006)</ref> In the 5th edition, some [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elves]] claim that owlbears have existed for millennia and older [[Fey (Dungeons & Dragons)|fey]] say that they have always existed in the [[Feywild]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Dungeons and Dragons 5E Monster Manual|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=249|via=}}</ref>\n\nWithin the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' system and in other [[role-playing game]]s, the owlbear usually serves as a \"monster\".

Both of his parents were teachers.\n\n==Stand-up performance==\n\nNoble's stand-up routine is a largely improvised and surreal performance with a [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] delivery. He is often referred to as a randomist. Often, a large percentage of his set becomes based around [[heckle]]s and conversations with members of the audience.<ref name=\"wiltshire\" /><ref name=\"biog\">{{cite web\n |title=Biography \n |url=http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/biography.html \n |author=Ross Noble \n |accessdate=2 December 2006 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201174831/http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/biography.html \n |archivedate= 1 December 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Although he does often have a few set topics which he performs throughout a tour, he describes the planning for the entire show as \"about four words on a piece of scrap paper\".<ref name=\"interview20061106\">[http://rossnoble.co.uk/downloads/2006.11.06%20Live%20on%20BBC%20Radio%201,%20UK.mp3 Ross Noble interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810152234/http://rossnoble.co.uk/downloads/2006.11.06%20Live%20on%20BBC%20Radio%201%2C%20UK.mp3 |date=10 August 2007 }}, [[Jo Whiley]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] on 6 November 2006</ref>\n\nNoble often [[mime]]s actions on-stage to help the audience visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is (\"just a stick with a pointy bit on it\") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' in which [[Jack Bauer]] escapes a cell using a greasy [[goose]].<ref name=\"unrealtime garrick\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Garrick Theatre, London | date =  11 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nNoble's style is recognised as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal tangent. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask a member of the audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about the routine, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded at the end of his shows. His most famous example is in his ''Randomist'' tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after [[Live 8]] near the beginning of a show in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later.<ref name=\"randomist newcastle\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = The City Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne | date =  6 November 2006}}</ref> This relates to an earlier comment he made in his ''Regent's Park'' show, saying that his mind \"Tends to wander off [the point] slightly\", and later added that \"[he] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities.\"<ref name=\"unrealtime regents\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Open-Air Theatre, Regent's Park, London | date =  11 October 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nNoble is originally from [[Cramlington]], [[Northumberland]], England. \"The ultimate place to live\" helped him with his career\u2014he found little to do in his hometown so he became particularly imaginative.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/theatre/2003/11/ross_noble_interview.shtml | title = The Noble art of stand-up | accessdate = 27 September 2006 | publisher = BBC}}</ref> At the age of 11, it was discovered that he was [[dyslexic]]. Because of this, Noble decided to work within a career which did not rely on academic skills. He had a brief stint as a street juggler with a friend, and aspired to join a circus. He joined a clown troupe and sold balloons as a stilt-walker, before deciding to become a comedian after winning tickets to a comedy show.<ref name=\"age dyslexia\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Arts/A-noble-comic/2005/03/18/1110913752482.html|title=Here's one I didn't prepare earlier|publisher=[[The Age]]|author=Luke Benedictus|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=3 January 2007}}</ref> As a teenager, Ross was a member of the youth theatre at the [[People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne|People's Theatre]] in [[Heaton, Newcastle]]. In 1997, he was doing warm-ups at the BBC for ''[[Friday Night Armistice]]''.\n\nNoble has been performing stand-up since the dyslexia diagnosis, and appeared in his local comedy club at the age of 15, despite licensing laws that prohibited him working there and forced him to leave through the kitchen.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Noble studied [[performing arts]] at [[Newcastle College]], after he told his careers adviser at school he wanted to be a [[comedian]]. He later stated that this had no effect on his stand-up ability, as he believes that the information taught is not important in being a good performer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/stage/2003/01/ross_noble2.shtml | title = BBC \u2013 South Yorkshire Stage \u2013 Ross Noble interview | accessdate = 1 December 2006 | publisher = BBC}}</ref>\n\n===Stand-up career===\nSince starting as a stand-up comedian, Noble has won many awards, including a ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' award winner in 2000 for his [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] show ''Chickenmaster'', and a [[Perrier Comedy Award|Perrier Award]] nomination in 1999 for another Edinburgh show ''Laser Boy''. He has since achieved great popularity in both the UK and Australia, where he has toured extensively every year since 2001. Noble's 2003 show ''Unrealtime'' was the best-selling show at the Edinburgh Fringe,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3179241.stm | title = Fringe passes million tickets mark | accessdate = 6 November 2006 |date= 25 August 2003 | publisher = BBC News}}</ref> before transferring to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] for a monthlong season at the [[Garrick Theatre]] where it played to packed houses. A recording of this tour was shown on [[BBC Two]] in 2004, and a double-DVD set was released later that year.\n\nDuring 2004, Noble performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] and the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and other venues with his show ''Noodlemeister''. His 2005 UK tour, ''Randomist'', ran from September to December, of which he continued in Australia during 2006. In April 2006, Noble was involved in a [[motorbike]] accident, and both fractured and dislocated his collarbone. Conveniently, he crashed right outside a hospital. Noble performed his shows over the following weeks with his arm in a sling.<ref name=\"randomist australia\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist, Australia Tour | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Australia | date =  6 November 2006}}</ref> During his 'Things' tour, in [[Bristol]] on 1 March 2009, he claimed that before the ambulance officers would help him, he was forced to do his [[Stephen Hawking]] impression.\n\nWhilst performing in Edinburgh in September 2006 for his ''Fizzy Logic'' tour, a fight broke out during the gig, caused by a drunken member of the audience arguing with another. Also, in his Edinburgh gig, some one gave him a basket of mini-muffins with faces printed on them; this is related to a sketch from Noble's DVD ''Sonic Waffle'', in which he mentions his hobby of finding faces in muffins.<ref name=\"nemone\">Ross Noble interview, [[Nemone]] on [[BBC 6 Music]] (27 September 2006)</ref> At another gig, he found someone filming the show on their [[mobile phone]] and confiscated the phone.

Often, a large percentage of his set becomes based around [[heckle]]s and conversations with members of the audience.<ref name=\"wiltshire\" /><ref name=\"biog\">{{cite web\n |title=Biography \n |url=http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/biography.html \n |author=Ross Noble \n |accessdate=2 December 2006 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201174831/http://www.rossnoble.co.uk/biography.html \n |archivedate= 1 December 2006 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref> Although he does often have a few set topics which he performs throughout a tour, he describes the planning for the entire show as \"about four words on a piece of scrap paper\".<ref name=\"interview20061106\">[http://rossnoble.co.uk/downloads/2006.11.06%20Live%20on%20BBC%20Radio%201,%20UK.mp3 Ross Noble interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810152234/http://rossnoble.co.uk/downloads/2006.11.06%20Live%20on%20BBC%20Radio%201%2C%20UK.mp3 |date=10 August 2007 }}, [[Jo Whiley]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] on 6 November 2006</ref>\n\nNoble often [[mime]]s actions on-stage to help the audience visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is (\"just a stick with a pointy bit on it\") or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' in which [[Jack Bauer]] escapes a cell using a greasy [[goose]].<ref name=\"unrealtime garrick\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Garrick Theatre, London | date =  11 October 2004}}</ref>\n\nNoble's style is recognised as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal tangent. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask a member of the audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about the routine, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded at the end of his shows. His most famous example is in his ''Randomist'' tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after [[Live 8]] near the beginning of a show in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later.<ref name=\"randomist newcastle\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = The City Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne | date =  6 November 2006}}</ref> This relates to an earlier comment he made in his ''Regent's Park'' show, saying that his mind \"Tends to wander off [the point] slightly\", and later added that \"[he] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities.\"<ref name=\"unrealtime regents\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Unrealtime | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Open-Air Theatre, Regent's Park, London | date =  11 October 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years===\nNoble is originally from [[Cramlington]], [[Northumberland]], England. \"The ultimate place to live\" helped him with his career\u2014he found little to do in his hometown so he became particularly imaginative.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/theatre/2003/11/ross_noble_interview.shtml | title = The Noble art of stand-up | accessdate = 27 September 2006 | publisher = BBC}}</ref> At the age of 11, it was discovered that he was [[dyslexic]]. Because of this, Noble decided to work within a career which did not rely on academic skills. He had a brief stint as a street juggler with a friend, and aspired to join a circus. He joined a clown troupe and sold balloons as a stilt-walker, before deciding to become a comedian after winning tickets to a comedy show.<ref name=\"age dyslexia\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Arts/A-noble-comic/2005/03/18/1110913752482.html|title=Here's one I didn't prepare earlier|publisher=[[The Age]]|author=Luke Benedictus|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=3 January 2007}}</ref> As a teenager, Ross was a member of the youth theatre at the [[People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne|People's Theatre]] in [[Heaton, Newcastle]]. In 1997, he was doing warm-ups at the BBC for ''[[Friday Night Armistice]]''.\n\nNoble has been performing stand-up since the dyslexia diagnosis, and appeared in his local comedy club at the age of 15, despite licensing laws that prohibited him working there and forced him to leave through the kitchen.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Noble studied [[performing arts]] at [[Newcastle College]], after he told his careers adviser at school he wanted to be a [[comedian]]. He later stated that this had no effect on his stand-up ability, as he believes that the information taught is not important in being a good performer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/stage/2003/01/ross_noble2.shtml | title = BBC \u2013 South Yorkshire Stage \u2013 Ross Noble interview | accessdate = 1 December 2006 | publisher = BBC}}</ref>\n\n===Stand-up career===\nSince starting as a stand-up comedian, Noble has won many awards, including a ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' award winner in 2000 for his [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] show ''Chickenmaster'', and a [[Perrier Comedy Award|Perrier Award]] nomination in 1999 for another Edinburgh show ''Laser Boy''. He has since achieved great popularity in both the UK and Australia, where he has toured extensively every year since 2001. Noble's 2003 show ''Unrealtime'' was the best-selling show at the Edinburgh Fringe,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3179241.stm | title = Fringe passes million tickets mark | accessdate = 6 November 2006 |date= 25 August 2003 | publisher = BBC News}}</ref> before transferring to London's [[West End theatre|West End]] for a monthlong season at the [[Garrick Theatre]] where it played to packed houses. A recording of this tour was shown on [[BBC Two]] in 2004, and a double-DVD set was released later that year.\n\nDuring 2004, Noble performed at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]] and the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] and other venues with his show ''Noodlemeister''. His 2005 UK tour, ''Randomist'', ran from September to December, of which he continued in Australia during 2006. In April 2006, Noble was involved in a [[motorbike]] accident, and both fractured and dislocated his collarbone. Conveniently, he crashed right outside a hospital. Noble performed his shows over the following weeks with his arm in a sling.<ref name=\"randomist australia\">{{cite video | people = Noble, Ross | title = Randomist, Australia Tour | medium = DVD | publisher = Stunt Baby | location = Australia | date =  6 November 2006}}</ref> During his 'Things' tour, in [[Bristol]] on 1 March 2009, he claimed that before the ambulance officers would help him, he was forced to do his [[Stephen Hawking]] impression.\n\nWhilst performing in Edinburgh in September 2006 for his ''Fizzy Logic'' tour, a fight broke out during the gig, caused by a drunken member of the audience arguing with another. Also, in his Edinburgh gig, some one gave him a basket of mini-muffins with faces printed on them; this is related to a sketch from Noble's DVD ''Sonic Waffle'', in which he mentions his hobby of finding faces in muffins.<ref name=\"nemone\">Ross Noble interview, [[Nemone]] on [[BBC 6 Music]] (27 September 2006)</ref> At another gig, he found someone filming the show on their [[mobile phone]] and confiscated the phone.

At a gig at the [[Edinburgh Playhouse]] during Noble's 2005 ''Randomist'' tour, a member of the audience put his feet up on the stage, and later removed his shoes and put them on the stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.<ref>Fizzy Logic Tour, Edinburgh 2006-09-09, Nobleism Tour, Edinburgh 8 September 2007</ref>\n\nNoble performed at the 2008 [[Latitude Festival]] and rounded off his set by leading everyone in the tent in a huge [[conga line]] (which quickly turned into a stampede) to a [[Veganism|vegan]] food stand so they could all ask for pies and sausage rolls.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Clark |url=http://www.suchsmallportions.com/festivals/latitude/2008/latitude-2008-ross-noble.html |title=Ross Noble runs riot at Latitude with 3,000 strong conga to vegan stall |publisher=Such Small Portions |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=120&p=4097&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1 |title=The latest music blogs, free MP3s, best new bands, music videos, movie trailers and news analysis |work=Nme|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe DVD of his show ''Nobleism'' was released in November 2009.\n\n===TV and radio===\n\n====Guest appearances====\nNoble had not done any acting work on TV until the summer of 2013 when he appeared opposite [[Ian Smith (actor)|Ian Smith]] as a gay lover in the Australian TV series \"It's a date\",<ref>{{cite web|author=Natalie Bochenski |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/noble-and-neighbourly-comedic-pursuits-20130329-2gz1x.html |title=Noble and Neighbourly comedic pursuits |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=30 March 2013 |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref> or radio, as he prefers stand-up for giving him the freedom to say what he wants without being influenced by a script or crew.<ref name=\"interview20061106\"/> Nevertheless, he has made many TV appearances, which mainly take the form of interviews and [[panel game]] participation.

In January 2005, Noble joined Australian [[comedian]] [[Terri Psiakis]] in co-hosting ''[[Ross and Terri]]'', the weekday lunch shift on national radio station [[Triple J]]. Following on from ''Ross Noble Goes Global'', Radio 4 broadcast a new series called ''Ross Noble On...'' during January to February 2007.

Described as an anti-travelogue around Britain, in the show Noble takes the freestyle philosophy he embraces in his live shows and utilises his trademark audience participation gimmick and transfers it to television as he rides around the UK on his motorbike taking live requests on Twitter instructing him on where he should go next, making the road trip entirely unpredictable.

It was especially popular from 1962 to 1964 in two major forms.{{sfn|Blair|2015|pp=7, 49, 119}} The first is '''instrumental surf''', distinguished by [[reverb]]-drenched [[electric guitar]]s played to evoke the sound of crashing waves, largely pioneered by [[Dick Dale]] and the Del-Tones. The second is '''vocal surf''', which took elements of the original surf sound and added [[vocal harmonies]], a movement led by [[the Beach Boys]].<ref name=\"AllMusicSurf\">{{cite web|title=Surf|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/surf-ma0000002883}}</ref><ref>P.

His regional hit \"[[Let's Go Trippin']]{{-\"}} (1961) launched the surf music craze, inspiring many others to take up the approach.\n\nThe genre reached national exposure when it was represented by [[vocal group]]s such as the Beach Boys and [[Jan and Dean]].{{sfn|Blair|2015|pp=7, 49}} Dale is quoted on such groups: \"They were surfing sounds [with] surfing lyrics. In other words, the music wasn't surfing music. The words made them surfing songs. ...

The sound was dominated by [[electric guitars]] which were particularly characterized by the extensive use of the \"wet\" [[spring reverb]] that was incorporated into [[Fender amplifiers]] from 1961, which is thought to emulate the sound of the waves.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=1313\u20131314}} The outboard separate [[Fender Reverb Unit]] that was developed by Fender in 1961 (as opposed to reverb that was incorporated as a built-in amp feature) was the actual first \"wet\" surf reverb tone.  This unit is the reverb effect heard on Dick Dale records, and others such as \"[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]\" by the [[Chantays]] and \"Point Panic\" by the [[Surfaris]].   It had more of a wet \"plucky\" tone than the \"built in\" amp reverb, due to a different circuitry.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nGuitarists also made use of the [[Tremolo arm|vibrato arm]] on their guitar to bend the pitch of notes downward, electronic tremolo effects and rapid (alternating) [[tremolo picking]].<ref>A.

Wheeler, ''The Stratocaster chronicles: Fender : celebrating 50 years of the Fender Strat'' (Hal Leonard, 2004), p. 117.</ref> Surf music was one of the first genres to universally adopt the electric bass, particularly the Fender [[Precision Bass]]. Classic surf drum kits tended to be [[Rogers Drums|Rogers]], [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]], [[Gretsch]] or [[Slingerland]].

This unit is the reverb effect heard on Dick Dale records, and others such as \"[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]\" by the [[Chantays]] and \"Point Panic\" by the [[Surfaris]].   It had more of a wet \"plucky\" tone than the \"built in\" amp reverb, due to a different circuitry.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nGuitarists also made use of the [[Tremolo arm|vibrato arm]] on their guitar to bend the pitch of notes downward, electronic tremolo effects and rapid (alternating) [[tremolo picking]].<ref>A.

In modern [[United States customary units|US customary units]] it is defined as {{frac|16|1|2}} [[Foot (unit)#United States survey foot|US survey feet]], equal to exactly {{frac|1|320}} of a [[Mile#U.S. survey mile|surveyor's mile]], or one-fourth of a [[surveyor's chain]], and is approximately 5.0292 metres. The rod is useful as a unit of length because whole number multiples of it can form one [[acre]] of square measure. The 'perfect acre'<ref name=\"Connections0\"/> is a rectangular area of 43,560 square feet, bounded by sides 660 feet (a [[furlong]]) long and 66 feet wide (220 yards and 22 yards) or, equivalently, 40 rods and 4 rods. An acre is therefore 160 square rods.\n\nThe name ''perch'' derives from the [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Ancient Roman unit]], the ''pertica''.\nThe measure also has a relationship to the military [[pike (weapon)|pike]] of about the same size. Both measures<ref name=\"Connections\"/> date from the sixteenth century,<ref name=\"Connections2\"/> when the pike was still utilized in national armies. The tool has largely been supplanted by electronic tools such as surveyor lasers ([[Lidar]]) and optical target devices for surveying lands. Surveyors rods and chains are still used in rough terrains with heavy overgrowth where laser or other optical measurements are difficult or impossible.

Henry wanted to raise even more funds for his wars than he'd seized directly from church property (he'd also assumed the debts of Monasteries<ref name=\"Connections\"/>), and as [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] writes and quotes in the book ''[[Connections (book)|Connections]]'': the English monk [[Richard Benese]] \"produced a book on how to survey land using the simple tools of the time, a rod with cord carrying knots at certain intervals, waxed and resined against wet weather.\" Benese poetically described the measure of an acre in terms of a perch:<ref name=\"Connections2\">''Connections'', pbk. p.263</ref>\n{{Cquote|an acre bothe of woodlande, also of fyldlande [heath] is always forty perches in length, and four perches in breadth, though an acre of woodlande be more in quantitie [value, was more valued commercially] than an acre of fyldelande|Richard Benese per James Burke in ''Connections'', pp 263}}\nThe practice of using surveyor's chains, and perch-length rods made into a detachable stiff chain, came about a century later when iron was a more plentiful and common material.

By the time of the industrial revolution and the quickening of land sales, canal and railway surveys, et al. Surveyor rods such as used by [[George Washington]] were generally made of dimensionally stable metal&mdash;semi-flexible drawn wrought iron linkable bar stock (not steel), such that the four folded elements of a chain were easily transportable through brush and branches when carried by a single man of a surveyor's crew. With a direct ratio to the length of a surveyor's chain and the sides of both an acre and a square (mile), they were common tools used by surveyors, if only to lay out a known plottable baseline in rough terrain thereafter serving as the reference line for instrumental ([[theodolite]]) [[triangulation]]s.\n\nThe rod as a [[Surveying|survey]] measure was standardized by [[Edmund Gunter]] in England in 1607 as one-fourth of a [[chain (unit)|chain]] (of {{convert|66|ft|m|2}}), or {{convert|16+1/2|ft|m|2}} long.\n\n===In ancient cultures===\nThe '''perch''' as a [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|lineal measure in Rome]] (also ''decempeda'') was {{convert|10|ft|m|2}}, and in [[France]] varied from 10 feet (''perche romanie'') to 22 feet (''perche d'arpent''\u2014apparently {{frac|1|10}} of \"the range of an arrow\"\u2014about 220 feet). To confuse matters further, by ancient Roman definition, an arpent equalled 120 Roman feet.

In modern [[United States customary units|US customary units]] it is defined as {{frac|16|1|2}} [[Foot (unit)#United States survey foot|US survey feet]], equal to exactly {{frac|1|320}} of a [[Mile#U.S. survey mile|surveyor's mile]], or one-fourth of a [[surveyor's chain]], and is approximately 5.0292 meters. The rod is useful as a unit of length because whole number multiples of it can form one [[acre]] of square measure. The 'perfect acre'<ref name=\"Connections0\"/> is a rectangular area of 43,560 square feet, bounded by sides 660 feet (a [[furlong]]) long and 66 feet wide (220 yards and 22 yards) or, equivalently, 40 rods and 4 rods. An acre is therefore 160 square rods.\n\nThe name ''perch'' derives from the [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Ancient Roman unit]], the ''pertica''.\nThe measure also has a relationship to the military [[pike (weapon)|pike]] of about the same size. Both measures<ref name=\"Connections\"/> date from the sixteenth century,<ref name=\"Connections2\"/> when the pike was still utilized in national armies. The tool has largely been supplanted by electronic tools such as surveyor lasers ([[Lidar]]) and optical target devices for surveying lands. Surveyors rods and chains are still used in rough terrains with heavy overgrowth where laser or other optical measurements are difficult or impossible.

By the time of the industrial revolution and the quickening of land sales, canal and railway surveys, et al. Surveyor rods such as used by [[George Washington]] were generally made of dimensionally stable metal&mdash;semi-flexible drawn wrought iron linkable bar stock (not steel), such that the four folded elements of a chain were easily transportable through brush and branches when carried by a single man of a surveyor's crew. With a direct ratio to the length of a surveyor's chain and the sides of both an acre and a square (mile), they were common tools used by surveyors, if only to lay out a known plottable baseline in rough terrain thereafter serving as the reference line for instrumental ([[theodolite]]) [[triangulation]]s.\n\nThe rod as a [[Surveying|survey]] measure was standardized by [[Edmund Gunter]] in England in 1607 as one-fourth of a [[chain (unit)|chain]] (of {{convert|66|ft|m|2}}), or {{convert|16+1/2|ft|m|2}} long.\n\n===In ancient cultures===\nThe '''perch''' as a [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|lineal measure in Rome]] (also ''decempeda'') was {{convert|10|ft|m|2}}, and in [[France]] varied from 10 feet (''perche romanie'') to 22 feet (''perche d'arpent''\u2014apparently {{frac|1|10}} of \"the range of an arrow\"\u2014about 220 feet).

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

Her husband of four years, Joel, a businessman working at a plastics company, moonlights as a comedian at [[The Gaslight Cafe]], copying more acclaimed comics' material. After one particularly mediocre performance, Joel leaves Midge for his secretary.\n\nA dejected and drunken Midge goes back to the Gaslight where she delivers an impromptu set, confessing her predicament to the audience. While her bawdy, biting, and brilliant delivery enthralls the audience, she gets arrested after baring her breasts.\n\nMidge meets comic [[Lenny Bruce]], who has also been arrested for obscenity in his act. Midge is bailed out of jail, and she, in turn, bails out Bruce. Inspired to be a comedian herself, she teams up with Gaslight employee Susie Myerson, who becomes her manager.\n\nAfter Midge and her two children move in with her parents, Rose and Abe, she lands a job at [[B. Altman and Company|B. Altman]], a high-end department store, working at the cosmetics counter. In addition to an income, the job provides material for Midge's act.\n\nMidge visits New York clubs to study other comedians. She meets top comedian Sophie Lennon, who is completely unlike her frumpy on-stage character. Sophie advises Midge to develop her own stage persona, but Midge prefers performing as herself.\n\nAfter Midge disparagingly reveals in her act that Sophie is actually a wealthy, snobbish socialite, she is blacklisted from every club in the city. However, with Susie and Lenny's help, Midge performs again and proves she can be a professional comic.\n\nJoel secretly watches her act, and, dejected, realizes she is truly talented. After trying out various stage names, Midge settles on \"Mrs. Maisel\".\n\n===Season 2===\nMidge's mother, Rose, moves to Paris after her New York social life falls apart. Initially oblivious to her departure, Midge and Abe attempt to persuade her to return home.\n\nBack in New York, two thugs working for Sophie Lennon's manager abduct Susie. They end up befriending and then releasing her with a warning that others may come looking for her.\n\nAfter enjoying life in Paris with and without Abe, Rose returns home after Abe promises to be more like his vacation self. He arranges for her to audit art classes at [[Columbia University]], where he is a tenured mathematics professor. The family goes on their annual vacation at a [[Borscht Belt|Catskill Mountains]] resort.\n\nSusie, upset that Midge will be away for two months, goes to the resort, and, impersonating a staff person, works on booking gigs in the area. She books Midge at a large hotel where she gives a sexually-charged performance, unaware a stunned Abe is in the audience. Midge meets Benjamin Ettenberg, a successful New York doctor whom she starts dating.\n\nWith Abe the only family member knowing about her side-career, Midge continues performing. When she wants to skip an important gig because it is on [[Yom Kippur]], Susie insists that Midge perform; Abe tells Midge it is time to tell the family.\n\nMidge and Susie embark on a short comedy tour outside New York City. Susie books Midge for a spot on a [[telethon]], where Midge meets Shy Baldwin, a famous singer. Susie learns that Sophie Lennon controls the show.\n\nStill angry over Midge having exposed her real identity, Sophie gets her bumped to the telethon's late-night end slot. Emboldened by knowing fewer viewers are watching, Midge's all-out performance is a hit, lighting up the phones with last-minute donations. Her performance prompts Shy Baldwin to offer her a job as the opening act on his six-month tour throughout the United States and Europe, which Midge immediately accepts. Meanwhile, after Susie threatened her for her scheme against Midge and tired of her own act, Sophie asks Susie to be her manager, saying she wants a manager who will fight for her like Susie does for Midge.\n\nAbe considers leaving [[Bell Labs]] and Columbia, fed up with their interference in his personal life. Benjamin proposes to Midge, despite her still being married to Joel. After watching Lenny Bruce's act about being alone, Midge ponders the personal cost of a full-time comedy career.\n\nJoel's father Moishe gives Joel a large sum of money, wanting him to pursue whatever he wants to do in life. Joel decides he wants to open a night club.\n\n===Season 3===\nAfter ending her engagement with Benjamin and a one night-stand with Joel, Midge kicks off a [[USO]] tour with Shy Baldwin, and meets his no-nonsense manager, Reggie. Susie and Midge briefly fall out over Susie managing Sophie Lennon, though Midge later relents, wanting Susie to be independently successful. Joel finds a suitable night club venue in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], but soon discovers the cheap rent is because an illegal casino operates in the basement. He begins seeing Mei, a woman who helped him procure the space. Mei assists Joel with other tasks, specifically obtaining the pending liquor license.\n\nAbe's leaving Columbia University and Bell Labs has financial repercussions and forces the family to vacate their apartment, owned by Columbia. Rose requests her wealthy Oklahoma oil family increase her trust fund allowance, then cuts ties with them with over their sexist attitudes. Having no other options, Abe and Rose stay at Moishe and Shirley Maisel's new house in [[Forest Hills, Queens]].\n\nJoel and Midge's divorce is finalized before Midge leaves for Las Vegas. After a lackluster opening night, Midge adapts to performing on the road. Sophie's desire to play the lead in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg's]] play, ''[[Miss Julie]]'', leads Susie to secure producers, a Broadway theater, and a notable male co-star. Joel visits Midge in Las Vegas while Susie is in New York. After a drunken night together, Midge and Joel wake up in bed together to discover that they got re-married. They mutually agree to divorce again. \n\nDuring rehearsals, Sophie proves she is a talented dramatic actress, but becomes unnerved on opening night and reverts to her comic persona, [[ad libbing]] the dialogue. Critics savage the play, forcing its closure. Susie angrily lambastes Sophie for ruining her chance to be a serious actor.\n\nAbe visits his old friend, Asher Friedman, a playwright blacklisted for [[Communist Party]] connections. Abe writes an article about Asher's unfair treatment that is published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' which leads to his being offered a job as a theater critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]''. \n\nLenny Bruce, currently living in Miami, sees Midge while she is performing there. Lenny takes her along to a local live TV show he is appearing on. Lenny ends the night by telling Midge her act is \"sensational\". Midge discovers that Shy is secretly gay. He occasionally becomes depressed and sometimes disappears for days, missing performances. After one violent encounter, Midge gets Shy on stage, helping to hide his injuries. When the tour goes on hiatus while Shy recuperates, Midge does radio ads, though the pay is sometimes non-monetary.\n\nMidge wants her old Upper West Side apartment back, partially so her children can attend Manhattan schools. Moishe agrees to sell her the apartment, with Midge's tour contract as collateral. Meanwhile, Rose discovers she has a matchmaking talent for her friends' unmarried adult children.\n\nMidge arrives for Joel's grand opening and does a short impromptu set when the band has some technical difficulties. After Susie loses most of Midge's earning on sports gambling, she turns over Midge's finances to Joel, knowing he is trustworthy. To repay Midge, Susie, along with her sister, commits insurance fraud by burning down their deceased mother's home.\n\nAt her [[Apollo Theater]] debut, Midge is reunited with Shy. Backstage, Midge is star-struck meeting [[Moms Mabley]], but is dismayed that she has been billed above Mabley on the program as Shy's opening act. Believing she is not ready for the prestigious Apollo, Midge is stressed that the crowd will resent a white comic. Reggie suggests she discuss Shy and life on the tour in her act, unaware Midge knows that Shy is gay. Midge mistakenly assumes that Shy's hometown Harlem audience also knows, and her gay-inferred jokes almost \"[[outing|out]]\" him. When Susie and Midge later arrive at the airport, Reggie informs them that Shy has dropped Midge from the tour. Distraught, they plead to make amends but are left on the tarmac as the plane takes off.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Rachel Brosnahan]] as Miriam \"Midge\" Maisel (n\u00e9e Weissman), a [[Jewish American]] housewife who discovers her flair for stand-up comedy.

After visiting an old playwright friend [[blacklisted]] early in the 1950s, Abe writes an article about the injustice that is published in ''[[The New York Times]]''.\n|LineColor       = FF9966\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n|Title           = Marvelous Radio\n|DirectedBy      = Daniel Palladino\n|WrittenBy       = Daniel Palladino\n|OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|12|6}}\n|ShortSummary    = Between legs of the Shy Baldwin tour, Midge, back in New York, takes on a series of radio gigs ranging from amusing to annoying, and with occasional odd payments. Abe is thrilled that ''The New York Times'' published his article. The Weissmans celebrate the [[bris]] of Noah and Astrid's baby. Susie's sports gambling habit worsens. Sophie Lennon's play opens on Broadway, but intimidated by acting onstage, she deviates from her role and devolves into her stand-up comic character; amid terrible reviews, the play closes the next day. Susie angrily confronts Sophie for destroying an opportunity to be considered a serious actress.\n|LineColor       = FF9966\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber   = 26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n|Title           = A Jewish Girl Walks Into the Apollo\u2026\n|DirectedBy      = Amy Sherman-Palladino\n|WrittenBy       = Amy Sherman-Palladino\n|OriginalAirDate = {{start date|2019|12|6}}\n|ShortSummary    = Midge and Joel disagree whether they can afford to send Ethan and Esther to an upper class private school in Manhattan. Joel and Mei reconcile on the threshold of his club's grand opening. The grand opening is an initial success, but a subsequent technical problem forces the band offstage. Midge saves the night with an impromptu performance. Moishe agrees to sell Midge's former apartment back to her \u2014 using her Baldwin tour contract as collateral. Susie's sports gambling costs her Midge's earnings, driving a desperate Susie to attempt insurance fraud to repay the money. Susie also appoints Joel as sole manager of Midge's finances, knowing he can be trusted. Someone objecting to Abe's article splatters him with tomatoes. Abe sees it as a sign that his writing affects people; it also leads to an unexpected job offer as a theater critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Midge is stunned to be billed ahead of black comedy legend [[Moms Mabley]] ([[Wanda Sykes]]) on Shy's big showcase at Harlem's legendary [[Apollo Theater]]. Shy's manager Reggie suggests an anxious Midge just talk about Shy and the tour. Midge wrongly assumes the Harlem audience knows about Shy's homosexuality. Her  improvised routine with jokes about Shy's effeminate behavior wins over the tough Apollo audience, but Reggie kicks her off the Baldwin tour for nearly outing Shy.\n|LineColor       = FF9966\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn developing the series, Amy Sherman-Palladino was inspired by childhood memories of her father, a standup comedian based in NYC, and an admiration for early female comics such as [[Joan Rivers]] and [[Totie Fields]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rachel Brosnahan on how 'trailblazer' Joan Rivers inspired Marvelous Mrs Maisel|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/11/29/rachel-brosnahan-on-how-trailblazer-joan-rivers-inspired-amazons-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-7119853/|accessdate=December 12, 2017|work=Metro|first=Adam|last=Starkey|date=November 29, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes122017\">{{cite news|last1=Soloski|first1=Alexis|title=Did You Hear the One About the Housewife Who Walks into a Comedy Club?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/arts/television/marvelous-mrs-maisel-amazon-amy-sherman-palladino.html|accessdate=December 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=November 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"VF1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/gilmore-girls-amy-sherman-palladino-amazon-pilot-marvelous-mrs-maisel|title=Gilmore Girls Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino Explains her Marvelous New TV Series|last=Busis|first=Hillary|work=Vanity Fair|date=March 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn June 6, 2016, it was confirmed that [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] had given the production a pilot order.

Her husband of four years, Joel, a businessman working at a plastics company, moonlights as a comedian at [[The Gaslight Cafe]], copying more acclaimed comics' material. After one particularly mediocre performance, Joel leaves Midge for his secretary.\n\nA dejected and drunken Midge goes back to the Gaslight where she delivers an impromptu set, confessing her predicament to the audience. While her bawdy, biting, and brilliant delivery enthralls the audience, she gets arrested after baring her breasts.\n\nMidge meets comic [[Lenny Bruce]], who has also been arrested for obscenity in his act. Midge is bailed out of jail, and she, in turn, bails out Bruce. Inspired to be a comedian herself, she teams up with Gaslight employee Susie Myerson, who becomes her manager.\n\nAfter Midge and her two children move in with her parents, Rose and Abe, she lands a job at [[B. Altman and Company|B. Altman]], a high-end department store, working at the cosmetics counter. In addition to an income, the job provides material for Midge's act.\n\nMidge visits New York clubs to study other comedians. She meets top comedian Sophie Lennon, who is completely unlike her frumpy on-stage character. Sophie advises Midge to develop her own stage persona, but Midge prefers performing as herself.\n\nAfter Midge disparagingly reveals in her act that Sophie is actually a wealthy, snobbish socialite, she is blacklisted from every club in the city. However, with Susie and Lenny's help, Midge performs again and proves she can be a professional comic.\n\nJoel secretly watches her act, and, dejected, realizes she is truly talented. After trying out various stage names, Midge settles on \"Mrs. Maisel\".\n\n===Season 2===\nMidge's mother, Rose, moves to Paris after her New York social life falls apart. Initially oblivious to her departure, Midge and Abe attempt to persuade her to return home.\n\nBack in New York, two thugs working for Sophie Lennon's manager abduct Susie. They end up befriending and then releasing her with a warning that others may come looking for her.\n\nAfter enjoying life in Paris with and without Abe, Rose returns home after Abe promises to be more like his vacation self. He arranges for her to audit art classes at [[Columbia University]], where he is a tenured mathematics professor. The family goes on their annual vacation at a [[Borscht Belt|Catskill Mountains]] resort.\n\nSusie, upset that Midge will be away for two months, goes to the resort, and, impersonating a staff person, works on booking gigs in the area. She books Midge at a large hotel where she gives a sexually-charged performance, unaware a stunned Abe is in the audience. Midge meets Benjamin Ettenberg, a successful New York doctor whom she starts dating.\n\nWith Abe the only family member knowing about her side-career, Midge continues performing. When she wants to skip an important gig because it is on [[Yom Kippur]], Susie insists that Midge perform; Abe tells Midge it is time to tell the family.\n\nMidge and Susie embark on a short comedy tour outside New York City. Susie books Midge for a spot on a [[telethon]], where Midge meets Shy Baldwin, a famous singer. Susie learns that Sophie Lennon controls the show.\n\nStill angry over Midge having exposed her real identity, Sophie gets her bumped to the telethon's late-night end slot. Emboldened by knowing fewer viewers are watching, Midge's all-out performance is a hit, lighting up the phones with last-minute donations. Her performance prompts Shy Baldwin to offer her a job as the opening act on his six-month tour throughout the United States and Europe, which Midge immediately accepts. Meanwhile, after Susie threatened her for her scheme against Midge and tired of her own act, Sophie asks Susie to be her manager, saying she wants a manager who will fight for her like Susie does for Midge.\n\nAbe considers leaving [[Bell Labs]] and Columbia, fed up with their interference in his personal life. Benjamin proposes to Midge, despite her still being married to Joel. After watching Lenny Bruce's act about being alone, Midge ponders the personal cost of a full-time comedy career.\n\nJoel's father Moishe gives Joel a large sum of money, wanting him to pursue whatever he wants to do in life. Joel decides he wants to open a night club.\n\n===Season 3===\nAfter ending her engagement with Benjamin and a one night-stand with Joel, Midge kicks off a [[USO]] tour with Shy Baldwin, and meets his no-nonsense manager, Reggie. Susie and Midge briefly fall out over Susie managing Sophie Lennon, though Midge later relents, wanting Susie to be independently successful. Joel finds a suitable night club venue in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], but soon discovers the cheap rent is because an illegal casino operates in the basement. He begins seeing Mei, a woman who helped him procure the space. Mei assists Joel with other tasks, specifically obtaining the pending liquor license.\n\nAbe's leaving Columbia University and Bell Labs has financial repercussions and forces the family to vacate their apartment, owned by Columbia. Rose requests her wealthy Oklahoma oil family increase her trust fund allowance, then cuts ties with them with over their sexist attitudes. Having no other options, Abe and Rose stay at Moishe and Shirley Maisel's new house in [[Forest Hills, Queens]].\n\nJoel and Midge's divorce is finalized before Midge leaves for Las Vegas. After a lackluster opening night, Midge adapts to performing on the road. Sophie's desire to play the lead in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg's]] play, ''[[Miss Julie]]'', leads Susie to secure producers, a Broadway theater, and a notable male co-star. Joel visits Midge in Las Vegas while Susie is in New York. After a drunken night together, Midge and Joel wake up in bed together to discover that they got re-married. They mutually agree to divorce again. \n\nDuring rehearsals, Sophie proves she is a talented dramatic actress, but becomes unnerved on opening night and reverts to her comic persona, [[ad libbing]] the dialogue. Critics savage the play, forcing its closure. Susie angrily lambastes Sophie for ruining her chance to be a serious actor.\n\nAbe visits his old friend, Asher Friedman, a playwright blacklisted for [[Communist Party]] connections. Abe writes an article about Asher's unfair treatment that is published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' which leads to his being offered a job as a theater critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]''. \n\nLenny Bruce, currently living in Miami, sees Midge while she is performing there. Lenny takes her along to a local live TV show he is appearing on. Lenny ends the night by telling Midge her act is \"sensational\". Midge discovers that Shy is secretly gay. He occasionally becomes depressed and sometimes disappears for days, missing performances. After one violent encounter, Midge gets Shy on stage, helping to hide his injuries. When the tour goes on hiatus while Shy recuperates, Midge does radio ads, though the pay is sometimes non-monetary.\n\nMidge wants her old Upper West Side apartment back, partially so her children can attend Manhattan schools. Moishe agrees to sell her the apartment, with Midge's tour contract as collateral. Meanwhile, Rose discovers she has a matchmaking talent for her friends' unmarried adult children.\n\nMidge arrives for Joel's grand opening and does a short impromptu set when the band has some technical difficulties. After Susie loses most of Midge's earning on sports gambling, she turns over Midge's finances to Joel, knowing he is trustworthy. To repay Midge, Susie, along with her sister, commits insurance fraud by burning down their deceased mother's home.\n\nAt her [[Apollo Theater]] debut, Midge is reunited with Shy. Backstage, Midge is star-struck meeting [[Moms Mabley]], but is dismayed that she has been billed above Mabley on the program as Shy's opening act. Believing she is not ready for the prestigious Apollo, Midge is stressed that the crowd will resent a white comic. Reggie suggests she discuss Shy and life on the tour in her act, unaware Midge knows that Shy is gay. Midge mistakenly assumes that Shy's hometown Harlem audience also knows, and her gay-inferred jokes almost \"[[outing|out]]\" him. When Susie and Midge later arrive at the airport, Reggie informs them that Shy has dropped Midge from the tour. Distraught, they plead to make amends but are left on the tarmac as the plane takes off.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Rachel Brosnahan]] as Miriam \"Midge\" Maisel (n\u00e9e Weissman), a [[Jewish American]] housewife who discovers her flair for stand-up comedy.
