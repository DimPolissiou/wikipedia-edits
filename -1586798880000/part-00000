It was released on 10 April 2020 by [[Netflix]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the opening scene, Jack is trying to muster up the courage to kiss Dina, his sister Hayley's American roommate, before he leaves to return home to London. He had come to Rome to visit his sister Hayley for the weekend, and Dina had also come to visit Hayley. Before he can kiss Dina, Greg, Jack's dorm roommate from university, bumps into them. Realising that Jack is also headed towards the airport, Greg offers him a ride and Jack is unable to kiss Dina or even say a proper goodbye. Saying an awkward goodbye, both men leave with Jack upset.\n\nThree years later, Jack is at his sister Hayley's wedding. Bryan, an aspiring actor and the maid of honor, is more concerned about being called the maid of honor, getting introduced to Italian film director Vitelli and not being seated next to Rebecca, rather than helping out the bride. He is late for the wedding ceremony because he decides to get a haircut to better prepare himself for his meeting with Vitelli. Hayley has chosen to not seat Bryan with Vitelli as she has seated all the English people on the English table, which also includes Amanda, Jack's \"nightmare of an ex-girlfriend\".\n\nAmanda has come to the wedding with her boyfriend Chaz, with whom she has clear commitment issues (he proposed six months earlier and she has not responded yet). Other friends of Hayley's include clingy Rebecca and socially awkward Sidney. Rebecca, upon meeting Chaz, accidentally mistakes him for a cabaret act and mentions that Amanda called Chaz a \"dickhead\". Sidney has worn a kilt to the wedding, despite not being Scottish, and becomes easily uncomfortable in it.\n\nAs Jack and Hayley's parents are dead, Hayley has asked Jack to walk her down the aisle. Just as they are about to, Hayley tells Jack that Dina has come to the wedding and is single. After the wedding, Sidney and approaches Dina, which leads to an uncomfortable conversation between the two and ends with Sidney leaving to get some champgane for the both of them, despite Dina not wanting any. Meanwhile, Jack and Bryan are talking about how Bryan will create a good first impression on Vitelli, when Bryan learns that he has to make a maid-of-honor speech. Rebecca joins the conversation, and while she continues to compliment him, Jack sees Dina for the first time in three years. Both of them talk and they confess to one another that they used to ask Hayley about the other.\n\nMarc, Hayley's school classmate, arrives at the wedding venue high on cocaine and plans to ruin the wedding. Hayley confronts Marc and asks him to leave. Their talk is interrupted by Roberto, Hayley's husband, and he ends up having Marc stay for the celebrations.\n\nHayley asks Jack to drug Marc with her sleeping drops, but some children mess around and rearrange the seating order.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Claflin]] as Jack\n* [[Olivia Munn]] as Dina \n* [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Hayley\n* [[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] as Bryan\n* [[Tim Key]] as Sidney\n* [[Aisling Bea]] as Rebecca\n* [[Jack Farthing]] as Marc\n* [[Allan Mustafa (actor)|Allan Mustafa]] as Chaz\n* [[Freida Pinto]] as Amanda\n* [[Paolo Mazzarelli]] as Vitelli\n* Tiziano Caputo as Roberto\n\n==Production==\nThe film was announced in April 2019, with [[Sam Claflin]], [[Olivia Munn]], [[Freida Pinto]] and [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] cast.

It is a struggle for the freedom of women to \"define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate\".{{efn|Germaine Greer (''The Whole Woman'', 1999): \"In 1970 the movement was called 'Women's Liberation' or, contemptuously, 'Women's Lib'. When the name 'Libbers' was dropped for 'Feminists' we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination. The aim of women's liberation is to do as much for female people as has been done for colonized nations. Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men.

She argued that the Western promotion of birth control in the Third World was in large part driven not by concern for human welfare but by the traditional fear and envy of the rich towards the fertility of the poor. The birth control movement had been tainted by such attitudes from its beginning, she wrote, citing [[Marie Stopes]] and others.

Suggesting that whites were mistaken in understanding this literally, she argued that Aborigines were offering whites terms on which they could be accepted into the Aboriginal kinship system.

There are whitefellas who insist that blackfellas don't practise adoption; all I can say is that when I asked about the possibility of assuming Aboriginality, the Kulin women said at once 'We'll adopt you.'

She has written over 20 books, including ''Sex and Destiny'' (1984), ''The Change'' (1991), ''The Whole Woman'' (1999), and ''Shakespeare's Wife'' (2007). Her 2013 book, ''[[White Beech: The Rainforest Years]]'', describes her efforts to restore an area of [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia|rainforest]] in the [[Numinbah Valley]] in Australia.

It is a struggle for the freedom of women to \"define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate\".{{efn|Germaine Greer (''The Whole Woman'', 1999): \"In 1970 the movement was called 'Women's Liberation' or, contemptuously, 'Women's Lib'. When the name 'Libbers' was dropped for 'Feminists' we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination. The aim of women's liberation is to do as much for female people as has been done for colonized nations. Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues as to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate.

{"title_page": "Impression formation", "text_new": "{{Format footnotes|date=June 2016}}\n\n'''Impression formation''' in [[social psychology]] refers to the processes by which different pieces of knowledge about another are combined into a global or summary impression. Social Psychologist Solomon Asch was a pioneer in Gestalt Psychology. He is credited with the seminal research on impression formation and conducted research on how individuals integrate information about personality traits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impression Formation, Theories Of|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estpsychtheory/impression_formation_theories_of|publisher=Elsevier's Dictionary of Psychological Theories|accessdate=2012-04-19}}</ref> Two major theories have been proposed to explain how this process of integration takes place. The Gestalt approach views the formation of a general impression as the sum of several interrelated impressions. As an individual seeks to form a coherent and meaningful impression of another individual, previous impressions significantly influence the interpretation of subsequent information.<ref name=\"HamiltonSherman1996\">{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=David L.|author2=Sherman, Steven J.|title=Perceiving persons and groups|journal=Psychological Review|date=1 January 1996|volume=103|issue=2|pages=336\u2013355|issn=1939-1471|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.103.2.336|pmid=8637962}}</ref> In contrast to the Gestalt approach, the cognitive algebra approach asserts that individuals' experiences are combined with previous evaluations to form a constantly changing impression of a person.<ref name=\"Himmelfarb1972\">{{cite journal|last=Himmelfarb|first=Samuel|title=Integration and attribution theories in personality impression formation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1972|volume=23|issue=3|pages=309\u2013313|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/h0033126|pmid=5070314}}</ref> A related area to impression formation is the study of [[person perception]], making [[dispositional attribution]]s, and then adjusting those inferences based on the information available.<ref name=\"GilbertPelham1988\">{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert|first1=Daniel T.|last2=Pelham|first2=Brett W.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|title=On cognitive busyness: When person perceivers meet persons perceived.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1988|volume=54|issue=5|pages=733\u2013740|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.5.733}}</ref>\n\n==Methods==\nImpression formation has traditionally been studied using three methods pioneered by Asch: [[free response]], [[free association (psychology)|free association]], and a check-list form. In addition, a fourth method based on a [[Likert scale]] with anchors such as \u201cvery favorable\u201d and \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d, has also been used in recent research.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\">{{cite journal|title=Dispositional Attribution: Multiple Inferences About Motive-Related Traits|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=86|issue=4|pages=530\u2013544|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.4.530|pmid=15053704|last1=Reeder|first1=Glenn D.|last2=Vonk|first2=Roos|last3=Ronk|first3=Marla J.|last4=Ham|first4=Jaap|last5=Lawrence|first5=Melissa|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.2048}}</ref> A combination of some or all of these techniques is often employed to produce the most accurate assessment of impression formation.\n\n===Free response===\n[[Free response]] is an experimental method frequently used in impression formation research. The participant (or perceiver) is presented with a stimulus (usually a short vignette or a list of personality descriptors such as ''assured, talkative, cold,'' etc.) and then instructed to briefly sketch his or her impressions of the type of person described. This is a useful technique for gathering detailed and concrete evidence on the nature of the impression formed. However, the difficulty of accurately coding responses often necessitates the use of additional quantitative measures.<ref name=\"Asch1946\">{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.

While this produces an easily quantifiable assessment of an impression, it forces participants' answers into a limited, and often extreme, response set.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> However, when used in conjunction with the above-mentioned techniques, check-list data provides useful information about the character of impressions.\n\n===Likert-type rating scales===\nWith [[Likert scale]]s, perceivers are responding to a presentation of discrete personality characteristics. Common presentation methods include lists of adjectives, photos or videos depicting a scene, or written scenarios.<ref name=\"ReederVonk2004\" /><ref name=Anderson1>{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=N.

In general, primacy can have three main effects: initial trait-information can be integrated into an individual's global impression of a person in a process of ''[[assimilation effects]],'' it can lead to a durable impression against which other information is compared in a process of ''[[anchoring]],'' and it can cause people to actively change their perception of others in a process of ''correction.''<ref name=DeCoster/>\n\n===Valence===\nThe emotionality of certain personality traits, such as \"warm\" versus \"cold\" characteristics, can influence how subsequent traits are interpreted and ultimately the type of impression formed.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> Information inconsistent with a person's global impression of another individual is especially prominent in memory.

''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967)</ref> focused on how individuals engage in [[impression management]]. Using the notion of ''face'' as ''[[identity (social science)|identity]]'' is used now, Goffman proposed that individuals maintain face expressively. \"By entering a situation in which he is given a face to maintain, a person takes on the responsibility of standing guard over the flow of events as they pass before him. He must ensure that a particular expressive order is sustained-an order that regulates the flow of events, large or small, so that anything that appears to be expressed by them will be consistent with his face.\"<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967), p. 9</ref> In other words, individuals control events so as to create desired impressions of themselves.

Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nStability was a factor in every equation, with some pre-action feeling toward an action element transferred to post-action feeling about the same element. Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of behaviors suffused to actors so impressions of actors were determined in part by the behaviors they performed. In general objects of action lost Potency.\n\nInteractions among variables included consistency effects, such as receiving Evaluative credit for performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received a boost in evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, more than half of the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.<ref>Impression-formation effects are described in detail by Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order'', Chapter 6. [[Ordinary least squares]] estimations of equations from the 515-event study, and from studies mentioned below, can be examined in [http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/JavaInteract.html Interact On-Line (Java applet)]</ref>\n\nStudies of event descriptions that explicitly specified [[behavior settings]] found that impression-formation processes are largely the same when settings are salient, but the setting becomes an additional contributor to impression formation regarding actor, behavior, and object; and the action changes the impression of the setting.<ref>Smith-Lovin, Lynn (1979). \"Behavior settings and impressions formed from social scenarios\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''42''': 31\u201343; Smith-Lovin, L. \"The affective control of events within settings,\" pp. 71\u2013102 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nActor and object are the same person in self-directed actions such as \"the lawyer praised himself\" or various kinds of [[self-harm]]. Impression-formation research<ref>Britt, Lory, and D. R. Heise (1992). \"Impressions of self-directed action.\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''55''': 335\u2013350</ref> indicates that self-directed actions reduce the positivity of actors on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions. Self-directed actions therefore are not an optimal way to confirm the good, potent, lively identities that people normally want to maintain. Rather self-directed actions are a likely mode of expression for individuals who want to manifest their low [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]].\n\nEarly work on impression formation<ref>Gollob, 1968; Gollob and Rossman, 1973</ref> used action sentences like, \"The kind man praises communists,\" and \"Bill helped the corrupt senator,\" assuming that modifier-noun combinations amalgamate into a functional unit. A later study<ref>Averett, Christine P., and D. R. Heise. \"Modified social identities: Amalgamations, attributions, and emotions,\" pp. 103\u2013132 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref> found that a modifier-noun combination does form an overall impression that works in action descriptions like a noun alone. The action sentences in that study combined identities with status characteristics, [[Trait theory|traits]], [[mood (psychology)|moods]], and [[emotion]]s. Another study<ref>Heise, D. R., and Lisa Thomas (1989). \"Predicting impressions created by combinations of emotion and social identity\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''52''': 141\u2013148.</ref> focused specifically on emotion descriptors combined with identities (e.g., an angry child) and again found that emotion terms amalgamate with identities, and equations describing this kind of amalgamation are of the same form as equations describing trait-identity amalgamation.\n\n==Cross-cultural studies==\nStudies of various kinds of impression formation have been conducted in Canada,<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J.

For example, in every culture that has been studied, Evaluation of an actor was determined by-among other things-a stability effect, a suffusion from the behavior Evaluation, and an interaction that rewarded an actor for performing a behavior whose Evaluation was consistent with the Evaluation of the object person.\n\nOn the other hand, each culture weighted the core effects distinctively. For example, the impact of behavior-object Evaluation consistency was much smaller in Germany than in the United States, Canada, or Japan, suggesting that [[Morality|moral]] judgments of actors have a somewhat different basis in Germany than in the other cultures. Additionally, impression-formation processes involved some unique interactions in each culture. For example, attribute-identity amalgamations in Germany involved some Potency and Activity interactions that did not appear in other cultures.\n\nA book, ''Surveying Cultures''<ref>Heise, D. R. ''Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments'' (Wiley Interscience, 2010)</ref> reviewed [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural research]] on impression-formation processes, and provided guidelines for conducting impression-formation studies in cultures where the processes are unexplored currently.\n\n== Recent Studies ==\nImpression formation is based on the characteristics of both the perceivers and targets. However, research has not been able to quantify the extent to which these two groups contribute to impression.

In general, primacy can have three main effects: initial trait-information can be integrated into an individual's global impression of a person in a process of ''[[assimilation effects]],'' it can lead to a durable impression against which other information is compared in a process of ''[[anchoring]],'' and it can cause people to actively change their perception of others in a process of ''correction.''<ref name=DeCoster/>\n\n===Valence===\nThe emotionality of certain personality traits, such as \"warm\" versus \"cold\" characteristics, can influence how subsequent traits are interpreted and ultimately the type of impression formed.<ref name=\"Asch1946\" /> Information inconsistent with a person's global impression of another individual is especially prominent in memory.

''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967)</ref> focused on how individuals engage in [[impression management]]. Using the notion of ''face'' as ''[[identity (social science)|identity]]'' is used now, Goffman proposed that individuals maintain face expressively. \"By entering a situation in which he is given a face to maintain, a person takes on the responsibility of standing guard over the flow of events as they pass before him. He must ensure that a particular expressive order is sustained-an order that regulates the flow of events, large or small, so that anything that appears to be expressed by them will be consistent with his face.\"<ref>Goffman, E. ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior'' (Anchor Books, 1967), p. 9</ref> In other words, individuals control events so as to create desired impressions of themselves.

Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nStability was a factor in every equation, with some pre-action feeling toward an action element transferred to post-action feeling about the same element. Evaluation, Potency, and Activity of behaviors suffused to actors so impressions of actors were determined in part by the behaviors they performed. In general objects of action lost Potency.\n\nInteractions among variables included consistency effects, such as receiving Evaluative credit for performing a bad behavior toward a bad object person, and congruency effects, such as receiving evaluative credit for nice behaviors toward weak objects or bad behaviors toward powerful objects. Third-order interactions included a balance effect in which actors received a boost in evaluation if two or none of the elements in the action were negative, otherwise a decrement. Across all nine prediction equations, more than half of the 64 possible predictors (first-order variables plus second- Dand third-order interactions) contributed to outcomes.<ref>Impression-formation effects are described in detail by Heise, D. R. ''Expressive Order'', Chapter 6. [[Ordinary least squares]] estimations of equations from the 515-event study, and from studies mentioned below, can be examined in [http://www.indiana.edu/~socpsy/ACT/interact/JavaInteract.html Interact On-Line (Java applet)]</ref>\n\nStudies of event descriptions that explicitly specified [[behavior settings]] found that impression-formation processes are largely the same when settings are salient, but the setting becomes an additional contributor to impression formation regarding actor, behavior, and object; and the action changes the impression of the setting.<ref>Smith-Lovin, Lynn (1979). \"Behavior settings and impressions formed from social scenarios\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''42''': 31\u201343; Smith-Lovin, L. \"The affective control of events within settings,\" pp. 71\u2013102 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref>\n\nActor and object are the same person in self-directed actions such as \"the lawyer praised himself\" or various kinds of [[self-harm]]. Impression-formation research<ref>Britt, Lory, and D. R. Heise (1992). \"Impressions of self-directed action.\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''55''': 335\u2013350</ref> indicates that self-directed actions reduce the positivity of actors on the Evaluation, Potency, and Activity dimensions. Self-directed actions therefore are not an optimal way to confirm the good, potent, lively identities that people normally want to maintain. Rather self-directed actions are a likely mode of expression for individuals who want to manifest their low [[self-esteem]] and [[self-efficacy]].\n\nEarly work on impression formation<ref>Gollob, 1968; Gollob and Rossman, 1973</ref> used action sentences like, \"The kind man praises communists,\" and \"Bill helped the corrupt senator,\" assuming that modifier-noun combinations amalgamate into a functional unit. A later study<ref>Averett, Christine P., and D. R. Heise. \"Modified social identities: Amalgamations, attributions, and emotions,\" pp. 103\u2013132 in L. Smith-Lovin and D. R. Heise, Eds. ''Analyzing Social Interaction: Advances in Affect Control Theory'' (Gordon and Breach, 1988)</ref> found that a modifier-noun combination does form an overall impression that works in action descriptions like a noun alone. The action sentences in that study combined identities with status characteristics, [[Trait theory|traits]], [[mood (psychology)|moods]], and [[emotion]]s. Another study<ref>Heise, D. R., and Lisa Thomas (1989). \"Predicting impressions created by combinations of emotion and social identity\" ''Social Psychology Quarterly'' '''52''': 141\u2013148.</ref> focused specifically on emotion descriptors combined with identities (e.g., an angry child) and again found that emotion terms amalgamate with identities, and equations describing this kind of amalgamation are of the same form as equations describing trait-identity amalgamation.\n\n==Cross-cultural studies==\nStudies of various kinds of impression formation have been conducted in Canada,<ref>MacKinnon, Neil J. (1985/1988/1998).

For example, in every culture that has been studied, Evaluation of an actor was determined by-among other things-a stability effect, a suffusion from the behavior Evaluation, and an interaction that rewarded an actor for performing a behavior whose Evaluation was consistent with the Evaluation of the object person.\n\nOn the other hand, each culture weighted the core effects distinctively. For example, the impact of behavior-object Evaluation consistency was much smaller in Germany than in the United States, Canada, or Japan, suggesting that [[Morality|moral]] judgments of actors have a somewhat different basis in Germany than in the other cultures. Additionally, impression-formation processes involved some unique interactions in each culture. For example, attribute-identity amalgamations in Germany involved some Potency and Activity interactions that did not appear in other cultures.\n\nA book, ''Surveying Cultures''<ref>Heise, D. R. ''Surveying Cultures: Discovering Shared Conceptions and Sentiments'' (Wiley Interscience, 2010)</ref> reviewed [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural research]] on impression-formation processes, and provided guidelines for conducting impression-formation studies in cultures where the processes are unexplored currently.\n\n== Recent Studies ==\nImpression formation is based on the characteristics of both the perceivers and targets. However, research has not been able to quantify the extent to which these two groups contribute to impression.
