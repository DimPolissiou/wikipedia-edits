The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. \n \nScientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|quantum effects]] such as [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]].\n\n==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==\nAt temperatures near {{convert|0|K|C F}}, nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]], where ''S'' is the [[entropy]]. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form [[perfect crystal]]s as ''T'' \u2192 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero in which a perfect crystal is gone. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''[[Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem]]'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any [[isothermal process]] approaches zero as ''T'' \u2192 0:\n:<math> \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\Delta S = 0 </math>\n\nThe implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value.\n\n<blockquote>The [[Third law of thermodynamics|Nerst postulate]] identifies the [[isothermal process|isotherm]] T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line\u2013line intersection|intersect]] the T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248&nbsp;Callen, pp.&nbsp;189\u2013190)</blockquote>\n\nA perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.\n\nPerfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get \"frozen in\" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.\n\nUsing the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;4</sup>. (Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated.\n\nSince the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is\n\n:<math> \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\,</math>\n\nthus, as ''T'' decreases, \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' approach each other (so long as \u0394''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If \u0394''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition \u0394''G''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 may imply that \u0394''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''\u0394''S'' term is large enough.\n\nMoreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This ensures that \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&nbsp;186\u2013187)\n\nOne model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermion]]s, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.\n\n==Relation with Bose\u2013Einstein condensate==\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensate}}\n\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''<sub>2</sub>/''T''<sub>1</sub>, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.<ref name=\"sib2115\"/>\n\n==Negative temperatures==\n{{Main|Negative temperature}}\n\nTemperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[Thermodynamic system|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvins) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.<ref name=\"Chase\">{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815144418/http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.<ref name=\"Chase\"/> As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero]]\nOne of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]].

The [[kinetic energy]] of the ground state cannot be removed. \n \nScientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|quantum effects]] such as [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]].\n\n==Thermodynamics near absolute zero==\nAt temperatures near {{convert|0|K|C F}}, nearly all molecular motion ceases and \u0394''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for any [[adiabatic process]], where ''S'' is the [[entropy]]. In such a circumstance, pure substances can (ideally) form [[perfect crystal]]s as ''T'' \u2192 0. [[Max Planck]]'s strong form of the [[third law of thermodynamics]] states the [[entropy]] of a perfect crystal vanishes at absolute zero in which a perfect crystal is gone. The original [[Walther Nernst|Nernst]] ''[[Nernst heat theorem|heat theorem]]'' makes the weaker and less controversial claim that the entropy change for any [[isothermal process]] approaches zero as ''T'' \u2192 0:\n:<math> \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\Delta S = 0 </math>\n\nThe implication is that the entropy of a perfect crystal approaches a constant value.\n\n<blockquote>The [[Third law of thermodynamics|Nerst postulate]] identifies the [[isothermal process|isotherm]] T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as coincident with the [[adiabat]] S&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, although other isotherms and adiabats are distinct. As no two adiabats intersect, no other adiabat can [[Line\u2013line intersection|intersect]] the T&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 isotherm. Consequently no adiabatic process initiated at nonzero temperature can lead to zero temperature. (\u2248&nbsp;Callen, pp.&nbsp;189\u2013190)</blockquote>\n\nA perfect crystal is one in which the internal [[lattice (group)|lattice]] structure extends uninterrupted in all directions. The perfect order can be represented by translational [[symmetry]] along three (not usually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]) [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]]. Every lattice element of the structure is in its proper place, whether it is a single atom or a molecular grouping. For [[chemical substance|substances]] that exist in two (or more) stable crystalline forms, such as diamond and [[graphite]] for [[carbon]], there is a kind of ''chemical degeneracy''. The question remains whether both can have zero entropy at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 even though each is perfectly ordered.\n\nPerfect crystals never occur in practice; imperfections, and even entire amorphous material inclusions, can and do get \"frozen in\" at low temperatures, so transitions to more stable states do not occur.\n\nUsing the [[Debye model]], the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and entropy of a pure crystal are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;3</sup>, while the [[enthalpy]] and [[chemical potential]] are proportional to ''T''<sup>&nbsp;4</sup>. (Guggenheim, p.&nbsp;111) These quantities drop toward their ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 limiting values and approach with ''zero'' slopes. For the specific heats at least, the limiting value itself is definitely zero, as borne out by experiments to below 10&nbsp;K. Even the less detailed [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] shows this curious drop in specific heats. In fact, all specific heats vanish at absolute zero, not just those of crystals. Likewise for the coefficient of [[thermal expansion]]. [[Maxwell relations|Maxwell's relations]] show that various other quantities also vanish. These [[phenomenon|phenomena]] were unanticipated.\n\nSince the relation between changes in [[Gibbs free energy]] (''G''), the enthalpy (''H'') and the entropy is\n\n:<math> \\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\Delta S \\,</math>\n\nthus, as ''T'' decreases, \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' approach each other (so long as \u0394''S'' is bounded). Experimentally, it is found that all spontaneous processes (including [[chemical reaction]]s) result in a decrease in ''G'' as they proceed toward [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. If \u0394''S'' and/or ''T'' are small, the condition \u0394''G''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0 may imply that \u0394''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0, which would indicate an [[exothermic]] reaction. However, this is not required; [[endothermic]] reactions can proceed spontaneously if the ''T''\u0394''S'' term is large enough.\n\nMoreover, the slopes of the [[derivative]]s of \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' converge and are equal to zero at ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. This ensures that \u0394''G'' and \u0394''H'' are nearly the same over a considerable range of temperatures and justifies the approximate [[empiricism|empirical]] Principle of Thomsen and Berthelot, which states that ''the equilibrium state to which a system proceeds is the one that evolves the greatest amount of heat'', i.e., an actual process is the ''most exothermic one''. (Callen, pp.&nbsp;186\u2013187)\n\nOne model that estimates the properties of an [[electron]] gas at absolute zero in metals is the [[Fermi gas]]. The electrons, being [[Fermion]]s, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical [[velocities]], even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the [[Fermi energy]]. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is of the order of 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical [[equipartition theorem]] for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.\n\n==Relation with Bose\u2013Einstein condensate==\n{{Main|Bose\u2013Einstein condensate}}\n\n[[File:Bose Einstein condensate.png|left|thumb|Velocity-distribution data of a gas of [[rubidium]] atoms at a temperature within a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero.

Absolute temperature measurement is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which specifies the size of the ''degree'', so the ''ratios'' of two absolute temperatures, ''T''<sub>2</sub>/''T''<sub>1</sub>, are the same in all scales. The most transparent definition of this standard comes from the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]]. It can also be found in [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] (for particles of half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]]) and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] (for particles of integer spin). All of these define the relative numbers of particles in a system as decreasing [[exponential function]]s of energy (at the particle level) over ''kT'', with ''k'' representing the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' representing the temperature observed at the [[macroscopic]] level.<ref name=\"sib2115\"/>\n\n==Negative temperatures==\n{{Main|Negative temperature}}\n\nTemperatures that are expressed as negative numbers on the familiar Celsius or Fahrenheit scales are simply colder than the zero points of those scales. Certain [[Thermodynamic system|systems]] can achieve truly negative temperatures; that is, their [[thermodynamic temperature]] (expressed in kelvins) can be of a [[Negative number|negative]] quantity. A system with a truly negative temperature is not colder than absolute zero. Rather, a system with a negative temperature is hotter than ''any'' system with a positive temperature, in the sense that if a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat flows from the negative to the positive-temperature system.<ref name=\"Chase\">{{cite web|last=Chase|first=Scott|title=Below Absolute Zero -What Does Negative Temperature Mean?|url=http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|work=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=2010-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815144418/http://www.phys.ncku.edu.tw/mirrors/physicsfaq/ParticleAndNuclear/neg_temperature.html|archive-date=15 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMost familiar systems cannot achieve negative temperatures because adding energy always increases their [[entropy]]. However, some systems have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease. Because temperature is defined by the relationship between energy and entropy, such a system's temperature becomes negative, even though energy is being added.<ref name=\"Chase\"/> As a result, the Boltzmann factor for states of systems at negative temperature increases rather than decreases with increasing state energy. Therefore, no complete system, i.e. including the electromagnetic modes, can have negative temperatures, since there is no highest energy state,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} so that the sum of the probabilities of the states would diverge for negative temperatures. However, for quasi-equilibrium systems (e.g. spins out of equilibrium with the electromagnetic field) this argument does not apply, and negative effective temperatures are attainable.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, physicists announced that for the first time they had created a quantum gas made up of potassium atoms with a negative temperature in motional degrees of freedom.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature.2013.12146|title=Quantum gas goes below absolute zero|journal=Nature|year=2013|last1=Merali|first1=Zeeya}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Robert Boyle]] pioneered the idea of an absolute zero]]\nOne of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was [[Robert Boyle]].

His instrument indicated temperatures by the height at which a certain mass of air sustained a column of mercury\u2014the volume, or \"spring\" of the air varying with temperature. Amontons therefore argued that the zero of his thermometer would be that temperature at which the spring of the air was reduced to nothing. He used a scale that marked the boiling point of water at +73 and the melting point of ice at +{{frac|51|1|2}}, so that the zero was equivalent to about \u2212240 on the Celsius scale.<ref name=AS2016>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Cold}}</ref> Amontons held that the absolute zero cannot be reached, so never attempted to compute it explicitly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Talbot |first1=G.R. |last2=Pacey |first2=A.C. |date=1972 |title=Antecedents of thermodynamics in the work of Guillaume Amontons |journal=Centaurus |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=20\u201340 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1972.tb00163.x|bibcode=1972Cent...16...20T }}</ref>\nThe value of \u2212240&nbsp;\u00b0C, or \"431 divisions [in Fahrenheit's thermometer] below the cold of freezing water\"<ref>{{Google books|tSm2Ws6bg0oC|Essays Medical and Philosophical|page=PA291}}</ref> was published by [[George Martine (physician)|George Martine]] in 1740.\n\nThis close approximation to the modern value of \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C<ref name=\"sib2115\"/> for the zero of the air thermometer was further improved upon in 1779 by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]], who observed that {{convert|-270|C|F K}} might be regarded as absolute cold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=Johann Heinrich|title=Pyrometrie|location=Berlin|year=1779|oclc=165756016}}</ref>\n\nValues of this order for the absolute zero were not, however, universally accepted about this period. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], in their 1780 treatise on heat, arrived at values ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 below the freezing point of water, and thought that in any case it must be at least 600 below.

The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, provision of services, and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative [[metropolitan area]].{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=234}} The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included [[Borough of Rossendale|Rossendale]]), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including [[Macclesfield]], [[Warrington]], [[Alderley Edge]], [[Northwich]], [[Middlewich]], [[Wilmslow]] and [[Lymm]]), and Derbyshire (the towns of [[New Mills]], [[Whaley Bridge]], [[Glossop]] and [[Chapel-en-le-Frith]] \u2013 a minority report suggested that [[Buxton]] be included).{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|1969|pp=219\u2013235}} The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside.{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|1969|pp=219\u2013235}} The report noted \"The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult\".{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=233}} Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] intended to define the \"South-East Lancashire conurbation\" noted that \"Greater Manchester it is not&nbsp;... One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns,&nbsp;... all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance\".{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=264}} The term ''Selnec'' (or ''SELNEC'') was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as \"the most convenient term available\", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire.{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|1969|pp=219\u2013235}}\n\nFollowing the [[Transport Act 1968]], in 1969 the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive]] (an authority to co-ordinate and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area smaller than the proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and [[Saddleworth]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It excluded Wigan, which was both in the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not been part of the 1958 act's review area).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selnec.org.uk/selnec.htm|publisher=selnec.org.uk|author=The SELNEC Preservation Society|title=The Formation of the SELNEC PTE|accessdate=6 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nRedcliffe-Maud's recommendations were accepted by the Labour-controlled government in February 1970.{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1975|pp=46\u20137, 56, 157}} Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their [[county council]]s had enough revenue to remain competitive ([[Cheshire County Council]] would have ceased to exist).{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1975|pp=46\u20137, 56, 157}} Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]]. Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed \"Botchdale\" by local MP [[Michael Fidler]])<ref>{{cite hansard|house=House of Commons|date=6 July 1972|column_start=763|column_end=834}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Lancashire saved from 'Botchdale'|work=The Times|date=7 July 1972|page=8}}</ref> but were divided into separate boroughs.

The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county.{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=246}} The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation\u2014much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles.{{sfn|Bristow|Cross|1983|p=30}} Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|pp=246, 255}}\n\nBecause of political objection, particularly from Cheshire, Greater Manchester covered only the inner, urban 62 of the 90 former districts that the Royal Commission had outlined as an effective administrative metropolitan area.{{sfn|Wannop|2002|pp=144\u2013145}} In this capacity, GMCC found itself \"planning for an arbitrary metropolitan area&nbsp;... abruptly truncated to the south\", and so had to negotiate several land-use, transport and housing projects with its neighbouring county councils.{{sfn|Wannop|2002|pp=144\u2013145}} However a \"major programme of environmental action\" by GMCC broadly succeeded in reversing social deprevation in its inner city slums.{{sfn|Wannop|2002|pp=144\u2013145}} Leisure and recreational successes included the Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded [[Manchester Central (Conference Centre)|Manchester Central]]), a converted former railway station in Manchester city centre used for cultural events,{{sfn|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|pp=214\u20135}} and GMCC's creation of five new [[country park]]s within its boundaries.{{sfn|Taylor|Evans|Fraser|1996|p=76}} GMCC was, however, criticised for being too Manchester-centric by representatives from the outer suburbs.{{sfn|Clapson|2010|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nUnlike the other counties created by the Act, Greater Manchester was never adopted as a [[Postal counties of the United Kingdom|postal county]] by the [[Royal Mail]].

It reported on the \"increasing demands for the exploration of the possibilities of a greater merger of [[public services]] throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities\".{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=227}} The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and [[County Borough of Salford|Salford]].

The [[Local Government Commission for England (1958\u20131967)|Local Government Commission for England]] presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county based on the conurbation surrounding and including Manchester, with nine most-purpose boroughs corresponding to the modern Greater Manchester boroughs (excluding Wigan). The review was abolished in favour of the Royal Commission on Local Government before issuing a final report.{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=231}}\n\nThe Royal Commission's 1969 report, known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, proposed the removal of much of the then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban]] and [[rural district]]s separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation. The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, provision of services, and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative [[metropolitan area]].{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=234}} The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included [[Borough of Rossendale|Rossendale]]), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including [[Macclesfield]], [[Warrington]], [[Alderley Edge]], [[Northwich]], [[Middlewich]], [[Wilmslow]] and [[Lymm]]), and Derbyshire (the towns of [[New Mills]], [[Whaley Bridge]], [[Glossop]] and [[Chapel-en-le-Frith]] \u2013 a minority report suggested that [[Buxton]] be included).{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|1969|pp=219\u2013235}} The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside.{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|1969|pp=219\u2013235}} The report noted \"The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult\".{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=233}} Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] intended to define the \"South-East Lancashire conurbation\" noted that \"Greater Manchester it is not&nbsp;... One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns,&nbsp;... all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance\".{{sfn|Frangopulo|1977|p=264}} The term ''Selnec'' (or ''SELNEC'') was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as \"the most convenient term available\", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire.{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|1969|pp=219\u2013235}}\n\nFollowing the [[Transport Act 1968]], in 1969 the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive]] (an authority to co-ordinate and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area smaller than the proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and [[Saddleworth]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It excluded Wigan, which was both in the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not been part of the 1958 act's review area).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selnec.org.uk/selnec.htm|publisher=selnec.org.uk|author=The SELNEC Preservation Society|title=The Formation of the SELNEC PTE|accessdate=6 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nRedcliffe-Maud's recommendations were accepted by the Labour-controlled government in February 1970.{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1975|pp=46\u20137, 56, 157}} Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their [[county council]]s had enough revenue to remain competitive ([[Cheshire County Council]] would have ceased to exist).{{sfn|Redcliffe-Maud|Wood|1975|pp=46\u20137, 56, 157}} Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the [[Metropolitan Borough of Bury]] and the [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale]].

He was one of the original members of [[Royal Southern Brotherhood]] and contributed to their first two studio albums and toured with them.

Layla has always appealed to me because you can really really \u2018feel\u2019 what [[Eric Clapton|Clapton]] was going through. That man was straight up in love.

He was one of the original members of [[Royal Southern Brotherhood]] and contributed to their first two studio albums and toured with them.
