In 1698, Media\u0219 already had 33 unions.\n\nIn the 19th century, unions started to merge and build factories. The first factory, called \"Karres\", was established in 1881 and produced various leather products. In 1888, a factory that manufactured cloth and various textiles was built, followed in 1895 by a factory called \"Salconserv\" that produced salami and cans. The company used to produce the famous brand of salami called [[Salam de Sibiu]], for the company \"Theil & Co. A.G. Salami und Selchwarenfabrik\", located in Sibiu.\n\nIn 1921, Media\u0219 started to manufacture windows. The factory is now called Geromed and extended its products with blackboards, mirrors, windscreens and stained glass. In the same year, a factory now called Emailul started to produce [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] pots, mugs and dishes.\n\nThe \"Vitrometan\" factory was built in 1922 and produces various glass products, including porcelain, light bulbs and mirrors. \"Relee S.A\" manufactures automobile components, switches, wall sockets, relays and electric motors.\n\nMedia\u0219 is known best for its role in production of [[methane gas]].

Its construction started in the 13th century. In the 15th century it was raised to 5 tiers. The St. Margaret Church was finished at about the same time. Later, 3 more tiers were added in only two months. The roof consists of colored vitrified tiles, and four turrets were built. The tower had a guard, who would sound his bugle whenever an enemy approached.  The tower has in its South-Western corner (between the clocks) a small wooden man who rings a bell, thus announcing in advance when the clock will ring on the hour. The heavy pressure of the tower on the sandy soil is the reason why the tower is slightly tilted to the North. Between 1927 and 1930, and later in 1972, the tower was consolidated. The tilt of the tip compared with the base is 2.32 m.\n\nThe city lies in the middle of the area which was inhabited by [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and in an area of 20&nbsp;km around it there are dozens of [[Fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]], two of them [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage sites]].\n\n'''[[St. Margaret's Church, Media\u0219|St. Margaret's Church]]:''' The fortified church was built in gothic style in 1488, with time it went through different modifications. The feeble ground structure made its tower, built in 1460, incline. In 1550 the church was raised with three storeys and in 1551 four smaller towers were added to show that the city had a court. It was at that time that it gained its 68.5 meters height. In 1783 the roof-structure was changed and the small towers renovated, it was also then that the golden globe, dating from 1550, was brought down from the tower and according to tradition its content was read aloud. The tower proved to be a good spotting post. In those times the trumpeter in the tower had an important function, sounding the alert about approaching danger. If he made a mistake, he would've been thrown out from the top of the tower. From this does the towers name derive, Trumpeters tower. In this tower was ordered to be locked [[Vlad the Impaler]], a.k.a. Dracula, by King Matyas in 1476. On the inside walls of the church one can see 14th- or 15th-century frescoes. The altar was made in 1480 in gothic style, and portrays the sufferings of Jesus. On the portrait, below the crucified Jesus' arm, a panorama of [[Vienna]] can be observed, thereby indicating  the portrait's origin. The church walls are also decorated with eastern wall carpets given to the church by Christians, some dating back to the 16th century. In the church there is the oldest brazen baptistry in Romania, made at the beginning of the 19th century. The canopy of the pulpit was made in 1679 by master Sigismund Moess. Its pipe-organ, from 1755, is appropriate for symphony concerts. While those concerts happen, the church benches are turned to face the pipe-organ.\n\n==Wine==\nThe grapes and wine leaves visible in the city's coat of arms refer to the (once well-known) wine from Media\u0219. For example, the wine is mentioned early in [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel [[Dracula]]: \"The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable\" ([[Jonathan Harker]]'s diary, May 5, on his way to the castle of the count).\n\n==Sports==\n*Football: [[Gaz Metan Media\u0219]] - playing in the [[Liga I]].\n*Basketball: [[CSM Media\u0219 (basketball)|CSM Media\u0219]] - playing in the [[Romanian Basketball Division A|Division A]].\n*Cycling: The annual [[mountain bike]] marathon (in Romanian: ''Maratonul Medieval Media\u0219'') is a popular bicycle race usually held in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ciclist.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/biciclete-vin-si-istorie-toate-la-medias|title=Biciclete, vin \u0219i istorie \u2013 toate la Media\u0219 - Veni, vidi, velo !|work=Veni, vidi, velo !}}</ref>\n\n==Natives==\n*Ioan Adam \n*[[Marius Baciu]]\n*Andreas Brecht von Brechtenberg  \n*Octavian Fodor\n*[[Giulio Gari]]\n*Ioan Ghi\u0219e\n*Tudor Cristian Jurgiu\n*[[Margareta Keszeg]]\n*[[Paul Traugott Meissner]]\n*[[Estelle Nathan]]\n*[[George Puflea]]\n*[[Stephan Ludwig Roth]]\n*Adrian Andrei Rusu\n*[[Christian Schesaeus]]\n*Ruxandra Sireteanu\n*[[Willi Schneider (skeleton racer)|Willie Schneider]]\n*Mihaela Tatu\n*George Togan\n*[[Michael Wei\u00df (politician)|Michael Wei\u00df]]\n\n==International relations==\n{{Main article|List of twin towns and sister cities in Romania}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 sister cities===\nMedia\u0219 is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Orase Infratite|url=http://www.primariamedias.ro/portal/medias/portal.nsf/AllByUNID/Orase-Infratite-0000183E?OpenDocument|website=primariamedias.ro|publisher=Media\u0219|language=ro|accessdate=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|MDA}} [[Cricova]], Moldova\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|NED}} [[De Fryske Marren]], Netherlands\n<!--G\u0142og\u00f3w - twinning ended-->\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mineral Wells, Texas|Mineral Wells]], United States\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Sopron]], Hungary\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Media\u0219}}\n{{wikivoyage|Media\u0219}}\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061024143950/http://www.primariamedias.ro/fileadmin/primaria_medias/cam1_big.htm Webcam located in \"Corneliu Coposu\" square]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111108045413/http://www.rainer-beel.de/Medias.html Media\u015f Transylvanian beauty in transition]\n* [http://www.mediasch.de/ Heimatgemeinschaft Mediasch e.

In the same year, a factory now called Emailul started to produce [[Vitreous enamel|enameled]] pots, mugs and dishes.\n\nThe \"Vitrometan\" factory was built in 1922 and produces various glass products, including porcelain, light bulbs and mirrors. \"Relee S.A\" manufactures automobile components, switches, wall sockets, relays and electric motors.\n\nMedia\u0219 is known best for its role in production of [[methane gas]]. The area where Media\u0219 is located is the site of the largest [[natural gas field]] in Romania.

Its construction started in the 13th century. In the 15th century it was raised to 5 tiers. The St. Margaret Church was finished at about the same time. Later, 3 more tiers were added in only two months. The roof consists of colored vitrified tiles, and four turrets were built. The tower had a guard, who would sound his bugle whenever an enemy approached.  The tower has in its South-Western corner (between the clocks) a small wooden man who rings a bell, thus announcing in advance when the clock will ring on the hour. The heavy pressure of the tower on the sandy soil is the reason why the tower is slightly tilted to the North. Between 1927 and 1930, and later in 1972, the tower was consolidated. The tilt of the tip compared with the base is 2.32 m.\n\nThe city lies in the middle of the area which was inhabited by [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and in an area of 20&nbsp;km around it there are dozens of [[Fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]], two of them [[UNESCO]] [[World heritage sites]].\n\n'''[[St. Margaret's Church, Media\u0219|St. Margaret's Church]]:''' The fortified church was built in gothic style in 1488, with time it went through different modifications. The feeble ground structure made its tower, built in 1460, incline. In 1550 the church was raised with three storeys and in 1551 four smaller towers were added to show that the city had a court. It was at that time that it gained its 68.5 meters height. In 1783 the roof-structure was changed and the small towers renovated, it was also then that the golden globe, dating from 1550, was brought down from the tower and according to tradition its content was read aloud. The tower proved to be a good spotting post. In those times the trumpeter in the tower had an important function, sounding the alert about approaching danger. If he made a mistake, he would've been thrown out from the top of the tower. From this does the towers name derive, Trumpeters tower. In this tower was ordered to be locked [[Vlad the Impaler]], a.k.a. Dracula, by King Matyas in 1476. On the inside walls of the church one can see 14th- or 15th-century frescoes. The altar was made in 1480 in gothic style, and portrays the sufferings of Jesus. On the portrait, below the crucified Jesus' arm, a panorama of [[Vienna]] can be observed, thereby indicating  the portrait's origin. The church walls are also decorated with eastern wall carpets given to the church by Christians, some dating back to the 16th century. In the church there is the oldest brazen baptistry in Romania, made at the beginning of the 19th century. The canopy of the pulpit was made in 1679 by master Sigismund Moess. Its pipe-organ, from 1755, is appropriate for symphony concerts. While those concerts happen, the church benches are turned to face the pipe-organ.\n\n==Wine==\nThe grapes and wine leaves visible in the city's coat of arms refer to the (once well-known) wine from Media\u0219. For example, the wine is mentioned early in [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel [[Dracula]]: \"The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable\" ([[Jonathan Harker]]'s diary, May 5, on his way to the castle of the count).\n\n==Sports==\n*Football: [[Gaz Metan Media\u0219]] - playing in the [[Liga I]].\n*Basketball: [[CSM Media\u0219 (basketball)|CSM Media\u0219]] - playing in the [[Romanian Basketball Division A|Division A]].\n*Cycling: The annual [[mountain bike]] marathon (in Romanian: ''Maratonul Medieval Media\u0219'') is a popular bicycle race usually held in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ciclist.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/biciclete-vin-si-istorie-toate-la-medias|title=Biciclete, vin \u0219i istorie \u2013 toate la Media\u0219 - Veni, vidi, velo !|work=Veni, vidi, velo !}}</ref>\n\n==Natives==\n*Ioan Adam \n*[[Marius Baciu]]\n*Andreas Brecht von Brechtenberg  \n*Octavian Fodor\n*[[Giulio Gari]]\n*Ioan Ghi\u0219e\n*Tudor Cristian Jurgiu\n*[[Margareta Keszeg]]\n*[[Paul Traugott Meissner]]\n*[[Estelle Nathan]]\n*[[George Puflea]]\n*[[Stephan Ludwig Roth]]\n*Adrian Andrei Rusu\n*[[Christian Schesaeus]]\n*Ruxandra Sireteanu\n*[[Willi Schneider (skeleton racer)|Willie Schneider]]\n*Mihaela Tatu\n*George Togan\n*[[Michael Wei\u00df (politician)|Michael Wei\u00df]]\n\n==International relations==\n{{Main article|List of twin towns and sister cities in Romania}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 sister cities===\nMedia\u0219 is [[town twinning|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Orase Infratite|url=http://www.primariamedias.ro/portal/medias/portal.nsf/AllByUNID/Orase-Infratite-0000183E?OpenDocument|website=primariamedias.ro|publisher=Media\u0219|language=ro|accessdate=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|MDA}} [[Cricova]], Moldova\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[D\u0105browa G\u00f3rnicza]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|NED}} [[De Fryske Marren]], Netherlands\n<!--G\u0142og\u00f3w - twinning ended-->\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Mineral Wells, Texas|Mineral Wells]], United States\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Sopron]], Hungary\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Media\u0219}}\n{{wikivoyage|Media\u0219}}\n\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061024143950/http://www.primariamedias.ro/fileadmin/primaria_medias/cam1_big.htm Webcam located in \"Corneliu Coposu\" square]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111108045413/http://www.rainer-beel.de/Medias.html Media\u015f Transylvanian beauty in transition]\n* [http://www.mediasch.de/ Heimatgemeinschaft Mediasch e.

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations. In response to the controversy, BioWare released the ''Extended Cut'' [[downloadable content]] pack, which expands upon the original ending. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Game of the Year from ''[[Game Informer]]''. In March 2017, it was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 3'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes control of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Prima Character\">{{cite book|last1=Musa|first1=Alexander|last2=Bueno|first2=Fernando|last3=Lierop|first3=Raphael Van|title=Mass Effect 3: Prima Official Game Guide|date=2012|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0-307-89148-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> If the player has a completed [[saved game]] from ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the character from that game can be imported.<ref name=\"Import\">{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Colin|title=Mass Effect 3 Review: Page 2 of 3|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/06/mass-effect-3-review?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> By importing an old character, decisions from prior ''Mass Effect'' titles are carried over, which impacts the plot of ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Import\" /> Similar to previous installments in the series, the player is able to choose from six different [[character class]]es that each have their own unique set of skills.<ref name=\"Tips\">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Kate|title=Before You Start\u2026 Tips for Playing Mass Effect 3 The Best Way|url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HQfbTNo?url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Adept class is proficient in [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers whereas the Soldier class is proficient in weapons.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> By completing assignments and [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], the player is rewarded with [[experience point]]s.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> Once enough points are earned, Shepard levels up, which allows for the unlocking or upgrading of skills along a [[Glossary of video game terms#Skilltree|tree]].<ref name=GSCC>{{cite web|url=http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |title=Comic-Con 2011: Mass Effect 3 Hands-On Preview - Biotics and Branching Upgrades |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |website=[[GameSpot]]|last1=McInnis|first1=Shaun}}</ref>\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' has three pre-set [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] modes: Action, Story, and RPG.<ref name=\"Three Modes\">{{cite magazine |last1=Francis |first1=Tom |title=Mass Effect 3 Narrative Mode and Action Mode explained |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 3, 2018 |date=March 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HSz91FS?url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Action Mode, conversations have automatic replies and normal combat difficulty; in Story Mode, conversations have manual replies and minimal combat difficulty; and in RPG Mode, conversations have manual replies and normal combat difficulty.<ref name=\"Three Modes\" /> The game contains various [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements,<ref name=Best>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|title=BioWare: Mass Effect 3 Is the Best Game We've Ever Made|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011|last=Westbrook|first=Logan|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HT6O6rv?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ability to augment guns with different ammo types, barrels, modifications, and scopes to improve their effectiveness in combat.

Regardless, Anderson is also killed in the process. Shepard attempts to fire off the Crucible, only to instead be lifted to the pinnacle of the Citadel, where a childlike artificial intelligence appears, who had appeared in Shepard's dreams several times.

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]].

attention for its lasting impact on the reputation of ''Mass Effect 3''. For example, a 2017 article by James Davenport of ''PC Gamer'' opined that the game's ending received an \"inordinate\" amount of criticism, and while he agreed that the ending was \"problematic\", he also noted that fixating on the ending could distract players from other aspects of the game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davenport |first1=James |title=The Mass Effect games ranked from worst to best |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-mass-effect-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |website=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=December 26, 2019 |date=April 27, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200104202828/https://www.pcgamer.com/the-mass-effect-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |archivedate=January 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2018, Lucy O'Brien of IGN posited that BioWare's cooperative response to \"Retake Mass Effect\" contributed to a paradigm shift in how consumers influence video game developers.

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations. In response to the controversy, BioWare released the ''Extended Cut'' [[downloadable content]] pack, which expands upon the original ending. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Game of the Year from ''[[Game Informer]]''. In March 2017, it was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 3'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes control of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Prima Character\">{{cite book|last1=Musa|first1=Alexander|last2=Bueno|first2=Fernando|last3=Lierop|first3=Raphael Van|title=Mass Effect 3: Prima Official Game Guide|date=2012|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0-307-89148-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> If the player has a completed [[saved game]] from ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the character from that game can be imported.<ref name=\"Import\">{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Colin|title=Mass Effect 3 Review: Page 2 of 3|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/06/mass-effect-3-review?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> By importing an old character, decisions from prior ''Mass Effect'' titles are carried over, which impacts the plot of ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Import\" /> Similar to previous installments in the series, the player is able to choose from six different [[character class]]es that each have their own unique set of skills.<ref name=\"Tips\">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Kate|title=Before You Start\u2026 Tips for Playing Mass Effect 3 The Best Way|url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HQfbTNo?url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Adept class is proficient in [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers whereas the Soldier class is proficient in weapons.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> By completing assignments and [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], the player is rewarded with [[experience point]]s.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> Once enough points are earned, Shepard levels up, which allows for the unlocking or upgrading of skills along a [[Glossary of video game terms#Skilltree|tree]].<ref name=GSCC>{{cite web|url=http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |title=Comic-Con 2011: Mass Effect 3 Hands-On Preview - Biotics and Branching Upgrades |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |website=[[GameSpot]]|last1=McInnis|first1=Shaun}}</ref>\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' has three pre-set [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] modes: Action, Story, and RPG.<ref name=\"Three Modes\">{{cite magazine |last1=Francis |first1=Tom |title=Mass Effect 3 Narrative Mode and Action Mode explained |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 3, 2018 |date=March 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HSz91FS?url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Action Mode, conversations have automatic replies and normal combat difficulty; in Story Mode, conversations have manual replies and minimal combat difficulty; and in RPG Mode, conversations have manual replies and normal combat difficulty.<ref name=\"Three Modes\" /> The game contains various [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements,<ref name=Best>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|title=BioWare: Mass Effect 3 Is the Best Game We've Ever Made|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011|last=Westbrook|first=Logan|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HT6O6rv?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ability to augment guns with different ammo types, barrels, modifications, and scopes to improve their effectiveness in combat.

attention for its lasting impact on the reputation of ''Mass Effect 3''. For example, a 2017 article by James Davenport of ''PC Gamer'' opined that the game's ending received an \"inordinate\" amount of criticism, and while he agreed that the ending was \"problematic\", he also noted that fixating on the ending could distract players from other aspects of the game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davenport |first1=James |title=The Mass Effect games ranked from worst to best |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-mass-effect-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |website=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=December 26, 2019 |date=April 27, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200104202828/https://www.pcgamer.com/the-mass-effect-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |archivedate=January 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2018, Lucy O'Brien of IGN posited that BioWare's cooperative response to \"Retake Mass Effect\" contributed to a paradigm shift in how consumers influence video game developers.

It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=190|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==

It reveals the events that led to each crisis or disaster, their causes as determined by the official investigating body or bodies, and the measures they recommended to prevent a similar incident from happening again. The programs use [[Historical reenactment|re-enactment]]s, [[interviews]], [[eyewitness testimony]], [[computer-generated imagery]], [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recording]]s, and official reports to reconstruct the sequences of events.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2020|03|12|num=190|title=Mayday|uk=yes}} This includes five ''Science of Disaster'' specials, each examining multiple crashes with similar causes. For broadcasters that do not use the series name ''Mayday'', three Season 3 episodes were labeled as ''Crash Scene Investigation'' spin-offs, examining marine or rail disasters.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==

It is notable for its explicitly [[[https://yespornpleasexxx.com/ erotic]]] scenes featuring elements of [https://yespornpleasexxx.com/ sexual practices] involving [[BDSM]] ([[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]]/[[Discipline (BDSM)|discipline]], [[Dominance and submission|dominance/submission]], and [[Sadomasochism|sadism/masochism]]). Originally [[Self-publishing|self-published]] as an [[ebook]] and [[print-on-demand]] in June 2011, the publishing rights to the novel were acquired by [[Vintage Books]] in March 2012.\n\n''Fifty Shades of Grey'' has topped [[Best Sellers list|best-seller lists]] around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015{{Citation need|reason=this number probably refers to the series not the book|date=January 2020}}. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor, while its portrayal of [https://yespornpleasexxx.com/ BDSM] has been targeted for criticism from a variety of perspectives. [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Focus Features]] produced an American [[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|film adaptation]], which was released on 13 February 2015,<ref name=Variety>{{cite news|title=Universal Shifts '50 Shades' Release Date to February 2015|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/universal-shifts-50-shades-release-date-to-february-2015-1200826341/ |work=Variety|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> and also received unfavourable reviews even though it was a box office success.\n\nThe second and third volumes of the [[Fifty Shades trilogy|original trilogy]], ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed]]'', were published in 2012.  A version of the novel from Christian's point of view, ''[[Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian]]'', was published in June 2015 as the fourth book. ''[[Darker: Fifty Shades Darker as Told by Christian]]'', published in November 2017, is the fifth book in the series.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey is one of the best BDSM books.\n\n==Plot==\nAnastasia \"Ana\" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending [[Washington State University Vancouver|Washington State University]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. Her best friend is Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy [[Seattle]] entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez.\n\nThe next day Jos\u00e9, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the [[Heathman Hotel]], where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out for coffee and asks if she is dating anyone, specifically Jos\u00e9. Ana replies that she is not dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued, but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up [[drunk dialing]] Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and Jos\u00e9 attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill in paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.\n\nAna goes on a date with Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, ''Charlie Tango'', to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of [[BDSM]] toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of [[dominance and submission]], and there will be no romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making eye contact with him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a [[Virginity|virgin]] and takes her virginity without making her sign the contract. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was [[homosexual]], because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.\n\nOver the next few days, Ana receives several packages from Christian. These include a laptop to enable her to research the BDSM lifestyle in consideration of the contract; to communicate with him, since she has never previously owned a computer; and to receive a more detailed version of the dominant/submissive contract. She and Christian email each other, with Ana teasing him and refusing to honour parts of the contract, such as only eating foods from a specific list. Ana later meets with Christian to discuss the contract and becomes overwhelmed by the potential BDSM arrangement and the potential of having a sexual relationship with Christian that is not romantic in nature. Because of these feelings, Ana runs away from Christian and does not see him again until her college graduation, where he is a guest speaker. During this time, Ana agrees to sign the dominant/submissive contract. Ana and Christian once again meet to further discuss the contract, and they go over Ana's [[Limits (BDSM)|hard and soft limits]]. Christian spanks Ana for the first time, and the experience leaves her both enticed and slightly confused. This confusion is exacerbated by Christian's lavish gifts and the fact that he brings her to meet his family. The two continue with the arrangement without Ana's having yet signed the contract. After successfully landing a job with Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP), Ana further bristles under the restrictions of the non-disclosure agreement and her complex relationship with Christian. The tension between Ana and Christian eventually comes to a head after Ana asks Christian to punish her in order to show her how extreme a BDSM relationship with him could be. Christian fulfils Ana's request, beating her with a belt, and Ana realises they are incompatible. Devastated, she breaks up with Christian and returns to the apartment she shares with Kate.\n\n==Background and publication==\n[[File:E. L. James (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|James in 2012]]\nThe ''Fifty Shades'' trilogy was developed from a [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'']] [[fan fiction]] series originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name \"Snowqueen's Icedragon\". The piece featured characters named after [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].  After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote ''Master of the Universe'' as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication.<ref>{{cite web|work= Media bistro |url=http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine/50128?red=as|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=Boog, Jason|date=21 November 2012}}</ref> Meyer commented on the series, saying \"that's really not my genre, not my thing...

In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein multiple professionals read and assessed the books for characteristics of [[intimate partner violence]], or IPV, using the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC's]] standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.<ref name=\"pmid23931257\">{{Cite journal|last2=Altenburger|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Walton|first3=Nicole L.|date=September 2013|title=\"Double crap!\" Abuse and harmed identity in Fifty Shades of Grey|journal=[[J.

Originally [[Self-publishing|self-published]] as an [[ebook]] and [[print-on-demand]] in June 2011, the publishing rights to the novel were acquired by [[Vintage Books]] in March 2012.\n\n''Fifty Shades of Grey'' has topped [[Best Sellers list|best-seller lists]] around the world, selling over 125 million copies worldwide by June 2015{{Citation need|reason=this number probably refers to the series not the book|date=January 2020}}. It has been translated into 52 languages, and set a record in the United Kingdom as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. Critical reception of the book, however, has tended towards the negative, with the quality of its prose generally seen as poor, while its portrayal of BDSM has been targeted for criticism from a variety of perspectives. [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Focus Features]] produced an American [[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|film adaptation]], which was released on 13 February 2015,<ref name=Variety>{{cite news|title=Universal Shifts '50 Shades' Release Date to February 2015|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/universal-shifts-50-shades-release-date-to-february-2015-1200826341/ |work=Variety|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref> and also received unfavourable reviews even though it was a box office success.\n\nThe second and third volumes of the [[Fifty Shades trilogy|original trilogy]], ''[[Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed]]'', were published in 2012.  A version of the novel from Christian's point of view, ''[[Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian]]'', was published in June 2015 as the fourth book. ''[[Darker: Fifty Shades Darker as Told by Christian]]'', published in November 2017, is the fifth book in the series.\n\n==Plot==\nAnastasia \"Ana\" Steele is a 21-year-old college senior attending [[Washington State University Vancouver|Washington State University]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]]. Her best friend is Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh, who writes for the college newspaper. Due to an illness, Kate is unable to interview 27-year-old Christian Grey, a successful and wealthy [[Seattle]] entrepreneur, and asks Ana to take her place. Ana finds Christian attractive as well as intimidating. As a result, she stumbles through the interview and leaves Christian's office believing it went poorly. Ana does not expect to meet Christian again, but he appears at the hardware store where she works. While he purchases various items including cable ties, masking tape, and rope, Ana informs Christian that Kate would like some photographs to illustrate her article about him. Christian gives Ana his phone number. Later, Kate urges Ana to call Christian and arrange a photo shoot with their photographer friend, Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez.\n\nThe next day Jos\u00e9, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the [[Heathman Hotel]], where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out for coffee and asks if she is dating anyone, specifically Jos\u00e9. Ana replies that she is not dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued, but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up [[drunk dialing]] Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and Jos\u00e9 attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals that he would like to have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill in paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.\n\nAna goes on a date with Christian, on which he takes her in his helicopter, ''Charlie Tango'', to his apartment. Once there, Christian insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] forbidding her from discussing anything they do together, which Ana agrees to sign. He also mentions other paperwork, but first takes her to his playroom full of [[BDSM]] toys and gear. There, Christian informs her that the second contract will be one of [[dominance and submission]], and there will be no romantic relationship, only a sexual one. The contract even forbids Ana from touching Christian or making eye contact with him. At this point, Christian realises that Ana is a [[Virginity|virgin]] and takes her virginity without making her sign the contract. The following morning, Ana and Christian again have sex. His mother arrives moments after their sexual encounter and is surprised by the meeting, having previously thought Christian was [[homosexual]], because he was never seen with a woman. Christian later takes Ana out to eat, and he reveals that he lost his virginity at age 15 to one of his mother's friends, Elena Lincoln, and that his previous dominant/submissive relationships failed due to incompatibility. Christian also reveals that in his first dominant/submissive relationship he was the submissive. Christian and Ana plan to meet again, and he takes Ana home, where she discovers several job offers and admits to Kate that she and Christian had sex.\n\nOver the next few days, Ana receives several packages from Christian. These include a laptop to enable her to research the BDSM lifestyle in consideration of the contract; to communicate with him, since she has never previously owned a computer; and to receive a more detailed version of the dominant/submissive contract. She and Christian email each other, with Ana teasing him and refusing to honour parts of the contract, such as only eating foods from a specific list. Ana later meets with Christian to discuss the contract and becomes overwhelmed by the potential BDSM arrangement and the potential of having a sexual relationship with Christian that is not romantic in nature. Because of these feelings, Ana runs away from Christian and does not see him again until her college graduation, where he is a guest speaker. During this time, Ana agrees to sign the dominant/submissive contract. Ana and Christian once again meet to further discuss the contract, and they go over Ana's [[Limits (BDSM)|hard and soft limits]]. Christian spanks Ana for the first time, and the experience leaves her both enticed and slightly confused. This confusion is exacerbated by Christian's lavish gifts and the fact that he brings her to meet his family. The two continue with the arrangement without Ana's having yet signed the contract. After successfully landing a job with Seattle Independent Publishing (SIP), Ana further bristles under the restrictions of the non-disclosure agreement and her complex relationship with Christian. The tension between Ana and Christian eventually comes to a head after Ana asks Christian to punish her in order to show her how extreme a BDSM relationship with him could be. Christian fulfils Ana's request, beating her with a belt, and Ana realises they are incompatible. Devastated, she breaks up with Christian and returns to the apartment she shares with Kate.\n\n==Background and publication==\n[[File:E. L. James (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|James in 2012]]\nThe ''Fifty Shades'' trilogy was developed from a [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'']] [[fan fiction]] series originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name \"Snowqueen's Icedragon\". The piece featured characters named after [[Stephenie Meyer]]'s characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].  After comments concerning the sexual nature of the material, James removed the story from the fan-fiction websites and published it on her own website, FiftyShades.com. Later she rewrote ''Master of the Universe'' as an original piece, with the principal characters renamed Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele and removed it from her website before publication.<ref>{{cite web|work= Media bistro |url=http://www.adweek.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine/50128?red=as|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=Boog, Jason|date=21 November 2012}}</ref> Meyer commented on the series, saying \"that's really not my genre, not my thing...

In 2013, social scientist Professor Amy E. Bonomi published a study wherein multiple professionals read and assessed the books for characteristics of [[intimate partner violence]], or IPV, using the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC's]] standards for emotional abuse and sexual violence. The study found that nearly every interaction between Ana and Christian was emotionally abusive in nature, including stalking, intimidation, and isolation. The study group also observed pervasive sexual violence within the CDC's definition, including Christian's use of alcohol to circumvent Ana's ability to consent, and that Ana exhibits classic signs of an abused woman, including constant perceived threat, stressful managing, and altered identity.<ref name=\"pmid23931257\">{{Cite journal|last2=Altenburger|first2=Lauren E.|last3=Walton|first3=Nicole L.|date=September 2013|title=\"Double crap!\" Abuse and harmed identity in Fifty Shades of Grey|journal=[[J.
