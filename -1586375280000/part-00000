The club was founded on 5 April 1898 and home matches are played at [[Fratton Park]] in [[Milton, Portsmouth]].\n\nPortsmouth have been the top tier [[List of English football champions|Football League Champions of England]] twice consecutively in [[1948\u201349 in English football|1949]] and [[1949\u201350 in English football|1950]].

One Pompey supporter is reported to have \"carried a black cat, with the club colours around its neck\" to the 1929 FA Cup Final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/7f76d0a19d |title=Key Match: 1929 FA Cup Final |publisher=Pompey Voices |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> Portsmouth managed to survive relegation, finishing one place above relegation.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1934, Portsmouth had become a regular top-half table finisher in the First Division. The [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334 season]] saw Portsmouth again reach the FA Cup final for a second time, having beaten Manchester United, Bolton Wanderers, Leicester City and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on the way. The club was again defeated in the [[1934 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], this time by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].\n\nHalfway through the 1934\u201335 season, on 23 December 1934, the original 1898 founding director and later Portsmouth chairman, George Lewin Oliver died.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/34163/page/3409/data.pdf |title=George Lewin Oliver Obituary |publisher=The London Gazette |date=24 May 1935 |accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> Using money from the June 1934 sale of defender [[Jimmy Allen (footballer, born 1909)|Jimmy Allen]] and money from the 1934 FA Cup Final, Portsmouth F.C. announced at Christmas 1934 that Fratton Park's North Stand was to be demolished and replaced with a much larger stand, increasing the ground capacity to more than 58,000.<ref name=\"northstand\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/d77e243589 |title=The New North Stand (7 September 1935) |publisher=PompeyVoices |accessdate=24 May 2018 }}</ref> The [[1934\u201335 Football League#First Division|1934\u201335 season]] ended with Portsmouth in fourteenth position and seven points above relegation.\n\nOn 7 September at the beginning of the [[1935\u201336 Football League#First Division|1935\u201336 First Division season]], in a home game against [[Aston Villa]], the new North Stand was opened by John McKenna, who had also opened Fratton Park's new South Stand ten years earlier.<ref name=\"northstand\" /> Former Portsmouth defender Jimmy Allen, whose sale in 1934 had largely paid for the new North Stand, was present at the game, as captain of the visiting Aston Villa team.

This was indeed third time lucky, as Portsmouth managed to defeat favourites [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] 4\u20131 in what the press had dubbed, 'The Gland Final' \u2013 a reference to 'monkey gland' [[Testosterone (medication)|testosterone injections]] \u2013 used by both teams (and others) that season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesefootballtimes.co/2015/08/05/monkey-glands-and-the-major/|title=Monkey Glands and the Major|publisher=These Football Times |accessdate=5 July 2018 |first=Connor |last=Heffernan |date=8 May 2015}}</ref> [[Bert Barlow]] and [[John Anderson (footballer, born 1915)|John 'Jock' Anderson]] scored, whilst [[Cliff Parker (footballer)|Cliff Parker]] scored twice (third and fourth goals).\n\nThe new [[1939\u201340 in English football|1939\u201340 season]] in the First Division began on Saturday 26 August 1939.  On Friday 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On Saturday 2 September 1939, all divisions of the Football League played their third and final game of the season, with [[Blackpool F.C.]] at the top of the table and Portsmouth in 18th position. These would be the last national Football League fixtures before abandonment following the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|British declaration of war on Germany]] on Sunday 3 September 1939. Large gatherings of crowds were suspended with the implementation of the [[Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939]].\n\nHowever, football competitions did take place during the war, with the Football League being split into ten regional mini leagues, with Portsmouth in [[1939\u201340 in English football|'League South']]. An annual national cup competition was held too, called the [[Football League War Cup]].\n\nIn 1942, Portsmouth reached the [[London War Cup]] final,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pompeyvoices.co.uk/story/b0bdf8dc47 |title=1942 London War Cup Final |publisher=Pompey Voices |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> a competition that had begun only a season earlier in 1940\u201341. The London War Cup was held once again during the 1941\u201342 season and was intended by its organisers to stand in for the FA Cup, despite the official Football League War Cup competition had been taking place annually since 1939.  The London War Cup competition required Portsmouth, the current FA Cup champions, to secede from the Football Association to enter. Portsmouth progressed to the 1942 London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but were beaten by [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and finished as runners-up. After the competition, Portsmouth paid a ten Pounds readmission fee to rejoin the Football Association again.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/chelsea/209868/70-years-of-hurt-brentford-fans-launch-petition-asking-chelsea-to-return-the-london-wartime-cup-they-won-in-1942.html |title=70 Years of Hurt:Brentford fans launch petition asking Chelsea to return the London Wartime Cup they won in 1942 |publisher=Who Ate All the Pies |first=Chris |last=Wright |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref> The London War Cup competition was never played again. Ironically, the London War Cup trophy won by Brentford in 1942 was reused for subsequent Football League War Cup competitions. The trophy was last presented in 1945 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and remains in the Chelsea F.C. museum today.\n\nDuring his wartime visits to Portsmouth, [[Field Marshal Montgomery]] became interested in Portsmouth Football Club and was made honorary President of Portsmouth F.C. in 1944 (until 1961).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/pompey-mentioned-in-monty-s-despatches-1-1261833|title=Pompey mentioned in Monty's despatches|publisher=Portsmouth News |date=15 June 2004 |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe end of World War II in 1945 caused Portsmouth to hold the distinction of holding the FA Cup trophy for the longest uninterrupted period of seven years, as the trophy was not presented again until the 1946 FA Cup Final. Manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' during a part of the war. Because the navy city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was routinely moved around the city of Portsmouth for its safety and protection, moving from Fratton Park's boardroom, into bank vaults, back to Fratton Park and around local pubs. During the worst of the bombing on Portsmouth, the FA Cup trophy was also taken ten miles north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of [[Lovedean]], where it was kept and displayed in a quaint thatched roof country pub called \"The Bird in Hand\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk/?BIHrequestID=4C55838218D9D39854D199BD64BA29 |title=About Us |publisher=The Bird in Hand |website=lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> In 1945, the FA Cup trophy was taken around the streets of Portsmouth and proudly shown off at [[Victory in Europe Day]] street parties.\n\nFA Cup competition was resumed for the [[1945\u201346 in English football|1945\u201346 season]], but the resumption of the Football League had to wait one more year. Portsmouth, as a Division One team and as the current FA Cup Champions (from 1939), were drawn to play against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Third Round stage of the FA Cup competition. The first of the two-leg tie was played at Birmingham's [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]] stadium on 5 January 1946 and the result was 1\u20130 in Birmingham City's favour. The second leg at Fratton Park ended 0\u20130 on 9 January 1946, with Birmingham City winning 1\u20130 overall on aggregate. (See [[1945\u201346 FA Cup]] for full results) Sadly, the FA Cup trophy was not to stay with Portsmouth for an eighth consecutive year and was returned to the Football Association in time for the [[1946 FA Cup Final]], in which Derby County were awarded the trophy.\n\nThe Football League finally resumed in [[1946\u201347 Football League|1946\u201347]]. Portsmouth had capitalised on the footballers called up to serve in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in the war years and recruited some of them. In this way, Portsmouth had the pick of some of the best. Portsmouth ended the 1946\u201347 Football League First Division season in 12th place. On 1 May 1947, legendary manager Jack Tinn left Portsmouth, with [[Bob Jackson (football manager)|Bob Jackson]] taking over the role on the same day.\n\nThe second post-war Football League First Division season resumed under manager Bob Jackson in [[1947\u201348 Football League|1947\u201348]]. This was also the first season Portsmouth wore red socks, which replaced their traditional black socks. The red socks were an idea proposed by Portsmouth's honorary president, Field Marshal Montgomery, who had suggested that Portsmouth should wear red socks to commemorate the sacrifice of British servicemen lost in war. Red is traditionally the colour of the [[British Army]] and also of the [[Remembrance poppy]] flower, and so Montgomery's idea was adopted by Portsmouth at the start of the season. Bob Jackson's Portsmouth finished in 8th place at the end of the [[1947\u201348 Football League|1947\u201348 First Division season]].\n\n===1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350: Champions of England===\nIn their 50-year \"Golden Jubilee\" anniversary [[1948\u201349 Football League|1948\u201349 season]], Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win a historic Football League and FA Cup \"[[Double (association football)|double]]\".  The potential of a rare 'Double' saw Fratton Park attracting average home attendances of 36,000 supporters, and a record attendance of 51,385 in an FA Cup quarter-final match against Derby County on 26 February 1949, which Portsmouth won 2\u20131. The Fratton Park attendance of 51,385 is no longer a club record. Portsmouth lost 1\u20133 in the FA Cup semi-final against Leicester City on 26 March 1949 at the neutral [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] stadium. Portsmouth however, did win one half of the 'Double', securing the First Division title and becoming Football League Champions of England at the end of the [[1948\u201349 Portsmouth F.C. season|1948\u201349 season]], with Manchester United finishing as runners-up. Portsmouth's championship-winning team consisted of [[Ernest Butler]], [[Phil Rookes]], [[Harry Ferrier]], [[Jimmy Scoular]], [[Reg Flewin]], [[Jimmy Dickinson]], [[Peter Harris (footballer)|Peter Harris]], [[Duggie Reid]], [[Ike Clarke]], [[Len Phillips]], [[Jack Froggatt]], [[Jasper Yeuell]], [[Lindy Delapenha]], [[Bert Barlow]] and [[Cliff Parker (footballer)|Cliff Parker]].\n\nBob Jackson's Portsmouth side beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5\u20131 on the last day of the following [[1949\u201350 Football League|1949\u201350 season]], winning the Football League title again for a second consecutive season \u2013 on goal difference \u2013 as both Portsmouth and runners up [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] finished the season with 53 points each, and only one point ahead of third place Sunderland on 52 points. Portsmouth are one of only five English teams to have won back-to-back consecutive top-flight League titles since the end of World War II.\n\nIn the following [[1950\u201351 Football League#First Division|1950\u201351 season]], League champions Portsmouth finished in 7th position, 13 points behind title winners Tottenham Hotspur.\n\n[[Eddie Lever]] took over at Pompey in 1952 after championship-winning manager Bob Jackson joined [[Hull City]]. In the [[1952\u201353 Football League#First Division|1952\u201353 season]], Portsmouth finished in 15th place and only 4 points above the relegation zone, with [[Arsenal F.C.]] winning the league title.\n\nPortsmouth finished third in the [[1954\u201355 Football League#First Division|1954\u201355 season]], only 4 points behind winners [[Chelsea F.C.]].\n\nIn the [[1955\u201356 Football League#First Division|1955\u201356 season]], on 22 February 1956, Fratton Park hosted the Football League's first ever floodlit evening game, against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], played under floodlights erected on top of the North Stand and South Stand roofs.<ref>{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=295}}</ref><ref>OUR ASSOCIATION FOOTBALL CORRESPONDENT. \"League Game By Floodlight.\" Times [London, England] 23 February 1956: 13.

It had two distinctive terraced tiers, a roofed upper terrace and an open-air lower terrace. In the [[1956\u201357 Football League#First Division|1956\u201357 season]], Portsmouth escaped relegation by four points and finished two places above the drop zone.\n\nIn the following [[1957\u201358 Football League#First Division|1957\u201358 season]], Portsmouth once again escaped relegation on goal difference and finished one place above the relegation zone. Manager Eddie Lever left Portsmouth in April 1958.\n\n[[Freddie Cox]] became new Portsmouth manager in August 1958. The new 1958\u201359 season was the first Football League season with four national divisions. The two old regional Third Divisions (North and South) which had begun in the 1921\u201322 season were restructured and replaced with two new national divisions, named the Third Division and Fourth Division. At the end of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359 season]] Portsmouth finished bottom of the First Division, ending their 32-year stay in the First Division, and relegation to the Second Division. By now, the championship winning team of 1949 and 1950 had been broken up, caused by ageing or injury.\n\n===1959\u20131979: Decline and relegation to the Fourth Division===\nFollowing the bottom-place finish in the previous 1958\u201359 First Division season, Portsmouth started the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360 season]] in the Second Division, the second tier of English football, which Portsmouth had last been in during the 1926\u201327 season. After another poor season, they escaped a further relegation to the Third Division only by 2 points and finishing only one place above the relegation zone.\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361 season]] Portsmouth finished second-to-last place in the Second Division relegation zone and were relegated once again to the Third Division, (the first former [[English football champions|English League champions]] to do so). Manager [[Freddie Cox]] was sacked in February 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/6642 |title=Freddie Cox DFC |publisher=AISA Arsenal History Society |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder the guidance of [[George Smith (footballer, born 1915)|George Smith]], Portsmouth, now in the Third Division for the [[1961\u201362 Football League First Division|1960\u201361 season]] had a good season and were promoted back to the Second Division at the first time of asking after winning the Third Division title. Field-Marshal Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery of Alamein, was the honorary President of Portsmouth, having begun to support them during World War II due to the proximity of his headquarters at [[Southwick House]] on the outskirts of Portsmouth. In private correspondence dated 25 April 1962, he wrote to Smith: \"I congratulate you very much on getting Portsmouth out of the Third Division \u2013 which was completely a wrong place for a famous team. While the players all did their stuff, the major credit goes to you.\"\n\nDespite limited financial means, manager George Smith maintained Portsmouth's Second Division status throughout the rest of the 1960s until Smith was replaced by [[Ron Tindall]] in April 1970 as Smith moved upstairs to become general manager in April 1970, until his retirement from football in 1973.\n\nThe cash injection that accompanied the arrival of John Deacon as chairman in 1972 failed to improve Portsmouth's Second Division position. Ron Tindall was replaced in May 1973 by [[John Mortimore (footballer)|John Mortimore]]. However, Ron Tindall returned for two games as caretaker manager after manager John Mortimore left in 1974. [[Ian St. John]] became new Portsmouth manager in September 1974.\n\nWith Deacon unable to continue bankrolling the club on the same scale, Portsmouth finished bottom of the Second Division in the [[1975\u201376 Football League#Second Division|1975\u201376 season]] and were relegated down to the Third Division.\n\nIn November of the [[1976\u201377 Football League|1976\u201377 Third Division season]], the club found itself needing to raise [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]25,000 to pay off debts and so avoid bankruptcy.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With players having to be sold to ease the club's financial situation, and no money available for replacements, Portsmouth were forced to rely on inexperienced young players. Initially results improved, but then declined again. On 4 May 1977, Ian St. John was replaced as manager by former Portsmouth and England international player [[Jimmy Dickinson]]. They ended the [[1976\u201377 Football League|1976\u201377 season]] only one place and one point above the Third Division's relegation zone.\nThey were relegated at the end of the new 1977\u201378 season, finishing in bottom place.\n\nIn the [[1978\u201379 Football League|1978\u201379 Fourth Division season]], Portsmouth finished in 7th position. Jimmy Dickinson suffered a heart attack near the end of the season and after the season in May 1979, was replaced by [[Frank Burrows]].\n\n===1979\u20131987: Return to the First Division===\nUnder Frank Burrows new management, Portsmouth gained promotion back to the Third Division after finishing in 4th place in the [[1979\u201380 Football League#Fourth Division|1979\u201380 season]].\n\nThe following [[1981\u201382 Football League#Third Division|1981\u201382 Third Division season]], Portsmouth finished mid-table in thirteenth position. On 21 May 1982, Frank Burrows departed and [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]] became the new Portsmouth manager.\n\nDuring the [[1982\u201383 Football League#Third Division|1982\u201383 Third Division season]], former Portsmouth player, manager and England international [[Jimmy Dickinson]] died aged 57 on 8 November 1982 after suffering three heart attacks. A public memorial service was held at a packed [[St Mary's Church, Portsea|St. Mary's Church]] in Fratton, Portsmouth.  Dickinson was laid to rest in [[Alton, Hampshire]]. Pompey later that season won the [[1982\u201383 Football League#Third Division|1982\u201383 Third Division championship title]], gaining promotion back to the Second Division.\n\nIn the [[1983\u201384 Football League#Second Division|1983\u201384 Second Division season]], Portsmouth finished sixteenth place in the table. After the season, Bobby Campbell was replaced by former England international and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] winner, [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] on 11 May 1984.\n\nUnder Ball, Portsmouth's results markedly improved and they narrowly missed winning promotion to the First Division in the [[1984\u201385 Football League#Second Division|1984\u201385 Second Division season]], finishing in 4th place on goal difference. They finished in 4th place again for the following [[1985\u201386 Football League#Second Division|1985\u201386 season]].\n\nIn Ball's third season as Portsmouth manager in the [[1986\u201387 Football League#Second Division|1986\u201387 Second Division season]], Portsmouth finished as runners-up behind Derby County, gaining promotion back to the First Division for the first time since the 1958\u201359 season. During the season, the upper tier of the Fratton End stand, built only thirty years earlier in 1956, was closed due to structural concerns, leaving only the lower tier of the Fratton End open to fans.\n\nBy the middle of the new [[1987\u201388 Football League#First Division|1987\u201388 First Division season]], the club was again in financial trouble. Portsmouth were relegated straight back down to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw chairman John Deacon sell the club to London-based businessman and former [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] chairman, [[Jim Gregory (football chairman)|Jim Gregory]].  Fratton Park was in a poor condition, with the Fratton End still half closed to fans and leaking roofs in the North and South stands.\n\nWith new chairman Jim Gregory injecting money into the club, work began in the summer of 1988 to demolish the upper tier of the Fratton End and its roof. The North and South stands were refurbished and both received smart new blue-coloured metal sheet roofs.\n\n===1988\u20132003: The Second Tier===\n\nAfter a single disappointing season in the First Division, Portsmouth were relegated back to the Second Division for the [[1988\u201389 Football League#Second Division|1988\u201389 season]]. Halfway through the season, Alan Ball was sacked on 17 January 1989 and replaced by [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]. The entire Fratton End stand was closed during most of the season during demolition works, with only the lower tier of the stand reopening in the springtime of 1989. Portsmouth ended the season only two places above the relegation zone.\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 [[Hillsborough Disaster]], Portsmouth removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the new [[1989\u201390 Football League#Second Division|1989\u201390 season]], except at the Milton End to separate away supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The season saw John Gregory leaving the club on 3 January 1990. Assistant manager Frank Burrows became manager for a second spell on 23 January 1990. Portsmouth finished in 12th position at the end of the season.\n\nThe [[1990\u201391 Football League#Second Division|1990\u201391 season]] saw Frank Burrows resign as manager on 13 March 1991 after a string of bad results. Burrows was replaced by coach [[Graham Paddon]] until the end of the season, finishing in 17th position.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]]'s arrival as manager at the start of the [[1991\u201392 Portsmouth F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] sparked a revival in the team's fortunes and that year Portsmouth reached the semi-finals of the [[1991\u201392 FA Cup|FA Cup]], meeting Liverpool at neutral ground Highbury on 5 April 1992 \u2013 the 94th Anniversary of Portsmouth Football Club. Portsmouth took the lead in extra time from a 111th minute [[Darren Anderton]] goal. However, Liverpool's [[Ronnie Whelan]] equalised five minutes later, and the semi-final match ended tied 1\u20131 after the allotted 120 minutes. The tie was then replayed at [[Villa Park]] on 13 April 1992 and ended 0\u20130 after extra time.  Portsmouth then lost 1\u20133 on penalties to Liverpool, who went on to meet Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup Final, which Liverpool won 2\u20130.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992\u201393 Football League]] season saw a major restructuring of the [[English football league system|English football \"pyramid\" system]], caused by all the First Division clubs resigning from the Football League and forming a new breakaway top tier [[FA Premier League]]. Now without a First Division, the Football League Second Division was renamed as the [[1992\u201393 Football League#First Division|\"Football League First Division\"]] for the 1992\u201393 season. The FA Premier League also had a new winners trophy made, meaning the famous old Football League First Division championship trophy became demoted in status, now acting as the new second tier \"First Division\" championship trophy instead. Portsmouth had a good 1992\u201393 season in the new \"First Division\", but missed out on automatic promotion to the new first tier Premier League by virtue of scoring only one fewer goal than second-placed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. In the subsequent promotion play-offs, Portsmouth lost 3\u20132 on aggregate over two games to Leicester City in the play-off semi-finals for the third promotion place.\n\nDuring the [[1993\u201394 Portsmouth F.C. season|1993\u201394 season]] under manager Jim Smith, Portsmouth finished 17th out of 24 in the First Division, winning 15 matches, drawing 13 and losing 18. The team reached the quarterfinals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the third round of the FA Cup, in both cases being knocked out after replays.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[1994\u201395 Portsmouth F.C. season|1994\u201395 season]] was a disappointing one for Portsmouth and after a decline in form which left them struggling at the wrong end of the \"new\" First Division, Jim Smith was sacked on 1 February 1995 and was replaced by [[Terry Fenwick]], who guided them to safety with 4 wins in their final 6 league games.\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 Portsmouth F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] Fenwick's first full season in charge of Portsmouth, relegation to the Second Division was avoided on the last day of the season (on goal difference) when Portsmouth won away at [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] while other results went the club's way.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, [[Terry Venables]] arrived at Portsmouth as a consultant. Venables had recently resigned as the England national team manager after the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] competition. Fratton Park was transformed into an all-seat stadium, with new blue plastic seats fitted to the lower North terrace, Milton End, lower South terrace paddocks and also to the remnant of the Fratton End terrace.\n\nIn the [[1996\u201397 Portsmouth F.C. season|1996\u201397]] league campaign, Portsmouth finished just short of the qualifying places for the playoffs for promotion to the Premier League.

In addition, a new roof extension was built over the lower tier of the North Stand and was completed before the new season started. These new additions to Fratton Park were partly funded by the [[Football Trust]] (now [[The Football Foundation]]).\n\nAt 4.59pm on Friday 31 October 1997, the new \u00a32.2 million Fratton End was officially cleared for its opening, with one minute to spare before a 5 pm deadline. Problems with some misorientated Fratton End rooftop floodlights caused the Fratton End of the pitch to be \"shrouded in gloom on Hallowe'en\", according to the Sky Sports 3 TV commentator, causing some doubt that the live televised Division One game against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] would take place.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Fortunately, the match referee, [[Paul Danson]] gave the go-ahead for the evening fixture. The game was won 0\u20131 by Swindon Town with an official Fratton Park attendance of only 8,707. As a mark of respect to the club's former player and manager, a memorial portrait of [[Jimmy Dickinson]] was incorporated into the seating of the new Fratton End stand, along with the club's crest. Terry Venables' role as coach of the Australian national team meant he was frequently absent from Portsmouth. Meanwhile, the team's results were poor. Two-thirds of the way through the [[1997\u201398 Portsmouth F.C. season|1997\u201398 season]], he and manager Terry Fenwick left the club, with Portsmouth on the bottom of the table, and Venables selling his shareholding back to Martin Gregory, son of former chairman Jim Gregory. Alan Ball then returned as manager for the second time on 26 January 1998. Relegation to the third tier was avoided on the last day of the season \u2013 by 1 point.\n\nPortsmouth's centenary season, [[1998\u201399 Portsmouth F.C. season|1998\u201399]], saw a financial crisis hit the club, and in December 1998 Portsmouth went into [[Administration (football)|financial administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16943651|title=Portsmouth enter administration & are docked 10 points|date=17 February 2012|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Serbian-born US businessman [[Milan Mandari\u0107]] saved the club with a takeover deal in May 1999, and the new chairman immediately started investing for the new 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nAlan Ball was sacked on 9 December 1999 during the [[1999\u20132000 Portsmouth F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season with the club near the bottom of the table.

Rix lost his job on 25 March 2002, with Harry Redknapp taking over. Former Portsmouth manager Jim Smith was asked to team up with Redknapp, and while he initially turned the offer down to remain as assistant at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], he soon arrived at Portsmouth after a change of manager at Coventry saw almost all of the club's coaching staff being dismissed. Peter Crouch scored 19 goals for Portsmouth, but was sold to Aston Villa in March 2002 for \u00a35&nbsp;million.  Portsmouth ended the [[2001\u201302 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001\u201302 Division One season]] in 17th place and 4 points above relegation.\n\nIn the [[2002\u201303 Portsmouth F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]], Portsmouth led the First Division for most of the season, with [[Svetoslav Todorov]] scoring 26 league goals, which made him the First Division's top scorer at the end of the season.

Harry Redknapp then made a surprise return to manage Portsmouth again after leaving relegated Southampton. In January 2006, Portsmouth were sold by Milan Mandari\u0107 and bought by businessman [[Alexandre Gaydamak]]. New signings included a quartet from Tottenham Hotspur, then record signing [[Benjani Mwaruwari|Benjani]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro]] on loan from [[VfL Wolfsburg]]. The club survived their third season in the Premier League one place above the relegation zone in 17th position. With large amounts of money available for Redknapp to make record signings, the club finished the [[2006\u201307 Portsmouth F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]] in the top half of the table for the first time, in ninth position, only one point short of European qualification.\n\n[[File:The FA Cup Trophy in 2008.jpg|thumb|Portsmouth won the [[FA Cup]] for the second time in 2008]]\n[[File:Fullscore.JPG|thumb|The scoreboard at the end of the [[2008 FA Cup Final]], in which Portsmouth beat [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] 1\u20130]]\nThe following [[2007\u201308 Portsmouth F.C. season|2007\u201308 season]] saw Portsmouth finish eighth in the Premier League and reach the [[2008 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] for the first time since 1939.

Club & Merchandising crest.]]\n\nAlthough Portsmouth F.C. were formed in 1898, the club did not have a club crest until one was introduced for the 1913\u201314 season. This would be the second season since Portsmouth's 1912 reformation, and their wearing of blue shirts for a second successive season. Their first season with a crest in 1913\u201314 would also become the last season before World War I began in 1914.\n\nThe official Coat of Arms of the [[Portsmouth|City of Portsmouth]] contains an eight pointed gold star and crescent moon on a blue shield, Portsmouth's adoption of the [[star and crescent]] is said to have come from when [[King Richard I]] (1157\u20131189), who granted the city \"a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points\" which he had taken from the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s standard of Governor [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], after capturing [[Cyprus]].\n\nThe first 1913 Portsmouth F.C. crest was based on official symbols belonging to the town council of Portsmouth, which featured a golden eight-pointed star and a golden crescent moon.  The football club's first crest featured a horizontally elongated white crescent moon beneath a white five pointed star, with both symbols positioned in the centre of a blue four pointed shield. Portsmouth town council bestowed the privileged use (but not ownership) of their moon and star motifs to Portsmouth F.C., albeit with some colour and design changes.<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\"/>\n\nThroughout their history Portsmouth F.C. have tried different variations of the crest before reverting to the basic gold star and crescent. After World War II, Portsmouth began using an eight-pointed star to match that used by the city of Portsmouth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional crest was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative to a more expensive gold coloured thread.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped the traditional crest and replaced it with an entirely new design. This crest showed a football in front of an [[anchor]] (representing the navy) and a [[sword]] (representing the army), with the whole design surrounded by an outer ring of ships rope. An alternative version included a circular version of the traditional star and crescent crest in place of the football.\n\nDuring 1989 and 1993, the rope and anchor crest was dropped replaced with a simpler eight pointed star and crescent moon on a long narrow shield. At the foot of the shield, a blue banner featured \"''Portsmouth Football Club''\" written within it in capital letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993-1997, the 1989-93 long narrow shield design was replaced by an embroidered badge of the city of Portsmouth Coat of Arms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatestkits.co.uk/products/1993-95-portsmouth-home-shirt-l|title=1993/95 Portsmouth Home Shirt (L)|website=Greatest Kits|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nThe 1993-97 city arms crest was replaced in 1997, with an eight pointed gold star and a golden crescent moon on a blue shield edged with a gold outer rim. At the foot of the shield, a gold ribbon with \"''Portsmouth F.C.''\" written in blue gothic lettering completed the new design.  This new crest coincided with the rebuilding and reopening of the new Fratton End and tjhe clubs centennial anniversary in the 1997\u201398 season\n\nIn 2007, an additional \"Since 1898\" was added to the 1997 crest ribbon underneath the shield in time for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, a month after their 110th Anniversary, Portsmouth revealed a new crest with a very three dimensional look, the tradition curved shield with \"three points\" at the top of the shield were replaced with two straightened angles, with \"Portsmouth F.C.\" written above the star on the shield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ffcw001.azureedge.net/-/media/team/england/crest/portsmouth.png?w=600&h=600|title=Portsmouth Crest|last=|first=|date=|website=ffcw001.azureedge.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> The traditional elongated crescent moon was replaced with a new circular one, which closely resembled that on the city's Coat of Arms. The new crest had its debut in the 2008 FA Cup Final, in which Portsmouth also wore a new 110th Anniversary all-blue commemorative home strip.\n\nAs part of the World War I Centennial Commemorations in the 2014\u201315 season, the club opted to replace the 2008 crest on the home kit with one almost identical to that used in 1913\u201314. This was a more traditional-looking club crest featuring the traditional three points at the top of a slightly rounded shield but with a silver five-pointed star inside instead of the usual eight-pointed one. The moon featured on the crest was also silver, both appearing on a blue background.\n\nIn June 2015, following positive feedback from supporters, Portsmouth F.C. decided to revert the official club crest back to a familiar and traditional design, over the one introduced in 2008, which was often criticised by Pompey fans for looking too similar to Arsenal F.C.'s updated modern era crest. Portsmouth's new 2015 crest was virtually identical in design to that which has been used for the majority of the club's history. The famous \"star and moon\", both silver-white on a blue background, have a slight three-dimensional appearance. The star was restored back to the familiar eight pointed design, instead of the five pointed version used in the 1913 and 2014 crests. The crest's shield retains the three points at the top but is in a more traditional shape. No lettering or numbering features on the new club crest, just like that which was used on home shirts the previous 2014\u201315 season.\n\nOn 4 May 2017 at [[Portsmouth Guildhall]], The Tornante Company, owned by Michael Eisner met the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST), the fan-based owners of Portsmouth, to discuss a potential takeover of the football club. During the meeting, the prospective new owners identified a long overlooked ownership and copyright issue concerning the traditional Portsmouth crest \u2013 Portsmouth Football Club did not legally \"own\" the symbols on the crest, which had actually only been \"on loan\" to the club from Portsmouth City Council since 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7DZY79jTY |publisher=The Tornante Company |via=YouTube.com |title=Michael Eisner's Q&A Session with Portsmouth Supporters Trust |date=13 May 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe Tornante Company completed their purchase of Portsmouth on 3 August 2017 after a majority vote from members of the Pompey Supporters Trust to sell.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} To rectify the copyright and commercial marketing issues with the current 2015 crest, the decision was taken by the new owners to design and copyright a brand new crest for the future.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Portsmouth's fans were consulted by traditional and digital media during late 2017 and early 2018 with various designs for new crests. Most of the designs were minor tweaks and adjustments of the existing 2015 crest, just enough to make a new crest design different from that of Portsmouth City Council's coat of Arms.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nOn 15 March 2018, two newly redesigned club crests were finally revealed. Both new crests featured a new eight pointed nautical compass star and the addition of an \"1898\" date, the founding year of the football club, beneath the crescent moon. The new crests are to be copyrighted and introduced for the new 2018\u201319 season. The first new crest, similar to previous crests, is intended for players shirts. The second crest, surrounded by a blue ring with \"Portsmouth Football Club\" written in it, will be used for letterheads, merchandise and other commercial purposes.<ref name=\"portsmouthfc.co.uk\"/>\n\n==Home colours==\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _claretborder|\n pattern_b = _Roma2|\n pattern_ra = _claretborder|\n pattern_sh = |\n pattern_so = |\n leftarm = ff9999|\n body = ff9999|\n rightarm = ff9999|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1899\u20131909\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collar|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body         = FFFFFF|\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 003366|\n socks = 003366|\n title = 1909\u20131912\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0066FF|\n body         = 0066FF|\n rightarm = 0066FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1912\u20131933\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1933\u20131947\n}}\n|}\n\nIn their first 1899\u20131900 season in the Southern League Division One, Portsmouth's first home colours were salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, matched with white shorts and black socks.

The collars and cuffs were the same colour as the Corporation of Portsmouth's public trams, which were painted maroon at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm |title=Portsmouth |publisher=Historical Football Kits |website=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref> These colours lasted until the end of the 1908\u201309 season.

The next season, Portsmouth ended the poor 1910\u201311 season in bottom place and Portsmouth were relegated to Southern League Division Two. Following relegation, a financial crisis, fund raising, promotion in early 1912 and then another financial crisis, the original Portsmouth company that had been formed in 1898 was 'wound up'. A new limited company was formed on 27 July 1912 as Portsmouth F.C.'s parent company.\n\nFor the start of the 1912\u201313 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed their home colours to azure blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home kit colour combination up until the start of the 1933\u201334 season, when the shirts were changed to a royal blue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> These colours remained until the start of the 1947\u201348 season, when the black socks were changed to red; this coinciding with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey's Home Kits Through The Ages |url=http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |publisher=PompeyWeb |accessdate=27 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603114751/http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |archivedate=3 June 2008}}</ref> Portsmouth F.C. changed their colour combination several times during the 1966\u20131976 period, before reverting to the now tradition post-war blue shirts, white shorts and red stockings in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> For the club's 110th anniversary season in 2008\u201309, Portsmouth played in an all blue home kit, which debuted in the previous season's successful 2008 FA Cup Final win.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Since the 2009\u201310 season, Portsmouth reverted to the now traditional blue-white-red home kit.\n\n===Red socks memorial===\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1947\u20131966\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1966\u20131972\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n pattern_sh = _blue stripes|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1972\u20131973\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _blueborder|\n pattern_b = _pfcaway10|\n pattern_ra = _blueborder|\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body = |\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _bluehorizontal|\n socks = FFFFFF|\n title = 1973\u20131976\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _vneckwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1976\u20132008\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteline|\n pattern_b  = _pfcccc|\n pattern_ra = _whiteline|\n leftarm    = 0000FF|\n body       = 0000FF|\n rightarm   = 0000FF|\n shorts     = 0000FF|\n socks      = 0000FF|\n title      = 2008\u20132009\n}}\n|}\nPortsmouth had predominantly worn black socks since their first match in 1899 up until the end of the post-World War II 1946\u201347 FA Cup season \u2013 in which the Football League had not yet resumed.\n\nDuring the Second World War and post-war periods, the British Army's [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Sir Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery]] had been based at [[Southwick House]], 5 miles to the north of Portsmouth. Montgomery regularly attended war-time League South matches at Fratton Park, becoming the honorary President of Portsmouth Football Club. Following the suggestion by Montgomery, red socks were introduced by the club as a memorial to soldiers lost in wartime as red is the traditional colour of the British Army and also the colour of the [[Remembrance poppy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2013/may/crest-of-a-wave/ |title=Crest Of A Wave |publisher=Portsmouth Football Club |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the resumption of a full professional Football League season in England in 1947\u201348, Portsmouth changed their socks from the usual black to red for the start of the 1947\u201348 season.

An exact origin for the ''Pompey'' nickname has never formally been identified by historians, as many variations, sources and interpretations of the ''Pompey'' nickname exist.\n\nOne possible theory of the Pompey nickname is the [[Contraction (grammar)|grammatical contraction]] of the [[Old Portsmouth]] location name '''[[Portsmouth Point]]''' to the shorter '''Po'm. P.''' ('''Po''''''rts'''''m.'''''outh'' '''P.'''''oint'') which supposedly saved time and space when handwritten into a ship's logbook. Other theories include Royal Navy romanticism of the Roman character '''[[Pompey]]''' from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', used by officers to inspire the ship's company.\n\nAnother ''Pompey'' nickname theory, based on actual historic events, originates from {{HMS|Pompee|1793|6}}, originally a newly built [[T\u00e9m\u00e9raire-class ship of the line|T\u00e9m\u00e9raire class]] French frigate named ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' that was surrendered by French Royalists during the [[French Revolution]] to their British allies during the [[Siege of Toulon]] in 1793. The ship ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' eventually arrived at [[Spithead]] in 1794 and was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as ''HMS Pomp\u00e9e''.  In 1797, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' was one of sixteen ships involved in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies]] of 1797. During her later career, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' also served as Portsmouth's guard ship and ended her career in the early nineteenth century anchored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]] as the chief prison ship ''Pompee''. ''Pompee'' was also used as prison ship for French prisoners captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). The harsh treatment received aboard ''Pompee'' gained a national notoriety with the criminal classes of England, the name ''Pompey'' itself became a northern England slang word for prison.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2010,00.html?gusrc=gpd |title=Why is Portsmouth called Pompey? |work=The Guardian |author=David Francis |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> The ''Pompee'' became a familiar local landmark and gained a common association with the Royal Navy and the civilian Portsmouth population, who both then began associating ''Pompee'' with Portsmouth.

Royal Artillery Portsmouth's supporters were also responsible for creating [[Portsmouth F.C.#'The Pompey Chimes'|\"The Town Hall Chimes\"]] chant, which later became known as ''\"The Pompey Chimes\"'' chant in the twentieth century.  The chant originally began at Royal Artillery Portsmouth's home football ground at Burnaby Road, Portsmouth ([[United Services Recreation Ground]]) and was within easy earshot of the nearby Portsmouth Town Hall (now called [[Portsmouth Guildhall]]) clock bells, which had inspired the chant.\n\nRoyal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C. were disqualified for \"professionalism\" after an 1898\u201399 FA Amateur Cup match.  Royal Artillery were also forced to field only a team of amateur reserve players, thus weakening the remaining Royal Artillery team for the remainder of the 1898\u201399 Southern Football League season. Royal Artillery finished bottom of the [[1898\u201399 Southern Football League#Division One|table]], relegated after a relegation match with Cowes F.C. and were eventually disbanded. The \"Pompey\" nickname, the \"Town Hall Chimes\" chant, some of the Royal Artillery players and their supporters then migrated to a newly formed football club, named Portsmouth F.C., earlier formed on 5 April 1898.<ref name=\"portsmouth.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/heritage/history-of-the-chimes-1-1299340|title=History of the chimes|website=Portsmouth.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nPortsmouth F.C., as the \"new\" Pompey, played their first Southern Football League match away to Chatham Town on Saturday 2 September 1899, winning 0\u20131. Their first home match at Fratton Park stadium took place only four days later on Wednesday 6 September 1899, a friendly match against Southampton F.C., which Portsmouth won 2\u20130. During the first early seasons of Portsmouth F.C., the football team wore salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, white shorts and black socks. The pink shirts gave rise to an alternative nickname, ''''The Shrimps''''. 'The Shrimps' went out of common usage after 1909 when Portsmouth F.C. began playing in white shirts, navy blue shorts and navy blue stockings. After the original 1898 founding company was replaced in 1912, Portsmouth began playing in their now familiar blue shirts in the 1912\u201313 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Fratton Park entrance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The entrance to Fratton Park's South Stand, with its mock Tudor facade]]\n{{main|Fratton Park}}\nPortsmouth F.C. play their home games at Fratton Park, in the district of [[Milton, Portsmouth]]. The stadium has been home to the club throughout its entire history since the club formed in 1898. Fratton Park is affectionately nicknamed \"The Old Girl\" by Portsmouth F.C. supporters.\n\nPlans for relocation were first mooted in the early 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park. Most recently, plans for relocation have included new stadia on a site offered by the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Horsea Island]], between Stamshaw and Port Solent, and on reclaimed land in Portsmouth Harbour beside the existing naval base. The former was mooted as a possible [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] venue as part of England's bid process. However, the cost to the city's taxpayers to join the bid was deemed too great a risk to take.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8378313.stm |title=Football \u2013 Portsmouth pulls out of 2018 bid |publisher=BBC News |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> A third, oft returned-to option, is to build a new stadium on the site of the existing Fratton Park.\n\nFollowing Portsmouth F.C.'s financial troubles, subsequent relegation from the Premier League, and the failure of the England 2018 bid, as of May 2017 there are no active plans for a new club stadium.\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n{{main|South Coast derby}}\n[[File:Pompeywembley.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portsmouth fans at Wembley Stadium for the 2007\u201308 FA Cup semi-final with West Bromwich Albion]]\nPortsmouth's main rivals are [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who are 19.8 miles (31.8&nbsp;km) away, with the \"border\" between the two located in the Hampshire village of [[Titchfield]].  The [[South Coast Derby]] is one of the less frequently played rivalries within English football due to the clubs being in different divisions however this usually adds to the ferocity of the fixture.\n\nPrior to the mid/late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This [[Local derby|derby match]] has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only played league games against each other in four seasons (1987\u201388, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305 and 2011\u201312). Including Southern League games, there have been 64 league games between the clubs, but they have also met five times in the FA Cup, Portsmouth beating their rivals 4\u20131 at [[St Mary's Stadium]] in their last meeting in 2010, and twice in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] \u2013 with Southampton winning both times.\n\nMany Portsmouth supporters commonly use the derogatory nickname '''''Scummer''''' (plural: '''''Scummers''''') to describe Southampton fans, or collectively '''''Scum''''' to also include their football club, and indeed the city of Southampton itself.\n* A disproven common origin theory dating from the late twentieth century suggested that the ''Scum'' nickname was an acronym of ''Southampton Company of Union Men'', linked to a vague recollection of an unspecified and unsourced past dockers strike, in which Southampton-based dockers supposedly crossed Portsmouth dockyard picket lines when brought in as [[Strikebreaker|scab labour]] to work inside the naval base. This theory is almost certainly an urban myth, as Royal Navy dockers are not permitted to go on strike.\n* Victorian era dockers employed in the supposedly higher status [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Royal Dockyard]], looked down in disdain upon the civilian merchant port dockers at [[Port of Southampton|Southampton Docks]] and nicknamed them ''Scum'', as scum, flotsam and jetsam are useless residue found floating on, or nearby water.\n* According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ''Scummers'' was a derogatory name with naval origins for pirates or buccaneers, and was first recorded in use in 1585.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scummer |title=scummer |work=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=24 January 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jan/23/newsstory.sport8 |title=Scummers v Skates |work=The Guardian |author=Kevin Mitchell |date=23 January 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Portsmouth supporters have had the equally derogatory nickname '''''Skate''''' bestowed upon them by Southampton fans as a rebuttal to ''Scummer'' since the 1987\u201388 Division One season. This was unofficially chosen by Southampton fans from a list of insults compiled by a Southampton-based supporters fanzine called ''The Ugly Inside'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/48841/ |title=Why Bournemouth Will Never Be Saints Rivals ! |work=FansNetwork |date=17 October 2018 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Ironically, the chosen nickname ''Skate'' was actually stolen from the civilian population of Portsmouth, who had long used ''Skate'' as a derogatory insult or nickname for sailors based in Portsmouth Dockyard and other Royal Navy establishments. According to legend and folklore, Royal Navy matelots on long sea voyages were regularly denied female company, and would keep a [[Skate (fish)|skate]] (fish species) in their hammock or bunkside, as the mouth of the skate was supposedly used as a substitute vagina. Sailors ashore in Royal Navy uniform seeking the services of Portsmouth's prostitutes would often be refused service and met with a ''\"I ain't no skate bait, mate!\"'' rebuttal.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nAnother rivalry over the years, colloquially known as the \"Dockyard Derby\", is with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/7201902.stm|title=Naval support for Dockyard Derby|date=22 January 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2289954/Tynan-Plymouth-can-cause-derby-upset.html|title=Tynan: Plymouth can cause derby upset|date=25 January 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports.<ref name=harvey>{{cite book |title=Rivals: The Off-Beat Guide to the 92 League Clubs |last1=Harvey |first1=Geoff |last2=Strowger |first2=Vanessa |year=2004 |publisher=Aesculus Press Ltd |location=Swadlincote, Derbyshire |isbn=1-904328-13-X |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG7XLIPEHvAC&pg=PT111&dq=%22battle+of+the+ports%22+football |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]], mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 18/19 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunderland-portsmouth-story-so-far-16284128|title=Sunderland vs Portsmouth: A story of red cards, penalties and a simmering rivalry|first=Sean|last=Tighe|date=16 May 2019|website=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nLesser rivalries exist with fellow South Coast clubs [[A.F.C.

Football referees would use the Town Hall's clock bells as a reference to when the football match should end at 4&nbsp;pm. Just before 4&nbsp;pm the crowd of supporters would slowly lilt in unison with the Town Hall's chimes on the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle to signify full-time.

On Friday 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On Saturday 2 September 1939, all divisions of the Football League played their third and final game of the season, with [[Blackpool F.C.]] at the top of the table and Portsmouth in 18th position. These would be the last national Football League fixtures before abandonment following the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|British declaration of war on Germany]] on Sunday 3 September 1939.

The London War Cup competition required Portsmouth, the current FA Cup champions, to secede from the Football Association to enter. Portsmouth progressed to the 1942 London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but were beaten by [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and finished as runners-up.

Manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' during a part of the war. Because the navy city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was routinely moved around the city of Portsmouth for its safety and protection, moving from Fratton Park's boardroom, into bank vaults, back to Fratton Park and around local pubs. During the worst of the bombing on Portsmouth, the FA Cup trophy was also taken ten miles north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of [[Lovedean]], where it was kept and displayed in a quaint thatched roof country pub called \"The Bird in Hand\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk/?BIHrequestID=4C55838218D9D39854D199BD64BA29 |title=About Us |publisher=The Bird in Hand |website=lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> In 1945, the FA Cup trophy was taken around the streets of Portsmouth and proudly shown off at [[Victory in Europe Day]] street parties.\n\nFA Cup competition was resumed for the [[1945\u201346 in English football|1945\u201346 season]], but the resumption of the Football League had to wait one more year. Portsmouth, as a Division One team and as the current FA Cup Champions (from 1939), were drawn to play against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Third Round stage of the FA Cup competition. The first of the two-leg tie was played at Birmingham's [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]] stadium on 5 January 1946 and the result was 1\u20130 in Birmingham City's favour. The second leg at Fratton Park ended 0\u20130 on 9 January 1946, with Birmingham City winning 1\u20130 overall on aggregate. (See [[1945\u201346 FA Cup]] for full results) Sadly, the FA Cup trophy was not to stay with Portsmouth for an eighth consecutive year and was returned to the Football Association in time for the [[1946 FA Cup Final]], in which Derby County were awarded the trophy.\n\nThe Football League finally resumed in [[1946\u201347 Football League|1946\u201347]]. Portsmouth had capitalised on the footballers called up to serve in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in the war years and recruited some of them. In this way, Portsmouth had the pick of some of the best. Portsmouth ended the 1946\u201347 Football League First Division season in 12th place. On 1 May 1947, legendary manager Jack Tinn left Portsmouth, with [[Bob Jackson (football manager)|Bob Jackson]] taking over the role on the same day.\n\nThe second post-war Football League First Division season resumed under manager Bob Jackson in [[1947\u201348 Football League|1947\u201348]]. This was also the first season Portsmouth wore red socks, which replaced their traditional black socks. The red socks were an idea proposed by Portsmouth's honorary president, Field Marshal Montgomery, who had suggested that Portsmouth should wear red socks to commemorate the sacrifice of British servicemen lost in war. Red is traditionally the colour of the [[British Army]] and also of the [[Remembrance poppy]] flower, and so Montgomery's idea was adopted by Portsmouth at the start of the season. Bob Jackson's Portsmouth finished in 8th place at the end of the [[1947\u201348 Football League|1947\u201348 First Division season]].\n\n===1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350: Champions of England===\nIn their 50-year \"Golden Jubilee\" anniversary [[1948\u201349 Football League|1948\u201349 season]], Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win a historic Football League and FA Cup \"[[Double (association football)|double]]\".  The potential of a rare 'Double' saw Fratton Park attracting average home attendances of 36,000 supporters, and a record attendance of 51,385 in an FA Cup quarter-final match against Derby County on 26 February 1949, which Portsmouth won 2\u20131. The Fratton Park attendance of 51,385 is no longer a club record. Portsmouth lost 1\u20133 in the FA Cup semi-final against Leicester City on 26 March 1949 at the neutral [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] stadium. Portsmouth however, did win one half of the 'Double', securing the First Division title and becoming Football League Champions of England at the end of the [[1948\u201349 Portsmouth F.C. season|1948\u201349 season]], with Manchester United finishing as runners-up. Portsmouth's championship-winning team consisted of [[Ernest Butler]], [[Phil Rookes]], [[Harry Ferrier]], [[Jimmy Scoular]], [[Reg Flewin]], [[Jimmy Dickinson]], [[Peter Harris (footballer)|Peter Harris]], [[Duggie Reid]], [[Ike Clarke]], [[Len Phillips]], [[Jack Froggatt]], [[Jasper Yeuell]], [[Lindy Delapenha]], [[Bert Barlow]] and [[Cliff Parker (footballer)|Cliff Parker]].\n\nBob Jackson's Portsmouth side beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5\u20131 on the last day of the following [[1949\u201350 Football League|1949\u201350 season]], winning the Football League title again for a second consecutive season \u2013 on goal difference \u2013 as both Portsmouth and runners up [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] finished the season with 53 points each, and only one point ahead of third place Sunderland on 52 points.

In the [[1956\u201357 Football League#First Division|1956\u201357 season]], Portsmouth escaped relegation by four points and finished two places above the drop zone.\n\nIn the following [[1957\u201358 Football League#First Division|1957\u201358 season]], Portsmouth once again escaped relegation on goal difference and finished one place above the relegation zone. Manager Eddie Lever left Portsmouth in April 1958.\n\n[[Freddie Cox]] became new Portsmouth manager in August 1958. The new 1958\u201359 season was the first Football League season with four national divisions. The two old regional Third Divisions (North and South) which had begun in the 1921\u201322 season were restructured and replaced with two new national divisions, named the Third Division and Fourth Division. At the end of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359 season]] Portsmouth finished bottom of the First Division, ending their 32-year stay in the First Division, and relegation to the Second Division. By now, the championship winning team of 1949 and 1950 had been broken up, caused by ageing or injury.\n\n===1959\u20131979: Decline and relegation to the Fourth Division===\nFollowing the bottom-place finish in the previous 1958\u201359 First Division season, Portsmouth started the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360 season]] in the Second Division, the second tier of English football, which Portsmouth had last been in during the 1926\u201327 season. After another poor season, they escaped a further relegation to the Third Division only by 2 points and finishing only one place above the relegation zone.\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361 season]] Portsmouth finished second-to-last place in the Second Division relegation zone and were relegated once again to the Third Division, (the first former [[English football champions|English League champions]] to do so). Manager [[Freddie Cox]] was sacked in February 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/6642 |title=Freddie Cox DFC |publisher=AISA Arsenal History Society |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder the guidance of [[George Smith (footballer, born 1915)|George Smith]], Portsmouth, now in the Third Division for the [[1961\u201362 Football League First Division|1960\u201361 season]] had a good season and were promoted back to the Second Division at the first time of asking after winning the Third Division title. Field-Marshal Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery of Alamein, was the honorary President of Portsmouth, having begun to support them during World War II due to the proximity of his headquarters at [[Southwick House]] on the outskirts of Portsmouth. In private correspondence dated 25 April 1962, he wrote to Smith: \"I congratulate you very much on getting Portsmouth out of the Third Division \u2013 which was completely a wrong place for a famous team. While the players all did their stuff, the major credit goes to you.\"\n\nDespite limited financial means, manager George Smith maintained Portsmouth's Second Division status throughout the rest of the 1960s until Smith was replaced by [[Ron Tindall]] in April 1970 as Smith moved upstairs to become general manager in April 1970, until his retirement from football in 1973.\n\nThe cash injection that accompanied the arrival of John Deacon as chairman in 1972 failed to improve Portsmouth's Second Division position. Ron Tindall was replaced in May 1973 by [[John Mortimore (footballer)|John Mortimore]]. However, Ron Tindall returned for two games as caretaker manager after manager John Mortimore left in 1974. [[Ian St. John]] became new Portsmouth manager in September 1974.\n\nWith Deacon unable to continue bankrolling the club on the same scale, Portsmouth finished bottom of the Second Division in the [[1975\u201376 Football League#Second Division|1975\u201376 season]] and were relegated down to the Third Division.\n\nIn November of the [[1976\u201377 Football League|1976\u201377 Third Division season]], the club found itself needing to raise [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]25,000 to pay off debts and so avoid bankruptcy.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With players having to be sold to ease the club's financial situation, and no money available for replacements, Portsmouth were forced to rely on inexperienced young players. Initially results improved, but then declined again. On 4 May 1977, Ian St. John was replaced as manager by former Portsmouth and England international player [[Jimmy Dickinson]]. They ended the [[1976\u201377 Football League|1976\u201377 season]] only one place and one point above the Third Division's relegation zone.\nThey were relegated at the end of the new 1977\u201378 season, finishing in bottom place.\n\nIn the [[1978\u201379 Football League|1978\u201379 Fourth Division season]], Portsmouth finished in 7th position. Jimmy Dickinson suffered a heart attack near the end of the season and after the season in May 1979, was replaced by [[Frank Burrows]].\n\n===1979\u20131987: Return to the First Division===\nUnder Frank Burrows new management, Portsmouth gained promotion back to the Third Division after finishing in 4th place in the [[1979\u201380 Football League#Fourth Division|1979\u201380 season]].\n\nThe following [[1981\u201382 Football League#Third Division|1981\u201382 Third Division season]], Portsmouth finished mid-table in thirteenth position. On 21 May 1982, Frank Burrows departed and [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]] became the new Portsmouth manager.\n\nDuring the [[1982\u201383 Football League#Third Division|1982\u201383 Third Division season]], former Portsmouth player, manager and England international [[Jimmy Dickinson]] died aged 57 on 8 November 1982 after suffering three heart attacks. A public memorial service was held at a packed [[St Mary's Church, Portsea|St. Mary's Church]] in Fratton, Portsmouth.  Dickinson was laid to rest in [[Alton, Hampshire]]. Pompey later that season won the [[1982\u201383 Football League#Third Division|1982\u201383 Third Division championship title]], gaining promotion back to the Second Division.\n\nIn the [[1983\u201384 Football League#Second Division|1983\u201384 Second Division season]], Portsmouth finished sixteenth place in the table. After the season, Bobby Campbell was replaced by former England international and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] winner, [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] on 11 May 1984.\n\nUnder Ball, Portsmouth's results markedly improved and they narrowly missed winning promotion to the First Division in the [[1984\u201385 Football League#Second Division|1984\u201385 Second Division season]], finishing in 4th place on goal difference. They finished in 4th place again for the following [[1985\u201386 Football League#Second Division|1985\u201386 season]].\n\nIn Ball's third season as Portsmouth manager in the [[1986\u201387 Football League#Second Division|1986\u201387 Second Division season]], Portsmouth finished as runners-up behind Derby County, gaining promotion back to the First Division for the first time since the 1958\u201359 season. During the season, the upper tier of the Fratton End stand, built only thirty years earlier in 1956, was closed due to structural concerns, leaving only the lower tier of the Fratton End open to fans.\n\nBy the middle of the new [[1987\u201388 Football League#First Division|1987\u201388 First Division season]], the club was again in financial trouble. Portsmouth were relegated straight back down to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw chairman John Deacon sell the club to London-based businessman and former [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] chairman, [[Jim Gregory (football chairman)|Jim Gregory]].  Fratton Park was in a poor condition, with the Fratton End still half closed to fans and leaking roofs in the North and South stands.\n\nWith new chairman Jim Gregory injecting money into the club, work began in the summer of 1988 to demolish the upper tier of the Fratton End and its roof. The North and South stands were refurbished and both received smart new blue-coloured metal sheet roofs.\n\n===1988\u20132003: The Second Tier===\n\nAfter a single disappointing season in the First Division, Portsmouth were relegated back to the Second Division for the [[1988\u201389 Football League#Second Division|1988\u201389 season]]. Halfway through the season, Alan Ball was sacked on 17 January 1989 and replaced by [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]. The entire Fratton End stand was closed during most of the season during demolition works, with only the lower tier of the stand reopening in the springtime of 1989. Portsmouth ended the season only two places above the relegation zone.\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 [[Hillsborough Disaster]], Portsmouth removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the new [[1989\u201390 Football League#Second Division|1989\u201390 season]], except at the Milton End to separate away supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The season saw John Gregory leaving the club on 3 January 1990. Assistant manager Frank Burrows became manager for a second spell on 23 January 1990. Portsmouth finished in 12th position at the end of the season.\n\nThe [[1990\u201391 Football League#Second Division|1990\u201391 season]] saw Frank Burrows resign as manager on 13 March 1991 after a string of bad results. Burrows was replaced by coach [[Graham Paddon]] until the end of the season, finishing in 17th position.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]]'s arrival as manager at the start of the [[1991\u201392 Portsmouth F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] sparked a revival in the team's fortunes and that year Portsmouth reached the semi-finals of the [[1991\u201392 FA Cup|FA Cup]], meeting Liverpool at neutral ground Highbury on 5 April 1992 \u2013 the 94th Anniversary of Portsmouth Football Club. Portsmouth took the lead in extra time from a 111th minute [[Darren Anderton]] goal. However, Liverpool's [[Ronnie Whelan]] equalised five minutes later, and the semi-final match ended tied 1\u20131 after the allotted 120 minutes. The tie was then replayed at [[Villa Park]] on 13 April 1992 and ended 0\u20130 after extra time.  Portsmouth then lost 1\u20133 on penalties to Liverpool, who went on to meet Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup Final, which Liverpool won 2\u20130.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992\u201393 Football League]] season saw a major restructuring of the [[English football league system|English football \"pyramid\" system]], caused by all the First Division clubs resigning from the Football League and forming a new breakaway top tier [[FA Premier League]]. Now without a First Division, the Football League Second Division was renamed as the [[1992\u201393 Football League#First Division|\"Football League First Division\"]] for the 1992\u201393 season. The FA Premier League also had a new winners trophy made, meaning the famous old Football League First Division championship trophy became demoted in status, now acting as the new second tier \"First Division\" championship trophy instead. Portsmouth had a good 1992\u201393 season in the new \"First Division\", but missed out on automatic promotion to the new first tier Premier League by virtue of scoring only one fewer goal than second-placed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. In the subsequent promotion play-offs, Portsmouth lost 3\u20132 on aggregate over two games to Leicester City in the play-off semi-finals for the third promotion place.\n\nDuring the [[1993\u201394 Portsmouth F.C. season|1993\u201394 season]] under manager Jim Smith, Portsmouth finished 17th out of 24 in the First Division, winning 15 matches, drawing 13 and losing 18. The team reached the quarterfinals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the third round of the FA Cup, in both cases being knocked out after replays.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[1994\u201395 Portsmouth F.C. season|1994\u201395 season]] was a disappointing one for Portsmouth and after a decline in form which left them struggling at the wrong end of the \"new\" First Division, Jim Smith was sacked on 1 February 1995 and was replaced by [[Terry Fenwick]], who guided them to safety with 4 wins in their final 6 league games.\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 Portsmouth F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] Fenwick's first full season in charge of Portsmouth, relegation to the Second Division was avoided on the last day of the season (on goal difference) when Portsmouth won away at [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] while other results went the club's way.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, [[Terry Venables]] arrived at Portsmouth as a consultant. Venables had recently resigned as the England national team manager after the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] competition. Fratton Park was transformed into an all-seat stadium, with new blue plastic seats fitted to the lower North terrace, Milton End, lower South terrace paddocks and also to the remnant of the Fratton End terrace.\n\nIn the [[1996\u201397 Portsmouth F.C. season|1996\u201397]] league campaign, Portsmouth finished just short of the qualifying places for the playoffs for promotion to the Premier League. Terry Venables took over as chairman in February 1997 after buying a 51 per cent controlling share in the club for \u00a31.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/46933.stm|title=Venables quits Portsmouth taking a tidy profit|date=13 January 1998|work=BBC News |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> The team enjoyed a run in the [[1996\u201397 FA Cup]] competition, beating FA Premier League side [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 15 February 1997, but were eventually beaten 1\u20134 by Chelsea F.C. in the quarter-finals at Fratton Park on 9 March 1997.\n\nAt the end of the 1996\u201397 season, the Fratton End was fully demolished in the summer (of 1997) and work began to build a new Fratton End stand. In addition, a new roof extension was built over the lower tier of the North Stand and was completed before the new season started. These new additions to Fratton Park were partly funded by the [[Football Trust]] (now [[The Football Foundation]]).\n\nAt 4.59pm on Friday 31 October 1997, the new \u00a32.2 million Fratton End was officially cleared for its opening, with one minute to spare before a 5 pm deadline. Problems with some misorientated Fratton End rooftop floodlights caused the Fratton End of the pitch to be \"shrouded in gloom on Hallowe'en\", according to the Sky Sports 3 TV commentator, causing some doubt that the live televised Division One game against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] would take place.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Fortunately, the match referee, [[Paul Danson]] gave the go-ahead for the evening fixture. The game was won 0\u20131 by Swindon Town with an official Fratton Park attendance of only 8,707. As a mark of respect to the club's former player and manager, a memorial portrait of [[Jimmy Dickinson]] was incorporated into the seating of the new Fratton End stand, along with the club's crest. Terry Venables' role as coach of the Australian national team meant he was frequently absent from Portsmouth. Meanwhile, the team's results were poor. Two-thirds of the way through the [[1997\u201398 Portsmouth F.C. season|1997\u201398 season]], he and manager Terry Fenwick left the club, with Portsmouth on the bottom of the table, and Venables selling his shareholding back to Martin Gregory, son of former chairman Jim Gregory. Alan Ball then returned as manager for the second time on 26 January 1998. Relegation to the third tier was avoided on the last day of the season \u2013 by 1 point.\n\nPortsmouth's centenary season, [[1998\u201399 Portsmouth F.C. season|1998\u201399]], saw a financial crisis hit the club, and in December 1998 Portsmouth went into [[Administration (football)|financial administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16943651|title=Portsmouth enter administration & are docked 10 points|date=17 February 2012|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Serbian-born US businessman [[Milan Mandari\u0107]] saved the club with a takeover deal in May 1999, and the new chairman immediately started investing for the new 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nAlan Ball was sacked on 9 December 1999 during the [[1999\u20132000 Portsmouth F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season with the club near the bottom of the table. [[Tony Pulis]] took over on 13 January 2000 and steered the club to safety at the end of the season.\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 Portsmouth F.C. season|2000\u201301 season]], Pulis was put on leave and replaced by Portsmouth player, [[Steve Claridge]] in a player-manager role.  On 23 February 2001, [[Graham Rix]] took over from Claridge. Portsmouth escaped relegation on the last day of the 2000\u201301 season when they won their final game and [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] lost theirs, keeping Portsmouth up at their expense.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3004911/Huddersfield-relegated-as-Palace-and-Portsmouth-win.html|title=Huddersfield relegated as Palace and Portsmouth win|date=6 May 2001|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> During the summer break, former [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] manager [[Harry Redknapp]] was appointed director of football by Mandaric.\n\nA week before the new season began, 25-year-old Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Aaron Flahavan]] was killed in a car crash near Bournemouth on 5 August 2001. In a mark of respect, Portsmouth retired his number 1 shirt for the season. Portsmouth signed veteran Croatian playmaker [[Robert Prosine\u010dki#Portsmouth|Robert Prosine\u010dki]] on a one-year deal and [[Peter Crouch]] for the start of the [[2001\u201302 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]]. Rix lost his job on 25 March 2002, with Harry Redknapp taking over. Former Portsmouth manager Jim Smith was asked to team up with Redknapp, and while he initially turned the offer down to remain as assistant at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], he soon arrived at Portsmouth after a change of manager at Coventry saw almost all of the club's coaching staff being dismissed. Peter Crouch scored 19 goals for Portsmouth, but was sold to Aston Villa in March 2002 for \u00a35&nbsp;million.  Portsmouth ended the [[2001\u201302 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001\u201302 Division One season]] in 17th place and 4 points above relegation.\n\nIn the [[2002\u201303 Portsmouth F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]], Portsmouth led the First Division for most of the season, with [[Svetoslav Todorov]] scoring 26 league goals, which made him the First Division's top scorer at the end of the season. Portsmouth finished top as First Division champions on 27 April 2003, six points clear of second-placed Leicester City, gaining promotion (with a game to spare) to the FA Premier League, returning to the top tier of English football after an absence of fifteen seasons.<ref>{{cite news |title=Portsmouth clinch promotion and championship |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2003/0427/portsmouth.html |work=RT\u00c9 Sport |date= 27 April 2003 |accessdate=27 August 2007}}</ref> Portsmouth were awarded the Football League First Division Championship trophy for a third time, as the former Football League championship trophy had been demoted in status in 1992\u201393 (because of the creation of the FA Premier League) and had become the second tier trophy. Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], midfielders Matthew Taylor and Paul Merson earned places in the 2002\u201303 Division One [[PFA Team of the Year (2000s)#First Division 4|PFA Team of the Year]] award.\n\n===2003\u20132010: FA Premier League===\nIn Portsmouth's Premiership debut season in 2003\u201304, the \"Harry & Jim\" partnership of Harry Redknapp and Jim Smith resulted in a 13th place final position at the end of the season.\n\nAlmost halfway through the following 2004\u201305 season in the Premiership, Harry Redknapp unexpectedly walked out on Portsmouth on 24 November 2004 after a row with chairman Milan Mandari\u0107 over the appointment of new Director of Football [[Velimir Zajec]] at the club. Shortly afterwards on 8 December 2004, Harry Redknapp was announced by Southampton F.C. chairman [[Rupert Lowe]] as their new manager, with Jim Smith as his assistant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/4077461.stm |title=Saints name Redknapp as boss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> Velimir Zajec then replaced Redknapp as Portsmouth manager, but in April 2005, Zajec was replaced by Frenchman [[Alain Perrin]].

Harry Redknapp then made a surprise return to manage Portsmouth again after leaving relegated Southampton. In January 2006, Portsmouth were sold by Milan Mandari\u0107 and bought by businessman [[Alexandre Gaydamak]]. New signings included a quartet from Tottenham Hotspur, then record signing [[Benjani Mwaruwari|Benjani]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro]] on loan from [[VfL Wolfsburg]]. The club survived their third season in the Premier League one place above the relegation zone in 17th position. With large amounts of money available for Redknapp to make record signings, the club finished the [[2006\u201307 Portsmouth F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]] in the top half of the table for the first time, in ninth position, only one point short of European qualification.\n\n[[File:The FA Cup Trophy in 2008.jpg|thumb|Portsmouth won the [[FA Cup]] for the second time in 2008]]\n[[File:Fullscore.JPG|thumb|The scoreboard at the end of the [[2008 FA Cup Final]], in which Portsmouth beat [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] 1\u20130]]\nThe following [[2007\u201308 Portsmouth F.C. season|2007\u201308 season]] saw Portsmouth finish eighth in the Premier League and reach the [[2008 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] for the first time since 1939.

On 19 August 2009, Portsmouth announced on their website that a rival consortium headed by current CEO [[Peter Storrie]] had also made a bid for the club; unknown at the time, this was backed by [[Ali al-Faraj]].

Club & Merchandising crest.]]\n\nAlthough Portsmouth F.C. were formed in 1898, the club did not have a club crest until one was introduced for the 1913\u201314 season. This would be the second season since Portsmouth's 1912 reformation, and their wearing of blue shirts for a second successive season. Their first season with a crest in 1913\u201314 would also become the last season before World War I began in 1914.\n\nThe official Coat of Arms of the [[Portsmouth|City of Portsmouth]] contains an eight pointed gold star and crescent moon on a blue shield, Portsmouth's adoption of the [[star and crescent]] is said to have come from when [[King Richard I]] (1157\u20131189), who granted the city \"a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points\" which he had taken from the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s standard of Governor [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], after capturing [[Cyprus]].\n\nThe first 1913 Portsmouth F.C. crest was based on official symbols belonging to the town council of Portsmouth, which featured a golden eight-pointed star and a golden crescent moon.  The football club's first crest featured a horizontally elongated white crescent moon beneath a white five pointed star, with both symbols positioned in the centre of a blue four pointed shield. Portsmouth town council bestowed the privileged use (but not ownership) of their moon and star motifs to Portsmouth F.C., albeit with some colour and design changes.<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\"/>\n\nThroughout their history Portsmouth F.C. have tried different variations of the crest before reverting to the basic gold star and crescent. After World War II, Portsmouth began using an eight-pointed star to match that used by the city of Portsmouth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional crest was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative to a more expensive gold coloured thread.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped the traditional crest and replaced it with an entirely new design. This crest showed a football in front of an [[anchor]] (representing the navy) and a [[sword]] (representing the army), with the whole design surrounded by an outer ring of ships rope. An alternative version included a circular version of the traditional star and crescent crest in place of the football.\n\nDuring 1989 and 1993, the rope and anchor crest was dropped replaced with a simpler eight pointed star and crescent moon on a long narrow shield. At the foot of the shield, a blue banner featured \"''Portsmouth Football Club''\" written within it in capital letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993-1997, the 1989-93 long narrow shield design was replaced by an embroidered badge of the city of Portsmouth Coat of Arms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatestkits.co.uk/products/1993-95-portsmouth-home-shirt-l|title=1993/95 Portsmouth Home Shirt (L)|website=Greatest Kits|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nThe 1993-97 city arms crest was replaced in 1997, with an eight pointed gold star and a golden crescent moon on a blue shield edged with a gold outer rim. At the foot of the shield, a gold ribbon with \"''Portsmouth F.C.''\" written in blue gothic lettering completed the new design.  This new crest coincided with the rebuilding and reopening of the new Fratton End and tjhe clubs centennial anniversary in the 1997\u201398 season\n\nIn 2007, an additional \"Since 1898\" was added to the 1997 crest ribbon underneath the shield in time for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, a month after their 110th Anniversary, Portsmouth revealed a new crest with a very three dimensional look, the tradition curved shield with \"three points\" at the top of the shield were replaced with two straightened angles, with \"Portsmouth F.C.\" written above the star on the shield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ffcw001.azureedge.net/-/media/team/england/crest/portsmouth.png?w=600&h=600|title=Portsmouth Crest|last=|first=|date=|website=ffcw001.azureedge.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> The traditional elongated crescent moon was replaced with a new circular one, which closely resembled that on the city's Coat of Arms. The new crest had its debut in the 2008 FA Cup Final, in which Portsmouth also wore a new 110th Anniversary all-blue commemorative home strip.\n\nAs part of the World War I Centennial Commemorations in the 2014\u201315 season, the club opted to replace the 2008 crest on the home kit with one almost identical to that used in 1913\u201314. This was a more traditional-looking club crest featuring the traditional three points at the top of a slightly rounded shield but with a silver five-pointed star inside instead of the usual eight-pointed one. The moon featured on the crest was also silver, both appearing on a blue background.\n\nIn June 2015, following positive feedback from supporters, Portsmouth F.C. decided to revert the official club crest back to a familiar and traditional design, over the one introduced in 2008, which was often criticised by Pompey fans for looking too similar to Arsenal F.C.'s updated modern era crest. Portsmouth's new 2015 crest was virtually identical in design to that which has been used for the majority of the club's history. The famous \"star and moon\", both silver-white on a blue background, have a slight three-dimensional appearance. The star was restored back to the familiar eight pointed design, instead of the five pointed version used in the 1913 and 2014 crests. The crest's shield retains the three points at the top but is in a more traditional shape. No lettering or numbering features on the new club crest, just like that which was used on home shirts the previous 2014\u201315 season.\n\nOn 4 May 2017 at [[Portsmouth Guildhall]], The Tornante Company, owned by Michael Eisner met the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST), the fan-based owners of Portsmouth, to discuss a potential takeover of the football club. During the meeting, the prospective new owners identified a long overlooked ownership and copyright issue concerning the traditional Portsmouth crest \u2013 Portsmouth Football Club did not legally \"own\" the symbols on the crest, which had actually only been \"on loan\" to the club from Portsmouth City Council since 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7DZY79jTY |publisher=The Tornante Company |via=YouTube.com |title=Michael Eisner's Q&A Session with Portsmouth Supporters Trust |date=13 May 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe Tornante Company completed their purchase of Portsmouth on 3 August 2017 after a majority vote from members of the Pompey Supporters Trust to sell.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} To rectify the copyright and commercial marketing issues with the current 2015 crest, the decision was taken by the new owners to design and copyright a brand new crest for the future.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Portsmouth's fans were consulted by traditional and digital media during late 2017 and early 2018 with various designs for new crests. Most of the designs were minor tweaks and adjustments of the existing 2015 crest, just enough to make a new crest design different from that of Portsmouth City Council's coat of Arms.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nOn 15 March 2018, two newly redesigned club crests were finally revealed. Both new crests featured a new eight pointed nautical compass star and the addition of an \"1898\" date, the founding year of the football club, beneath the crescent moon. The new crests are to be copyrighted and introduced for the new 2018\u201319 season. The first new crest, similar to previous crests, is intended for players shirts. The second crest, surrounded by a blue ring with \"Portsmouth Football Club\" written in it, will be used for letterheads, merchandise and other commercial purposes.<ref name=\"portsmouthfc.co.uk\"/>\n\n==Home colours==\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _claretborder|\n pattern_b = _Roma2|\n pattern_ra = _claretborder|\n pattern_sh = |\n pattern_so = |\n leftarm = ff9999|\n body = ff9999|\n rightarm = ff9999|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1899\u20131909\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collar|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body         = FFFFFF|\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 003366|\n socks = 003366|\n title = 1909\u20131912\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0066FF|\n body         = 0066FF|\n rightarm = 0066FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1912\u20131933\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1933\u20131947\n}}\n|}\n\nIn their first 1899\u20131900 season in the Southern League Division One, Portsmouth's first home colours were salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, matched with white shorts and black socks.  The pink shirts gave the early Portsmouth F.C. the alternative second nickname of 'The Shrimps'. The collars and cuffs were the same colour as the Corporation of Portsmouth's public trams, which were painted maroon at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm |title=Portsmouth |publisher=Historical Football Kits |website=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref> These colours lasted until the end of the 1908\u201309 season. 'The Shrimps' nickname then also declined from common usage.\n\nAt the start of the 1909\u201310 season, Portsmouth changed to white shirts with navy blue shorts and navy blue socks. The next season, Portsmouth ended the poor 1910\u201311 season in bottom place and Portsmouth were relegated to Southern League Division Two. Following relegation, a financial crisis, fund raising, promotion in early 1912 and then another financial crisis, the original Portsmouth company that had been formed in 1898 was 'wound up'. A new limited company was formed on 27 July 1912 as Portsmouth F.C.'s parent company.\n\nFor the start of the 1912\u201313 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed their home colours to azure blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home kit colour combination up until the start of the 1933\u201334 season, when the shirts were changed to a royal blue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> These colours remained until the start of the 1947\u201348 season, when the black socks were changed to red; this coinciding with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey's Home Kits Through The Ages |url=http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |publisher=PompeyWeb |accessdate=27 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603114751/http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |archivedate=3 June 2008}}</ref> Portsmouth F.C. changed their colour combination several times during the 1966\u20131976 period, before reverting to the now tradition post-war blue shirts, white shorts and red stockings in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> For the club's 110th anniversary season in 2008\u201309, Portsmouth played in an all blue home kit, which debuted in the previous season's successful 2008 FA Cup Final win.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Since the 2009\u201310 season, Portsmouth reverted to the now traditional blue-white-red home kit.\n\n===Red socks memorial===\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1947\u20131966\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1966\u20131972\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n pattern_sh = _blue stripes|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1972\u20131973\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _blueborder|\n pattern_b = _pfcaway10|\n pattern_ra = _blueborder|\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body = |\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _bluehorizontal|\n socks = FFFFFF|\n title = 1973\u20131976\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _vneckwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1976\u20132008\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteline|\n pattern_b  = _pfcccc|\n pattern_ra = _whiteline|\n leftarm    = 0000FF|\n body       = 0000FF|\n rightarm   = 0000FF|\n shorts     = 0000FF|\n socks      = 0000FF|\n title      = 2008\u20132009\n}}\n|}\nPortsmouth had predominantly worn black socks since their first match in 1899 up until the end of the post-World War II 1946\u201347 FA Cup season \u2013 in which the Football League had not yet resumed.\n\nDuring the Second World War and post-war periods, the British Army's [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Sir Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery]] had been based at [[Southwick House]], 5 miles to the north of Portsmouth. Montgomery regularly attended war-time League South matches at Fratton Park, becoming the honorary President of Portsmouth Football Club. Following the suggestion by Montgomery, red socks were introduced by the club as a memorial to soldiers lost in wartime as red is the traditional colour of the British Army and also the colour of the [[Remembrance poppy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2013/may/crest-of-a-wave/ |title=Crest Of A Wave |publisher=Portsmouth Football Club |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the resumption of a full professional Football League season in England in 1947\u201348, Portsmouth changed their socks from the usual black to red for the start of the 1947\u201348 season.

An exact origin for the ''Pompey'' nickname has never formally been identified by historians, as many variations, sources and interpretations of the ''Pompey'' nickname exist.\n\nOne possible theory of the Pompey nickname is the [[Contraction (grammar)|grammatical contraction]] of the [[Old Portsmouth]] location name '''[[Portsmouth Point]]''' to the shorter '''Po'm. P.''' ('''Po''''''rts'''''m.'''''outh'' '''P.'''''oint'') which supposedly saved time and space when handwritten into a ship's logbook. Other theories include Royal Navy romanticism of the Roman character '''[[Pompey]]''' from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', used by officers to inspire the ship's company.\n\nAnother ''Pompey'' nickname theory, based on actual historic events, originates from {{HMS|Pompee|1793|6}}, originally a newly built [[T\u00e9m\u00e9raire-class ship of the line|T\u00e9m\u00e9raire class]] French frigate named ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' that was surrendered by French Royalists during the [[French Revolution]] to their British allies during the [[Siege of Toulon]] in 1793. The ship ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' eventually arrived at [[Spithead]] in 1794 and was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as ''HMS Pomp\u00e9e''.  In 1797, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' was one of sixteen ships involved in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies]] of 1797. During her later career, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' also served as Portsmouth's guard ship and ended her career in the early nineteenth century anchored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]] as the chief prison ship ''Pompee''. ''Pompee'' was also used as prison ship for French prisoners captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). The harsh treatment received aboard ''Pompee'' gained a national notoriety with the criminal classes of England, the name ''Pompey'' itself became a northern England slang word for prison.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2010,00.html?gusrc=gpd |title=Why is Portsmouth called Pompey? |work=The Guardian |author=David Francis |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> The ''Pompee'' became a familiar local landmark and gained a common association with the Royal Navy and the civilian Portsmouth population, who both then began associating ''Pompee'' with Portsmouth. ''Pompee'' was finally taken away to be broken up in [[Woolwich]] in 1817, but her name lived on in Portsmouth folklore, anglicised to \"''Pompey''\" over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe present Portsmouth Football Club were not the first football club in the city of Portsmouth to be known as ''Pompey''. In the 1890s, an amateur Portsmouth-based British Army team, '''Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C.''' were reported in newspapers with the ''Pompey'' nickname, as well as also being known as ''The Gunners''.  Royal Artillery Portsmouth's supporters were also responsible for creating [[Portsmouth F.C.#'The Pompey Chimes'|\"The Town Hall Chimes\"]] chant, which later became known as ''\"The Pompey Chimes\"'' chant in the twentieth century.  The chant originally began at Royal Artillery Portsmouth's home football ground at Burnaby Road, Portsmouth ([[United Services Recreation Ground]]) and was within easy earshot of the nearby Portsmouth Town Hall (now called [[Portsmouth Guildhall]]) clock bells, which had inspired the chant.\n\nRoyal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C. were disqualified for \"professionalism\" after an 1898\u201399 FA Amateur Cup match.  Royal Artillery were also forced to field only a team of amateur reserve players, thus weakening the remaining Royal Artillery team for the remainder of the 1898\u201399 Southern Football League season. Royal Artillery finished bottom of the [[1898\u201399 Southern Football League#Division One|table]], relegated after a relegation match with Cowes F.C. and were eventually disbanded. The \"Pompey\" nickname, the \"Town Hall Chimes\" chant, some of the Royal Artillery players and their supporters then migrated to a newly formed football club, named Portsmouth F.C., earlier formed on 5 April 1898.<ref name=\"portsmouth.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/heritage/history-of-the-chimes-1-1299340|title=History of the chimes|website=Portsmouth.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nPortsmouth F.C., as the \"new\" Pompey, played their first Southern Football League match away to Chatham Town on Saturday 2 September 1899, winning 0\u20131. Their first home match at Fratton Park stadium took place only four days later on Wednesday 6 September 1899, a friendly match against Southampton F.C., which Portsmouth won 2\u20130. During the first early seasons of Portsmouth F.C., the football team wore salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, white shorts and black socks. The pink shirts gave rise to an alternative nickname, ''''The Shrimps''''. 'The Shrimps' went out of common usage after 1909 when Portsmouth F.C. began playing in white shirts, navy blue shorts and navy blue stockings. After the original 1898 founding company was replaced in 1912, Portsmouth began playing in their now familiar blue shirts in the 1912\u201313 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Fratton Park entrance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The entrance to Fratton Park's South Stand, with its mock Tudor facade]]\n{{main|Fratton Park}}\nPortsmouth F.C. play their home games at Fratton Park, in the district of [[Milton, Portsmouth]]. The stadium has been home to the club throughout its entire history since the club formed in 1898. Fratton Park is affectionately nicknamed \"The Old Girl\" by Portsmouth F.C. supporters.\n\nPlans for relocation were first mooted in the early 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park. Most recently, plans for relocation have included new stadia on a site offered by the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Horsea Island]], between Stamshaw and Port Solent, and on reclaimed land in Portsmouth Harbour beside the existing naval base. The former was mooted as a possible [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] venue as part of England's bid process. However, the cost to the city's taxpayers to join the bid was deemed too great a risk to take.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8378313.stm |title=Football \u2013 Portsmouth pulls out of 2018 bid |publisher=BBC News |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> A third, oft returned-to option, is to build a new stadium on the site of the existing Fratton Park.\n\nFollowing Portsmouth F.C.'s financial troubles, subsequent relegation from the Premier League, and the failure of the England 2018 bid, as of May 2017 there are no active plans for a new club stadium.\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n{{main|South Coast derby}}\n[[File:Pompeywembley.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portsmouth fans at Wembley Stadium for the 2007\u201308 FA Cup semi-final with West Bromwich Albion]]\nPortsmouth's main rivals are [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who are 19.8 miles (31.8&nbsp;km) away, with the \"border\" between the two located in the Hampshire village of [[Titchfield]].  The [[South Coast Derby]] is one of the less frequently played rivalries within English football due to the clubs being in different divisions however this usually adds to the ferocity of the fixture.\n\nPrior to the mid/late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This [[Local derby|derby match]] has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only played league games against each other in four seasons (1987\u201388, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305 and 2011\u201312). Including Southern League games, there have been 64 league games between the clubs, but they have also met five times in the FA Cup, Portsmouth beating their rivals 4\u20131 at [[St Mary's Stadium]] in their last meeting in 2010, and twice in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] \u2013 with Southampton winning both times.\n\nMany Portsmouth supporters commonly use the derogatory nickname '''''Scummer''''' (plural: '''''Scummers''''') to describe Southampton fans, or collectively '''''Scum''''' to also include their football club, and indeed the city of Southampton itself.\n* A disproven common origin theory dating from the late twentieth century suggested that the ''Scum'' nickname was an acronym of ''Southampton Company of Union Men'', linked to a vague recollection of an unspecified and unsourced past dockers strike, in which Southampton-based dockers supposedly crossed Portsmouth dockyard picket lines when brought in as [[Strikebreaker|scab labour]] to work inside the naval base. This theory is almost certainly an urban myth, as Royal Navy dockers are not permitted to go on strike.\n* Victorian era dockers employed in the supposedly higher status [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Royal Dockyard]], looked down in disdain upon the civilian merchant port dockers at [[Port of Southampton|Southampton Docks]] and nicknamed them ''Scum'', as scum, flotsam and jetsam are useless residue found floating on, or nearby water.\n* According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ''Scummers'' was a derogatory name with naval origins for pirates or buccaneers, and was first recorded in use in 1585.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scummer |title=scummer |work=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=24 January 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jan/23/newsstory.sport8 |title=Scummers v Skates |work=The Guardian |author=Kevin Mitchell |date=23 January 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Portsmouth supporters have had the equally derogatory nickname '''''Skate''''' bestowed upon them by Southampton fans as a rebuttal to ''Scummer'' since the 1987\u201388 Division One season. This was unofficially chosen by Southampton fans from a list of insults compiled by a Southampton-based supporters fanzine called ''The Ugly Inside'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/48841/ |title=Why Bournemouth Will Never Be Saints Rivals ! |work=FansNetwork |date=17 October 2018 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Ironically, the chosen nickname ''Skate'' was actually stolen from the civilian population of Portsmouth, who had long used ''Skate'' as a derogatory insult or nickname for sailors based in Portsmouth Dockyard and other Royal Navy establishments. According to legend and folklore, Royal Navy matelots on long sea voyages were regularly denied female company, and would keep a [[Skate (fish)|skate]] (fish species) in their hammock or bunkside, as the mouth of the skate was supposedly used as a substitute vagina. Sailors ashore in Royal Navy uniform seeking the services of Portsmouth's prostitutes would often be refused service and met with a ''\"I ain't no skate bait, mate!\"'' rebuttal.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nAnother rivalry over the years, colloquially known as the \"Dockyard Derby\", is with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/7201902.stm|title=Naval support for Dockyard Derby|date=22 January 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2289954/Tynan-Plymouth-can-cause-derby-upset.html|title=Tynan: Plymouth can cause derby upset|date=25 January 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports.<ref name=harvey>{{cite book |title=Rivals: The Off-Beat Guide to the 92 League Clubs |last1=Harvey |first1=Geoff |last2=Strowger |first2=Vanessa |year=2004 |publisher=Aesculus Press Ltd |location=Swadlincote, Derbyshire |isbn=1-904328-13-X |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG7XLIPEHvAC&pg=PT111&dq=%22battle+of+the+ports%22+football |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]], mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 18/19 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunderland-portsmouth-story-so-far-16284128|title=Sunderland vs Portsmouth: A story of red cards, penalties and a simmering rivalry|first=Sean|last=Tighe|date=16 May 2019|website=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nLesser rivalries exist with fellow South Coast clubs [[A.F.C.

Football referees would use the Town Hall's clock bells as a reference to when the football match should end at 4&nbsp;pm. Just before 4&nbsp;pm the crowd of supporters would slowly lilt in unison with the Town Hall's chimes on the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle to signify full-time.

G. Paley''' (3 September 1823 \u2013 23 January 1895), was an English architect who practised in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], Lancashire, in the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century.  After leaving school in 1838, he went to Lancaster to become a pupil of [[Edmund Sharpe]], and in 1845 he joined Sharpe as a partner.  Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as the sole principal.  In 1868 [[Hubert Austin]] joined him as a partner, and in 1886 Paley's son [[Henry Paley|Henry]] (who was usually known as Harry) also became a partner.  This partnership continued until Edward Paley's death in 1895.\n\nPaley's major work was the design of new churches, but he also rebuilt, [[Victorian restoration|restored]], and made additions and alterations to existing churches.  His major new ecclesiastical design was that of St Peter's Church, Lancaster, which became [[Lancaster Cathedral]].  He also carried out secular commissions, mainly on [[English country house|country house]]s in the north-west of England.  His largest and most important secular work was the [[Royal Albert Asylum]] in Lancaster.  When designing churches, Paley mainly used the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, but in his secular works he employed a greater variety of styles, including [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] and [[Scottish Baronial architecture|Scottish Baronial]] as well as Gothic Revival.\n\nPaley played little part in the political life of Lancaster, but he was involved with cultural events and sports in the town.  His interests included music and archaeology, and he was involved in archery and rowing.  In addition to designing the Royal Albert Asylum, he served on its committee, as well as being on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute.  His work tended to be eclipsed in the later part of his career by Austin, and Paley is regarded as having been a competent architect, rather than a great one.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEdward Paley was born in [[Easingwold]], North Yorkshire, the seventh child and the fourth son of Revd Edmund Paley and Sarah n\u00e9e Apthorp. His older brother, Frederick Paley, was a classical scholar. His father was the local [[vicar#Anglican|vicar]], who in turn was second son of [[William Paley]], the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]].  Edward was initially educated at home, and later at [[Christ's Hospital]] when it was situated in London.  From school he went directly to Lancaster in 1838 to become a pupil of the architect Edmund Sharpe at the age of 15.{{sfn|Price|1998|p=27|ps=}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=49\u201350|ps=}}\n\n==Career and works==\n[[File:St Peter's Cathedral, Lancaster.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lancaster Cathedral]]|alt=A stone Gothic style church with a tall steeple]]\n\n===1845\u201368===\nIn 1845, after Paley had completed his [[Articled clerk|articles]], Sharpe appointed him as a partner in the practice,{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=55|ps=}} which was known as Sharpe and Paley, Architects,{{sfn|Price|1998|p=4\u20135|ps=}} (or more usually as Sharpe &&nbsp;Paley).{{sfn|Pevsner|2002|p=31|ps=}}  Sharpe then paid more attention to his interests outside the practice, and from 1847 Paley was carrying out most of the work.  In 1851, the year of Paley's marriage to Sharpe's sister, Sharpe formally retired from the practice, leaving Paley as sole principal.  The practice continued to use the title Sharpe and Paley until 1856, the year Sharpe moved to North Wales;{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=55|ps=}} the title was then changed to E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Paley.{{sfn|Price|1998|p=4\u20135|ps=}} In 1860 Paley moved his office from St&nbsp;Leonard's Gate to 32&nbsp;Castle Hill (later 24&nbsp;Castle Park).  This building was to serve the practice for the rest of its existence until it closed in 1946.  In 1871 Paley took over the ownership of the building.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=55|ps=}}\n\nBetween 1845 and 1851 it is difficult to determine how much responsibility each partner took in the commissions undertaken by the practice, but from 1851 it was Paley who was individually responsible.  The two partners did work together on the remodelling of [[Capernwray Hall]], and in the rebuilding of [[All Saints' Church, Wigan]].{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=55\u201356|ps=}}  Throughout Paley's career, the design of new churches was his major source of work.  Between 1851 and 1867 he was responsible for about 36&nbsp;new or rebuilt churches.  During the 1850s his new churches included [[St Patrick's Church, Preston Patrick|St&nbsp;Patrick, Preston Patrick]], [[St Peter's Church, Rylstone|St&nbsp;Peter, Rylstone]] (both 1852\u201353), [[St Anne's Church, Thwaites|St&nbsp;Anne, Thwaites]] (1853\u201354), [[Christ Church, Bacup]], (1854), and [[St. George's Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St&nbsp;George, Barrow-in-Furness]] (1859\u201360).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=56\u201359|ps=}}  All these churches were Anglican, but in 1857 came a commission for a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, St&nbsp;Peter, Lancaster, (which in 1924 became Lancaster Cathedral).  With its spire rising to {{convert|240|ft|m|0}}, it is considered to be Paley's finest design.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=59\u201361|ps=}}  Later major new churches include [[St Peter's Church, Quernmore|St&nbsp;Peter, Quernmore]], [[St Anne's Church, Singleton|St&nbsp;Anne, Singleton]] (both 1859\u201360), [[St Mark's Church, Preston|St&nbsp;Mark, Preston]] (1862\u201363), [[Holy Trinity Church, Bury|Holy Trinity, Bury]] (1863\u201364), [[St James' Church, Poolstock|St&nbsp;James, Poolstock]] (1863\u201366), [[St. James' Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St&nbsp;James, Barrow]] (1867\u201369), and his most substantial church of this period, [[St Peter's Church, Bolton|St&nbsp;Peter, Bolton]] (1867\u201371).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=62\u201368|ps=}}\n\nPaley also designed a great variety of secular buildings, the most important of which was the Royal Albert Asylum (1868\u201373), the largest building ever undertaken by the practice.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=75\u201377|ps=}}  He carried out much work on schools, designing town and village schools, and designing extensions for larger schools, including work for [[Giggleswick School]] (1849\u201351) and, for [[Rossall School]], a chapel (1861\u201362) and a new east wing (1867).  Paley carried out commissions for country houses, including the rebuilding of [[Wennington Hall]] (1855\u201356), and a new house, [[The Ridding]] in [[Bentham, North Yorkshire|Bentham]], North Yorkshire (1857\u201360).  There was also a variety of smaller works, including a music hall in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], cemetery buildings in Lancaster and [[Stalmine]], and industrial buildings.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=68\u201371|ps=}}  Paley's career coincided with the growth of the town of Barrow-in-Furness and the development of the [[Furness Railway]] and, being the major architect in the area, he gained many commissions relating to the town and the railway.  He developed working relationships with the major entrepreneurs, [[Sir James Ramsden|James Ramsden]], and [[Henry Schneider]], for whom he designed both domestic and industrial buildings.  An early commission was to convert a former [[manor house]] into the [[Furness Abbey Hotel]] for the railway (1847\u201348).  He later designed a large country house for Ramsden, [[Abbot's Wood, Cumbria|Abbot's Wood]] (1857\u201359, since demolished).  Paley's first station for the railway was Strand station in Barrow (1863, since demolished).  Subsequently, the practice was to be responsible for most of the buildings required for the railway.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=71\u201374|ps=}}\n\n===1868\u201395===\n[[File:St George's Church, Barrow.jpg|thumb|[[St. George's Church, Barrow-in-Furness]]|alt=A stone church seen from the west with a broad battlemented tower]]\nFrom 1868 until his death in 1895 Paley worked in partnerships.  He was joined by Hubert Austin in 1868, when the practice became known as Paley and Austin.  Paley's son Henry, usually known as Harry, joined the partnership in 1886, when the practice became Paley, Austin and Paley, a title it retained until Edward Paley's death.{{sfn|Price|1998|p=4\u20135|ps=}}  From 1868 it is difficult to know what part any one partner contributed to any particular project.  Almost all the works were attributed to the partnership as a whole, and not to an individual partner.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  What is certain is that the firm enjoyed its most successful period and designed most of its most admired buildings during these years.  New features appeared, including what Brandwood et al. describe as \"a new-found muscularity which tended to be uncharacteristic of Paley's work\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  Although Paley had occasionally used [[Perpendicular style|Perpendicular]] features in his churches, these were used much more frequently, so much so that the practice is credited with playing a part in what Brandwood et al. term the \"Perpendicular revival in the North\",{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=94|ps=}} and even with playing a \"nationally pioneering role\" in the \"rehabilitation of the Perpendicular style as an acceptable stylistic choice\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=92|ps=}}  In addition, later in this period, the use of features derived from the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]] was introduced.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  It is not known what part Edward Paley played in these developments, but Brandwood et al. argue that they are \"undoubtedly attributable to the influence of Austin\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  This is not to down-play the work done by Paley during this period.  Brandwood et al. point out that of the two, Paley had the more outgoing personality, and because of this, and because of his senior position, the writers suggest that he, rather than Austin, would \"tend to 'front' many of the dealings of the firm\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=6|ps=}}  They also suggest that Paley would be more at ease in dealing with patrons, such as the Duke of Devonshire, in discussing the rebuilding of [[Holker Hall]] after the fire of 1871,{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=6, 90|ps=}} and that he would have played a greater part in training the pupils in the practice.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=6|ps=}}\n\nPaley did have some individual responsibilities within the practice.  He took over from Sharpe as Bridgemaster of the [[Lonsdale (hundred)|South Lonsdale Hundred]] in 1860, and in 1868 he was appointed as inspector of [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster Gaol]] and the [[Judges Lodgings, Lancaster|Judge's Lodgings]].  He served on the committee of the Royal Albert Asylum for many years, taking much interest in its management.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=53\u201354|ps=}}  He was a director of the Lancaster Waggon Company, for whom he designed their factory, the [[Lancaster Carriage and Wagon Works]] (1864\u201365).{{sfn|Price|1998|p=29|ps=}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=70, 221|ps=}}  In his role as bridgemaster he was responsible for the new road bridge over the [[River Lune]] at [[Caton, Lancashire|Caton]] (1882\u201383) following its collapse in 1881.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=53|ps=}}  Paley became a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1871, served on its council for two periods, and at the time of his death was one of its examiners.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=54|ps=}}\n\n==Architectural styles==\n[[File:Royal Albert Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Albert Hospital|Royal Albert Asylum]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], showing the tower with its French features|alt=Part of a three-storey building with a tower surmounted by a Mansard roof]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century ecclesiastical architecture was moving away from the [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style towards [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic]].  Initially the churches in Gothic Revival style incorporated Gothic-like features, such as [[lancet window]]s, and towers with [[pinnacle]]s and [[crocket]]s.  This was known as a pre-archaeological style and was used in the first phase of the [[Commissioners' Church]]es.  [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Pugin]] argued that these features should correctly and accurately reflect [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Gothic architecture rather than mimic it, and Sharpe became an expert in this movement.  Paley learned much of this from Sharpe and as a consequence incorporated \"correct\" Gothic features in his own work.  At the same time the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were advocating a more [[sacrament]]al form of [[liturgy]], which required a larger [[chancel]] than that normally provided in the Commissioners' Churches.  Paley was also influenced in this by his brother, Frederick, who was a member of the Camden Society and was himself an expert on medieval architecture.{{sfn|Price|1998|pp=38\u201341|ps=}}  Most of Paley's churches followed precedents from the 13th and 14th&nbsp;centuries, and were in [[Early English style|Early English]], or in [[Decorated style]], mainly the latter.  Their common plan consisted of open roofs, benches for the congregation, stalls in the chancel, a [[pulpit]] to the side of the entrance to the chancel, steps leading up to the chancel, and a [[baptismal font|font]] at the west end.  Paley is not seen as an innovator in church design, and he did not use devices such as [[polychromy]], which was being introduced elsewhere.  He did however introduce Perpendicular features into some of his designs, for example, St&nbsp;Patrick, Preston Patrick, St&nbsp;Peter, Rylstone (both 1852\u201353), and in the rebuilding of [[St Paul's Church, Brookhouse]] (1865\u201367).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=56\u201358|ps=}}  Paley's early new churches had plastered interiors, but in 1860 he introduced an interior of bare brick in St&nbsp;Peter, Quernmore.

G. Paley''' (3 September 1823 \u2013 23 January 1895), was an English architect who practised in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], Lancashire, in the second half of the 19th&nbsp;century.  After leaving school in 1838, he went to Lancaster to become a pupil of [[Edmund Sharpe]], and in 1845 he joined Sharpe as a partner.  Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as the sole principal.  In 1868 [[Hubert Austin]] joined him as a partner, and in 1886 Paley's son [[Henry Paley|Henry]] (who was usually known as Harry) also became a partner.  This partnership continued until Edward Paley's death in 1895.\n\nPaley's major work was the design of new churches, but he also rebuilt, [[Victorian restoration|restored]], and made additions and alterations to existing churches.  His major new ecclesiastical design was that of St Peter's Church, Lancaster, which became [[Lancaster Cathedral]].  He also carried out secular commissions, mainly on [[English country house|country house]]s in the north-west of England.  His largest and most important secular work was the [[Royal Albert Asylum]] in Lancaster.  When designing churches, Paley mainly used the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, but in his secular works he employed a greater variety of styles, including [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] and [[Scottish Baronial architecture|Scottish Baronial]] as well as Gothic Revival.\n\nPaley played little part in the political life of Lancaster, but he was involved with cultural events and sports in the town.  His interests included music and archaeology, and he was involved in archery and rowing.  In addition to designing the Royal Albert Asylum, he served on its committee, as well as being on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute.  His work tended to be eclipsed in the later part of his career by Austin, and Paley is regarded as having been a competent architect, rather than a great one.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEdward Paley was born in [[Easingwold]], North Yorkshire, the seventh child and the fourth son of Revd Edmund Paley and Sarah n\u00e9e Apthorp.  His father was the local [[vicar#Anglican|vicar]], who in turn was second son of [[William Paley]], the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]].  Edward was initially educated at home, and later at [[Christ's Hospital]] when it was situated in London.  From school he went directly to Lancaster in 1838 to become a pupil of the architect Edmund Sharpe at the age of 15.{{sfn|Price|1998|p=27|ps=}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=49\u201350|ps=}}\n\n==Career and works==\n[[File:St Peter's Cathedral, Lancaster.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lancaster Cathedral]]|alt=A stone Gothic style church with a tall steeple]]\n\n===1845\u201368===\nIn 1845, after Paley had completed his [[Articled clerk|articles]], Sharpe appointed him as a partner in the practice,{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=55|ps=}} which was known as Sharpe and Paley, Architects,{{sfn|Price|1998|p=4\u20135|ps=}} (or more usually as Sharpe &&nbsp;Paley).{{sfn|Pevsner|2002|p=31|ps=}}  Sharpe then paid more attention to his interests outside the practice, and from 1847 Paley was carrying out most of the work.  In 1851, the year of Paley's marriage to Sharpe's sister, Sharpe formally retired from the practice, leaving Paley as sole principal.  The practice continued to use the title Sharpe and Paley until 1856, the year Sharpe moved to North Wales;{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=55|ps=}} the title was then changed to E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Paley.{{sfn|Price|1998|p=4\u20135|ps=}} In 1860 Paley moved his office from St&nbsp;Leonard's Gate to 32&nbsp;Castle Hill (later 24&nbsp;Castle Park).  This building was to serve the practice for the rest of its existence until it closed in 1946.  In 1871 Paley took over the ownership of the building.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=55|ps=}}\n\nBetween 1845 and 1851 it is difficult to determine how much responsibility each partner took in the commissions undertaken by the practice, but from 1851 it was Paley who was individually responsible.  The two partners did work together on the remodelling of [[Capernwray Hall]], and in the rebuilding of [[All Saints' Church, Wigan]].{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=55\u201356|ps=}}  Throughout Paley's career, the design of new churches was his major source of work.  Between 1851 and 1867 he was responsible for about 36&nbsp;new or rebuilt churches.  During the 1850s his new churches included [[St Patrick's Church, Preston Patrick|St&nbsp;Patrick, Preston Patrick]], [[St Peter's Church, Rylstone|St&nbsp;Peter, Rylstone]] (both 1852\u201353), [[St Anne's Church, Thwaites|St&nbsp;Anne, Thwaites]] (1853\u201354), [[Christ Church, Bacup]], (1854), and [[St. George's Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St&nbsp;George, Barrow-in-Furness]] (1859\u201360).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=56\u201359|ps=}}  All these churches were Anglican, but in 1857 came a commission for a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, St&nbsp;Peter, Lancaster, (which in 1924 became Lancaster Cathedral).  With its spire rising to {{convert|240|ft|m|0}}, it is considered to be Paley's finest design.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=59\u201361|ps=}}  Later major new churches include [[St Peter's Church, Quernmore|St&nbsp;Peter, Quernmore]], [[St Anne's Church, Singleton|St&nbsp;Anne, Singleton]] (both 1859\u201360), [[St Mark's Church, Preston|St&nbsp;Mark, Preston]] (1862\u201363), [[Holy Trinity Church, Bury|Holy Trinity, Bury]] (1863\u201364), [[St James' Church, Poolstock|St&nbsp;James, Poolstock]] (1863\u201366), [[St. James' Church, Barrow-in-Furness|St&nbsp;James, Barrow]] (1867\u201369), and his most substantial church of this period, [[St Peter's Church, Bolton|St&nbsp;Peter, Bolton]] (1867\u201371).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=62\u201368|ps=}}\n\nPaley also designed a great variety of secular buildings, the most important of which was the Royal Albert Asylum (1868\u201373), the largest building ever undertaken by the practice.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=75\u201377|ps=}}  He carried out much work on schools, designing town and village schools, and designing extensions for larger schools, including work for [[Giggleswick School]] (1849\u201351) and, for [[Rossall School]], a chapel (1861\u201362) and a new east wing (1867).  Paley carried out commissions for country houses, including the rebuilding of [[Wennington Hall]] (1855\u201356), and a new house, [[The Ridding]] in [[Bentham, North Yorkshire|Bentham]], North Yorkshire (1857\u201360).  There was also a variety of smaller works, including a music hall in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], cemetery buildings in Lancaster and [[Stalmine]], and industrial buildings.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=68\u201371|ps=}}  Paley's career coincided with the growth of the town of Barrow-in-Furness and the development of the [[Furness Railway]] and, being the major architect in the area, he gained many commissions relating to the town and the railway.  He developed working relationships with the major entrepreneurs, [[Sir James Ramsden|James Ramsden]], and [[Henry Schneider]], for whom he designed both domestic and industrial buildings.  An early commission was to convert a former [[manor house]] into the [[Furness Abbey Hotel]] for the railway (1847\u201348).  He later designed a large country house for Ramsden, [[Abbot's Wood, Cumbria|Abbot's Wood]] (1857\u201359, since demolished).  Paley's first station for the railway was Strand station in Barrow (1863, since demolished).  Subsequently, the practice was to be responsible for most of the buildings required for the railway.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=71\u201374|ps=}}\n\n===1868\u201395===\n[[File:St George's Church, Barrow.jpg|thumb|[[St. George's Church, Barrow-in-Furness]]|alt=A stone church seen from the west with a broad battlemented tower]]\nFrom 1868 until his death in 1895 Paley worked in partnerships.  He was joined by Hubert Austin in 1868, when the practice became known as Paley and Austin.  Paley's son Henry, usually known as Harry, joined the partnership in 1886, when the practice became Paley, Austin and Paley, a title it retained until Edward Paley's death.{{sfn|Price|1998|p=4\u20135|ps=}}  From 1868 it is difficult to know what part any one partner contributed to any particular project.  Almost all the works were attributed to the partnership as a whole, and not to an individual partner.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  What is certain is that the firm enjoyed its most successful period and designed most of its most admired buildings during these years.  New features appeared, including what Brandwood et al. describe as \"a new-found muscularity which tended to be uncharacteristic of Paley's work\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  Although Paley had occasionally used [[Perpendicular style|Perpendicular]] features in his churches, these were used much more frequently, so much so that the practice is credited with playing a part in what Brandwood et al. term the \"Perpendicular revival in the North\",{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=94|ps=}} and even with playing a \"nationally pioneering role\" in the \"rehabilitation of the Perpendicular style as an acceptable stylistic choice\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=92|ps=}}  In addition, later in this period, the use of features derived from the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]] was introduced.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  It is not known what part Edward Paley played in these developments, but Brandwood et al. argue that they are \"undoubtedly attributable to the influence of Austin\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=80|ps=}}  This is not to down-play the work done by Paley during this period.  Brandwood et al. point out that of the two, Paley had the more outgoing personality, and because of this, and because of his senior position, the writers suggest that he, rather than Austin, would \"tend to 'front' many of the dealings of the firm\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=6|ps=}}  They also suggest that Paley would be more at ease in dealing with patrons, such as the Duke of Devonshire, in discussing the rebuilding of [[Holker Hall]] after the fire of 1871,{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=6, 90|ps=}} and that he would have played a greater part in training the pupils in the practice.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=6|ps=}}\n\nPaley did have some individual responsibilities within the practice.  He took over from Sharpe as Bridgemaster of the [[Lonsdale (hundred)|South Lonsdale Hundred]] in 1860, and in 1868 he was appointed as inspector of [[Lancaster Castle|Lancaster Gaol]] and the [[Judges Lodgings, Lancaster|Judge's Lodgings]].  He served on the committee of the Royal Albert Asylum for many years, taking much interest in its management.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=53\u201354|ps=}}  He was a director of the Lancaster Waggon Company, for whom he designed their factory, the [[Lancaster Carriage and Wagon Works]] (1864\u201365).{{sfn|Price|1998|p=29|ps=}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=70, 221|ps=}}  In his role as bridgemaster he was responsible for the new road bridge over the [[River Lune]] at [[Caton, Lancashire|Caton]] (1882\u201383) following its collapse in 1881.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=53|ps=}}  Paley became a fellow of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in 1871, served on its council for two periods, and at the time of his death was one of its examiners.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=54|ps=}}\n\n==Architectural styles==\n[[File:Royal Albert Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Albert Hospital|Royal Albert Asylum]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], showing the tower with its French features|alt=Part of a three-storey building with a tower surmounted by a Mansard roof]]\nDuring the first half of the 19th&nbsp;century ecclesiastical architecture was moving away from the [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style towards [[English Gothic architecture|Gothic]].

This was known as a pre-archaeological style and was used in the first phase of the [[Commissioners' Church]]es.  [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|A.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Pugin]] argued that these features should correctly and accurately reflect [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Gothic architecture rather than mimic it, and Sharpe became an expert in this movement.  Paley learned much of this from Sharpe and as a consequence incorporated \"correct\" Gothic features in his own work.  At the same time the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]], were advocating a more [[sacrament]]al form of [[liturgy]], which required a larger [[chancel]] than that normally provided in the Commissioners' Churches.  Paley was also influenced in this by his brother, Frederick, who was a member of the Camden Society and was himself an expert on medieval architecture.{{sfn|Price|1998|pp=38\u201341|ps=}}  Most of Paley's churches followed precedents from the 13th and 14th&nbsp;centuries, and were in [[Early English style|Early English]], or in [[Decorated style]], mainly the latter.  Their common plan consisted of open roofs, benches for the congregation, stalls in the chancel, a [[pulpit]] to the side of the entrance to the chancel, steps leading up to the chancel, and a [[baptismal font|font]] at the west end.  Paley is not seen as an innovator in church design, and he did not use devices such as [[polychromy]], which was being introduced elsewhere.  He did however introduce Perpendicular features into some of his designs, for example, St&nbsp;Patrick, Preston Patrick, St&nbsp;Peter, Rylstone (both 1852\u201353), and in the rebuilding of [[St Paul's Church, Brookhouse]] (1865\u201367).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=56\u201358|ps=}}  Paley's early new churches had plastered interiors, but in 1860 he introduced an interior of bare brick in St&nbsp;Peter, Quernmore.  This feature was repeated in a similar manner in later churches including St&nbsp;Mark, Preston, and St&nbsp;James, Barrow.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=62|ps=}}\n\nIn his secular commissions, Paley employed a greater variety of architectural styles, including features of Tudor Revival architecture.  The earliest major building in which he used this style was Wennington Hall (1855\u201356).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=70\u201371|ps=}}{{sfn|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=684|ps=}}  As a contrast was the country house, [[The Ridding]] (1857\u201360), which is in Scottish Baronial style, the only building in which he used this style.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=71|ps=}}  Another building in Tudor style is the country house [[Eccle Riggs]] (1865).{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=221|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hyde|Pevsner|2010|p=201|ps=}}  His most important building, the Royal Albert Asylum (1868\u201373), is Gothic in style,{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=76|ps=}} but, in the opinion of Hartwell and Pevsner, it incorporates French features, in particular the steep [[hip roof|hipped roof]] of the central tower.{{sfn|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=405|ps=}}  After Hubert Austin joined the practice, it becomes difficult to determine the specific input of any individual partner.  New architectural features were introduced, and Brandwood et al. consider that Paley \"tends to be overshadowed\" by Austin,{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=77|ps=}} but the practice continued to design fine buildings throughout the time that Paley was a principal.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=77|ps=}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Parish church, Brookhouse.jpg|thumb|[[St Paul's Church, Brookhouse]], a church attended by Paley that had been largely rebuilt by him|alt=A stone church seen from the south-west with a large battlemented tower]]\nEdward Paley married Frances Sharpe, Edmund Sharpe's sister, in June 1851.  They had five children: three daughters followed by two sons, the youngest of whom, Henry Anderson (known as Harry), joined his father as a partner in the practice.  The family lived initially at 35 Castle Park, near [[Lancaster Castle]], before moving to a house to the south of Lancaster called ''The Greaves'', which Paley designed himself.  He also converted a former [[workhouse]] into a [[English country house|country house]] for himself, called ''Moorgarth'', at Brookhouse, near [[Caton, Lancashire|Caton]] to the north-east of Lancaster.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=51\u201352|ps=}}  Paley was a keen [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churchman, initially attending [[Lancaster Priory]], and later St Paul's Church, Brookhouse, a church that he largely rebuilt in 1866\u201367.  Paley took little interest in local politics, although he did serve as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] councillor for three years from 1858; he declined to be renominated at the end of his term.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=52|ps=}}  He was involved in other ways in social concerns, serving on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute.  He also played a major part in establishing the Royal Albert Asylum, designing the building and serving on its committee.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=53\u201354|ps=}}  Paley shared sporting and musical interests with Sharpe, being a member of the John O'Gaunt Bowmen, and helping Sharpe to set up the Lancaster Rowing Club. Paley and his wife were members of the Lancaster Choral Society, Paley was involved with the Athenaeum Company and the Lancaster Philosophical Society, and in 1873 founded the County Club, a [[gentleman's club]] in Lancaster.  He was also interested in archaeology, and was a founder member of the [[Royal Archaeological Institute|Royal Archaeological Society]], and a member of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=52\u201353|ps=}} \n\n===Death===\nPaley died on 23 January 1895, having suffered from [[typhoid fever]] for 20&nbsp;days.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=135\u2013136|ps=}}  Although he had not played a prominent role in the political life of Lancaster he had been active in the life of the town, and was given a civic funeral;{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=6, 52|ps=}} he was buried in Lancaster Cemetery. His [[estate (law)|estate]] amounted to \u00a371,939 ({{Inflation|UK|71939|1895|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=135\u2013136|ps=}}\n\n==Appraisal==\n\nHartwell and Pevsner consider that the architectural partnership of Austin and Paley \"did more outstanding work than any other in the county\", and that this work was \"outstanding in the national as well as the regional context\".{{sfn|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=31|ps=}}{{efn|The county referred to was the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of Lancashire, which was then much larger than the present [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]]; it included parts of what are now [[Cumbria]], Greater Manchester and [[Merseyside]].}}  Although during the time of the Paley and Austin partnership, Austin has been given more credit for the originality of the designs, Paley had a good reputation as a church architect in his own right.  After his death the ''Architect & Contract Reporter'' carried an article highlighting this aspect of his work.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=56|ps=}}  In respect of St&nbsp;Peter, Lancaster (later Lancaster Cathedral), Brandwood et al. consider it to be \"Paley's masterpiece as an independent church architect\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=59|ps=}}  In 1901 the German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius mentioned it in his survey of English churches \"with some enthusiasm\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=61|ps=}}  [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] writing in 1969 described it as \"a fine, aspiring building\",{{sfn|Pevsner|2002|p=155|ps=}} and Pevsner's successors in the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series describe it as his \"''chef d'oeuvre''\".{{sfn|Hartwell|Pevsner|2009|p=369|ps=}}  Later Paley's work tended to be overshadowed by Austin, although it is usually impossible to determine which partner was responsible for which design.{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|pp=77\u201379|ps=}}\n\nPaley has been described as being \"an attractive individual, popular and a leading figure in the life of Lancaster\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=6|ps=}}  His obituary in the ''Lancaster Guardian'' described him as \"one of nature's gentlemen, always cheerful and kindly&nbsp;... esteemed and respected by all\".{{sfn|Brandwood|Austin|Hughes|Price|2012|p=52|ps=}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Sharpe, Paley and Austin]]\n*[[List of works by Sharpe and Paley]]\n*[[List of ecclesiastical works by E.

It covered the land of contemporary [[Rize Province]] and the littoral of contemporary [[Artvin Province]].\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Ottoman [[Siege of Trebizond (1461)|conquest of Trebizond Empire]] and later [[Ottoman invasion of Guria]] in 1547, Laz populated area known as [[Lazia (Pontus)|Lazia]] became its own distinctive area ([[sanjak]]) as part of [[eyalet]] of [[Trebizond Eyalet|Trabzon]], under the administration of a Governor who governed from the town of Rizaion ([[Rize]]). His title was \"''Lazistan [[Mutasarr\u0131f|Mutasserif]]\"''; in other words \"''Governor of Lazistan\"''. The Lazistan sanjak was divided into [[kaza|caza]]s, namely those of: [[Of, Turkey|Ofi]], [[Rize|Rizaion]], [[Pazar, Rize|Athena]], [[Hopa]], [[Gonio Fortress|Gonia]] and [[Batumi|Batum]].\n\nNot only the [[Pasha]]s (governors) of Trabzon until the 19th century, but real authority in many of the ''[[Kaza|cazas]]'' (districts) of each sanjak by the mid-17th century lay in the hands of relatively independent native Laz [[derebey]]s (\"valley-lords\"), or feudal chiefs who exercised absolute authority in their own districts, carried on petty warfare with each other, did not owe allegiance to a superior and never paid contributions to the sultan. This state of insubordination was not really broken until the assertion of Ottoman authority during the reforms of the [[Osman Nuri Pasha|Osman Pasha]] in 1850s.\n\nIn 1547, Ottomans acquired the coastal fortress of [[Gonio Fortress|Gonia]], which served as capital of Lazistan; then [[Batumi|Batum]] until it was acquired by the Russians in 1878, throughout the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]], thereafter, [[Rize]] became the capital of the sanjak. The Muslim Lazs living near the war zones in [[Batum Oblast|Batumi Oblast]] were subjected to ethnic cleansing; many Lazes living in Batumi fled to the Ottoman Empire, settling along the southern Black Sea coast to the east of [[Samsun]] and [[Marmara Region|Marmara region]].\n\nAround 1914 Ottoman policy towards the Christian population shifted; state policy was since focused to the forceful migration of Christian [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic Greek]] and Laz population living in coastal areas to the Anatolian hinterland. In the 1920s Christian population of the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] were expelled to [[Greece]].\n\nIn 1917, after the [[Russian Revolution]], Lazs became citizents of [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], and eventually became [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] in 1921. Simultaneously, a [[Treaty of Moscow (1921)|treaty of friendship]] was signed in Moscow between [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] and the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]], whereby southern portions of former [[Batum Oblast]] - later known as [[Artvin]], was awarded to Turkey, which renounced its claims to Batumi.\n\nThe autonomous Lazistan sanjak existed until the end of the empire in 1923. The designation of the term of Lazistan was officially banned in 1926, by the [[Kemalism|Kemalists]].<ref>Thys-\u015eenocak, Lucienne. Ottoman Women Builders. Aldershot, England: Ashgate, 2006.

He and his descendants, ran sheep and then cattle until the 1990s. As with many pastoral enterprises during the 1980s and 1990s, Angas Downs struggled financially and was eventually taken over by the mortgagee in 1994 before being purchased by the nearby [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] community. Since 1994, it has been owned by the Imanpa Development Association Inc., and managed by their company Lisanote Pty. Ltd. Descendants of William Liddle have living areas on the property.\n\nFrederick GG Rose visited Angas Downs during July\u2013October 1962 and documented the people and ways of life. He took specific interest in documenting the process of change in Aboriginal culture in context with contact with white civilisation. He also reported the genealogy of the Liddle family and other Aboriginals living on Angas Downs. More information on Aboriginal histories of Angas Downs can be found in Fred Rose's Book \"The wind of change in central Australia: The Aborigines at Angas Downs, 1962\".<ref>{{Cite book| author = Rose F | year = 1965 | title = The wind of change in central Australia: The Aborigines at Angas Downs, 1962 | publisher = Akademie Verlag | location = Berlin}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Angas Downs was declared an Indigenous Protected Area and remains a resource for members of the  Imanpa  Community, some of whom grew up and worked on Angas Downs.\n\nThe property still runs 300-400 head of cattle, restricted to a 266&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> paddock in the southeast. Tourists can join tours to Angas Downs led by members of the Imanpa community to learn about the pastoral, cultural and natural history of the property.\n\n==Imanpa==\nResidents of Imanpa  include Matuntara descendants (the original occupiers of Angas Downs region), [[Yankunytjatjara]] and [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people. The Imanpa Development Association holds the lease for Angas Downs through its company Lisanote Pty Ltd.\n\n===Challenges===\nAs for many remote Indigenous Communities in Australia, the [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] Community faces significant health, employment and educational challenges. Senior men and women say there is a breakdown in the old ways and that law and culture - the [[Tjukurpa]] is being lost. Land management activities restore the station environment and also improve the self-esteem and motivation of the Indigenous people by appealing to their aspiration to care for their country, and provide opportunities for training, employment and economic development. The Anangu elders, the ''Tjilpis'' and ''Myinkmaku'', believe many social and health problems are the result of a breakdown in the old ways, and that implementation of [[Tjukurpa]] (Anangu customary knowledge) and restoring the land would help solve these problems. ''Piranpa'' (white fella science) and [[Tjukurpa]]  can work together to do these things. It will make sure Tjukurpa and culture continue, and get children and grandchildren to learn about land. Looking after land is the key to Tjukurpa. Also more bush tucker means healthier food.\n\nAnangu want to increase the amount of kuka (game animals like [[emu]] (''Dromaius novaehollandiae'') and [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') and mai (plant food) like quandong (''[[Santalum acuminatum]]'')). Anangu also want to bring back species that aren\u2019t in the land any more like [[rufous hare-wallaby|mala]] and [[common brushtail possum]].\n\n[[File:Tjuki tells a dreaming story about Manpi (pigeon).jpg|thumb|right|Tjuki tells a dreaming story about Manpi (a pigeon) - Angas Downs IPA provides opportunity for elders to impart cultural and environmental knowledge to younger generations]]\n[[File:Wilbiabefore.JPG|thumb|right|Wilbia (Wilpiya) soak before restoration, damage by feral camels 1998]]\n[[File:Camel at Wilbia.JPG|thumb|right|Feral camel at Wilbia/Wilpiya soak before restoration 1998]]\n[[File:WilbiaRestored.jpg|thumb|right|Wilbia/Wilpiya soak after restoration 2010]]\n[[File:Fence line gradient - camel control.JPG|thumb|Camel control fence on Angas Downs showing improvements to vegetation without camel, cattle and horse browsing.]]\n[[File:Emu chicks on Angas Downs2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Ranger David Wongway looking after emu chicks on Angas Downs September 2010.jpg]]\n\n==Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area Plan of Management==\nThrough the support of the Australian Government's Caring for our Country, Working on Country<ref name=WOC/> and [[Indigenous Protected Areas]] programs, [[Anangu]] Rangers and the [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] community are restoring the landscape and protecting their cultural heritage using the [[Kuka Kanyini]] principles.\n\nA plan of management was prepared by the members of the community with support from Australian Wildlife Services.<ref name=Wilson/><ref name=\"AWS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au/category/uncategorized/angas-downs/|title=Category: Angas Downs|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> It draws on traditional land management practices and sets out priorities for scientists and wildlife managers to work with [[Anangu]] from [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] to increase kuka (game), control ferals and protect cultural sites and the environment.<ref name=\"awt.com.au\"/>\n\n'''Objectives'''\n\nTo manage land and wildlife resources in order to maintain Anangu culture, conserve biodiversity and enable sustainable production in support of human communities and economic development.\nIn greater detail, the plan sets out how to:\n\n* increase wildlife populations and estimate hunting yields\n* identify wildlife refuge areas\n* restore and protect water sources\n* restore patch burning practices\n* control feral animals and weeds\n* exchange information across the region.\n\nThe plan outlines the significance of Angas Downs\u2019 biodiversity, the importance of its conservation and its contribution to the Imanpa Community.

''Simoselaps betholdi'' (Jan's banded snake), ''Suta punctata'' (little spotted snake), ''[[Demansia psammophis]]'' (yellow-faced whipsnake), ''Tiliqua multifasciata'' (Centralian blue-tongued skink), ''[[Ramphotyphlops endoterus]]'' (interior blind snake), ''Pygopus nigriceps'' (western hooded scaly-foot), [[woma python|woma]], ''[[Nephrurus]] laevissimus'', ''[[Nephrurus]] levis levis'', ''Morethia ruficauda'' and ''Egernia inornata'' (desert skink) among others have been detected. Mammals detected included [[kultarr]], [[Wongai ningaui]], spinifex hopping mice, sandy inland mice and [[lesser hairy-footed dunnart]].\n\n==Emu breeding on Angas Downs==\nEmu populations are very low on Angas Downs, as is the case in much of the Northern Territory. They are an important species to the local [[Anangu]] and traditional owners and to ecological processes. In combination with land management and control of feral animals, Anangu rangers will implement an emu breeding program to increase emus in the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au|title=Australian Wildlife Services|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> Local knowledge<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alicespringsdesertpark.com.au/about/pdf/emus_and_quandongs.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317194641/http://www.alicespringsdesertpark.com.au/about/pdf/emus_and_quandongs.pdf# |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> has suggested that emus may also increase the success of quandong (''Santalum acuminatum'') germination after the seed is eaten and has passed through the gut - this could be due to a combination of seed coat break down and being deposited in rich nutrient filled dung.

They were flown into Ayers Rock airport ([[Uluru]]) by [[Qantas]] and driven to the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area. After successful breeding, the emus will be released into a larger sanctuary area on Angas Downs. Angas Downs rangers also now own an egg incubator which will be used for increasing breeding success in following years.  The chicks and incubator were bought with donations provided by the Rotary Club of Canberra Burley Griffin. Progress of the emu chicks can be found [http://www.awt.com.au/2012/04/18/emu-chicks-arrive-at-angas-downs/ here].\n\n==Aerial surveys of Angas Downs - camels, kangaroos and feral horse populations==\nAerial surveys of the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area and surrounding lands were completed in June 2010. The survey was flown by Dr George Wilson using standard procedures for fixed-wing aircraft surveys. Indigenous observer, Brad Lander, and Jennifer Smits<ref name=AWS/> counted animals seen at low level and 200m on either side of the aircraft. Species targeted/observed included camels, kangaroos, horses, feral cattle, emus, euros, dingos and bustards (turkeys).\n\nThe study was vital to understanding populations of kangaroos and pressures from camel and horse populations on the property and hence native wildlife.\n\nUsing mapping program ArcGis 9.3, observations were interpolated to form maps showing spatial variability (animals/km<sup>2</sup>) of populations across the region. Estimated average density rates of kangaroos and camels across Angas Downs was 0.91 \u00b1 0.16 and 0.24 \u00b10.07 per km<sup>2</sup> respectively. It was noted that camel populations were largely dispersed due to recent high rainfall in central Australia (as at June 2010). Spatial variability of grazing pressures was also investigated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au/2010/08/04/aerial-surveys-to-estimate-populations-of-camels-kangaroos-horses-angas-downs-nt/|title=Aerial Surveys to estimate populations of Camels, Kangaroos, Horses\u2026Angas Downs, NT|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Trial tours==\nAngas Downs is interested in development of small scale, tourism ventures.

With effective management of water and sustainable harvesting of populations of native wildlife, Angas Downs could become a significant location for conservation in central Australia. Rangers on Angas Downs are improving the environment to protect and increase important animals and plants using a combination of traditional knowledge and western science.\n\n==Pastoral history==\nAngas Downs Station was first taken up for pastoral purposes by William Liddle in 1927. He and his descendants, ran sheep and then cattle until the 1990s. As with many pastoral enterprises during the 1980s and 1990s, Angas Downs struggled financially and was eventually taken over by the mortgagee in 1994 before being purchased by the nearby [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] community. Since 1994, it has been owned by the Imanpa Development Association Inc., and managed by their company Lisanote Pty. Ltd. Descendants of William Liddle have living areas on the property.\n\nFrederick GG Rose visited Angas Downs during July\u2013October 1962 and documented the people and ways of life. He took specific interest in documenting the process of change in Aboriginal culture in context with contact with white civilisation. He also reported the genealogy of the Liddle family and other Aboriginals living on Angas Downs. More information on Aboriginal histories of Angas Downs can be found in Fred Rose's Book \"The wind of change in central Australia: The Aborigines at Angas Downs, 1962\".<ref>{{Cite book| author = Rose F | year = 1965 | title = The wind of change in central Australia: The Aborigines at Angas Downs, 1962 | publisher = Akademie Verlag | location = Berlin}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Angas Downs was declared an Indigenous Protected Area and remains a resource for members of the  Imanpa  Community, some of whom grew up and worked on Angas Downs.\n\nThe property still runs 300-400 head of cattle, restricted to a 266&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> paddock in the southeast. Tourists can join tours to Angas Downs led by members of the Imanpa community to learn about the pastoral, cultural and natural history of the property.\n\n==Imanpa==\nResidents of Imanpa  include Matuntara descendants (the original occupiers of Angas Downs region), [[Yankunytjatjara]] and [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people. The Imanpa Development Association holds the lease for Angas Downs through its company Lisanote Pty Ltd.\n\n===Challenges===\nAs for many remote Indigenous Communities in Australia, the [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] Community faces significant health, employment and educational challenges. Senior men and women say there is a breakdown in the old ways and that law and culture - the [[Tjukurpa]] is being lost. Land management activities restore the station environment and also improve the self-esteem and motivation of the Indigenous people by appealing to their aspiration to care for their country, and provide opportunities for training, employment and economic development. The Anangu elders, the ''Tjilpis'' and ''Myinkmaku'', believe many social and health problems are the result of a breakdown in the old ways, and that implementation of [[Tjukurpa]] (Anangu customary knowledge) and restoring the land would help solve these problems. ''Piranpa'' (white fella science) and [[Tjukurpa]]  can work together to do these things. It will make sure Tjukurpa and culture continue, and get children and grandchildren to learn about land. Looking after land is the key to Tjukurpa. Also more bush tucker means healthier food.\n\nAnangu want to increase the amount of kuka (game animals like [[emu]] (''Dromaius novaehollandiae'') and [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') and mai (plant food) like quandong (''[[Santalum acuminatum]]'')). Anangu also want to bring back species that aren\u2019t in the land any more like [[rufous hare-wallaby|mala]] and [[common brushtail possum]].\n\n[[File:Tjuki tells a dreaming story about Manpi (pigeon).jpg|thumb|right|Tjuki tells a dreaming story about Manpi (a pigeon) - Angas Downs IPA provides opportunity for elders to impart cultural and environmental knowledge to younger generations]]\n[[File:Wilbiabefore.JPG|thumb|right|Wilbia (Wilpiya) soak before restoration, damage by feral camels 1998]]\n[[File:Camel at Wilbia.JPG|thumb|right|Feral camel at Wilbia/Wilpiya soak before restoration 1998]]\n[[File:WilbiaRestored.jpg|thumb|right|Wilbia/Wilpiya soak after restoration 2010]]\n[[File:Fence line gradient - camel control.JPG|thumb|Camel control fence on Angas Downs showing improvements to vegetation without camel, cattle and horse browsing.]]\n[[File:Emu chicks on Angas Downs2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Ranger David Wongway looking after emu chicks on Angas Downs September 2010.jpg]]\n\n==Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area Plan of Management==\nThrough the support of the Australian Government's Caring for our Country, Working on Country<ref name=WOC/> and [[Indigenous Protected Areas]] programs, [[Anangu]] Rangers and the [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] community are restoring the landscape and protecting their cultural heritage using the [[Kuka Kanyini]] principles.\n\nA plan of management was prepared by the members of the community with support from Australian Wildlife Services.<ref name=Wilson/><ref name=\"AWS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au/category/uncategorized/angas-downs/|title=Category: Angas Downs|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> It draws on traditional land management practices and sets out priorities for scientists and wildlife managers to work with [[Anangu]] from [[Imanpa, Northern Territory|Imanpa]] to increase kuka (game), control ferals and protect cultural sites and the environment.<ref name=\"awt.com.au\"/>\n\n'''Objectives'''\n\nTo manage land and wildlife resources in order to maintain Anangu culture, conserve biodiversity and enable sustainable production in support of human communities and economic development.\nIn greater detail, the plan sets out how to:\n\n* increase wildlife populations and estimate hunting yields\n* identify wildlife refuge areas\n* restore and protect water sources\n* restore patch burning practices\n* control feral animals and weeds\n* exchange information across the region.\n\nThe plan outlines the significance of Angas Downs\u2019 biodiversity, the importance of its conservation and its contribution to the Imanpa Community.

Angas Downs rangers are:\n* Restoring and reactivating water sources\n* Erecting feral animal exclusion fences (see [[Australian feral camel]])\n* Implementing feral animal eradication programs\n* Controlling weeds and restoring native species\n* Helping to increase native species, especially kuka (game) species\n* Monitoring wildlife and landscapes using [[Cybertracker]]\n* Implementing patch burning\n* Documenting bush tucker, medicine plants and cultural places\n* Helping to start small scale tourism on Angas Downs\n* Setting up breeding and holding facilities for emus\n* Fencing and fire protection for rare plants such as Christmas tree mulga and quandong.\n\n==Small mammal and reptile surveys==\nAngas Downs Rangers conduct regular reptile and small mammal surveys across Angas Down\u2019s landscapes with scientists and volunteers using pitfall and funnel traps, and active searches. 51 reptile, 10 mammal (including one bat) and 4 frog species have been recorded to date. ''Simoselaps betholdi'' (Jan's banded snake), ''Suta punctata'' (little spotted snake), ''[[Demansia psammophis]]'' (yellow-faced whipsnake), ''Tiliqua multifasciata'' (Centralian blue-tongued skink), ''[[Ramphotyphlops endoterus]]'' (interior blind snake), ''Pygopus nigriceps'' (western hooded scaly-foot), [[woma python|woma]], ''[[Nephrurus]] laevissimus'', ''[[Nephrurus]] levis levis'', ''Morethia ruficauda'' and ''Egernia inornata'' (desert skink) among others have been detected. Mammals detected included [[kultarr]], [[Wongai ningaui]], spinifex hopping mice, sandy inland mice and [[lesser hairy-footed dunnart]].\n\n==Emu breeding on Angas Downs==\nEmu populations are very low on Angas Downs, as is the case in much of the Northern Territory. They are an important species to the local [[Anangu]] and traditional owners and to ecological processes. In combination with land management and control of feral animals, Anangu rangers will implement an emu breeding program to increase emus in the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au|title=Australian Wildlife Services|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> Local knowledge<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.alicespringsdesertpark.com.au/about/pdf/emus_and_quandongs.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317194641/http://www.alicespringsdesertpark.com.au/about/pdf/emus_and_quandongs.pdf# |archive-date=17 March 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> has suggested that emus may also increase the success of quandong (''Santalum acuminatum'') germination after the seed is eaten and has passed through the gut - this could be due to a combination of seed coat break down and being deposited in rich nutrient filled dung.

It is a goal of Angas Downs to increase bush tucker species such as quandong and will trial use of emus in quandong regeneration in coming years<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/more/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=16 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180815030618/http://www.abc.net.au/more/# |archive-date=15 August 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2010, [[Anangu]] Rangers took delivery of 20 emu chicks from an emu farm in WA. They were flown into Ayers Rock airport ([[Uluru]]) by [[Qantas]] and driven to the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area. After successful breeding, the emus will be released into a larger sanctuary area on Angas Downs. Angas Downs rangers also now own an egg incubator which will be used for increasing breeding success in following years.  The chicks and incubator were bought with donations provided by the Rotary Club of Canberra Burley Griffin. Progress of the emu chicks can be found [http://www.awt.com.au/2012/04/18/emu-chicks-arrive-at-angas-downs/ here].\n\n==Aerial surveys of Angas Downs - camels, kangaroos and feral horse populations==\nAerial surveys of the Angas Downs Indigenous Protected Area and surrounding lands were completed in June 2010. The survey was flown by Dr George Wilson using standard procedures for fixed-wing aircraft surveys. Indigenous observer, Brad Lander, and Jennifer Smits<ref name=AWS/> counted animals seen at low level and 200m on either side of the aircraft. Species targeted/observed included camels, kangaroos, horses, feral cattle, emus, euros, dingos and bustards (turkeys).\n\nThe study was vital to understanding populations of kangaroos and pressures from camel and horse populations on the property and hence native wildlife.\n\nUsing mapping program ArcGis 9.3, observations were interpolated to form maps showing spatial variability (animals/km<sup>2</sup>) of populations across the region. Estimated average density rates of kangaroos and camels across Angas Downs was 0.91 \u00b1 0.16 and 0.24 \u00b10.07 per km<sup>2</sup> respectively. It was noted that camel populations were largely dispersed due to recent high rainfall in central Australia (as at June 2010). Spatial variability of grazing pressures was also investigated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au/2010/08/04/aerial-surveys-to-estimate-populations-of-camels-kangaroos-horses-angas-downs-nt/|title=Aerial Surveys to estimate populations of Camels, Kangaroos, Horses\u2026Angas Downs, NT|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Trial tours==\nAngas Downs is interested in development of small scale, tourism ventures. Angas Downs is on the main road to Uluru National Park and Watarrka National Park and has many thousands of visitors cross it each week.\nLed by members of the Imanpa community, Australian Wildlife Services helped coordinate a few trial tour runs through the property including Rotary groups interested in culture, education and philanthropic activities and University/TAFE student groups interested in environment and wildlife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awt.com.au/2012/10/02/canberra-institute-of-technology-students-visit-angas-for-surveys/|title=Canberra Institute of Technology students visit Angas for surveys|website=Awt.com.au|accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> Angas Downs participated in a workshop called \u2018Stepping Stones\u2019 at the Imanpa community in May 2010 to help develop tourism on Angas Downs.\n\n==Support for Angas Downs==\nThere is also potential for other benefactors to provide support, technical advice and training to the Anangu Rangers who are being employed to complete the work.

He alienated anti-slavery groups by championing and signing the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] and enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], yet he failed to stem conflict between North and South, setting the stage for Southern [[Secession in the United States|secession]] and the [[American Civil War]].\n\nPierce was born in [[History of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and served in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and the [[U.S. Senate|Senate]] until he resigned from the Senate in 1842. His private law practice was a success, and he was appointed [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|New Hampshire's U.S. Attorney]] in 1845. He took part in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the Army. He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]]. He and running mate [[William R. King]] easily defeated the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] ticket of [[Winfield Scott]] and [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]] in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]].\n\nAs president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. He was a [[Young America movement|Young America]] expansionist who signed the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from [[Mexico]] and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency. His popularity declined sharply in the [[New England|Northern states]] after he supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which nullified the [[Missouri Compromise]], while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflict]] over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the [[Ostend Manifesto]] calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. He fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], but was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the [[American Civil War]] as he became a vocal critic of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].\n\nPierce was popular and outgoing, but his family life was a grim affair, with his wife [[Jane Pierce|Jane]] suffering from illness and depression for much of her life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey W.

They opposed the established [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] (and their successors, the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]), who were led by sitting President [[John Quincy Adams]]. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]] between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office,{{refn|group=note|The [[governor of New Hampshire]] was then elected annually; see also [[List of Governors of New Hampshire]].}} but Franklin Pierce won his first election, as Hillsborough [[Town meeting#Traditional town meetings|town moderator]], a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nPierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he [[1828 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|lost New Hampshire]]. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]]. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 33\u201343.</ref>\n\nLike all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45, Pierce was a member of the [[New Hampshire Army National Guard|state militia]], and was appointed [[aide de camp]] to Governor [[Samuel Dinsmoor]] in 1831.

Jackson's second term was under way, and the House had a strong Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the [[Second Bank of the United States]] from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund [[internal improvements]] with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements the responsibility of the states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the [[Twenty-fourth United States Congress|Twenty-fourth Congress]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 47\u201357.</ref>\n\nAs [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] grew more vocal in the mid-1830s, Congress was inundated with petitions from anti-slavery groups seeking legislation to restrict slavery in the United States. From the beginning, Pierce found the abolitionists' \"agitation\" to be an annoyance, and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states' rights, even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\" /> He was also frustrated with the \"religious bigotry\" of abolitionists, who cast their political opponents as sinners.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 92.</ref> \"I consider slavery a social and political evil,\" Pierce said, \"and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 71\u201372.</ref> Still, he wrote in December 1835, \"One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man. This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 67.</ref>\n\nWhen Rep. [[James Henry Hammond]] of South Carolina looked to prevent anti-slavery petitions from reaching the House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported what came to be known as the [[21st Rule|gag rule]], which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 57\u201359.</ref> He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery ''Herald of Freedom'' as a \"[[doughface]]\", which had the dual meaning of \"craven-spirited man\" and \"northerner with southern sympathies\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 59\u201361.</ref> Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the ''Herald of Freedom'' article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one-in-33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] read the article on the Senate floor as \"proof\" that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one-in-33 figure.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 362\u201375.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Senate===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce by Southworth & Hawes c1852.png|thumb|right|Pierce in 1852]]\nThe resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who had been elected governor of New Hampshire, left a short-term opening to be filled by the state legislature, and with Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose [[John Page (New Hampshire)|John Page]] to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce was elected to the full term, to commence in March 1837, and at age 32, was at the time one of the youngest members in Senate history. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while his wife also continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring for him a [[sinecure]] as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 64\u201369.</ref>\n\nPierce voted the party line on most issues and was an able senator, but not an eminent one; he was overshadowed by the [[Great Triumvirate]] of Calhoun, [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]], who dominated the Senate.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 68, 91\u201392.</ref> Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis, as the [[Panic of 1837]] had begun. He considered the depression a result of the banking system's rapid growth, amidst \"the extravagance of overtrading and the wilderness of speculation\".<ref name = \"w6972\" /> So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans, he supported newly elected Democratic president [[Martin Van Buren]] and his plan to create an [[Independent Treasury|independent treasury]], a proposal which split the Democratic Party. Debate over slavery continued in Congress, and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia, where Congress had jurisdiction. Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal, which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation.<ref name = \"w6972\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 69\u201372.</ref> Meanwhile, the Whigs were growing in congressional strength, which would leave Pierce's party with only a small majority by the end of the decade.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 80.</ref>\n\nOne topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the [[Twenty-sixth United States Congress|Twenty-sixth Congress]] (1839\u20131841). In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 78\u201384.</ref>\n\nPierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren's re-election in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]]. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to [[William Henry Harrison]], the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|Twenty-seventh Congress]]. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President [[John Tyler]] succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 84\u201390.</ref> New Hampshire Democrats insisted that their state's U.

Also, he was frustrated at being a member of the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 419.</ref> His last actions in the Senate in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing federal funds to the states \u2013 believing that the money should go to the military instead \u2013 and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the [[Collector of the Port of New York|New York Customs House]], where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Party leader==\n\n===Lawyer and politician===\n[[File:Piercemanse.JPG|thumb|The [[Concord, New Hampshire]] house where Pierce lived from 1842 to 1848 is now known as the [[Pierce Manse]].

He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 98\u2013101.</ref>\n\nPierce remained involved in the state Democratic Party, which was split by several issues. Governor Hill, who represented the commercial, urban wing of the party, advocated the use of government charters to support corporations, granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads. The radical \"[[Locofocos|locofoco]]\" wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters, who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege. The state's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations after the Panic of 1837, and Hill was voted out of office. Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically, and reluctantly agreed to represent Hill's adversary in a legal dispute regarding ownership of a newspaper\u2014Hill lost, and founded his own paper, of which Pierce was a frequent target.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\nIn June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee, and in the following year's state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature. The party remained divided on several issues, including railroad development and the [[temperance movement]], and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences. His priorities were \"order, moderation, compromise, and party unity\", which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 103\u201310.</ref> As he would as president, Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly, and saw the opposition to slavery as a threat to that.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 431.</ref>\n\nDemocratic [[James K. Polk]]'s [[dark horse]] victory in the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 presidential election]] was welcome news to Pierce, who had befriended the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] while both served in Congress. Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election, and in turn Polk appointed him as [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|United States Attorney for New Hampshire]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201332.</ref> Polk's most prominent cause was the [[annexation of Texas]], an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale, now a U.S. Representative. Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a public letter to his constituents outlining his opposition to the measure.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"Jan.7.-Hon. John P. Hale's letter to his constituents against the annexation of Texas, published\".</ref> Pierce responded by re-assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale's nomination for another term in Congress.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"John P. Hale, who had been nominated for re-election to Congress by the Democratic party, was at this election dropped from the ticket, and John Woodbury substituted, in consequence of Mr. Hale's refusal to go with the party in voting for the annexation of Texas. A portion of the party, consisting of those who approved of his opposition to the extension of slavery, voted for him, and succeeded in defeating his opponent, leaving a vacancy in the delegation\".</ref> The political firestorm led to Pierce severing ties with his longtime friend, and with his law partner Fowler, who was a Hale supporter.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 111\u201322.</ref> Hale refused to withdraw, and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire, the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat. Eventually, the Whigs and Hale's [[Independent Democrat]]s took control of the legislature, elected Whig [[Anthony Colby]] as governor and sent Hale to the Senate, much to Pierce's anger.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 447.</ref>\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce - 1852.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierce in his brigadier general's uniform]]\nActive military service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly his older brother [[Benjamin Kendrick Pierce|Benjamin]]'s, as well as that of [[John McNeil Jr.]], husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. General [[Zachary Taylor]]'s advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General [[Winfield Scott]] proposed capturing the port of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed commander and colonel of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and second-in-command.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankP-mounted.jpg|thumb|left|Pierce's brief term as a [[general officer|general]] in the Mexican\u2013American War boosted his public image.<ref name=\"war-reception\" />|alt=Illustration of Franklin Pierce as a general, riding a horse]]\nOn March 3, 1847, Pierce was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and took command of a [[brigade]] of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies for Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, in time for the [[Battle of Contreras]].<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 490.</ref> The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and debilitating his knee.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 144\u201347.</ref> The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, \"General Pierce is a damned coward.\"<ref name = \"h505\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 505.</ref> Pierce returned for the following day's action, but re-injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men; by the time he caught up, the battle was mostly won.<ref name = h505 />\n\nAs the [[Battle of Churubusco]] approached, Scott ordered Pierce to the rear to convalesce. He responded, \"For God's sake, General, this is the last great battle, and I must lead my brigade.\" Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign, eventually taking part in the [[Battle for Mexico City|capture of Mexico City]] in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle.<ref name = w147plus /> For much of the Mexico City battle, he was in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea.<ref name = h505 /> Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city; while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, he also tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.<ref name = w147plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 147\u201354.</ref>\n\nPierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state, and submitted his resignation from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long shadow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.<ref name=\"war-reception\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 154\u2013157.</ref>\n\n[[Ulysses S. Grant]], who had the opportunity to observe Pierce firsthand during the war, countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs, written several years after Pierce's death: \"Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage.

His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.<ref name=\"leadership\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 157\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe large [[Mexican Cession]] of land divided the United States politically, with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and offering the [[Wilmot Proviso]] to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 N]]. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy split the Democrats. At the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]], the majority nominated former Michigan senator [[Lewis Cass]] for president, while a minority broke off to become the [[Free Soil Party]], backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General [[Zachary Taylor]], a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil [[ticket (politics)|ticket]], and was so effective that Taylor, who was [[1848 United States presidential election|elected president]], was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, p. 549\u201365.</ref>\n\nSenator Henry Clay, a Whig, hoped to put the slavery question to rest with a set of proposals that became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]]. These would give victories to North and South, and gained the support of his fellow Whig, Webster. With the bill stalled in the Senate, Illinois Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] led a successful effort to split it into separate measures so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the overall package. The bills passed, and were signed by President [[Millard Fillmore]] (who had succeeded Taylor after the president's death earlier in 1850).<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref> Pierce strongly supported the compromise, giving a well-received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to \"The Union! Eternal Union!\"<ref name=autogenerated1>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 608.</ref> The same month, the Democratic candidate for governor, John Atwood, issued a letter opposing the Compromise, and Pierce helped to recall the state convention and remove Atwood from the ticket.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The fiasco compromised the election for the Democrats, who lost several races; still, Pierce's party retained its control over the state, and was well positioned for the upcoming presidential election.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 173\u201380.</ref>\n\n==Election of 1852==\n{{Main|1852 Democratic National Convention|1852 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:1852DemocraticCampaignPoster.png|thumb|right|Campaign poster for the Pierce/King ticket|alt=Poster]]\nAs the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]] approached, the Democrats were divided by the slavery issue, though most of the [[Barnburners and Hunkers#Barnburners|\"Barnburners\"]] who had left the party with Van Buren to form the Free Soil Party had returned. It was widely expected that the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] would result in deadlock, with no major candidate able to win the necessary two-thirds majority. New Hampshire Democrats, including Pierce, supported his old teacher, Levi Woodbury, by then an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], as a compromise candidate, but Woodbury's death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce's allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk. New Hampshire Democrats felt that, as the state in which their party had most consistently gained Democratic majorities, they should supply the presidential candidate. Other possible standard-bearers included Douglas, Cass, [[William Marcy]] of New York, [[James Buchanan]] of Pennsylvania, [[Sam Houston]] of Texas, and [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] of Missouri.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 181\u201384.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 23\u201329.</ref>\n\nDespite home state support, Pierce faced obstacles to his nomination, since he had been out of office for a decade, and also lacked the front-runners' national reputation. He publicly declared that such a nomination would be \"utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes\", but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected, he knew his future influence depended on his availability to run.<ref name =w184plus /> Thus, he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him, with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial [[Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref name =w184plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 184\u201397.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe convention assembled on June 1 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and the deadlock occurred as expected. On the first ballot of the 288 delegates, held on June 3, Cass claimed 116, Buchanan 93, and the rest were scattered, without a single vote for Pierce. The next 34 ballots passed with no winner even close, and still no votes for Pierce. The Buchanan team then had their delegates vote for minor candidates, including Pierce, to demonstrate Buchanan's inevitability, and unite the convention behind him. This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine switched to Pierce; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy, and Pierce was soon in third place. After the 48th ballot, North Carolina Congressman [[James C. Dobbin]] delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate. On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president. Delegates selected Alabama Senator [[William R. King]], a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's [[running mate]], and adopted a [[party platform]] that rejected further \"agitation\" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 197\u2013202</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nWhen word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce found it difficult to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would not like to live in Washington.<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 34.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scott vs Pierce campaign.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|This anti-Pierce political cartoon depicts him as weak and cowardly|alt=Political cartoon]]\nThe Whig candidate was General Scott, Pierce's commander in Mexico; his running mate was [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]]. The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs. The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen [[voter turnout]] to its lowest level since [[U.S. presidential election, 1836|1836]]; according to biographer Peter A. Wallner, it was \"one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 210\u201313</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 36\u201338.</ref> Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for him and the platform; ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' editor [[Horace Greeley]] summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, \"we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it\".<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 724.</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1852.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral map of the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]]|alt=Map]]\nPierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign.

A sizable block of Free Soilers broke for Pierce's in-state rival, Hale, who won 4.9 percent of the popular vote.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 229\u201330.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 39.</ref> The Democrats took large majorities in Congress.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 740.</ref>\n\n==Presidency==\n{{Main|Presidency of Franklin Pierce}}\n\n===Train crash and transition===\n[[File:First ladies-pierce.jpg|thumb|Jane Pierce and \"Benny\", whose death cast a shadow over Pierce's term in office<ref name=\"benny\" />|alt=Photograph of Jane and Benjamin Pierce]]\n\nPierce began his presidency in mourning. Weeks after his election, on January 6, 1853, the President-elect's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]] near [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. Both Franklin and Jane Pierce survived, but in the wreckage found their only remaining son, 11-year-old Benjamin, crushed to death, his body nearly decapitated. Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from his wife. They both suffered severe depression afterward, which likely affected Pierce's performance as president.<ref name=\"benny\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 241\u201349.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 43\u201344.</ref> Jane Pierce wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband's pursuit and acceptance of high office. She wrote a lengthy letter of apology to \"Benny\" for her failings as a mother.<ref name=\"benny\"/> She avoided social functions for much of her first two years as [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]], making her public debut in that role to great sympathy at the annual public reception held at the White House on New Year's Day, 1855.<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 55.</ref>\n\nWhen Franklin Pierce departed New Hampshire for the inauguration, Jane Pierce chose to remain. Pierce, then the youngest man to be elected president, chose to [[Affirmation in law|affirm]] his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible, as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done. He was the first president to deliver his [[Inauguration Day|inaugural address]] from memory.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hurja |first= Emil |date=1933|title=History of Presidential Inaugurations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KnY_AAAAIAAJ|publisher=New York Democrat |page= 49}}</ref> In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations, including the \"eminently important\" acquisition of new territories. \"The policy of my Administration\", said the new president, \"will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.\" Avoiding the word \"slavery\", he emphasized his desire to put the \"important subject\" to rest and maintain a peaceful union. He alluded to his own personal tragedy, telling the crowd, \"You have summoned me in my weakness, you must sustain me by your strength.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 249\u201355.</ref>\n\n===Administration and political strife===\n{{See also|List of federal judges appointed by Franklin Pierce}}\n{{CSS image crop|Image = PIERCE, Franklin-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 50|oLeft = 45|Location = right|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]]-engraved portrait of Pierce as president}}\n\nIn his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] appointments, Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most in the party had not originally supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 767.</ref>\n\nAll of Pierce's cabinet nominations were unanimously and immediately confirmed by the Senate.<ref name =\"wall5plus\" /> Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.<ref name =\"wall5plus\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 5\u201324.</ref>\n\nFactionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or \"Hards\" of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Marcy (who became Secretary of State) and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell Democrats or \"Softs\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 15\u201318, and throughout.</ref>\n\n[[File:William R.

By the start of 1853, King was severely ill with tuberculosis, and went to Cuba to recuperate. His condition deteriorated, and Congress passed a special law, allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24. Wanting to die at home, he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day. The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce's term, as the Constitution then had no provision for filling the vacancy. This extended vacancy meant that for nearly the entirety of Pierce's presidency the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|Senate President pro tempore]], initially [[David Atchison]] of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nPierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors.<ref name=\"wallner-20\" /> His Cabinet members implemented an early system of [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] examinations which was a forerunner to the [[Pendleton Act]] passed three decades later, which mandated that most positions in the U.S. government should be awarded on the basis of merit, not patronage.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 35\u201336.</ref> The [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] was reformed by Secretary [[Robert McClelland (American politician)|Robert McClelland]], who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 36\u201339.</ref> Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]].<ref name=\"wallner-20\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 20.</ref> There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court\u2014Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator [[Judah P.

Marcy]] leading the charge as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marcy sought to present to the world a distinctively American, republican image. He issued a circular recommending that U.S. diplomats wear \"the simple dress of an American citizen\" instead of the elaborate [[diplomatic uniform]]s worn in the courts of Europe, and that they only hire American citizens to work in consulates.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 25\u201332.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 128.</ref> Marcy received international praise for his 73-page letter defending Austrian refugee [[Martin Koszta]], who had been captured abroad in mid-1853 by the Austrian government despite his intention to become a U.S. citizen.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 61\u201363.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 128\u201329.</ref>\n\nDavis, an advocate of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate [[James Gadsden]] to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating the provisions of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s [[filibuster (military)|unauthorized expedition]] into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 75\u201381.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 129\u201333.</ref> Congress reduced the [[Gadsden Purchase]] to the region now comprising southern [[Arizona]] and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15&nbsp;million to $10&nbsp;million.

Marcy completed a [[trade agreement|trade reciprocity agreement]] with British minister to Washington, [[Sir John Crampton, 2nd Baronet|John Crampton]], which reduced the need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 27\u201330, 63\u201366, 125\u201326</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 133.</ref> While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada\u2013US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence.

To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 [[State of the Union|message to Congress]] Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions.

The publication of the [[Ostend Manifesto]], which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy, provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave-holding possession to bolster Southern interests. It helped discredit the expansionist policy of [[Manifest Destiny]] the Democratic Party had often supported.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 131\u201357.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 149\u2013155.</ref>\n\nPierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military.

[[organized territory|Organizing]] the largely unsettled [[Nebraska Territory]], which stretched from [[Missouri]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from Texas north to what is now the Canada\u2013US border, was a crucial part of Douglas's plans for western expansion. He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from [[Chicago]] to California, through the vast western territory. Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized. Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery, and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come, in part, from the South. Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|decide whether to allow slavery]]. This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as most of it was north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 N line the Missouri Compromise deemed \"free\". The territory would be split into a northern part, Nebraska, and a southern part, [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not.<ref name=\"kansas\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 90\u2013102, 119\u201322.</ref><ref name =\"kansas 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 88\u2013100.</ref><ref name = \"kansas 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1097\u20131240.</ref> In the view of pro-slavery [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] politicians, the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of [[California]], including territory south of the compromise line, as a free state.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Jefferson |title=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government |date=1881 |isbn=0-306-80418-2 |page=25|title-link=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government }}</ref>\n\nPierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this.<ref>See {{harv|Etchison|2004}}, p. 14.</ref> Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator [[Salmon P. Chase]] and Massachusetts's [[Charles Sumner]], who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.<ref name = \"kansas\" /><ref name = \"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n \nPierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and ultimately defined the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the [[Know Nothing]]s, and the founding of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"kansas\" /><ref name=\"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Forcing Slavery Freesoilers Throats.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Northerners resented Pierce's attempted expansion of slavery through Kansas\u2013Nebraska and Cuba.<ref name=\"resentment\" /><ref name=\"resentment 2\"/> In this 1856 cartoon, a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]] is held down by Pierce, Buchanan, and Cass while Douglas shoves \"Slavery\" (depicted as a black man) down his throat.|alt=Political cartoon]]\n\nEven as the act was being debated, settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Thousands of pro-slavery [[Border Ruffians]] came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] set up a shadow government, and drafted the [[Topeka Constitution]], Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] government.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 195\u2013209.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 111\u2013120.</ref>\n\nPassage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave [[Anthony Burns]] in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched federal troops to enforce Burns's return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 122\u201325.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThe midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as well as to the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party.<ref name=\"resentment\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 158\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"resentment 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\n===1856 election===\n{{Main|1856 Democratic National Convention}}\n\n[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Partisan violence spilled into Congress in May 1856 when Free Soil Senator [[Charles Sumner]] was [[caning of Charles Sumner|assaulted with a walking cane]] by Democratic Rep.

In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.<ref name=\"1856-convention\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 266\u201370.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 157\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1515\u201358.</ref>\n\nWhen balloting began on June 5 at the convention in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Pierce expected a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority. On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest. By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote. Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan. Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case. After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner. To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of \"unqualified approbation\" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative [[John C. Breckinridge]], as the vice-presidential nominee.<ref name=\"1856-convention\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\" /> This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term.{{refn|group=note|Pierce was the only president who had been elected as president to not be renominated by their party for a second term.

In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 292\u2013296.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 177\u2013179.</ref> In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted.

The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property.

He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession, writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would \"not be along Mason and Dixon's line merely\", but \"within our own borders in our own streets\".<ref name = \"postpres\" /> He also criticized New England Protestant ministers, who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates, for their \"heresy and treason\".<ref name=\"postpres\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 309\u2013327.</ref> The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce; during [[Lincoln-Douglas debates|his debates]] with Republican Senate candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1858, Douglas called the former president \"a man of integrity and honor\".<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nAs the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly [[1860 United States presidential election|defeated]] for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.<ref name = \"secede\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 327\u2013338.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nAfter efforts to prevent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended with the firing on [[Fort Sumter]], Northern Democrats, including Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. \"I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war,\" Pierce wrote to his wife.<ref name = \"secede\" /> Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of [[habeas corpus in the United States|''habeas corpus'']], arguing that even in a time of war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties. This stand won him admirers with the emerging [[Copperheads (politics)|Northern Peace Democrats]], but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn September 1861, Pierce traveled to Michigan, visiting his former Interior Secretary, McClelland, former senator Cass, and others. A Detroit bookseller, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, [[William H. Seward]], accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people, and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president. Later that month, the pro-administration ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'' printed an item calling Pierce \"a prowling traitor spy\", and intimating that he was a member of the pro-Confederate [[Knights of the Golden Circle]]. No such conspiracy existed, but a Pierce supporter, Guy S. Hopkins, sent to the ''Tribune'' a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, indicating that \"President P.\" was part of a plot against the Union.<ref name = \"michigan\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 341\u2013343.</ref><ref name=\"michigan 2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 85\u2013100.</ref> Hopkins intended for the ''Tribune'' to make the charges public, at which point Hopkins would admit authorship, thus making the ''Tribune'' editors seem overly partisan and gullible. Instead, the ''Tribune'' editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials. Seward then ordered the arrest of possible \"traitors\" in Michigan, which included Hopkins. Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax, but despite this, Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true. Pierce denied them, and Seward hastily backtracked. Later, Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax, and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly. When Seward refused to make their correspondence public, Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally, California's [[Milton Latham]], read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record, to the administration's embarrassment.<ref name = \"michigan\" /><ref name= \"michigan 2\"/>\n\nThe institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat [[Clement Vallandigham]] further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. \"Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?\", he demanded.<ref name = \"speech\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 343\u2013357.</ref><ref name= \"speech2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 109\u2013123.</ref> Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.<ref name = \"speech\" /><ref name=\"speech2\"/>\n\nJane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by the death of his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne in May 1864; he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of [[Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 357\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Final years and death===\nPierce's drinking impaired his health in his last years, but he grew increasingly spiritual. He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid-1865. During this time, he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis, now a prisoner at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia. He also offered financial help to Hawthorne's son Julian, as well as to his own nephews. On the second anniversary of Jane's death, Pierce was baptized into his wife's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] faith at St. Paul's Church in Concord. He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination, which had alienated Democrats with anti-slavery rhetoric. He took up the life of an \"old farmer\", as he called himself, buying up property, drinking less, farming the land himself, and hosting visiting relatives.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 363\u2013366.</ref> He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at [[Little Boar's Head Historic District|Little Boar's Head]] on the coast, sometimes visiting Jane's relatives in Massachusetts. Still interested in politics, he expressed support for [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policy and supported the president's acquittal in his [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]]; he later expressed optimism for Johnson's successor, Ulysses S. Grant.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 366\u2013371.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nPierce's health began to decline again in mid-1869; he resumed heavy drinking despite his deteriorating physical condition. He returned to Concord that September, suffering from severe [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, knowing he would not recover. A caretaker was hired; none of his family members were present in his final days. He died at 4:35&nbsp;am on Friday, October 8, 1869. President Grant, who later defended Pierce's service in the Mexican-American War, declared a day of national mourning. Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front-page stories examining Pierce's colorful and controversial career. Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord's [[Old North Cemetery (Concord, New Hampshire)|Old North Cemetery]].<ref name=\"burial\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 369\u2013373.</ref>\n\nIn his last [[will (law)|will]], which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|72000|1869|r=-4}}}} today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's children and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank Pierce received the largest share.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 374.</ref>\n\n==Sites, memorials, and honors==\nIn addition to his LL.D. from Norwich University, Pierce also received honorary doctorates from Bowdoin College (1853) and [[Dartmouth College]] (1860).<ref>{{cite book |last= Dartmouth College |date= 1900 |title= General Catalogue |url= https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sKM4AAAAYAAJ |quote= Franklin Pierce LL.D. dartmouth. |publisher= Dartmouth College |page= [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_sKM4AAAAYAAJ/page/n432 405]|accessdate= August 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nTwo places in New Hampshire have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] specifically because of their association with Pierce.

He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [the [[Guano Islands Act]]]. His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife. His support for the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gara|first=Larry|title=Pierce, Franklin|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00788.html|work= American National Biography Online|date=February 2000}}{{subscription}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Books-inline|Presidents of the United States (1789\u20131860)}}\n* [[List of New Hampshire historical markers (76\u2013100)#80|New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 80]]: Franklin Pierce 1804\u20131869\n* [[List of deaths through alcohol]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==== Works cited ====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.c-span.org/video/?184075-1/franklin-pierce-new-hampshires-favorite-son ''Booknotes'' interview with Peter Wallner on ''Franklin Pierce: New Hampshire`s Favorite Son'', November 28, 2004], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Boulard|2006}}|last=Boulard|first=Garry|title=The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce: The Story of a President and the Civil War|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0-595-40367-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Butler|1908}}|last=Butler|first=Pierce|year=1908|author-link=Pierce Butler (justice)|title=Judah P.

His private law practice was a success, and he was appointed [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|New Hampshire's U.S. Attorney]] in 1845. He took part in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the Army. He was seen by Democrats as a compromise candidate uniting northern and southern interests and was nominated as the party's candidate for president on the 49th ballot at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]]. He and running mate [[William R. King]] easily defeated the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] ticket of [[Winfield Scott]] and [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]] in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]].\n\nAs president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also satisfying the diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. He was a [[Young America movement|Young America]] expansionist who signed the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from [[Mexico]] and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency. His popularity declined sharply in the [[New England|Northern states]] after he supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which nullified the [[Missouri Compromise]], while many whites in the South continued to support him. Passage of the act led to [[Bleeding Kansas|violent conflict]] over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the [[Ostend Manifesto]] calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. He fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]], but was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the [[American Civil War]] as he became a vocal critic of President [[Abraham Lincoln]].\n\nPierce was popular and outgoing, but his family life was a grim affair, with his wife [[Jane Pierce|Jane]] suffering from illness and depression for much of her life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey W.

He was a sixth-generation descendant of Thomas Pierce, who had moved to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Norwich, Norfolk]], England in about 1634. His father [[Benjamin Pierce (governor)|Benjamin]] was a lieutenant in the [[American Revolutionary War]] who moved from [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]] to Hillsborough after the war, purchasing {{convert|50|acre}} of land. Pierce was the fifth of eight children born to Benjamin and his second wife Anna Kendrick; his first wife Elizabeth Andrews died in childbirth, leaving a daughter. Benjamin was a prominent [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]]{{refn|group=note|This was called the ''Republican'' or ''Jeffersonian Republican Party'' at the time; it soon became known as the ''[[Democratic-Republican Party]]''.

During Pierce's childhood, his father was deeply involved in state politics, while two of his older brothers fought in the [[War of 1812]]; public affairs and the military were thus a major influence in his early life.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 1\u20138.</ref>\n\nPierce's father ensured that his sons were educated, and he placed Pierce in a school at Hillsborough Center in childhood and sent him to the town school at Hancock at age 12.{{refn|group=note|The two-story school building burned some years later, and Hancock Academy was founded in 1836 to fill its place.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hurd |first1=D.

The Reverend William Allen, the college's president, objected to the noise and ordered a halt to the activity. When Pierce refused to comply with Allen's order, animosity grew between the students and the college authorities resulting in the junior class going on strike. Pierce was accused of leading the rebellion, but the college records do not acknowledge the event. Pierce's father took note of his son's role, however, and in a rare letter, admonished him about his behavior.

They opposed the established [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] (and their successors, the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]), who were led by sitting President [[John Quincy Adams]]. The work of the New Hampshire Democratic Party came to fruition in March 1827, when their pro-Jackson nominee, Benjamin Pierce, won the support of the pro-Adams faction and was elected governor of New Hampshire essentially unopposed. While the younger Pierce had set out to build a career as an attorney, he was fully drawn into the realm of politics as the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]] between Adams and Jackson approached. In the state elections held in March 1828, the Adams faction withdrew their support of Benjamin Pierce, voting him out of office,{{refn|group=note|The [[governor of New Hampshire]] was then elected annually; see also [[List of Governors of New Hampshire]].}} but Franklin Pierce won his first election, as Hillsborough [[Town meeting#Traditional town meetings|town moderator]], a position to which he would be elected for six consecutive years.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nPierce actively campaigned in his district on behalf of Jackson, who carried both the district and the nation by large margins in the November 1828 election, even though he [[1828 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|lost New Hampshire]]. The outcome further strengthened the Democratic Party, and Pierce won his first legislative seat the following year, representing Hillsborough in the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]]. Pierce's father, meanwhile, was elected again as governor, retiring after that term. The younger Pierce was appointed as chairman of the House Education Committee in 1829 and the Committee on Towns the following year. By 1831 the Democrats held a legislative majority, and Pierce was elected Speaker of the House. The young Speaker used his platform to oppose the expansion of banking, protect the state militia, and offer support to the national Democrats and Jackson's re-election effort. At the age of 27, he was a star of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. Though attaining early political and professional success, in his personal letters he continued to lament his bachelorhood and yearned for a life beyond Hillsborough.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 33\u201343.</ref>\n\nLike all white males in New Hampshire between the ages of 18 and 45, Pierce was a member of the [[New Hampshire Army National Guard|state militia]], and was appointed [[aide de camp]] to Governor [[Samuel Dinsmoor]] in 1831.

Jackson's second term was under way, and the House had a strong Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the [[Second Bank of the United States]] from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund [[internal improvements]] with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements the responsibility of the states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the [[Twenty-fourth United States Congress|Twenty-fourth Congress]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 47\u201357.</ref>\n\nAs [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] grew more vocal in the mid-1830s, Congress was inundated with petitions from anti-slavery groups seeking legislation to restrict slavery in the United States. From the beginning, Pierce found the abolitionists' \"agitation\" to be an annoyance, and saw federal action against slavery as an infringement on southern states' rights, even though he was morally opposed to slavery itself.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\" /> He was also frustrated with the \"religious bigotry\" of abolitionists, who cast their political opponents as sinners.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 92.</ref> \"I consider slavery a social and political evil,\" Pierce said, \"and most sincerely wish that it had no existence upon the face of the earth.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 71\u201372.</ref> Still, he wrote in December 1835, \"One thing must be perfectly apparent to every intelligent man. This abolition movement must be crushed or there is an end to the Union.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 67.</ref>\n\nWhen Rep. [[James Henry Hammond]] of South Carolina looked to prevent anti-slavery petitions from reaching the House floor, however, Pierce sided with the abolitionists' right to petition. Nevertheless, Pierce supported what came to be known as the [[21st Rule|gag rule]], which allowed for petitions to be received, but not read or considered. This passed the House in 1836.<ref name=\"wallner-i-57-59\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 57\u201359.</ref> He was attacked by the New Hampshire anti-slavery ''Herald of Freedom'' as a \"[[doughface]]\", which had the dual meaning of \"craven-spirited man\" and \"northerner with southern sympathies\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 59\u201361.</ref> Pierce had stated that not one in 500 New Hampshirites were abolitionists; the ''Herald of Freedom'' article added up the number of signatures on petitions from that state, divided by the number of residents according to the 1830 census, and suggested the actual number was one-in-33. Pierce was outraged when South Carolina Senator [[John C. Calhoun]] read the article on the Senate floor as \"proof\" that New Hampshire was a hotbed of abolitionism. Calhoun apologized after Pierce replied to him in a speech which stated that most signatories were women and children, who could not vote, which therefore cast doubt on the one-in-33 figure.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 362\u201375.</ref>\n\n===U.S. Senate===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce by Southworth & Hawes c1852.png|thumb|right|Pierce in 1852]]\nThe resignation in May 1836 of Senator Isaac Hill, who had been elected governor of New Hampshire, left a short-term opening to be filled by the state legislature, and with Hill's term as senator due to expire in March 1837, the legislature also had to fill the six-year term to follow. Pierce's candidacy for the Senate was championed by state Representative John P. Hale, a fellow Athenian at Bowdoin. After much debate, the legislature chose [[John Page (New Hampshire)|John Page]] to fill the rest of Hill's term. In December 1836, Pierce was elected to the full term, to commence in March 1837, and at age 32, was at the time one of the youngest members in Senate history. The election came at a difficult time for Pierce, as his father, sister, and brother were all seriously ill, while his wife also continued to suffer from chronic poor health. As senator, he was able to help his old friend Nathaniel Hawthorne, who often struggled financially, procuring for him a [[sinecure]] as measurer of coal and salt at the Boston Customs House that allowed the author time to continue writing.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 64\u201369.</ref>\n\nPierce voted the party line on most issues and was an able senator, but not an eminent one; he was overshadowed by the [[Great Triumvirate]] of Calhoun, [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]], who dominated the Senate.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 68, 91\u201392.</ref> Pierce entered the Senate at a time of economic crisis, as the [[Panic of 1837]] had begun. He considered the depression a result of the banking system's rapid growth, amidst \"the extravagance of overtrading and the wilderness of speculation\".<ref name = \"w6972\" /> So that federal money would not support speculative bank loans, he supported newly elected Democratic president [[Martin Van Buren]] and his plan to create an [[Independent Treasury|independent treasury]], a proposal which split the Democratic Party. Debate over slavery continued in Congress, and abolitionists proposed its end in the District of Columbia, where Congress had jurisdiction. Pierce supported a resolution by Calhoun against this proposal, which Pierce considered a dangerous stepping stone to nationwide emancipation.<ref name = \"w6972\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 69\u201372.</ref> Meanwhile, the Whigs were growing in congressional strength, which would leave Pierce's party with only a small majority by the end of the decade.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 80.</ref>\n\nOne topic of particular importance to Pierce was the military. He challenged a bill which would expand the ranks of the Army's staff officers in Washington without any apparent benefit to line officers at posts in the rest of the country. He took an interest in military pensions, seeing abundant fraud within the system, and was named chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Pensions in the [[Twenty-sixth United States Congress|Twenty-sixth Congress]] (1839\u20131841). In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 78\u201384.</ref>\n\nPierce campaigned vigorously throughout his home state for Van Buren's re-election in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]]. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to [[William Henry Harrison]], the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the [[Twenty-seventh United States Congress|Twenty-seventh Congress]]. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President [[John Tyler]] succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 84\u201390.</ref> New Hampshire Democrats insisted that their state's U.

Governor Hill, who represented the commercial, urban wing of the party, advocated the use of government charters to support corporations, granting them privileges such as limited liability and eminent domain for building railroads. The radical \"[[Locofocos|locofoco]]\" wing of his party represented farmers and other rural voters, who sought an expansion of social programs and labor regulations and a restriction on corporate privilege. The state's political culture grew less tolerant of banks and corporations after the Panic of 1837, and Hill was voted out of office. Pierce was closer to the radicals philosophically, and reluctantly agreed to represent Hill's adversary in a legal dispute regarding ownership of a newspaper\u2014Hill lost, and founded his own paper, of which Pierce was a frequent target.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\nIn June 1842 Pierce was named chairman of the State Democratic Committee, and in the following year's state election he helped the radical wing take over the state legislature. The party remained divided on several issues, including railroad development and the [[temperance movement]], and Pierce took a leading role in helping the state legislature settle their differences. His priorities were \"order, moderation, compromise, and party unity\", which he tried to place ahead of his personal views on political issues.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 103\u201310.</ref> As he would as president, Pierce valued Democratic Party unity highly, and saw the opposition to slavery as a threat to that.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 431.</ref>\n\nDemocratic [[James K. Polk]]'s [[dark horse]] victory in the [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 presidential election]] was welcome news to Pierce, who had befriended the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] while both served in Congress. Pierce had campaigned heavily for Polk during the election, and in turn Polk appointed him as [[United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire#U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire|United States Attorney for New Hampshire]].<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201332.</ref> Polk's most prominent cause was the [[annexation of Texas]], an issue which caused a dramatic split between Pierce and his former ally Hale, now a U.S. Representative. Hale was so impassioned against adding a new slave state that he wrote a public letter to his constituents outlining his opposition to the measure.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"Jan.7.-Hon. John P. Hale's letter to his constituents against the annexation of Texas, published\".</ref> Pierce responded by re-assembling the state Democratic convention to revoke Hale's nomination for another term in Congress.<ref>See {{harv|Wadleigh|1913}}, p. 249: \"John P. Hale, who had been nominated for re-election to Congress by the Democratic party, was at this election dropped from the ticket, and John Woodbury substituted, in consequence of Mr. Hale's refusal to go with the party in voting for the annexation of Texas. A portion of the party, consisting of those who approved of his opposition to the extension of slavery, voted for him, and succeeded in defeating his opponent, leaving a vacancy in the delegation\".</ref> The political firestorm led to Pierce severing ties with his longtime friend, and with his law partner Fowler, who was a Hale supporter.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 111\u201322.</ref> Hale refused to withdraw, and as a majority vote was needed for election in New Hampshire, the party split led to deadlock and a vacant House seat. Eventually, the Whigs and Hale's [[Independent Democrat]]s took control of the legislature, elected Whig [[Anthony Colby]] as governor and sent Hale to the Senate, much to Pierce's anger.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 447.</ref>\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War===\n[[File:Franklin Pierce - 1852.jpg|thumb|upright|Pierce in his brigadier general's uniform]]\nActive military service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly his older brother [[Benjamin Kendrick Pierce|Benjamin]]'s, as well as that of [[John McNeil Jr.]], husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. General [[Zachary Taylor]]'s advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General [[Winfield Scott]] proposed capturing the port of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed commander and colonel of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry Regiment]] in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] and second-in-command.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 131\u201335.</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankP-mounted.jpg|thumb|left|Pierce's brief term as a [[general officer|general]] in the Mexican\u2013American War boosted his public image.<ref name=\"war-reception\" />|alt=Illustration of Franklin Pierce as a general, riding a horse]]\nOn March 3, 1847, Pierce was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], and took command of a [[brigade]] of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies for Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, in time for the [[Battle of Contreras]].<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 490.</ref> The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and debilitating his knee.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 144\u201347.</ref> The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, \"General Pierce is a damned coward.\"<ref name = \"h505\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 505.</ref> Pierce returned for the following day's action, but re-injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men; by the time he caught up, the battle was mostly won.<ref name = h505 />\n\nAs the [[Battle of Churubusco]] approached, Scott ordered Pierce to the rear to convalesce. He responded, \"For God's sake, General, this is the last great battle, and I must lead my brigade.\" Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped negotiate an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade throughout the rest of the campaign, eventually taking part in the [[Battle for Mexico City|capture of Mexico City]] in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle.<ref name = w147plus /> For much of the Mexico City battle, he was in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea.<ref name = h505 /> Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city; while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, he also tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.<ref name = w147plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 147\u201354.</ref>\n\nPierce was finally allowed to return to Concord in late December 1847. He was given a hero's welcome in his home state, and submitted his resignation from the Army, which was approved on March 20, 1848. His military exploits elevated his popularity in New Hampshire, but his injuries and subsequent troubles in battle led to accusations of cowardice which would long shadow him. He had demonstrated competence as a general, especially in the initial march from Vera Cruz, but his short tenure and his injury left little for historians to judge his ability as a military commander.<ref name=\"war-reception\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 154\u2013157.</ref>\n\n[[Ulysses S. Grant]], who had the opportunity to observe Pierce firsthand during the war, countered the allegations of cowardice in his memoirs, written several years after Pierce's death: \"Whatever General Pierce's qualifications may have been for the Presidency, he was a gentleman and a man of courage. I was not a supporter of him politically, but I knew him more intimately than I did any other of the volunteer generals.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulysses S.|last=Grant|authorlink=Ulysses S.

His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.<ref name=\"leadership\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 157\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe large [[Mexican Cession]] of land divided the United States politically, with many in the North insisting that slavery not be allowed there (and offering the [[Wilmot Proviso]] to ensure it), while others wanted slavery barred north of the [[Missouri Compromise]] line of [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 N]]. Both proposals were anathema to many Southerners, and the controversy split the Democrats. At the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]], the majority nominated former Michigan senator [[Lewis Cass]] for president, while a minority broke off to become the [[Free Soil Party]], backing former president Van Buren. The Whigs chose General [[Zachary Taylor]], a Louisianan, whose views on most political issues were unknown. Despite his past support for Van Buren, Pierce supported Cass, turning down the quiet offer of second place on the Free Soil [[ticket (politics)|ticket]], and was so effective that Taylor, who was [[1848 United States presidential election|elected president]], was held in New Hampshire to his lowest percentage in any state.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, p. 549\u201365.</ref>\n\nSenator Henry Clay, a Whig, hoped to put the slavery question to rest with a set of proposals that became known as the [[Compromise of 1850]]. These would give victories to North and South, and gained the support of his fellow Whig, Webster. With the bill stalled in the Senate, Illinois Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] led a successful effort to split it into separate measures so that each legislator could vote against the parts his state opposed without endangering the overall package. The bills passed, and were signed by President [[Millard Fillmore]] (who had succeeded Taylor after the president's death earlier in 1850).<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref> Pierce strongly supported the compromise, giving a well-received speech in December 1850 pledging himself to \"The Union! Eternal Union!\"<ref name=autogenerated1>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 608.</ref> The same month, the Democratic candidate for governor, John Atwood, issued a letter opposing the Compromise, and Pierce helped to recall the state convention and remove Atwood from the ticket.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The fiasco compromised the election for the Democrats, who lost several races; still, Pierce's party retained its control over the state, and was well positioned for the upcoming presidential election.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 173\u201380.</ref>\n\n==Election of 1852==\n{{Main|1852 Democratic National Convention|1852 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:1852DemocraticCampaignPoster.png|thumb|right|Campaign poster for the Pierce/King ticket|alt=Poster]]\nAs the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]] approached, the Democrats were divided by the slavery issue, though most of the [[Barnburners and Hunkers#Barnburners|\"Barnburners\"]] who had left the party with Van Buren to form the Free Soil Party had returned. It was widely expected that the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]] would result in deadlock, with no major candidate able to win the necessary two-thirds majority. New Hampshire Democrats, including Pierce, supported his old teacher, Levi Woodbury, by then an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice of the Supreme Court]], as a compromise candidate, but Woodbury's death in September 1851 opened up an opportunity for Pierce's allies to present him as a potential dark horse in the mold of Polk. New Hampshire Democrats felt that, as the state in which their party had most consistently gained Democratic majorities, they should supply the presidential candidate. Other possible standard-bearers included Douglas, Cass, [[William Marcy]] of New York, [[James Buchanan]] of Pennsylvania, [[Sam Houston]] of Texas, and [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] of Missouri.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 181\u201384.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 23\u201329.</ref>\n\nDespite home state support, Pierce faced obstacles to his nomination, since he had been out of office for a decade, and also lacked the front-runners' national reputation. He publicly declared that such a nomination would be \"utterly repugnant to my tastes and wishes\", but given the desire of New Hampshire Democrats to see one of their own elected, he knew his future influence depended on his availability to run.<ref name =w184plus /> Thus, he quietly allowed his supporters to lobby for him, with the understanding that his name would not be entered at the convention unless it was clear none of the front-runners could win. To broaden his potential base of southern support as the convention approached, he wrote letters reiterating his support for the Compromise of 1850, including the controversial [[Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref name =w184plus>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 184\u201397.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe convention assembled on June 1 in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and the deadlock occurred as expected. On the first ballot of the 288 delegates, held on June 3, Cass claimed 116, Buchanan 93, and the rest were scattered, without a single vote for Pierce. The next 34 ballots passed with no winner even close, and still no votes for Pierce. The Buchanan team then had their delegates vote for minor candidates, including Pierce, to demonstrate Buchanan's inevitability, and unite the convention behind him. This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia, New Hampshire, and Maine switched to Pierce; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy, and Pierce was soon in third place. After the 48th ballot, North Carolina Congressman [[James C. Dobbin]] delivered an unexpected and passionate endorsement of Pierce, sparking a wave of support for the dark horse candidate. On the 49th ballot, Pierce received all but six of the votes, and thus gained the Democratic nomination for president. Delegates selected Alabama Senator [[William R. King]], a Buchanan supporter, as Pierce's [[running mate]], and adopted a [[party platform]] that rejected further \"agitation\" over the slavery issue and supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 197\u2013202</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nWhen word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce found it difficult to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would not like to live in Washington.<ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 34.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scott vs Pierce campaign.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|This anti-Pierce political cartoon depicts him as weak and cowardly|alt=Political cartoon]]\nThe Whig candidate was General Scott, Pierce's commander in Mexico; his running mate was [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[William Alexander Graham|William A. Graham]]. The Whigs could not unify their factions as the Democrats had, and the convention adopted a platform almost indistinguishable from that of the Democrats, including support of the Compromise of 1850. This incited the Free Soilers to field their own candidate, Senator Hale of New Hampshire, at the expense of the Whigs. The lack of political differences reduced the campaign to a bitter personality contest and helped to dampen [[voter turnout]] to its lowest level since [[U.S. presidential election, 1836|1836]]; according to biographer Peter A. Wallner, it was \"one of the least exciting campaigns in presidential history\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 210\u201313</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 36\u201338.</ref> Scott was harmed by the lack of enthusiasm of anti-slavery northern Whigs for him and the platform; ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' editor [[Horace Greeley]] summed up the attitude of many when he said of the Whig platform, \"we defy it, execrate it, spit upon it\".<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 724.</ref>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1852.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral map of the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]]|alt=Map]]\nPierce kept quiet so as not to upset his party's delicate unity, and allowed his allies to run the campaign.

Weeks after his election, on January 6, 1853, the President-elect's family had been traveling from Boston by train when their car derailed and rolled down an [[embankment (transportation)|embankment]] near [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. Both Franklin and Jane Pierce survived, but in the wreckage found their only remaining son, 11-year-old Benjamin, crushed to death, his body nearly decapitated. Pierce was not able to hide the gruesome sight from his wife. They both suffered severe depression afterward, which likely affected Pierce's performance as president.<ref name=\"benny\">See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 241\u201349.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 43\u201344.</ref> Jane Pierce wondered if the train accident was divine punishment for her husband's pursuit and acceptance of high office.

Pierce, then the youngest man to be elected president, chose to [[Affirmation in law|affirm]] his oath of office on a law book rather than swear it on a Bible, as all his predecessors except John Quincy Adams had done. He was the first president to deliver his [[Inauguration Day|inaugural address]] from memory.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hurja |first= Emil |date=1933|title=History of Presidential Inaugurations |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KnY_AAAAIAAJ|publisher=New York Democrat |page= 49}}</ref> In the address he hailed an era of peace and prosperity at home and urged a vigorous assertion of U.S. interests in its foreign relations, including the \"eminently important\" acquisition of new territories. \"The policy of my Administration\", said the new president, \"will not be deterred by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion.\" Avoiding the word \"slavery\", he emphasized his desire to put the \"important subject\" to rest and maintain a peaceful union. He alluded to his own personal tragedy, telling the crowd, \"You have summoned me in my weakness, you must sustain me by your strength.\"<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2004}}, p. 249\u201355.</ref>\n\n===Administration and political strife===\n{{See also|List of federal judges appointed by Franklin Pierce}}\n{{CSS image crop|Image = PIERCE, Franklin-President (BEP engraved portrait).jpg |bSize = 325|cWidth = 230|cHeight = 270|oTop = 50|oLeft = 45|Location = right|Description = [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]]-engraved portrait of Pierce as president}}\n\nIn his [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] appointments, Pierce sought to unite a party that was squabbling over the fruits of victory. Most in the party had not originally supported him for the nomination, and some had allied with the Free Soil party to gain victory in local elections. Pierce decided to allow each of the party's factions some appointments, even those that had not supported the Compromise of 1850.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 767.</ref>\n\nAll of Pierce's cabinet nominations were unanimously and immediately confirmed by the Senate.<ref name =\"wall5plus\" /> Pierce spent the first few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism.<ref name =\"wall5plus\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 5\u201324.</ref>\n\nFactionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell Democrats or \"Hards\" of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Marcy (who became Secretary of State) and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell Democrats or \"Softs\".<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 15\u201318, and throughout.</ref>\n\n[[File:William R.

By the start of 1853, King was severely ill with tuberculosis, and went to Cuba to recuperate. His condition deteriorated, and Congress passed a special law, allowing him to be sworn in before the American consul in Havana on March 24. Wanting to die at home, he returned to his plantation in Alabama on April 17 and died the next day. The office of vice president remained vacant for the remainder of Pierce's term, as the Constitution then had no provision for filling the vacancy. This extended vacancy meant that for nearly the entirety of Pierce's presidency the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|Senate President pro tempore]], initially [[David Atchison]] of Missouri, was next in line to the presidency.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nPierce sought to run a more efficient and accountable government than his predecessors.<ref name=\"wallner-20\" /> His Cabinet members implemented an early system of [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] examinations which was a forerunner to the [[Pendleton Act]] passed three decades later, which mandated that most positions in the U.S. government should be awarded on the basis of merit, not patronage.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 35\u201336.</ref> The [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]] was reformed by Secretary [[Robert McClelland (American politician)|Robert McClelland]], who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 36\u201339.</ref> Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand the role of the U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges and attorneys, which was an important step in the eventual development of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]].<ref name=\"wallner-20\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 20.</ref> There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court\u2014Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator [[Judah P.

Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]'s [[filibuster (military)|unauthorized expedition]] into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 75\u201381.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 129\u201333.</ref> Congress reduced the [[Gadsden Purchase]] to the region now comprising southern [[Arizona]] and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15&nbsp;million to $10&nbsp;million.

Marcy completed a [[trade agreement|trade reciprocity agreement]] with British minister to Washington, [[Sir John Crampton, 2nd Baronet|John Crampton]], which reduced the need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable reciprocity treaty was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 27\u201330, 63\u201366, 125\u201326</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 133.</ref> While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada\u2013US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]] of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence.

To the President's surprise, the British did not expel Buchanan in retaliation. In his December 1855 [[State of the Union|message to Congress]] Pierce had set forth the American case that Britain had violated the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty. The British, according to Buchanan, were impressed by the message and were rethinking their policy. Nevertheless, Buchanan was not successful in getting the British to renounce their Central American possessions. The Canadian treaty was ratified by Congress, the British Parliament, and by the colonial legislatures in Canada.<ref>See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 902\u201317.</ref>\n\nPierce's administration aroused sectional apprehensions when three U.S. diplomats in Europe drafted a proposal to the president to purchase [[Cuba]] from Spain for $120&nbsp;million (USD), and justify the \"wresting\" of it from Spain if the offer were refused. The publication of the [[Ostend Manifesto]], which had been drawn up at the insistence of Secretary of State Marcy, provoked the scorn of northerners who viewed it as an attempt to annex a slave-holding possession to bolster Southern interests. It helped discredit the expansionist policy of [[Manifest Destiny]] the Democratic Party had often supported.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 131\u201357.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 149\u2013155.</ref>\n\nPierce favored expansion and a substantial reorganization of the military.

[[organized territory|Organizing]] the largely unsettled [[Nebraska Territory]], which stretched from [[Missouri]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]], and from Texas north to what is now the Canada\u2013US border, was a crucial part of Douglas's plans for western expansion. He wanted a transcontinental railroad with a link from [[Chicago]] to California, through the vast western territory. Organizing the territory was necessary for settlement as the land would not be surveyed nor put up for sale until a territorial government was authorized. Those from slave states had never been content with western limits on slavery, and felt it should be able to expand into territories procured with blood and treasure that had come, in part, from the South. Douglas and his allies planned to organize the territory and let local settlers [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|decide whether to allow slavery]]. This would repeal the Missouri Compromise of 1820, as most of it was north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 N line the Missouri Compromise deemed \"free\". The territory would be split into a northern part, Nebraska, and a southern part, [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]], and the expectation was that Kansas would allow slavery and Nebraska would not.<ref name=\"kansas\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 90\u2013102, 119\u201322.</ref><ref name =\"kansas 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 88\u2013100.</ref><ref name = \"kansas 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1097\u20131240.</ref> In the view of pro-slavery [[U.S. Southern states|Southern]] politicians, the Compromise of 1850 had already annulled the Missouri Compromise by admitting the state of [[California]], including territory south of the compromise line, as a free state.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Jefferson |title=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government |date=1881 |isbn=0-306-80418-2 |page=25|title-link=The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government }}</ref>\n\nPierce had wanted to organize the Nebraska Territory without explicitly addressing the matter of slavery, but Douglas could not get enough southern support to accomplish this.<ref>See {{harv|Etchison|2004}}, p. 14.</ref> Pierce was skeptical of the bill, knowing it would result in bitter opposition from the North. Douglas and Davis convinced him to support the bill regardless. It was tenaciously opposed by northerners such as Ohio Senator [[Salmon P. Chase]] and Massachusetts's [[Charles Sumner]], who rallied public sentiment in the North against the bill. Northerners had been suspicious of the Gadsden Purchase, moves towards Cuba annexation, and the influence of slaveholding Cabinet members such as Davis, and saw the Nebraska bill as part of a pattern of southern aggression. The result was a political firestorm that did great damage to Pierce's presidency.<ref name = \"kansas\" /><ref name = \"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n \nPierce and his administration used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board in favor of the bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and ultimately defined the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the [[Know Nothing]]s, and the founding of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref name=\"kansas\" /><ref name=\"kansas 2\"/><ref name=\"kansas 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Forcing Slavery Freesoilers Throats.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Northerners resented Pierce's attempted expansion of slavery through Kansas\u2013Nebraska and Cuba.<ref name=\"resentment\" /><ref name=\"resentment 2\"/> In this 1856 cartoon, a [[Free Soil Party|Free Soiler]] is held down by Pierce, Buchanan, and Cass while Douglas shoves \"Slavery\" (depicted as a black man) down his throat.|alt=Political cartoon]]\n\nEven as the act was being debated, settlers on both sides of the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much violence between groups that the territory became known as [[Bleeding Kansas]]. Thousands of pro-slavery [[Border Ruffians]] came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] set up a shadow government, and drafted the [[Topeka Constitution]], Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] government.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 195\u2013209.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 111\u2013120.</ref>\n\nPassage of the act coincided with the seizure of escaped slave [[Anthony Burns]] in Boston. Northerners rallied in support of Burns, but Pierce was determined to follow the Fugitive Slave Act to the letter, and dispatched federal troops to enforce Burns's return to his Virginia owner despite furious crowds.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 122\u201325.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nThe midterm congressional elections of 1854 and 1855 were devastating to the Democrats (as well as to the Whig Party, which was on its last legs). The Democrats lost almost every state outside the South. The administration's opponents in the North worked together to return opposition members to Congress, though only a few northern Whigs gained election. In Pierce's New Hampshire, hitherto loyal to the Democratic Party, the Know-Nothings elected the governor, all three representatives, dominated the legislature, and returned John P. Hale to the Senate. Anti-immigrant fervor brought the Know-Nothings their highest numbers to that point, and some northerners were elected under the auspices of the new Republican Party.<ref name=\"resentment\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 158\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"resentment 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 99\u2013100.</ref>\n\n===1856 election===\n{{Main|1856 Democratic National Convention}}\n\n[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Partisan violence spilled into Congress in May 1856 when Free Soil Senator [[Charles Sumner]] was [[caning of Charles Sumner|assaulted with a walking cane]] by Democratic Rep.

In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders were aware of Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.<ref name=\"1856-convention\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 266\u201370.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\">See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 157\u201367.</ref><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\">See {{harv|Holt|2010}}, loc. 1515\u201358.</ref>\n\nWhen balloting began on June 5 at the convention in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], Pierce expected a plurality, if not the required two-thirds majority. On the first ballot, he received only 122 votes, many of them from the South, to Buchanan's 135, with Douglas and Cass receiving the rest. By the following morning fourteen ballots had been completed, but none of the three main candidates were able to get two-thirds of the vote. Pierce, whose support had been slowly declining as the ballots passed, directed his supporters to break for Douglas, withdrawing his name in a last-ditch effort to defeat Buchanan. Douglas, only 43 years of age, believed that he could be nominated in 1860 if he let the older Buchanan win this time, and received assurances from Buchanan's managers that this would be the case. After two more deadlocked ballots, Douglas's managers withdrew his name, leaving Buchanan as the clear winner. To soften the blow to Pierce, the convention issued a resolution of \"unqualified approbation\" in praise of his administration and selected his ally, former Kentucky Representative [[John C. Breckinridge]], as the vice-presidential nominee.<ref name=\"1856-convention\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 2\" /><ref name=\"1856-convention 3\" /> This loss marked the only time in U.S. history that an elected president who was an active candidate for reelection was not nominated for a second term.{{refn|group=note|Pierce was the only president who had been elected as president to not be renominated by their party for a second term.

In his final message to Congress, delivered in December 1856, he vigorously attacked Republicans and abolitionists. He took the opportunity to defend his record on fiscal policy, and on achieving peaceful relations with other nations.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 292\u2013296.</ref><ref>See {{harv|Gara|1991}}, p. 177\u2013179.</ref> In the final days of the Pierce administration, Congress passed bills to increase the pay of army officers and to build new naval vessels, also expanding the number of seamen enlisted.

He insisted that northern abolitionists stand down to avoid a southern secession, writing that the bloodshed of a civil war would \"not be along Mason and Dixon's line merely\", but \"within our own borders in our own streets\".<ref name = \"postpres\" /> He also criticized New England Protestant ministers, who largely supported abolition and Republican candidates, for their \"heresy and treason\".<ref name=\"postpres\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 309\u2013327.</ref> The rise of the Republican Party forced the Democrats to defend Pierce; during [[Lincoln-Douglas debates|his debates]] with Republican Senate candidate [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1858, Douglas called the former president \"a man of integrity and honor\".<ref>See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nAs the Democratic Convention of 1860 approached, some asked Pierce to run as a compromise candidate that could unite the fractured party, but Pierce refused. As Douglas struggled to attract southern support, Pierce backed Cushing and then Breckinridge as potential alternatives, but his priority was a united Democratic Party. The split Democrats were soundly [[1860 United States presidential election|defeated]] for the presidency by the Republican candidate, Lincoln. In the months between Lincoln's election, and his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Pierce looked on as several southern states began plans to secede. He was asked by Justice Campbell to travel to Alabama and address that state's secession convention. Due to illness he declined, but sent a letter appealing to the people of Alabama to remain in the Union, and give the North time to repeal laws against southern interests and to find common ground.<ref name = \"secede\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 327\u2013338.</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nAfter efforts to prevent the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended with the firing on [[Fort Sumter]], Northern Democrats, including Douglas, endorsed Lincoln's plan to bring the Southern states back into the fold by force. Pierce wanted to avoid war at all costs, and wrote to Van Buren, proposing an assembly of former U.S. presidents to resolve the issue, but this suggestion was not acted on. \"I will never justify, sustain or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless, unnecessary war,\" Pierce wrote to his wife.<ref name = \"secede\" /> Pierce publicly opposed President Lincoln's order suspending the writ of [[habeas corpus in the United States|''habeas corpus'']], arguing that even in a time of war, the country should not abandon its protection of civil liberties. This stand won him admirers with the emerging [[Copperheads (politics)|Northern Peace Democrats]], but others saw the stand as further evidence of Pierce's southern bias.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 337\u2013343.</ref>\n\nIn September 1861, Pierce traveled to Michigan, visiting his former Interior Secretary, McClelland, former senator Cass, and others. A Detroit bookseller, J. A. Roys, sent a letter to Lincoln's Secretary of State, [[William H. Seward]], accusing the former president of meeting with disloyal people, and saying he had heard there was a plot to overthrow the government and establish Pierce as president. Later that month, the pro-administration ''[[Detroit Tribune]]'' printed an item calling Pierce \"a prowling traitor spy\", and intimating that he was a member of the pro-Confederate [[Knights of the Golden Circle]]. No such conspiracy existed, but a Pierce supporter, Guy S. Hopkins, sent to the ''Tribune'' a letter purporting to be from a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, indicating that \"President P.\" was part of a plot against the Union.<ref name = \"michigan\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 341\u2013343.</ref><ref name=\"michigan 2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 85\u2013100.</ref> Hopkins intended for the ''Tribune'' to make the charges public, at which point Hopkins would admit authorship, thus making the ''Tribune'' editors seem overly partisan and gullible. Instead, the ''Tribune'' editors forwarded the Hopkins letter to government officials. Seward then ordered the arrest of possible \"traitors\" in Michigan, which included Hopkins. Hopkins confessed authorship of the letter and admitted the hoax, but despite this, Seward wrote to Pierce demanding to know if the charges were true. Pierce denied them, and Seward hastily backtracked. Later, Republican newspapers printed the Hopkins letter in spite of his admission that it was a hoax, and Pierce decided that he needed to clear his name publicly. When Seward refused to make their correspondence public, Pierce publicized his outrage by having a Senate ally, California's [[Milton Latham]], read the letters between Seward and Pierce into the Congressional record, to the administration's embarrassment.<ref name = \"michigan\" /><ref name= \"michigan 2\"/>\n\nThe institution of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat [[Clement Vallandigham]] further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. \"Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate to any one of us when we must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?\", he demanded.<ref name = \"speech\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 343\u2013357.</ref><ref name= \"speech2\">See {{harv|Boulard|2006}}, p. 109\u2013123.</ref> Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] and [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.<ref name = \"speech\" /><ref name=\"speech2\"/>\n\nJane Pierce died of tuberculosis in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by the death of his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne in May 1864; he was with Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of [[Lincoln's assassination]] in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying any need for a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 357\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Final years and death===\nPierce's drinking impaired his health in his last years, but he grew increasingly spiritual. He had a brief relationship with an unknown woman in mid-1865. During this time, he used his influence to improve the treatment of Davis, now a prisoner at [[Fort Monroe]] in Virginia. He also offered financial help to Hawthorne's son Julian, as well as to his own nephews. On the second anniversary of Jane's death, Pierce was baptized into his wife's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] faith at St. Paul's Church in Concord. He found this church to be less political than his former Congregational denomination, which had alienated Democrats with anti-slavery rhetoric. He took up the life of an \"old farmer\", as he called himself, buying up property, drinking less, farming the land himself, and hosting visiting relatives.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 363\u2013366.</ref> He spent most of his time in Concord and his cottage at [[Little Boar's Head Historic District|Little Boar's Head]] on the coast, sometimes visiting Jane's relatives in Massachusetts. Still interested in politics, he expressed support for [[Andrew Johnson]]'s [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policy and supported the president's acquittal in his [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeachment trial]]; he later expressed optimism for Johnson's successor, Ulysses S. Grant.<ref>See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 366\u2013371.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nPierce's health began to decline again in mid-1869; he resumed heavy drinking despite his deteriorating physical condition. He returned to Concord that September, suffering from severe [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, knowing he would not recover. A caretaker was hired; none of his family members were present in his final days. He died at 4:35&nbsp;am on Friday, October 8, 1869. President Grant, who later defended Pierce's service in the Mexican-American War, declared a day of national mourning. Newspapers across the country carried lengthy front-page stories examining Pierce's colorful and controversial career. Pierce was interred next to his wife and two of his sons in the Minot enclosure at Concord's [[Old North Cemetery (Concord, New Hampshire)|Old North Cemetery]].<ref name=\"burial\">See {{harv|Wallner|2007}}, p. 369\u2013373.</ref>\n\nIn his last [[will (law)|will]], which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left a large number of specific bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other items to friends, family, and neighbors.

He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the letter of the law on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [the [[Guano Islands Act]]]. His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife. His support for the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gara|first=Larry|title=Pierce, Franklin|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00788.html|work= American National Biography Online|date=February 2000}}{{subscription}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Books-inline|Presidents of the United States (1789\u20131860)}}\n* [[List of New Hampshire historical markers (76\u2013100)#80|New Hampshire Historical Marker No. 80]]: Franklin Pierce 1804\u20131869\n* [[List of deaths through alcohol]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==== Works cited ====\n{{external media|float=right|video1=[https://www.c-span.org/video/?184075-1/franklin-pierce-new-hampshires-favorite-son ''Booknotes'' interview with Peter Wallner on ''Franklin Pierce: New Hampshire`s Favorite Son'', November 28, 2004], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Boulard|2006}}|last=Boulard|first=Garry|title=The Expatriation of Franklin Pierce: The Story of a President and the Civil War|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0-595-40367-0}}\n* {{cite book|ref={{harvid|Butler|1908}}|last=Butler|first=Pierce|year=1908|author-link=Pierce Butler (justice)|title=Judah P.
