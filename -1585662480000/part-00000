In digital audio, the sound wave of the audio signal is encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence. For example, in [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]], samples are taken 44100 [[Hertz|times per second]] each with 16 bit [[Audio bit depth|sample depth]]. Digital audio is also the name for the entire technology of [[sound recording and reproduction]] using audio signals that have been encoded in [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital form]]. Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the 1970s, it gradually replaced [[Comparison of analog and digital recording |analog audio technology]] in many areas of [[audio engineering]] and [[telecommunications]] in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nIn a digital audio system, an [[Analog signal|analog electrical signal]] representing the sound is converted with an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) into a digital signal, typically using [[pulse-code modulation]]. This digital signal can then be recorded, edited, modified, and copied using [[computer]]s, audio playback machines, and other digital tools. When the sound engineer wishes to listen to the recording on headphones or loudspeakers (or when a consumer wishes to listen to a digital sound file), a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) performs the reverse process, converting a digital signal back into an analog signal, which is then sent through an [[audio power amplifier]] and ultimately to a [[loudspeaker]].\n\nDigital audio systems may include [[Audio compression (data)|compression]], [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Digital signal processing|processing]], and [[Data transmission|transmission]] components. Conversion to a digital format allows convenient manipulation, storage, transmission, and retrieval of an audio signal. Unlike analog audio, in which making copies of a recording results in [[generation loss]] and degradation of signal quality, digital audio allows an infinite number of copies to be made without any degradation of signal quality.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:4-bit-linear-PCM.svg|300px|right|thumb|A sound wave, in red, represented digitally, in blue (after [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and 4-bit [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]).]]\n\nDigital audio technologies are used in the recording, manipulation, mass-production, and distribution of sound, including recordings of [[song]]s, instrumental pieces, [[podcast]]s, sound effects, and other sounds. Modern [[Music download|online music distribution]] depends on digital recording and [[Audio compression (data)|data compression]]. The availability of music as data files, rather than as physical objects, has significantly reduced the costs of distribution.<ref name=\"Janssens\">{{cite journal|last=Janssens|first=Jelle|year=2009|title=The Music Industry on (the) Line? Surviving Music Piracy in a Digital Era|journal= European Journal of Crime, Criminal Law and Criminal Justice|volume=77|issue=96|pages=77\u201396|doi=10.1163/157181709X429105|author2=Stijn Vandaele|author3=Tom Vander Beken|hdl=1854/LU-608677}}</ref> Before digital audio, the music industry distributed and sold music by selling physical copies in the form of [[Phonograph record|records]] and [[cassette tape]]s. With digital-audio and online distribution systems such as [[iTunes]], companies sell digital sound files to consumers, which the consumer receives over the Internet.\n\nAn analog audio system converts physical waveforms of sound into electrical representations of those waveforms by use of a [[transducer]], such as a [[microphone]]. The sounds are then stored on an analog medium such as [[magnetic tape]], or transmitted through an analog medium such as a [[telephone line]] or [[Radio broadcasting|radio]]. The process is reversed for reproduction: the electrical audio signal is [[amplifier|amplified]] and then converted back into physical waveforms via a [[loudspeaker]]. Analog audio retains its fundamental wave-like characteristics throughout its storage, transformation, duplication, and amplification.\n\n[[Analog signal|Analog audio signal]]s are susceptible to noise and distortion, due to the innate characteristics of electronic circuits and associated devices. Disturbances in a [[digital system]] do not result in error unless the disturbance is so large as to result in a symbol being misinterpreted as another symbol or disturb the sequence of symbols. It is therefore generally possible to have an entirely error-free digital audio system in which no noise or distortion is introduced between conversion to digital format, and conversion back to analog.\n\nA digital audio signal may optionally be encoded for correction of any errors that might occur in the storage or transmission of the signal. This technique, known as [[channel coding]], is essential for broadcast or recorded digital systems to maintain bit accuracy. [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation]] is a channel code used in the audio [[compact disc]] (CD).\n\n===Conversion process===\n[[File:A-D-A Flow.svg|thumb|alt=Analog to Digital to Analog conversion|The lifecycle of sound from its source, through an ADC, digital processing, a DAC, and finally as sound again.]]\n\nA digital audio system starts with an ADC that converts an analog signal to a digital signal.<ref group=\"note\">Some audio signals such as those created by [[Synthesizer|digital synthesis]] originate entirely in the digital domain, in which case analog to digital conversion does not take place.</ref> The ADC runs at a specified [[sampling rate]] and converts at a known bit resolution. [[CD audio]], for example, has a sampling rate of 44.1&nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] (44,100&nbsp;samples per second), and has 16-bit [[Audio bit depth|resolution]] for each [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] channel. Analog signals that have not already been [[bandlimited]] must be passed through an [[anti-aliasing filter]] before conversion, to prevent the [[Aliasing|aliasing distortion]] that is caused by audio signals with frequencies higher than the [[Nyquist frequency]] (half the sampling rate).\n\nA digital audio signal may be stored or transmitted. Digital audio can be stored on a CD, a [[digital audio player]], a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]], a [[USB flash drive]], or any other digital [[data storage device]]. The digital signal may be altered through [[digital signal processing]], where it may be [[audio filter|filter]]ed or have [[audio signal processing|effect]]s applied. [[Sample-rate conversion]] including [[upsampling]] and [[downsampling]] may be used to conform signals that have been encoded with a different sampling rate to a common sampling rate prior to processing. [[Audio compression (data)|Audio data compression]] techniques, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], or [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], are commonly employed to reduce the file size. Digital audio can be carried over [[digital audio interface]]s such as [[AES3]] or [[MADI]]. Digital audio can be carried over a network using [[audio over Ethernet]], [[audio over IP]] or other [[streaming media]] standards and systems.\n\nFor playback, digital audio must be converted back to an analog signal with a DAC which may use [[oversampling]].\n\n==History==\n===Coding===\n{{Main|Audio coding format|Audio data compression}}\n\n[[Pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) was invented by British scientist [[Alec Reeves]] in 1937.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zs7v5 |publisher=BBC |title=Genius Unrecognised |date=2011-03-27 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref> In 1950, [[C.

In digital audio, the sound wave of the audio signal is encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence. For example, in [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD audio]], samples are taken 44100 [[Hertz|times per second]] each with 16 bit [[Audio bit depth|sample depth]]. Digital audio is also the name for the entire technology of [[sound recording and reproduction]] using audio signals that have been encoded in [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital form]]. Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the 1970s, it gradually replaced [[Comparison of analog and digital recording |analog audio technology]] in many areas of [[audio engineering]] and [[telecommunications]] in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nIn a digital audio system, an [[Analog signal|analog electrical signal]] representing the sound is converted with an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) into a digital signal, typically using [[pulse-code modulation]]. This digital signal can then be recorded, edited, modified, and copied using [[computer]]s, audio playback machines, and other digital tools. When the sound engineer wishes to listen to the recording on headphones or loudspeakers (or when a consumer wishes to listen to a digital sound file), a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) performs the reverse process, converting a digital signal back into an analog signal, which is then sent through an [[audio power amplifier]] and ultimately to a [[loudspeaker]].\n\nDigital audio systems may include [[Audio compression (data)|compression]], [[Computer data storage|storage]], [[Digital signal processing|processing]], and [[Data transmission|transmission]] components. Conversion to a digital format allows convenient manipulation, storage, transmission, and retrieval of an audio signal. Unlike analog audio, in which making copies of a recording results in [[generation loss]] and degradation of signal quality, digital audio allows an infinite number of copies to be made without any degradation of signal quality.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:4-bit-linear-PCM.svg|300px|right|thumb|A sound wave, in red, represented digitally, in blue (after [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] and 4-bit [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]).]]\n\nDigital audio technologies are used in the recording, manipulation, mass-production, and distribution of sound, including recordings of [[song]]s, instrumental pieces, [[podcast]]s, sound effects, and other sounds. Modern [[Music download|online music distribution]] depends on digital recording and [[Audio compression (data)|data compression]]. The availability of music as data files, rather than as physical objects, has significantly reduced the costs of distribution.<ref name=\"Janssens\">{{cite journal|last=Janssens|first=Jelle|year=2009|title=The Music Industry on (the) Line? Surviving Music Piracy in a Digital Era|journal= European Journal of Crime, Criminal Law and Criminal Justice|volume=77|issue=96|pages=77\u201396|doi=10.1163/157181709X429105|author2=Stijn Vandaele|author3=Tom Vander Beken|hdl=1854/LU-608677}}</ref> Before digital audio, the music industry distributed and sold music by selling physical copies in the form of [[Phonograph record|records]] and [[cassette tape]]s. With digital-audio and online distribution systems such as [[iTunes]], companies sell digital sound files to consumers, which the consumer receives over the Internet.\n\nAn analog audio system converts physical waveforms of sound into electrical representations of those waveforms by use of a [[transducer]], such as a [[microphone]]. The sounds are then stored on an analog medium such as [[magnetic tape]], or transmitted through an analog medium such as a [[telephone line]] or [[Radio broadcasting|radio]]. The process is reversed for reproduction: the electrical audio signal is [[amplifier|amplified]] and then converted back into physical waveforms via a [[loudspeaker]]. Analog audio retains its fundamental wave-like characteristics throughout its storage, transformation, duplication, and amplification.\n\n[[Analog signal|Analog audio signal]]s are susceptible to noise and distortion, due to the innate characteristics of electronic circuits and associated devices. Disturbances in a [[digital system]] do not result in error unless the disturbance is so large as to result in a symbol being misinterpreted as another symbol or disturb the sequence of symbols. It is therefore generally possible to have an entirely error-free digital audio system in which no noise or distortion is introduced between conversion to digital format, and conversion back to analog.\n\nA digital audio signal may optionally be encoded for correction of any errors that might occur in the storage or transmission of the signal. This technique, known as [[channel coding]], is essential for broadcast or recorded digital systems to maintain bit accuracy. [[Eight-to-fourteen modulation]] is a channel code used in the audio [[compact disc]] (CD).\n\n===Conversion process===\n[[File:A-D-A Flow.svg|thumb|alt=Analog to Digital to Analog conversion|The lifecycle of sound from its source, through an ADC, digital processing, a DAC, and finally as sound again.]]\n\nA digital audio system starts with an ADC that converts an analog signal to a digital signal.<ref group=\"note\">Some audio signals such as those created by [[Synthesizer|digital synthesis]] originate entirely in the digital domain, in which case analog to digital conversion does not take place.</ref> The ADC runs at a specified [[sampling rate]] and converts at a known bit resolution. [[CD audio]], for example, has a sampling rate of 44.1&nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]] (44,100&nbsp;samples per second), and has 16-bit [[Audio bit depth|resolution]] for each [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] channel. Analog signals that have not already been [[bandlimited]] must be passed through an [[anti-aliasing filter]] before conversion, to prevent the [[Aliasing|aliasing distortion]] that is caused by audio signals with frequencies higher than the [[Nyquist frequency]] (half the sampling rate).\n\nA digital audio signal may be stored or transmitted. Digital audio can be stored on a CD, a [[digital audio player]], a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]], a [[USB flash drive]], or any other digital [[data storage device]]. The digital signal may be altered through [[digital signal processing]], where it may be [[audio filter|filter]]ed or have [[audio signal processing|effect]]s applied. [[Sample-rate conversion]] including [[upsampling]] and [[downsampling]] may be used to conform signals that have been encoded with a different sampling rate to a common sampling rate prior to processing. [[Audio compression (data)|Audio data compression]] techniques, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], or [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], are commonly employed to reduce the file size. Digital audio can be carried over [[digital audio interface]]s such as [[AES3]] or [[MADI]]. Digital audio can be carried over a network using [[audio over Ethernet]], [[audio over IP]] or other [[streaming media]] standards and systems.\n\nFor playback, digital audio must be converted back to an analog signal with a DAC which may use [[oversampling]].{{Clear}}\n\n==History==\n===Coding===\n{{Main|Audio coding format|Audio data compression}}\n\n[[Pulse-code modulation]] (PCM) was invented by British scientist [[Alec Reeves]] in 1937.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00zs7v5 |publisher=BBC |title=Genius Unrecognised |date=2011-03-27 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref> In 1950, [[C.

Seaman]]. Based on [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|1957 book of the same name]], it was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film. The film is narrated by [[Anthony Hopkins]] and stars [[Jim Carrey]] in the [[Grinch|title role]] along with [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Molly Shannon]] in supporting roles, as well as introducing [[Taylor Momsen]] as Cindy Lou Who.\n\nBecause the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline in order to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed and several new rhymes were put in. The film also borrowed some music and character elements that originated in the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 animated television special]], such as the song \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" and the Grinch's green skin tone.\n\nProduced by Howard and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]], ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on November 17 and received mixed reviews from critics who criticized the screenplay, characters and innuendos but praised the musical score, Carrey\u2019s performance and production values. The film grossed over $345 million worldwide, becoming the [[2000 in film|sixth-highest grossing film of 2000]] and was originally the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the [[The Grinch (film)|third film adaptation of the story]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Guinness World Records 2007| url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin|url-access=registration| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| year=2006| page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin/page/n197 182] (UK edition)| chapter=Arts & Media| isbn=978-1-9049-9412-1}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] as well as getting nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please refer to WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Plots for films should be between 400-700 words. Also see [[User:NinjaRobotPirate/How to streamline a plot summary]] for excellent tips. -->\nAll the residents of [[Whoville]] (Whos) enjoy celebrating [[Christmas]]. The [[Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature, arrives in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. He was a timid child who had a crush on Martha May Whovier, one of the prettiest girls in his school, who showed empathy towards him. Bully Augustus May Who, however, was jealous that Martha liked the Grinch more than him and began to mock him for having a beard. Because of this, the Grinch cut his face while attempting to shave, to which his classmates \u2014 except Martha \u2014 laughed at him and caused the Grinch to lose his temper and declare that he hates Christmas. He fled to the top of Mount Crumpit, north of Whoville, for which he lived there.\n\n53 years later, nobody likes the Grinch due to the harmful stunts he pulls on them. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She then has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office and later discovers his tragic past.\n\nCindy nominates the Grinch to be the town's \"Holiday Cheermeister\", much to the displeasure of May Who, who is now the mayor of Whoville. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration and he eventually accepts. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins to have fun, but May Who reminds him of his childhood humiliation by giving him an electric shaver as a present before publicly proposing marriage to Martha and giving her a gaudy engagement ring. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos for their materialism by telling them that Christmas is only about gifts that they will end up throwing in the garbage, which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He destroys the tree and goes on a rampage around Whoville, before going back home to Mt. Crumpit.\n\nFinally fed up with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch concocts a plan to crush the Whos' Christmas spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they're sleeping. He disguises himself as [[Santa Claus]] and dresses his dog Max as a [[reindeer]], then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and lies to Cindy when she catches him stealing their tree, allowing him to escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back to the top of Mt. Crumpit to destroy the gifts by pushing the sack off the side. When the Whos wake up on Christmas morning, they are horrified to discover the theft and May Who blames Cindy for letting this happen to Whoville. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, comes to his daughter's defense by explaining to Maywho and all of the other Whos that he has finally figured out what Cindy has been trying to tell the whole town \u2014 Christmas is mainly about love of family and friends, not just gifts and fancy lights. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.\n\nBefore the Grinch can push the stolen gifts off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then has an epiphany and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes. The sleigh full of gifts begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return the gifts.\n\nThe Grinch apologizes for the burglary and surrenders himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny May Who's request to arrest and [[pepper spray]] the Grinch. Martha even turns down May Who's proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that her heart belongs to the Grinch. Afterwards, the redeemed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[the Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature who despises Christmas and the Whos of Whoville.

It took a number of tests, and ultimately Carrey admiring a photo of Baker in his first test makeup, for the decision to use Baker's original makeup design. The Grinch suit was covered in yak hair, dyed green and sewed onto a spandex suit. The application of the makeup took up to 2 and a half hours, after which a frustrated Carrey kicked a hole in the wall of his trailer. Carrey's makeup artist [[Kazuhiro Tsuji]] took the most from Carrey's anger. \"On set, [Carrey] was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn't finish,\" Tsuji said. \"After two weeks we only could finish three days' worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart.

Seaman]]. Based on [[Dr. Seuss]]'s [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!|1957 book of the same name]], it was the first Dr. Seuss book to be adapted into a full-length feature film. The film is narrated by [[Anthony Hopkins]] and stars [[Jim Carrey]] in the [[Grinch|title role]] along with [[Jeffrey Tambor]], [[Christine Baranski]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Molly Shannon]] in supporting roles, as well as introducing [[Taylor Momsen]] as Cindy Lou Who.\n\nBecause the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions were made to the storyline in order to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the title character and reworking the story's minor character Cindy Lou Who as a main character. Most of the rhymes that were used in the book were also used in the film, though some of the lines were to some degree changed and several new rhymes were put in. The film also borrowed some music and character elements that originated in the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 animated television special]], such as the song \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" and the Grinch's green skin tone.\n\nProduced by Howard and [[Brian Grazer]]'s [[Imagine Entertainment]], ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas!'' was released by [[Universal Pictures]] in the United States on November 17 and received mixed reviews from critics who criticized the screenplay, characters and innuendos but praised the musical score, Carrey\u2019s performance and production values. The film grossed over $345 million worldwide, becoming the [[2000 in film|sixth-highest grossing film of 2000]] and was originally the second highest-grossing holiday film of all-time behind ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990), until both films were surpassed in 2018 by the [[The Grinch (film)|third film adaptation of the story]].<ref name=\"BOM\"/><ref>{{cite book| title=Guinness World Records 2007| url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin|url-access=registration| publisher=Guinness World Records Limited| year=2006| page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2007guin/page/n197 182] (UK edition)| chapter=Arts & Media| isbn=978-1-9049-9412-1}}</ref> It won the [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Academy Award for Best Makeup]] as well as getting nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please refer to WP:FILMPLOT before editing.

Also see [[User:NinjaRobotPirate/How to streamline a plot summary]] for excellent tips. -->\nAll the residents of [[Whoville]] (Whos) enjoy celebrating [[Christmas]]. The [[Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature, arrives in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. He was a timid child who had a crush on Martha May Whovier, one of the prettiest girls in his school, who showed empathy towards him. Bully Augustus May Who, however, was jealous that Martha liked the Grinch more than him and began to mock him for having a beard. Because of this, the Grinch cut his face while attempting to shave, to which his classmates \u2014 except Martha \u2014 laughed at him and caused the Grinch to lose his temper and declare that he hates Christmas. He fled to the top of Mount Crumpit, north of Whoville, for which he lived there.\n\n53 years later, nobody likes the Grinch due to the harmful stunts he pulls on them. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She then has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office and later discovers his tragic past.\n\nCindy nominates the Grinch to be the town's \"Holiday Cheermeister\", much to the displeasure of May Who, who is now the mayor of Whoville. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration and he eventually accepts. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins to have fun, but May Who reminds him of his childhood humiliation by giving him an electric shaver as a present before publicly proposing marriage to Martha and giving her a gaudy engagement ring. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos for their materialism by telling them that Christmas is only about gifts that they will end up throwing in the garbage, which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He destroys the tree and goes on a rampage around Whoville, before going back home to Mt. Crumpit.\n\nFinally fed up with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch concocts a plan to crush the Whos' Christmas spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they're sleeping. He disguises himself as [[Santa Claus]] and dresses his dog Max as a [[reindeer]], then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and lies to Cindy when she catches him stealing their tree, allowing him to escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back to the top of Mt. Crumpit to destroy the gifts by pushing the sack off the side. When the Whos wake up on Christmas morning, they are horrified to discover the theft and May Who blames Cindy for letting this happen to Whoville. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, comes to his daughter's defense by explaining to Maywho and all of the other Whos that he has finally figured out what Cindy has been trying to tell the whole town \u2014 Christmas is mainly about love of family and friends, not just gifts and fancy lights. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.\n\nBefore the Grinch can push the stolen gifts off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then has an epiphany and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes. The sleigh full of gifts begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return the gifts.\n\nThe Grinch apologizes for the burglary and surrenders himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny May Who's request to arrest and [[pepper spray]] the Grinch. Martha even turns down May Who's proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that her heart belongs to the Grinch. Afterwards, the redeemed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as [[the Grinch]], a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature who despises Christmas and the Whos of Whoville.

Much of the Whoville set was constructed on the backlot of [[Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]] behind the Bates Motel set from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. [[Rick Baker]] was hired to design and create the film's prosthetic makeup for Carrey and the rest of the cast. It took a number of tests, and ultimately Carrey admiring a photo of Baker in his first test makeup, for the decision to use Baker's original makeup design. The Grinch suit was covered in yak hair, dyed green and sewed onto a spandex suit. The application of the makeup took up to 2 and a half hours, after which a frustrated Carrey kicked a hole in the wall of his trailer. Carrey's makeup artist [[Kazuhiro Tsuji]] took the most from Carrey's anger. \"On set, [Carrey] was really mean to everybody and at the beginning of the production they couldn't finish,\" Tsuji said. \"After two weeks we only could finish three days' worth of shooting schedule, because suddenly he would just disappear and when he came back, everything was ripped apart. We couldn't shoot anything.\" Tsuji left production until Baker had a discussion with Carrey on how important Tsuji was to the production.

Ramollah) was born in [[Kermanshah]], [[Iran]], and started his public teachings at the age of 23. His teachings cover a wide range of topics from [[spirituality]] to thought and thinking methods as well as [[parapsychology]], [[metaphysics]] and [[esoteric]] knowledge. He has been the originator of some applied theories among which the ''[http://www.prothinka.org/Article/2850/ Systematic Decision Making using 7/10 Method]'' and ''poly-what planning formulae'' have been more popular.<ref>Prothinka emagazine, [http://www.prothinka-src.org/Persian/Show_eZine.php?ezine_id=12%20Prothinka-SRC vol. 12]</ref><ref>Sublime Thinking magazine, Summer 2006, Vol. 3</ref><ref>[http://360thinkingtips.blogspot.com/2010/08/136.html 360 Thinking tips]</ref> <br />\nFattahi's appearance is not similar to religious characters and he has insisted repeatedly that he is not a religious man. Although he does not teach about religions and faiths, a large proportion of his teachings are focused to revive divine spiritualism, esoteric cognition, and self-awareness. He has little if not much academic education; according to him, ''\"One day I burnt that little acquired knowledge and left it to oblivion\"'',<ref>The Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, Page 2-5</ref> but there are more than 4000 pages of manuscripts available on his teachings in the field of esoteric knowledge as well as applied and fundamental theories.

He is especially concerned about people who are astray and in deviation \u2013 that majority caught in darkness and ignorance.  He points out that he has completely explored and fully known their world; therefore, he has a very deep and strong relation with them.  However, he avoids arrogant, fanatic, pessimistic, hesitant and so-called wise people.<ref>same</ref><br />\nAlthough Fattahi's teachings on the field of thinking methods have been most popular within the past 15 years, some of his followers still know him as a spiritual leader.\n\nFattahi has been given various appellations by different categories of his followers and admirers. There have been different opinions about his nature of identity and it's been told by some of his devotees he is such or such person. But far from any pretension he has called all those attributes chimerical and superstitious and once answered to the question 'who you really are?': ''\"I am not somebody else, I am who I am.\"''<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/WhoIsTheMasterEn/2090/ Who is Master Iliya?], An Introduction published at Fattahi's official website.</ref>\nHe presents himself as a servant of God and frequently refers to himself as an ordinary and normal person.

Fattahi |source=[http://ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/], An extract from 1st to 5th official statements of Master Elia Public Relation Office.}}\n\n==Teachings==\nThe biographical materials available on Fattahi via various blogs as well as [http://www.ostad-iliya.org his official website] state that he has begun his teachings at the age of 16 among a limited number of his students.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin- vol. 1] an autobiography available on [ostad-iliya.org/en Master Elia official website]</ref> Later at the age of 23, his public speeches began which was to be most welcomed by scholars, intellectuals, students and youth. However, it's been recognized that people from different categories of the society has joined him as his followers; [[literate]] and [[illiterate]], young and old, religious and secular, [[intellectual]] and [[dogmatic]], rich, poor, and even a few numbers of people with a very low incidence of being influenced by his teachings; those who have been addicted, [[perverted]] or had been considering themselves as extraordinary people and had some followers.\n\nFattahi's teachings are based on ''Elahism''.<ref>Elahism is a universal monotheistic ritual transcending any religion or faith (in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages it could be an abbreviation of [[Allah]]-ism). The founder of Elahism is Maha-Avatar who has been called by various names and appellations in different regions of the globe. He is known as Master Rouhollah in Iran. A number of documentaries (in the form of films and books) have been produced about him. It's also been claimed that he has the highest rank in the esoteric masters' hierarchy. However, ''Elahism'' has been taught by some other spiritual masters in the world. The Esoteric Elahism could be defined as divine-shifted esoteric knowledge which is neither related to any of the religions nor faiths, sects or cults. Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques (named ZX methods) are the secret part of these teachings which is taught in the form of non \u2013public tutorials.</ref> A more popular name given to his teachings is \"The Art of [[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Life\" which is carried on two levels. The first level consists of simple and general instructions which is called the ''Solar Level'' or the stage of \"Revival and Rebirth\". This is the cycle of awakening, of the opening of eyes and ears, of mobilization of minds and activation of hearts.\n\nThe essence of his instructions in this level is a perception of [[divinity|divine]] presence and revelation of love for [[The Lord]] or \"living lovingly in the divine presence\". His teachings are based upon determining principles and clear basis.<ref>The Art of Transcendental Life is neither a new sacred law \u2013 [[shariat]] \u2013 nor a new spiritual path, but it is the interpretation and significance of the words of the Living Lord in the present time. The basis of his teachings consists of \"tendency towards the truth\" and this means to be inclined towards existence and presence instead of to lean towards the illusion. That is to say, being inclined toward God, God- worshiping, God-seeking, God-centeredness, God-infatuation, God-mindfulness, God-observance, God-infatuation instead of being inclined towards oneself, self-worshiping, selfishness, self-conceit, self-infatuation, and self-centeredness.  In the art of transcendental life, the emphasis is on quality, introversion, and worship of the Lining One rather than extroversion and worship of dead.</ref>\n\nThe second level is called ''Astronomical Level'' or ''Transcendental Arts'' which is related to metaphysical techniques or Psychotechnology and consists of teachings of mysteries. This level is meant for the selected and admitted individuals and due to its mysterious nature, quite a little information has been publicized about its details.<ref>More information could be retrieved at [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Fattahi's autobiography], page 112</ref><br />\n \nElia does not charge the attendees for his teachings but he believes the student's self is the price of their training.<ref>same</ref>\n\n===Other branches of Elia's public teachings===\nIn addition to [[spirituality|spiritual]] and cognitive teachings, Fattahi has held some tutorials for a limited number of his students during which they have been trained in more specialized fields. Science of Success, Harmonical Marriage, Sublime Nutrition, Creative Speaking, Methods of Sublime Struggling, Methods of Writing, Lecturing and Doing research, [[wikt:symbolism|Symbolism]] and Nature-based [[Semiotics]], Methods of Dynamic and Coordinated Therapy, Techniques of Analyzing and Interpreting of the Articles, and Esoteric [[Anthropology]] are some of his semi-public teaching courses.<ref>same</ref>\n\n====Thinking Methods====\nOne of the most pivotal branches of Fattahi's teachings is called ''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Teach/Teach9/1710/ XZY]'' or ''36 Methods of Sublime Thinking''. Methods such as [http://prothinka.org/Article/2887/ Creative Thinking], [http://prothinka.org/Article/2886/ Pattern-extractor Thinking] as well as Conceptualizer Thinking, Foresighter, Symmetrizing and Ultra-viewing methods could be noted.

This can be concluded regarding his activities within the recent years which was mainly focused on the field of thinking and thought. Some of the El-Yasin affiliated institutions such as [http://www.pmrg.ir/portal Professional Management Research Group] (PMRG) as well as [[www.prothinka.com|Association of Thinkers and Researchers]] have also been very active in discussion and transcription of Fattahi's thinking methods ever since.\n\n===Non-public Teachings===\nAnother aspect of Fattahi's teaching is focused on [[esoteric]] knowledge. It's been called ''Astronomical level'', ''ZX methods'' or Psychotechnology in which Creative Dreaming (dream making), Spiritual Communication, Teletransportation, Energy Hunting and Parallel Experiencing are taught to the trainees.<br />\nFattahi believes such trainings are not necessary for the public, therefore, he has recommended them to a limited number of his followers who have been selected and admitted by precise and strict criteria. According to Fattahi's followers, it's necessary for an esoteric apprentice to be committed to some strict rules such as keeping anonymity, protecting the mysterious techniques, avoiding the use of their abilities for personal means and complying with some unusual conditions.<ref>More information could be retrieved from [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Aamin, vol.1], page 12</ref>\n\nRegardless to the detailed content of all above-mentioned categories, Fattahi considers the extract of his teachings in the divine phrase ''There is no deity other than Him/Her'' (La Elaha Ella Hou).<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, 1998</ref>\n\n==Lectures==\nThe first rounds of Master Elia's public lectures were begun at his age of 23 (1996) in [[Tehran]]. These lectures used to be held mostly in cultural centers and community halls and were extremely welcomed by different categories of audiences especially youth, [[students]], writers, [[intellectuals]] and [[scholars]]. \nBefore being forced to stop by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Iran)]], the organizers had to arrange his lectures in the largest [[auditoriums]] of Tehran with the capacity for admission of thousands of people, but, those auditoriums were not spacious enough for eager audiences, therefore, further sessions were carried out with [[wikt:audio|audio]] or video playback.\n\nThose lectures were generally given in various subjects such as:\n* [[Faith]], the key of human [[salvation]]\n* [[Thinking]] and its methods\n* [[wikt:divine|Divine]] [[Parables]]\n* Calling on God\n* God is the one\n* Review and analysis of Eastern mysticism\n* Guiles and traps of the [[Devil]]\n* Observation and methods of controlling [[ego (spirituality)|ego]]\n* God's holy names\n* [[Parapsychology]] and Science of success\n* The art of [[transcendentals|transcendental]] living; the sublime life\n* God's [[blessing]], God's [[Divine grace|grace]]\n* Gratitude to God\n* Divine communication\n* Methods of [[worshiping]] and the keys to materialization of a wish\n* [[The Art of Dreaming|Dreaming]] and creative observation\n* Female-dominance or male-dominance?\n* The Superior President\n* Your attitude is determinant to your [[future]]\n* Determinative words\n* ...\n\nIn the following years, under serious pressures of the Security Office against Religions and Religious Minorities, the lectures were held less frequently. Not a day passed without direct or indirect attacks from radical [[clergies]] in their bid to control the scene of culture and religion. \nIn Spring 2005, during a lecture at the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium]] in Tehran, a direct and physical attack was mounted by undercover agents in a bid to harm and arrest Elia.<ref>To watch a footage of this event click [http://ostad-iliya.org/MovieEn/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=114 here] or [http://ostad-iliya.org/Movie/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=103 here] .</ref> Although, he was not arrested as a result of participants' robust defense but this session is considered as the last public meeting of Master Elia M. Ramollah since 2005. It is worth mentioning that in winter 2007 a plan was set to hold a speech session in [[Azadi Stadium]] (Tehran) with a capacity to admit 100,000 audiences, but it was dropped due to strong disagreement of the authorities at [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Ministry of Intelligence and Security of Iran]].\n\n==From the critics' point of view==\nFattahi's name (Elia M. Ramollah) was first mentioned by [[Kayhan|''Kayhan'' newspaper]]<ref>Kayhan newspaper, 28/03/1383- Persian calendar</ref> (the organ of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]) as a perverted character (2004). His name was published once again in ''Kayhan''<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> and ''[[Resalat (newspaper)|Resalat]]''<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref> newspapers a few months before his first detention in 2007 by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Security service of Iran]].\n\nTaking the actions of Iranian governmental newspapers and TVs into account, one can conclude that despite having thousands of followers and admirers, Fattahi is faced with serious [[dogmatic]] [[critics]] some of which accuse him of heresy and claiming [[prophecy]], and categorize his teachings as a [[New religious movement]] (NRM).<ref>New religions typology, Hamidieh Behzad, 20/03/1385- Persian calendar</ref>\n\nSome others, however, consider him as the master of a tempting and [[Subversion|subversive]] [[sect]], related to global [[Zionism]] networks, related to [[Freemasonry|Masons]], a talented [[Hypnotize Minds|mesmerizer]], [[wizard (paranormal)|wizard]], a neo-[[Rasputin]] and a [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] promoter.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri Eslami]] newspaper published an article titled ''A God who is the 13th child of his family'' in which Fattahi was introduced as a person claiming [[deity]].<ref>Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, No. 8619, 02/03/1388- persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn brief, various calumnious accusations surfaced against Fattahi were:\nThe new [[Messiah]], [[Krishnamurti]]'s next ring, the [[Devil]], spirit of Messiah, the prophet of non-believers and non-religious, the preacher of spirituality without religion, US and Western power's agent, a preacher of negative resistance, 21st century wizard, Mahatma Elia, the second [[Gandhi]], the second [[Martin Luther|Luther]], the 3rd [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], corrupted, excommunicated, leader of American culture, a preacher of spiritual innovation and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], harbinger of so-called Elia-ism, and a deity claimant.\n\nTo address the accusations claimed by Fattahi's opponents, the 6th branch of the Special Court for Governmental Staffs was authorized to open a special case against him (2006), and recalled the possible plaintiffs through a public announcement by [[Kayhan]] to lodge their complaints.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> However, the case was closed without any specific result due to lack of plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.ettelaat.net/08-maj/news.asp?id=28905 Ettelaat Net]</ref>\n\nElia's opponents do not deny his ability and knowledge in different areas but unlike his fans who consider it as an entitlement of a divine sense, their approach is to destruct and to question his talents.\nSome of them claim that his charismatic character has its root on his childhood and the family issues he was facing combined with an essence of talent and innate genius: \n''Due to his family problems, especially mental turbulent atmosphere full of family conflicts, he was forced to quit school and became solitary and isolated.''<ref>Anonymous,''Elia, Ramollah, the Avatar and ...'', Kajraheh Supplement, Jam e Jam Newspaper, March 2007, p. 18</ref> <br />\n \nSome other opponents attribute his talents to extensive studies in various fields:\n''Later on, he began studying the metaphysics books and documents such as Psycho technology, halo vision, dreaming, Maha-meditation, energy healing and other so-called science including cosmic science. He then met some celebrities and masters in this area\u2026''<ref>same</ref>\n\n''Despite lack of formal education and classical studies, he took advantage of his talents and proportional abilities to compensate his personality defects very well.''<ref>same</ref>\n\nFattahi has responded to some of these allegations in this way:\n\n''Question: Some believe you are insane or a wizard. Why should they believe so?''\n\nAnswer: \"If I would use the opposite medicine you would use to cure the same illness, we shall, naturally, take each other for insane. It is not your fault to call me mad for you to realize the way I act, think or move is contrary to your expectations. Since you take yourself as a wise person, you will naturally call mad and insane whoever moves and thinks unlike you\u2026those who call me sorcerer and wizard want to relieve their conscience and actually assert themselves and maintain their claims.\nThey hear my teachings and get impressed and see that others are impressed as well. They observe changes and evolution, awakenings and cries and are thus faced with divine power and holy teachings. However, they think if they accept these teachings, the colossal palace they have built in their conceit will collapse and their false and superficial rightfulness will be denounced. They believe accepting the teachings of God's Spirit jeopardizes their profits\u2026They see the divine power yet because it goes against their egoistic aspirations they attack the person and individuality of the teacher. They calumniate him and investigate his personality.\"<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Page 123-124</ref>\n\nThere have been several statements officially published by Elyasin Community as a response to rumors and allegations about Peyman Fattahi.<ref>These statements have originally been issued between 1990 and 1997 by the Office of Public Relations of the community and republished to clarify his followers' attitude toward those rumors. To read an extract of them click [http://www.ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/ here].</ref>\n\nFattahi's devotees do believe most of these rumors and allegations have been already responded in officially issued statements, however, many of them have been actively challenging with such destructive acts specifically after the open conflicts of Iranian security service with their master and leader. They have expressed their disagreement with these demolition jobs mostly by compiling books, publishing articles, film making, and blogging and are still working on these issues.\n\nIn spite of their attempts to respond to the allegations and rumors, destructive acts by Fattahi's opponents are still ongoing, using the governmental tribunes and in form of publishing articles, circulation of free bulletins and digests, broadcasting TV serials and round-tables as well as making fake and fabricated documentaries. In Summer 2011, a report was published by Religions and Faiths Watch<ref>http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/308/1/ Corruptors and Demons!</ref> about the exhibition and fairs held by [[Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Qom Seminary]] and the [http://www.ido.ir/en/en-default.aspx Islamic Development Organization] (IDO). In those events, an extensive attack has been designated to happen against Green movement leaders ([[Mirhossein Mousavi|Mousavi]], [[Mehdi KARUBI|Karubi]] and [[Seyed Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]]), U.S. presidents ([[Barack Obama]] and [[George W. Bush]]), European presidents (like [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]), some Iranian intellectuals and dissidents (such as Dr [[Abdolkarim Soroush|Soroush]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Akbar Ganji]], [[Alireza Nourizadeh]], [[Mohsen Sazegara]]). In these sets of exhibitions, further to Peyman Fattahi (known as Master Elia \u2013 the leader of Elyasin Community) some spiritual movements (such as [[Baha'i]]s and [[Dervish]]es) and spiritual leaders (such as [[Dalai Lama]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], Paul Twitchel \u2013 the master of [[Eckankar]] and Li Hongzhi \u2013 the master of [[Falun Dafa]]) has been targeted by Iranian extremist clergies.\n\nFurthermore, a TV programme entitled ''[[Armageddon]]'' (the final battle between the good and evil) has been broadcast by the News Channel of Islamic republic of Iran (IRINN) and other governmental media (2011). The TV series consists of 104 episodes, some of which have been replayed several times by governmental TV. According to the latest report of ''Association of Thinkers and Researcher''<ref>''The 45th attack of Iranian extremist clergies to Master Elia'' (Summary of Armageddon TV Series, episode 25), Paris Keynezhad \u2013 Senior member of Association of THikers and Researchers</ref> episode 25 begins with blatant lies and demolition jobs on Elia M. then continues doing the same against the author [[Paulo Coelho]]. It is claimed in the film that Paulo Coelho is corrupted, Satanist, Zionist and a drug addict. In another episode the narrator speaks about other famous characters and groups like [[Shimon Peres]]-the ex-prime minister and the current president of Israel and one of the pioneers of modern Zionism, [[Osho Rajneesh]] and [[Eckankar]] spiritual movement then emphasizes that the [[U.S.]] presidents, like Mr. Bush and Obama as well as the foreign minister of United States [[Hillary Clinton]], European presidents and even the Pope<ref>the world leader of catholic Christians</ref> are all [[Satanist]]s.\n\nThe 4th season of ''Armageddon'' TV programme has been replayed four times on governmental television of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].<ref>The main subject of the other episodes of Armageddon, season 4 is as follows:\nMedia Pluralism, Satellite Channels, BBC, VOA ( in this episode it is claimed that VOA is affiliated with Zionism, Baha'i, etc), Cold Digital War (claiming that Facebook, Microsoft, Internet, etc. are all perverted and Zionistic), Rereading the History of Cinema in Iran (claiming that the cinema of Iran has its roots in Freemasons and Zionism\u2026), Zionist Cults and Terrorist Coup d'\u00e9tat-seekers (it speaks about the Baha'i's attempts to dominate Iran and their treachery and demolitions), Secular Sufis, Modern Spiritualities (claiming that Dalai Lama, Sai Baba, Osho, Krishnamurti, etc. are all perverted and hirelings and Ekankar, TSM, etc. are all Zionistic), Anarchistic Spirituality (claiming that Elia M.

These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.\n\n\"On May 27, 2007, Master Fattahi (known as Eliya M) was arrested by the \"Department against Religions and Religious Minorities\" (DARRM). He was sent to notorious security ward 209 of [[Evin prison]]. Afraid of his follower's support, the security officials were at loss to decide on jailing him. According to DARRM statement, Eliya M. was finally arrested by the decision of high-ranking religious officials. A council consist of highest-ranking religious and cleric powers of Iran decided that Eliya M. should be quietly arrested under charges of permuting the religion (Islam), proselytism, an invitation to spiritual pluralism, conspiracy against the Islamic government, renewal of religion by linking Islam, Christianity and Judaism; spiritual liberalism and incitement to the so \u0640 called American Islam and many other routine accusations that are used in these cases such as Offending sacred symbols of religion, a conspiracy by creating underground secret society and cult (Eliya \u0640 ism). But he had only one crime: he was against the Islam that calls for violence\u2026 Eliya was arrested for spiritual liberty, for a different interpretation of God's words which was against the cold stagnant understanding of religion.\".<ref>Extracted from [http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/40/36/ the first open letter of Elia's followers to leaders of the world]</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Peyman Fattahi was released on a bail of 300 million Tomans (almost 300,000 USD) after spending six months in prison, suffering from recurrent bleeding from nose and ears, bloody vomiting and bloody urination.<ref>[[U.S Department of State]] annual report on Iran Human Rights.

Although there is no press released report available on this matter.\n\n===Third Detention===\nOn 24 July 2011, a report was published about Fatahi's third detention along with a number of his students and members of Association of Thinkers and Researchers.<ref>To original script of the news could be retrieved from this [http://prothinka.org/News/3381/ link]</ref>\n\nA few days later, the official spokesperson of Elyasin Community who resides in UK<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/people/Paris-Keynejad/1108926967 Paris Keynezhad]</ref> verified this news by publishing an announcement but she mentioned they have all been released shortly after detention and none of the Elyasin members are under arrest. Some other key members of Elyasin verified this official announcement as well.<ref>The statement can be retrieved from this [http://www.emruznews.com/2011/08/post-7081.php link]</ref>\n\nImmediately after publishing of this announcement [[Tabnak]] and some the government- related blogs and websites began to widely publish a short note about Fattahi's arrest in which the event was distorted.<ref>[http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/179079/%D8%AF%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%82%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C-%C2%AB%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%C2%BB Tabnak], 02/05/1390 \u2013 Persian calendar, news code# 179079</ref> Fattahi's followers do believe re-publishing of this news firstly by Tabnak then by the other government affiliated websites have happened to proceed with the aim of [[psychological war]] against Fattahi and Elyasin Community.\n\nHowever, this act brought an immediate response from Fattahi's followers in the form of publishing an open letter from members of [http://www.prothinka-src.org Association of Thinkers and Researchers (overseas branch)] to world leaders.

Elyasin consists of a number of NGO's and publishing houses, most of which have been banned and shut time from the time of Ahmadinejad's presidency. There are some magazines affiliated to Elyasin such as ''Art of Living'', ''Esoteric Knowledge'', ''Motivators'', [[Science of Success (magazine)|''Science of Success'']], ''The Art of Transcendental Life'', and ''Sublime Thinking''. \nAvamer-e-Yasin, Science f Success, [http://www.prothinka.com Association of Thinkers and Researchers], Nature Front Association, Yasin Society of Writers and Researchers (Payam), and [http://ayahra.org/en Elyasin Human Rights and International Affairs] are some of Elyasin treaty bodies to be noted.\nIt's worth mentioning that Fattahi's followers are generally known as 'Elahioun' who can be recognized in different sub-categories such as \"Mansouroun (Elias' Offsprings)\", Iliya Supporters, The protectors of Elia M., Ghadr and Payam 1,2,3 groups, and Sina group (Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques trainees and apprentices).\nFattahi's devotees are running a number of active blogs and websites at the moment.\n\n==Written Works and confiscated books==\n'''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Jaryane-_Hedayate-Elahi_edition-2.pdf The Flow of Divine Guidance]''' is the only published book which is a transcription of Fattahi's public speeches at the age of 23. This book has been compiled by one of his close disciples and primarily published in 1998. However, this book was banned after the first publishing. His followers claim thousands of copies of it have been printed and distributed by Fattahi's devotees inside and outside of Iran. \nThere are more than 30 books have been confiscated by Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran) including:<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/ILIYA-CV-en.pdf Victims of ruthlessness]</ref>\n\n# The \"Teachings of Truth\" canon which contains some of his speeches and lectures.\n# \"Esoteric schools and the mysterious meanings in manuscripts\"\n# \"Sublime thinking and methods of creative thinking\" (consist of thirty six methods of thinking)\n# \"Thinking Formulas and Mental Software\"(consist of more than seven hundred thinking formulas to do different works)\n# \"The Art of Sublime Struggle\"\n# [[Hezbollah]] Doctrine (The Army of God Doctrine) (on inviting Hezbollah to use flexible methods and software thinking and to avoid violence and increase tendency to love)\n# \"Universal Theories and Modern Spirituality\"\n# \"Fundamental Life patterns\"\n# \"True Intuitions and False interpretations\"\n# \"The Art of Dreaming in Elahism (creative dreaming and dream making)\"\n# \"Esoteric judgment and true justice\"\n# \"Harmonious and Disharmonic Marriage\"\n# \"Saviors of the World and Motivators\"\n# \"Fundamental Insights and Enlivening Thoughts\"\n# \"The Ancient Science of Semiotics\"(understanding the signs of the world around us)\n# \"Teaching revolutionary counseling\"\n# \"Inward Interpretations of outward verses or signs\"\n# \"Creative Look; constructive thoughts and inventive words\"\n# \"The Meanings of Nature Sounds and Birds Songs\"\n# \"The Future of the World, Civilizations and Religions\"\n# \"The Knowledge of Names and Luminous Keys\"\n# \"The Methods of Predicting future\"\n# \"Cults and Anti Cults\" (on what cults are and analyzing and controlling them)\n# \"The Correspondence\"(letters, questions, messages and recommendations to the leaders of the world, scientists and scholars)\n\n==Doctrines and Fundamental Theories==\nAccording to Fattahi's old allies a large number of [[doctrine]]s and fundamental theories have been proposed by him since 20 years ago.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin, vol.1], page 452-454,</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been usually suggested during public speeches and meetings as well as personal conversations and discussions on the daily routine. Then, they have been further analyzed by students who have been responsible for collecting them. Although most of these theories are esoteric-based and esoteric-oriented, they do concern all aspects of life and sometimes are linked to the details of daily life.\nThe doctrines of Sublime Struggle, Reconciliation of Civilizations, Creative Look, Harmonious Marriage, as well as the doctrine of coordination, doctrine Suprapolar Human Being (bipolar man), the doctrine of 360-degree view are some of which could be mentioned in this regard. Also, the theories of Intuitive References, Creative Review and the doctrine of Voluntary and Recurrent Death could be noted.<ref>same</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been collected and further discussed by a number of his students in a multi-volume set of books entitled ''360 Doctrines and Comprehensive Theories''.

His teachings cover a wide range of topics from [[spirituality]] to thought and thinking methods as well as [[parapsychology]], [[metaphysics]] and [[esoteric]] knowledge. He has been the originator of some applied theories among which the ''[http://www.prothinka.org/Article/2850/ Systematic Decision Making using 7/10 Method]'' and ''poly-what planning formulae'' have been more popular.<ref>Prothinka emagazine, [http://www.prothinka-src.org/Persian/Show_eZine.php?ezine_id=12%20Prothinka-SRC vol. 12]</ref><ref>Sublime Thinking magazine, Summer 2006, Vol. 3</ref><ref>[http://360thinkingtips.blogspot.com/2010/08/136.html 360 Thinking tips]</ref> <br />\nFattahi's appearance is not similar to religious characters and he has insisted repeatedly that he is not a religious man. Although he does not teach about religions and faiths, a large proportion of his teachings are focused to revive divine spiritualism, esoteric cognition, and self-awareness. He has little if not much academic education; according to him, ''\"One day I burnt that little acquired knowledge and left it to oblivion\"'',<ref>The Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, Page 2-5</ref> but there are more than 4000 pages of manuscripts available on his teachings in the field of esoteric knowledge as well as applied and fundamental theories.

However, he avoids arrogant, fanatic, pessimistic, hesitant and so-called wise people.<ref>same</ref><br />\nAlthough Fattahi's teachings on the field of thinking methods have been most popular within the past 15 years, some of his followers still know him as a spiritual leader.\n\nFattahi has been given various appellations by different categories of his followers and admirers. There have been different opinions about his nature of identity and it's been told by some of his devotees he is such or such person. But far from any pretension he has called all those attributes chimerical and superstitious and once answered to the question 'who you really are?': ''\"I am not somebody else, I am who I am.\"''<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/WhoIsTheMasterEn/2090/ Who is Master Iliya?], An Introduction published at Fattahi's official website.</ref>\nHe presents himself as a servant of God and frequently refers to himself as an ordinary and normal person.

However, it's been recognized that people from different categories of the society has joined him as his followers; [[literate]] and [[illiterate]], young and old, religious and secular, [[intellectual]] and [[dogmatic]], rich, poor, and even a few numbers of people with a very low incidence of being influenced by his teachings; those who have been addicted, [[perverted]] or had been considering themselves as extraordinary people and had some followers.\n\nFattahi's teachings are based on ''Elahism''.<ref>Elahism is a universal monotheistic ritual transcending any religion or faith (in [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]] languages it could be an abbreviation of [[Allah]]-ism). The founder of Elahism is Maha-Avatar who has been called by various names and appellations in different regions of the globe. He is known as Master Rouhollah in Iran. A number of documentaries (in the form of films and books) have been produced about him. It's also been claimed that he has the highest rank in the esoteric masters' hierarchy. However, ''Elahism'' has been taught by some other spiritual masters in the world. The Esoteric Elahism could be defined as divine-shifted esoteric knowledge which is neither related to any of the religions nor faiths, sects or cults. Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques (named ZX methods) are the secret part of these teachings which is taught in the form of non \u2013public tutorials.</ref> A more popular name given to his teachings is \"The Art of [[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Life\" which is carried on two levels. The first level consists of simple and general instructions which is called the ''Solar Level'' or the stage of \"Revival and Rebirth\". This is the cycle of awakening, of the opening of eyes and ears, of mobilization of minds and activation of hearts.\n\nThe essence of his instructions in this level is a perception of [[divinity|divine]] presence and revelation of love for [[The Lord]] or \"living lovingly in the divine presence\". His teachings are based upon determining principles and clear basis.<ref>The Art of Transcendental Life is neither a new sacred law \u2013 [[shariat]] \u2013 nor a new spiritual path, but it is the interpretation and significance of the words of the Living Lord in the present time. The basis of his teachings consists of \"tendency towards the truth\" and this means to be inclined towards existence and presence instead of to lean towards the illusion. That is to say, being inclined toward God, God- worshiping, God-seeking, God-centeredness, God-infatuation, God-mindfulness, God-observance, God-infatuation instead of being inclined towards oneself, self-worshiping, selfishness, self-conceit, self-infatuation, and self-centeredness.  In the art of transcendental life, the emphasis is on quality, introversion, and worship of the Lining One rather than extroversion and worship of dead.</ref>\n\nThe second level is called ''Astronomical Level'' or ''Transcendental Arts'' which is related to metaphysical techniques or Psychotechnology and consists of teachings of mysteries. This level is meant for the selected and admitted individuals and due to its mysterious nature, quite a little information has been publicized about its details.<ref>More information could be retrieved at [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Fattahi's autobiography], page 112</ref><br />\n \nElia does not charge the attendees for his teachings but he believes the student's self is the price of their training.<ref>same</ref>\n\n===Other branches of Elia's public teachings===\nIn addition to [[spirituality|spiritual]] and cognitive teachings, Fattahi has held some tutorials for a limited number of his students during which they have been trained in more specialized fields. Science of Success, Harmonical Marriage, Sublime Nutrition, Creative Speaking, Methods of Sublime Struggling, Methods of Writing, Lecturing and Doing research, [[wikt:symbolism|Symbolism]] and Nature-based [[Semiotics]], Methods of Dynamic and Coordinated Therapy, Techniques of Analyzing and Interpreting of the Articles, and Esoteric [[Anthropology]] are some of his semi-public teaching courses.<ref>same</ref>\n\n====Thinking Methods====\nOne of the most pivotal branches of Fattahi's teachings is called ''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Teach/Teach9/1710/ XZY]'' or ''36 Methods of Sublime Thinking''. Methods such as [http://prothinka.org/Article/2887/ Creative Thinking], [http://prothinka.org/Article/2886/ Pattern-extractor Thinking] as well as Conceptualizer Thinking, Foresighter, Symmetrizing and Ultra-viewing methods could be noted.

This can be concluded regarding his activities within the recent years which was mainly focused on the field of thinking and thought. Some of the El-Yasin affiliated institutions such as [http://www.pmrg.ir/portal Professional Management Research Group] (PMRG) as well as [[www.prothinka.com|Association of Thinkers and Researchers]] have also been very active in discussion and transcription of Fattahi's thinking methods ever since.\n\n===Non-public Teachings===\nAnother aspect of Fattahi's teaching is focused on [[esoteric]] knowledge. It's been called ''Astronomical level'', ''ZX methods'' or Psychotechnology in which Creative Dreaming (dream making), Spiritual Communication, Teletransportation, Energy Hunting and Parallel Experiencing are taught to the trainees.<br />\nFattahi believes such trainings are not necessary for the public, therefore, he has recommended them to a limited number of his followers who have been selected and admitted by precise and strict criteria. According to Fattahi's followers, it's necessary for an esoteric apprentice to be committed to some strict rules such as keeping anonymity, protecting the mysterious techniques, avoiding the use of their abilities for personal means and complying with some unusual conditions.<ref>More information could be retrieved from [http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Aamin, vol.1], page 12</ref>\n\nRegardless to the detailed content of all above-mentioned categories, Fattahi considers the extract of his teachings in the divine phrase ''There is no deity other than Him/Her'' (La Elaha Ella Hou).<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Peyma Elahi, 1998</ref>\n\n==Lectures==\nThe first rounds of Master Elia's public lectures were begun at his age of 23 (1996) in [[Tehran]]. These lectures used to be held mostly in cultural centres and community halls and were extremely welcomed by different categories of audiences especially youth, [[students]], writers, [[intellectuals]] and [[scholars]]. \nBefore being forced to stop by the [[Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (Iran)]], the organizers had to arrange his lectures in the largest [[auditoriums]] of Tehran with the capacity for admission of thousands of people, but, those auditoriums were not spacious enough for eager audiences, therefore, further sessions were carried out with [[wikt:audio|audio]] or video playback.\n\nThose lectures were generally given in various subjects such as:\n* [[Faith]], the key of human [[salvation]]\n* [[Thinking]] and its methods\n* [[wikt:divine|Divine]] [[Parables]]\n* Calling on God\n* God is the one\n* Review and analysis of Eastern mysticism\n* Guiles and traps of the [[Devil]]\n* Observation and methods of controlling [[ego (spirituality)|ego]]\n* God's holy names\n* [[Parapsychology]] and Science of success\n* The art of [[transcendentals|transcendental]] living; the sublime life\n* God's [[blessing]], God's [[Divine grace|grace]]\n* Gratitude to God\n* Divine communication\n* Methods of [[worshiping]] and the keys to materialization of a wish\n* [[The Art of Dreaming|Dreaming]] and creative observation\n* Female-dominance or male-dominance?\n* The Superior President\n* Your attitude is determinant to your [[future]]\n* Determinative words\n* ...\n\nIn the following years, under serious pressures of the Security Office against Religions and Religious Minorities, the lectures were held less frequently. Not a day passed without direct or indirect attacks from radical [[clergies]] in their bid to control the scene of culture and religion. \nIn Spring 2005, during a lecture at the [[Shahid Shiroudi Stadium]] in Tehran, a direct and physical attack was mounted by undercover agents in a bid to harm and arrest Elia.<ref>To watch a footage of this event click [http://ostad-iliya.org/MovieEn/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=114 here] or [http://ostad-iliya.org/Movie/MoviePlayer.aspx?clp=103 here] .</ref> Although, he was not arrested as a result of participants' robust defense but this session is considered as the last public meeting of Master Elia M. Ramollah since 2005. It is worth mentioning that in winter 2007 a plan was set to hold a speech session in [[Azadi Stadium]] (Tehran) with a capacity to admit 100,000 audiences, but it was dropped due to strong disagreement of the authorities at [[Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security|Ministry of Intelligence and Security of Iran]].\n\n==From the critics' point of view==\nFattahi's name (Elia M. Ramollah) was first mentioned by [[Kayhan|''Kayhan'' newspaper]]<ref>Kayhan newspaper, 28/03/1383- Persian calendar</ref> (the organ of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]]) as a perverted character (2004).

Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn 2010, [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhouri Eslami]] newspaper published an article titled ''A God who is the 13th child of his family'' in which Fattahi was introduced as a person claiming [[deity]].<ref>Jomhouri Eslami newspaper, No. 8619, 02/03/1388- persian calendar</ref>\n\nIn brief, various calumnious accusations surfaced against Fattahi were:\nThe new [[Messiah]], [[Krishnamurti]]'s next ring, the [[Devil]], spirit of Messiah, the prophet of non-believers and non-religious, the preacher of spirituality without religion, US and Western power's agent, a preacher of negative resistance, 21st century wizard, Mahatma Elia, the second [[Gandhi]], the second [[Martin Luther|Luther]], the 3rd [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], corrupted, excommunicated, leader of American culture, a preacher of spiritual innovation and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], harbinger of so-called Elia-ism, and a deity claimant.\n\nTo address the accusations claimed by Fattahi's opponents, the 6th branch of the Special Court for Governmental Staffs was authorized to open a special case against him (2006), and recalled the possible plaintiffs through a public announcement by [[Kayhan]] to lodge their complaints.<ref>Getting familiar with a subversive sect, A. Najafi, Kayhan newspaper, 14 September 1385 \u2013 persian calendar</ref> However, the case was closed without any specific result due to lack of plaintiffs.<ref>[http://www.ettelaat.net/08-maj/news.asp?id=28905 Ettelaat Net]</ref>\n\nElia's opponents do not deny his ability and knowledge in different areas but unlike his fans who consider it as an entitlement of a divine sense, their approach is to destruct and to question his talents.\nSome of them claim that his charismatic character has its root on his childhood and the family issues he was facing combined with an essence of talent and innate genius: \n''Due to his family problems, especially mental turbulent atmosphere full of family conflicts, he was forced to quit school and became solitary and isolated.''<ref>Anonymous,''Elia, Ramollah, the Avatar and ...'', Kajraheh Supplement, Jam e Jam Newspaper, March 2007, p. 18</ref> <br />\n \nSome other opponents attribute his talents to extensive studies in various fields:\n''Later on, he began studying the metaphysics books and documents such as Psycho technology, halo vision, dreaming, Maha-meditation, energy healing and other so-called science including cosmic science. He then met some celebrities and masters in this area\u2026''<ref>same</ref>\n\n''Despite lack of formal education and classical studies, he took advantage of his talents and proportional abilities to compensate his personality defects very well.''<ref>same</ref>\n\nFattahi has responded to some of these allegations in this way:\n\n''Question: Some believe you are insane or a wizard. Why should they believe so?''\n\nAnswer: \"If I would use the opposite medicine you would use to cure the same illness, we shall, naturally, take each other for insane. It is not your fault to call me mad for you to realize the way I act, think or move is contrary to your expectations. Since you take yourself as a wise person, you will naturally call mad and insane whoever moves and thinks unlike you\u2026those who call me sorcerer and wizard want to relieve their conscience and actually assert themselves and maintain their claims.\nThey hear my teachings and get impressed and see that others are impressed as well. They observe changes and evolutions, awakenings and cries and are thus faced with divine power and holy teachings. However, they think if they accept these teachings, the colossal palace they have built in their conceit will collapse and their false and superficial rightfulness will be denounced. They believe accepting the teachings of God's Spirit jeopardizes their profits\u2026They see the divine power yet because it goes against their egoistic aspirations they attack the person and individuality of the teacher. They calumniate him and investigate his personality.\"<ref>Flow of Divine Guidance, Page 123-124</ref>\n\nThere have been several statements officially published by Elyasin Community as a response to rumors and allegations about Peyman Fattahi.<ref>These statements have originally been issued between 1990 and 1997 by the Office of Public Relations of the community and republished to clarify his followers' attitude toward those rumors. To read an extract of them click [http://www.ostad-iliya.org/Manifest/1999/ here].</ref>\n\nFattahi's devotees do believe most of these rumors and allegations have been already responded in officially issued statements, however, many of them have been actively challenging with such destructive acts specifically after the open conflicts of Iranian security service with their master and leader. They have expressed their disagreement with these demolition jobs mostly by compiling books, publishing articles, film making, and blogging and are still working on these issues.\n\nIn spite of their attempts to respond to the allegations and rumors, destructive acts by Fattahi's opponents are still ongoing, using the governmental tribunes and in form of publishing articles, circulation of free bulletins and digests, broadcasting TV serials and round-tables as well as making fake and fabricated documentaries. In Summer 2011, a report was published by Religions and Faiths Watch<ref>http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/308/1/ Corruptors and Demons!</ref> about the exhibition and fairs held by [[Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom|Qom Seminary]] and the [http://www.ido.ir/en/en-default.aspx Islamic Development Organization] (IDO). In those events, an extensive attack has been designated to happen against Green movement leaders ([[Mirhossein Mousavi|Mousavi]], [[Mehdi KARUBI|Karubi]] and [[Seyed Mohammad Khatami|Khatami]]), U.S. presidents ([[Barack Obama]] and [[George W. Bush]]), European presidents (like [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]]), some Iranian intellectuals and dissidents (such as Dr [[Abdolkarim Soroush|Soroush]], [[Mohsen Kadivar]], [[Akbar Ganji]], [[Alireza Nourizadeh]], [[Mohsen Sazegara]]). In these sets of exhibitions, further to Peyman Fattahi (known as Master Elia \u2013 the leader of Elyasin Community) some spiritual movements (such as [[Baha'i]]s and [[Dervish]]es) and spiritual leaders (such as [[Dalai Lama]], [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], Paul Twitchel \u2013 the master of [[Eckankar]] and Li Hongzhi \u2013 the master of [[Falun Dafa]]) has been targeted by Iranian extremist clergies.\n\nFurthermore, a TV programme entitled ''[[Armageddon]]'' (the final battle between the good and evil) has been broadcast by the News Channel of Islamic republic of Iran (IRINN) and other governmental media (2011). The TV series consists of 104 episodes, some of which have been replayed several times by governmental TV. According to the latest report of ''Association of Thinkers and Researcher''<ref>''The 45th attack of Iranian extremist clergies to Master Elia'' (Summary of Armageddon TV Series, episode 25), Paris Keynezhad \u2013 Senior member of Association of THikers and Researchers</ref> episode 25 begins with blatant lies and demolition jobs on Elia M. then continues doing the same against the author [[Paulo Coelho]]. It is claimed in the film that Paulo Coelho is corrupted, Satanist, Zionist and a drug addict. In another episode the narrator speaks about other famous characters and groups like [[Shimon Peres]]-the ex-prime minister and the current president of Israel and one of the pioneers of modern Zionism, [[Osho Rajneesh]] and [[Eckankar]] spiritual movement then emphasizes that the [[U.S.]] presidents, like Mr. Bush and Obama as well as the foreign minister of United States [[Hillary Clinton]], European presidents and even the Pope<ref>the world leader of catholic Christians</ref> are all [[Satanist]]s.\n\nThe 4th season of ''Armageddon'' TV programme has been replayed four times on governmental television of [[Islamic Republic of Iran]].<ref>The main subject of the other episodes of Armageddon, season 4 is as follows:\nMedia Pluralism, Satellite Channels, BBC, VOA ( in this episode it is claimed that VOA is affiliated with Zionism, Baha'i, etc), Cold Digital War (claiming that Facebook, Microsoft, Internet, etc. are all perverted and Zionistic), Rereading the History of Cinema in Iran (claiming that the cinema of Iran has its roots in Freemasons and Zionism\u2026), Zionist Cults and Terrorist Coup d'\u00e9tat-seekers (it speaks about the Baha'i's attempts to dominate Iran and their treachery and demolitions), Secular Sufis, Modern Spiritualities (claiming that Dalai Lama, Sai Baba, Osho, Krishnamurti, etc. are all perverted and hirelings and Ekankar, TSM, etc. are all Zionistic), Anarchistic Spirituality (claiming that Elia M.

A number of his close associates and followers were also arrested<ref>[[Khabarnet]], 13 July 2009</ref> including two of his brothers, Keyvan and Ramin Fattahi.\n\nIn 2004, Fattahi and his followers began to gain attention in the mainstream media, with an incendiary editorial in a hard-line national newspaper portraying Fattahi as a miscreant.<ref>[[Kayhan]], 17 June 2004</ref> Several more articles were published in hard-line newspapers since then (Resalat, Kayhan, Jam e jam, Jomhouri Eslami), with the charges leveled at Fattahi and his group taking on a more serious air. These reports and the growing magnitude of his public events may have ultimately contributed to his arrest.\n\n\"On May 27, 2007, Master Fattahi (known as Eliya M) was arrested by the \"Department against Religions and Religious Minorities\" (DARRM). He was sent to notorious security ward 209 of [[Evin prison]]. Afraid of his follower's support, the security officials were at loss to decide on jailing him. According to DARRM statement, Eliya M. was finally arrested by the decision of high-ranking religious officials. A council consist of highest-ranking religious and cleric powers of Iran decided that Eliya M. should be quietly arrested under charges of permuting the religion (Islam), proselytism, an invitation to spiritual pluralism, conspiracy against the Islamic government, renewal of religion by linking Islam, Christianity and Judaism; spiritual liberalism and incitement to the so \u0640 called American Islam and many other routine accusations that are used in these cases such as Offending sacred symbols of religion, a conspiracy by creating underground secret society and cult (Eliya \u0640 ism). But he had only one crime: he was against the Islam that calls for violence\u2026 Eliya was arrested for spiritual liberty, for a different interpretation of God's words which was against the cold stagnant understanding of religion.\".<ref>Extracted from [http://ayahra.org/en//content/view/40/36/ the first open letter of Elia's followers to leaders of the world]</ref>\n\nIn November 2007, Peyman Fattahi was released on a bail of 300 million Tomans (almost 300,000 USD) after spending six months in prison, suffering from recurrent bleeding from nose and ears, bloody vomiting and bloody urination.<ref>[[U.S Department of State]] annual report on Iran Human Rights.

Elyasin consists of a number of NGO's and publishing houses, most of which have been banned and shut time from the time of Ahmadinejad's presidency. There are some magazines affiliated to Elyasin such as ''Art of Living'', ''Esoteric Knowledge'', ''Motivators'', [[Science of Success (magazine)|''Science of Success'']], ''The Art of Transcendental Life'', and ''Sublime Thinking''. \nAvamer-e-Yasin, Science f Success, [http://www.prothinka.com Association of Thinkers and Researchers], Nature Front Association, Yasin Society of Writers and Researchers (Payam), and [http://ayahra.org/en Elyasin Human Rights and International Affairs] are some of Elyasin treaty bodies to be noted.\nIt's worth mentioning that Fattahi's followers are generally known as 'Elahioun' who can be recognized in different sub-categories such as \"Mansouroun (Elias' Offsprings)\", Iliya Supporters, The protectors of Elia M., Ghadr and Payam 1,2,3 groups, and Sina group (Psycho technology and metaphysical techniques trainees and apprentices).\nFattahi's devotees are running a number of active blogs and websites at the moment.\n\n==Written Works and confiscated books==\n'''[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Jaryane-_Hedayate-Elahi_edition-2.pdf The Flow of Divine Guidance]''' is the only published book which is a transcription of Fattahi's public speeches at the age of 23. This book has been compiled by one of his close disciples and primarily published in 1998. However, this book was banned after the first publishing. His followers claim thousands of copies of it have been printed and distributed by Fattahi's devotees inside and outside of Iran. \nThere are more than 30 books have been confiscated by Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran) including:<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/ILIYA-CV-en.pdf Victims of ruthlessness]</ref>\n\n# The \"Teachings of Truth\" canon which contains some of his speeches and lectures.\n# \"Esoteric schools and the mysterious meanings in manuscripts\"\n# \"Sublime thinking and methods of creative thinking\" (consist of thirty six methods of thinking)\n# \"Thinking Formulas and Mental Software\"(consist of more than seven hundred thinking formulas to do different works)\n# \"The Art of Sublime Struggle\"\n# [[Hezbollah]] Doctrine (The Army of God Doctrine) (on inviting Hezbollah to use flexible methods and software thinking and to avoid violence and increase tendency to love)\n# \"Universal Theories and Modern Spirituality\"\n# \"Fundamental Life patterns\"\n# \"True Intuitions and False interpretations\"\n# \"The Art of Dreaming in Elahism (creative dreaming and dream making)\"\n# \"Esoteric judgment and true justice\"\n# \"Harmonious and Disharmonic Marriage\"\n# \"Saviors of the World and Motivators\"\n# \"Fundamental Insights and Enlivening Thoughts\"\n# \"The Ancient Science of Semiotics\"(understanding the signs of the world around us)\n# \"Teaching revolutionary counseling\"\n# \"Inward Interpretations of outward verses or signs\"\n# \"Creative Look; constructive thoughts and inventive words\"\n# \"The Meanings of Nature Sounds and Birds Songs\"\n# \"The Future of the World, Civilizations and Religions\"\n# \"The Knowledge of Names and Luminous Keys\"\n# \"The Methods of Predicting future\"\n# \"Cults and Anti Cults\" (on what cults are and analyzing and controlling them)\n# \"The Correspondence\"(letters, questions, messages and recommendations to the leaders of the world, scientists and scholars)\n\n==Doctrines and Fundamental Theories==\nAccording to Fattahi's old allies a large number of [[doctrine]]s and fundamental theories have been proposed by him since 20 years ago.<ref>[http://ostad-iliya.org/Download/Amin1.pdf Ammin, vol.1], page 452-454,</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been usually suggested during public speeches and meetings as well as personal conversations and discussions on the daily routine. Then, they have been further analyzed by students who have been responsible for collecting them. Although most of these theories are esoteric-based and esoteric-oriented, they do concern all aspects of life and sometimes are linked to the details of daily life.\nThe doctrines of Sublime Struggle, Reconciliation of Civilizations, Creative Look, Harmonious Marriage, as well as the doctrine of coordination, doctrine Suprapolar Human Being (bipolar man), the doctrine of 360-degree view are some of which could be mentioned in this regard. Also, the theories of Intuitive References, Creative Review and the doctrine of Voluntary and Recurrent Death could be noted.<ref>same</ref>\n\nThese doctrines have been collected and further discussed by a number of his students in a multi-volume set of books entitled ''360 Doctrines and Comprehensive Theories''.

The twenty-first named storm of the [[2018 Pacific hurricane season]], Vicente originated from a trough of low pressure that formed within a large area of disturbed weather near [[Central America]] early on October 19. Around midday, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression, which prompted the [[National Hurricane Center]] to begin issuing advisories. Later in day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was assigned the name ''Vicente''. Despite having only been a weak tropical storm, Vicente developed an intermittent eye-like feature. Unfavorable conditions prevented strengthening until late on October 20. At that time, Vicente peaked with [[maximum sustained wind|maximum sustained winds]] of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a [[Barometric pressure|minimum central pressure]] of 1002 mbar (29.59 inHg). A day later, Vicente began to weaken due increasing wind shear before slightly restrengthening early on October 22. On October 23, Vicente weakened into a tropical depression. Later in the day, Vicente degenerated into a remnant low after making landfall in southwestern Mexico, before dissipating soon afterward.\n\nVicente caused deadly flooding and mudslides that killed 16 individuals in Mexico.\n{{clear}}\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Vicente 2018 track.png}}\nTropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex affiliated with the eastern Pacific [[monsoon trough]] and a [[tropical wave]].

Although [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] initially flared along the northern side of the wave, it gradually decreased until the wave was completely devoid of convection.

The twenty-first named storm of the [[2018 Pacific hurricane season]], Vicente originated from a trough of low pressure that formed within a large area of disturbed weather near [[Central America]] early on October 19. Around midday, the disturbance organized into a tropical depression, which prompted the [[National Hurricane Center]] to begin issuing advisories. Later in day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was assigned the name ''Vicente''. Despite having only been a weak tropical storm, Vicente developed an intermittent eye-like feature. Unfavorable conditions prevented strengthening until late on October 20. At that time, Vicente peaked with [[maximum sustained wind|maximum sustained winds]] of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a [[Barometric pressure|minimum central pressure]] of 1002 mbar (29.59 inHg). A day later, Vicente began to weaken due increasing wind shear before slightly restrengthening early on October 22. On October 23, Vicente weakened into a tropical depression. Later in the day, Vicente degenerated into a remnant low after making landfall in southwestern Mexico, before dissipating soon afterward.\n\nVicente caused deadly flooding and mudslides that killed 16 individuals in Mexico.\n{{clear}}\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Vicente 2018 track.png}}\nTropical Storm Vicente's origins can be traced back to a low-level vortex affiliated with the eastern Pacific [[monsoon trough]] and a [[tropical wave]]. The wave departed from Africa's western coast on October 6 and traveled westward across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], arriving at the [[Lesser Antilles]] around October&nbsp;14.
