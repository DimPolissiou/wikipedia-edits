These interceptors combined with dense usage results in collisions that are more probable and much more likely to inflict harm to an outside human life. In rural areas, swift-moving spooked wildlife such as [[deer]],<ref name=\"deer\"/> [[elk]], [[Moose#Vehicle collisions|moose]], and [[pronghorn|antelope]] are more likely to intercept a roadway at over 30&nbsp;mph (48 km/h).

A classic instance of this occurs when, from a visibility perspective, it would be safe to drive much faster were it not for a slower-moving vehicle ahead. As such, the dynamic ACDA is governing the basic speed rule, because in maintaining this distance, one cannot drive at a faster speed than that matching the forward vehicle. The \"time gap\" ''t''<sub>g</sub> or \"time cushion\" is the time required to travel the dynamic ACDA or \"following distance\" at the [[operating speed]].

If a vehicle cannot be controlled so as to safely remain within its lane above a certain speed and circumstance, then it is irrelevant how assuredly clear the distance is ahead.

An urban or residential street which permits a maximum speed limit of 25&nbsp;mph under its very best conditions (roadsides cleared of visual obstructions past a 20-foot maintained [[right of way]]), may in practice be unsafe to drive at more than 10&nbsp;mph within sections with utilized curbside parking. This table also suggests that the safe speed could be greater than a statutory 25&nbsp;mph posted speed, where roadside clearance is sufficient such that no \"foreseeable\" object could emerge from the proximate edge of roadside visibility, transect the cleared area, and intercept the lane before the driver could come to a halt. However, wary road design engineers may have differing views of foreseeable intercept speeds than that reflected by the 85th percentile speed chosen by the public. This can have unfortunate consequences where a mass commuting public is unfamiliar with or does not appreciate specific local hazards. Narrow lane widths are purposely used for [[traffic calming]], because careful drivers universally choose their speed depending on the roadway width.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/lane-width/ |title=Urban Street Design Guide: Lane Width |publisher=National Association of City Transportation Officials |quote=as the width of the lane increased, the speed of the roadway increased}}</ref> Standard horizontal clearances are commonly set by [[AASHTO]] guidelines or a jurisdiction's department of transportation.<ref name=\"AASHTO\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/oppd/hdm/pdf/english/chp0300.pdf |title=CAHDM |pages=300\u201325 |quote=309.1 Horizontal Clearances for Highways: The horizontal clearance to all roadside objects should be based on engineering judgment with the objective of maximizing the distance between roadside objects and the edge of traveled way.}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Safe speed as a function of horizontal clearance for 16&nbsp;km/h (10&nbsp;mph) intercept object (i.e. domestic animals)'''\n|-\n!

A road's vertical [[Geometric design of roads#Profile|profile]] must be assured to have such a curvature as not to hide hazards close behind its crests. [[Discretion]] for drivers and pedestrians to enter onto a potentially occupied lane from a side street must be assuredly eliminated such as with fences, merge lanes, or signalized access. There must also be an assurance of no opportunity for animals and debris to enter from side lots, and that there are continuous multi-hourly maintenance [[highway patrol|patrols]] performed. Furthermore, such road sections must be distinguished from other roads so that the driver could clearly and immediately know when he or she may or may not take such extended \"assurance.\" Few roads might meet these requirements except some of the highest functional classification [[controlled-access highways]] such as [[freeways]] and [[autobahn]]s.<ref name=\"FHWA\"/>\n\nEven if such criteria are met, the law must also exempt driver liability for maintaining clear distance ahead. In most democracies, such liability for failures of the distance to remain clear beyond line of sight would ultimately be transferred to its taxpayers.<ref name=\"Kenworthy\"/> This only generally occurs when governments have been tasked by constituents or their courts to take the responsibly to design and maintain roadways that \"assure\" the distance will be clear beyond the proximate edge of clear visibility.

An urban or residential street which permits a maximum speed limit of 25&nbsp;mph under its very best conditions (roadsides cleared of visual obstructions past a 20-foot maintained [[right of way]]), may in practice be unsafe to drive at more than 10&nbsp;mph within sections with utilized curbside parking. This table also suggests that the safe speed could be greater than a statutory 25&nbsp;mph posted speed, where roadside clearance is sufficient such that no \"foreseeable\" object could emerge from the proximate edge of roadside visibility, transect the cleared area, and intercept the lane before the driver could come to a halt. However, wary road design engineers may have differing views of foreseeable intercept speeds than that reflected by the 85th percentile speed chosen by the public. This can have unfortunate consequences where a mass commuting public is unfamiliar with or does not appreciate specific local hazards. Narrow lane widths are purposely used for [[traffic calming]], because careful drivers universally choose their speed depending on the roadway width.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nacto.org/publication/urban-street-design-guide/street-design-elements/lane-width/ |title=Urban Street Design Guide: Lane Width |publisher=National Association of City Transportation Officials |quote=as the width of the lane increased, the speed of the roadway increased}}</ref> Standard horizontal clearances are commonly set by [[AASHTO]] guidelines or a jurisdiction's department of transportation.<ref name=\"AASHTO\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/oppd/hdm/pdf/english/chp0300.pdf |title=CAHDM |pages=300\u201325 |quote=309.1 Horizontal Clearances for Highways: The horizontal clearance to all roadside objects should be based on engineering judgment with the objective of maximizing the distance between roadside objects and the edge of traveled way.}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Safe speed as a function of horizontal clearance for 16&nbsp;km/h (10&nbsp;mph) intercept object (i.e. domestic animals)'''\n|-\n!
