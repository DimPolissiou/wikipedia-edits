First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination). Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.<ref name=\"Chen Strych Hotez Bottazzi p.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen WH, Strych U, Hotez PJ, Bottazzi ME | title=The SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Pipeline: an Overview | journal=Current Tropical Medicine Reports | date=3 March 2020 | pages=1\u20134 |doi=10.1007/s40475-020-00201-6 |doi-access=free | pmid=32219057 | pmc=7094941 | name-list-format = vanc}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in [[Seattle]].

He appeared in commercials and hosted shows like the ''Ignite Gospel Music Festival'' and ''Jam'' on television.\n\n* '''Japs Mendoza''' ''(Vocals, lead guitar) is a former painter who had learned [[guitar]], also got started in show business through a talent contest. He joined MACIPRISA, an inter-school singing contest in [[Bulacan]]. The experience encouraged him to consider singing as a career, so he uploaded his performance videos to [[YouTube]] and watched them in order to find and correct his mistakes. He soon felt confident enough to audition for ''[[The Voice of the Philippines]]'' and was picked by [[Lea Salonga]]. \n\n* '''Chael Adriano''' ''(Bass guitar, backing vocals)'' is an engineer.\n\n* '''RJ Cruz''' ''(Acoustic guitar, backing vocals)'' is a freshman college student at [[De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde]].\n\n* '''Joshua Coronel''' ''(Drums)'' is now married.\n\n'''Former members''' \n* '''Jiad Arroyo''' first appeared in the Gandang Lalake segment on variety show ''[[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]''.

He could possibly have achieved anything he wanted to with assistance from his father but preferred to pursue success in his own way. His initial experience was in the theater, with roles in the musicals ''Ibong Adarna'' and ''Saranggola Ni Pepe''. De Mesa has his own clothing line called Felipe after his departure from the band.\n\n* '''Daniel Grospe''' started as an actor, after winning an acting contest in ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' This gained him entry into acting workshops and a role on GMA's ''[[Saang Sulok ng Langit]]'' television series. Frustrated over the slow pace of his career, he went back to music, playing the [[drums]], first in church and then later with the pop-jazz group Southwind. Then, as one of the finalists in TV5's ''[[Kanta Pilipinas]]'', he got the chance to interpret the song \"Kesa\" in the first [[Philippine Popular Music Festival|Philpop Music Festival]].

Jiad Arroyo was a founding member, along with Daniel Grospe. Carl Guevara, Japs Mendoza, and Jason de Mesa joined later.\n\nThe band was initially named at a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] shortly after a [[One Direction]] concert, where the boys were mulling the British boy band's popularity. They were initially called the D\u2019 Juans, after Juan De La Cruz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filipinosingers.com/the-juans/|title=The Juans|publisher=filipinosingers.com|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Band members==\n'''Current members'''\n* '''Carl Guevara''' ''(Lead vocals, keybords)'' studied music production at the [[De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde]] and was a Top 12 finalist in the musical reality show on GMA Network's ''Ride to Fame''. He worked in theater and appeared in musicals including ''Kelly Kelly ang Hit na Musical'', ''Batang Rizal'', ''Lola Basyang'' and ''[[Peter Pan]]''. He appeared in commercials and hosted shows like the ''Ignite Gospel Music Festival'' and ''Jam'' on television.\n\n* '''Japs Mendoza''' ''(Vocals, lead guitar) is a former painter who had learned [[guitar]], also got started in show business through a talent contest. He joined MACIPRISA, an inter-school singing contest in [[Bulacan]]. The experience encouraged him to consider singing as a career, so he uploaded his performance videos to [[YouTube]] and watched them in order to find and correct his mistakes. He soon felt confident enough to audition for ''[[The Voice of the Philippines]]'' and was picked by [[Lea Salonga]]. \n\n* '''Chael Adriano''' ''(Bass guitar, backing vocals)'' is an engineer.\n\n* '''RJ Cruz''' ''(Acoustic guitar, backing vocals)'' is a freshman college student at [[De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde]].\n\n* '''Joshua Coronel''' ''(Drums)'' is now married.\n\n'''Former members''' \n* '''Jiad Arroyo''' first appeared in the Gandang Lalake segment on variety show ''[[It's Showtime (variety show)|It's Showtime]]''. He achieved first runner-up in the competition and earned valuable insights into the intricacies of show business. Arroyo is a self-taught guitarist, studying YouTube tutorials and subsequently learned from his bandmates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chikka-nessavenue.com/2015/08/the-juans-more-than-just-boy-band.html?m=1|title=\"The Juans\" More Than Just A Boy Band|author=Albert Bryan S.

His father was the late [[Rico J. Puno]], one of the country's greatest singers and entertainers. He could possibly have achieved anything he wanted to with assistance from his father but preferred to pursue success in his own way. His initial experience was in the theater, with roles in the musicals ''Ibong Adarna'' and ''Saranggola Ni Pepe''. De Mesa has his own clothing line called Felipe after his departure from the band.\n\n* '''Daniel Grospe''' started as an actor, after winning an acting contest in ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' This gained him entry into acting workshops and a role on GMA's ''[[Saang Sulok ng Langit]]'' television series. Frustrated over the slow pace of his career, he went back to music, playing the [[drums]], first in church and then later with the pop-jazz group Southwind. Then, as one of the finalists in TV5's ''[[Kanta Pilipinas]]'', he got the chance to interpret the song \"Kesa\" in the first [[Philippine Popular Music Festival|Philpop Music Festival]]. The opportunity gave Daniel the Awit Award for Best Performance as New Male Artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2016/07/13/1602136/meet-juans/amp/|title=Meet The Juans|author=Baby A.
