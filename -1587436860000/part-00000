Relatively little-known for a half-century after its introduction, it achieved iconic status in the [[post-war period]] as the preferred typeface of many [[Switzerland|Swiss]] graphic designers in what became called the [[International Typographic Style|'International' or 'Swiss' design style]] which became popular across the [[Western world]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Its simple, neutral design has also influenced many later typefaces.

He decides to be honest with her before their relationship goes any further. Their conversation prompts Dan to get in contact with Samantha.<ref name=\"Married\"/> Tucker said, \"Dan realises he has got a few things to sort out with his ex.

During an interview with the charity she stated: \"I think they've done a great job, the writers really did their research beforehand; they spent time with people who have bipolar disorder, and worked closely with SANE Australia. They haven't glossed over it.\"<ref name=\"sane\"/> ''Neighbours<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' executive producer [[Susan Bower]] said that it was important to represent the character dealing with bipolar disorder accurately.<ref name=\"Peace\"/> She also said that any health condition had to be \"properly researched\", as they did not want to give viewers any misinformation.

Samantha claims not to know about the wedding and tells Dan that he is about to become a father. [[Elle Robinson]] ([[Pippa Black]]) offers Samantha a room at her house and Libby tries to be nice by inviting her to a barbecue. When Libby sees Dan feel the baby kick, she calls off the wedding. It later emerges that [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) had told Samantha about the wedding. Samantha asks [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) for a job and he employs her as a legal adviser for his newspaper. When Libby turns up at Samantha's ultrasound scan, Samantha tells Dan that she does not want Libby involved with her baby. [[Cassandra Freedman]] ([[Tottie Goldsmith]]) moves into Ramsay Street and when she sets her sights on Paul, she sees Samantha as a threat. Cassandra gets a job at the hospital and she reads Samantha's file and decides to blackmail her about her bipolar disorder. Samantha finds out that her baby was conceived three weeks later than she had thought and therefore is not Dan's. Cassandra begins her blackmail plan and Samantha blurts out that she had not known that Dan was not the father of the baby. Cassandra gets Samantha to convince her daughter, [[Donna Freedman|Donna]] ([[Margot Robbie]]), to move out of the Robinsons' house. As Samantha and Cassandra are discussing her secret, [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) overhears and tells Libby and Dan the truth about Samantha's baby. Dan confronts Samantha and she tells him that the baby is not his. Samantha then leaves Erinsborough.\n\nSamantha later calls Dan, while suffering a manic episode and asks him to look after her and her newborn daughter, Emma. Dan agrees and he and Libby go to New Zealand. Libby returns alone as Dan agrees to stay for another week. Libby discovers Dan has transferred $12,000 of their money into Samantha's bank account, to help with her debts. On Dan's return, Libby makes him promise not to have any further contact with Samantha.\n\nA year later, when [[Charlie Hoyland]] (Jacob Brito) wanders off during Halloween, Samantha finds him and runs into Steph, Lucas and [[Lyn Scully]] ([[Janet Andrewartha]]). Lucas and Samantha talk and she tells him that she is good. Steph thanks Samantha for finding Charlie and Samantha tells her that she has been to see Dan and [[Adam Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Adam]]. Lyn asks Samantha what brings her back to town and Samantha tells her that she is there to prosecute Steph's culpable driving case. The next day, Samantha goes to see Donna and says that she is sorry that her husband, [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]), is dead. Samantha asks Donna if they can meet, but Donna turns her down. Samantha later sees Donna's university lecturer fail her assignment and asks if she can buy her and [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) tea. Samantha talks to Kate about her witness statement and when she goes to Ramsay Street to talk to Paul, she sees Libby. Samantha tells [[Karl Kennedy|Karl]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) and [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she has recently lost her father and that she is sorry for what she did to them. Lucas then asks her to leave everyone alone. Libby warns Sam to stay away from her parents and Samantha tells her that Dan is a new man now he is a father. Steph takes her away and tells her to back off. Samantha later gives Steph some leaflets about children in prison. Toadie tells Samantha that he will report her to the police and [[bar association]] for witness intimidation. Paul meets her in Charlie's and tells her that he wants to help Samantha out and he will give her anything she wants. Samantha later tells Paul that he needs to get Donna to attend the trial to upset Steph. However, Donna later realises what Paul is doing. Samantha asks Karl and Susan to write victim impact statements and when she notices something is up between the couple, she talks to Susan and tells her that she will find out if something is wrong. When Libby is on the stand, Sam brings up Steph's relationship with Dan. Samantha then launches a personal attack on Libby and [[List of Neighbours characters (2010)#Judge Nerida Willow|Judge Willow]] ([[Jane Clifton]]) tells her to stop. The jury later deliver a guilty verdict. Donna has a go at Samantha and says that the case was never about Ringo, but a chance for her to get back at Libby and Steph. The judge later gives Steph a six year prison sentence.\n\nTen years later, Samantha meets with Claudia Watkins, who wants custody of her granddaughter [[Aster Conway]] (Scout Bowman). Claudia tells Sam that Aster's mother, Elly Conway is unemployed and about to face trial for murder. Sam is happy to take on the case, as Elly is Susan Kennedy's niece. Sam explains her history with the Kennedys and how she believes that they exploited her mental health issues, prompting her departure from Melbourne. Sam later returned to the city and is now a partner in a law firm. When Claudia asks who will care for Aster if Elly goes to jail, Sam replies that it will mostly likely be the Kennedys and Elly's sister. Sam then tells Claudia that they need to cast doubt on their suitability.\n\n==Reception==\nDuring Samantha's first appearance the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' called her a \"blonde beauty.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dan+is+desperate%3b+NEIGHBOURS+WEEKDAYS%2c+CH5%2c+5.35pm.-a0179795010|title=Dan is desperate|date=7 June 2008|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> A year later they said \"We know we're supposed to feel sorry for people who are ill, but can somebody just tell Dan's ex-wife Sam to get knotted?\"<ref name=\"SoapStories\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0212008566|title=Soap stories|date=14 November 2009|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> The paper revealed that they had \"high hopes\" that Samantha was gone for good, but she had turned up again \"like the proverbial bad penny.\"<ref name=\"SoapStories\"/> Television critic, Andrew Mercado, praised Buchanan's 2009 appearance in March 2010, saying \"Simone Buchanan did a great turn last year on ''Neighbours'' as a crazed ex\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mercadotv.com.au/?p=54|title=Make Things Right with the Hey Dad Actors\u2026|last=Mercado|first=Andrew|date=29 March 2010|publisher=mercadoTV|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Neighbours characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzgerald, Samantha}}\n[[Category:Neighbours characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with bipolar disorder]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=July 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = Neighbours\n|image= Samantha Fitzgerald.JPG\n|imagesize= 200px\n|name= Samantha Fitzgerald\n|portrayer= [[Simone Buchanan]]\n|introducer= {{plainlist|\n*Ric Pellizzeri and [[Susan Bower]] (2008)\n*Susan Bower (2010)\n*[[Jason Herbison]] (2020)\n}} \n|years= 2008\u20132010, 2020\n|classification= [[List of Neighbours characters#Recurring and guest characters|Current; recurring]] \n|first= {{start date|2008|3|21|df=y}}\n|last= <!--{{end date|2010|11|24|df=y}}-->\n|home = [[New Zealand]]\n|occupation= Lawyer<br />Newspaper legal advisor\n|husband = [[Daniel Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Daniel Fitzgerald]] (2002\u20132008)\n|daughters = Emma Fitzgerald \n}}\n'''Samantha \"Sam\" Fitzgerald''' is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', played by [[Simone Buchanan]].

Samantha claims not to know about the wedding and tells Dan that he is about to become a father. [[Elle Robinson]] ([[Pippa Black]]) offers Samantha a room at her house and Libby tries to be nice by inviting her to a barbecue. When Libby sees Dan feel the baby kick, she calls off the wedding. It later emerges that [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) had told Samantha about the wedding. Samantha asks [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) for a job and he employs her as a legal adviser for his newspaper. When Libby turns up at Samantha's ultrasound scan, Samantha tells Dan that she does not want Libby involved with her baby. [[Cassandra Freedman]] ([[Tottie Goldsmith]]) moves into Ramsay Street and when she sets her sights on Paul, she sees Samantha as a threat. Cassandra gets a job at the hospital and she reads Samantha's file and decides to blackmail her about her bipolar disorder. Samantha finds out that her baby was conceived three weeks later than she had thought and therefore is not Dan's. Cassandra begins her blackmail plan and Samantha blurts out that she had not known that Dan was not the father of the baby. Cassandra gets Samantha to convince her daughter, [[Donna Freedman|Donna]] ([[Margot Robbie]]), to move out of the Robinsons' house. As Samantha and Cassandra are discussing her secret, [[Stephanie Scully]] ([[Carla Bonner]]) overhears and tells Libby and Dan the truth about Samantha's baby. Dan confronts Samantha and she tells him that the baby is not his. Samantha then leaves Erinsborough.\n\nSamantha later calls Dan, while suffering a manic episode and asks him to look after her and her newborn daughter, Emma. Dan agrees and he and Libby go to New Zealand. Libby returns alone as Dan agrees to stay for another week. Libby discovers Dan has transferred $12,000 of their money into Samantha's bank account, to help with her debts. On Dan's return, Libby makes him promise not to have any further contact with Samantha.\n\nA year later, when [[Charlie Hoyland]] (Jacob Brito) wanders off during Halloween, Samantha finds him and runs into Steph, Lucas and [[Lyn Scully]] ([[Janet Andrewartha]]). Lucas and Samantha talk and she tells him that she is good. Steph thanks Samantha for finding Charlie and Samantha tells her that she has been to see Dan and [[Adam Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Adam]]. Lyn asks Samantha what brings her back to town and Samantha tells her that she is there to prosecute Steph's culpable driving case. The next day, Samantha goes to see Donna and says that she is sorry that her husband, [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]), is dead. Samantha asks Donna if they can meet, but Donna turns her down. Samantha later sees Donna's university lecturer fail her assignment and asks if she can buy her and [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) tea. Samantha talks to Kate about her witness statement and when she goes to Ramsay Street to talk to Paul, she sees Libby. Samantha tells [[Karl Kennedy|Karl]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) and [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she has recently lost her father and that she is sorry for what she did to them. Lucas then asks her to leave everyone alone. Libby warns Sam to stay away from her parents and Samantha tells her that Dan is a new man now he is a father. Steph takes her away and tells her to back off. Samantha later gives Steph some leaflets about children in prison. Toadie tells Samantha that he will report her to the police and [[bar association]] for witness intimidation. Paul meets her in Charlie's and tells her that he wants to help Samantha out and he will give her anything she wants. Samantha later tells Paul that he needs to get Donna to attend the trial to upset Steph. However, Donna later realises what Paul is doing. Samantha asks Karl and Susan to write victim impact statements and when she notices something is up between the couple, she talks to Susan and tells her that she will find out if something is wrong. When Libby is on the stand, Sam brings up Steph's relationship with Dan. Samantha then launches a personal attack on Libby and [[List of Neighbours characters (2010)#Judge Nerida Willow|Judge Willow]] ([[Jane Clifton]]) tells her to stop. The jury later deliver a guilty verdict. Donna has a go at Samantha and says that the case was never about Ringo, but a chance for her to get back at Libby and Steph. The judge later gives Steph a six year prison sentence.\n\nTen years later, Samantha meets with Claudia Watkins, who wants custody of her granddaughter [[Aster Conway]] (Scout Bowman). Claudia tells Sam that Aster's mother, Elly Conway is unemployed and about to face trial for murder. Sam is happy to take on the case, as Elly is Susan Kennedy's niece. Sam explains her history with the Kennedys and how she believes that they exploited her mental health issues, prompting her departure from Melbourne. Sam later returned to the city and is now a partner in a law firm. When Claudia asks who will care for Aster if Elly goes to jail, Sam replies that it will mostly likely be the Kennedys and Elly's sister. Sam then tells Claudia that they need to cast doubt on their suitability.\n\n==Reception==\nDuring Samantha's first appearance the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' called her a \"blonde beauty.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dan+is+desperate%3b+NEIGHBOURS+WEEKDAYS%2c+CH5%2c+5.35pm.-a0179795010|title=Dan is desperate|date=7 June 2008|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> A year later they said \"We know we're supposed to feel sorry for people who are ill, but can somebody just tell Dan's ex-wife Sam to get knotted?\"<ref name=\"SoapStories\">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+stories.-a0212008566|title=Soap stories|date=14 November 2009|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref> The paper revealed that they had \"high hopes\" that Samantha was gone for good, but she had turned up again \"like the proverbial bad penny.\"<ref name=\"SoapStories\"/> Television critic, Andrew Mercado, praised Buchanan's 2009 appearance in March 2010, saying \"Simone Buchanan did a great turn last year on ''Neighbours'' as a crazed ex\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mercadotv.com.au/?p=54|title=Make Things Right with the Hey Dad Actors\u2026|last=Mercado|first=Andrew|date=29 March 2010|publisher=mercadoTV|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Neighbours characters|past}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzgerald, Samantha}}\n[[Category:Neighbours characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with bipolar disorder]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "JuneGloom07", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Fitzgerald"}
