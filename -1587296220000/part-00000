It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but appears in a wide range of coat colors and patterns. Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. Their personalities are also very similar. Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. They often remain playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing [[Fetch (game)|fetch]]. Despite their slender appearance, they are athletic and can leap into high places. They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human interaction. Unlike the breed's blue-eyed forebear, Orientals are usually green-eyed.<ref name=ticaOS/> The [[Oriental Longhair]] differs only with respect to coat length.

The [[gene]] that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (solid). When the cats from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as \"non-blue eyed Siamese\" or \"foreign shorthair\". Other breeds that were developed from the [[landrace]] cats of Thailand include the [[Havana Brown]] (which some breed registries classify as simply an Oriental Shorthair variant) and the [[Korat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuddlykittens.com/2011/10/information-regarding-the-oriental-shorthair-cat/|title=Information Regarding the Oriental Shorthair Cat|date=October 16, 2011|publisher=Cuddly Kittens|accessdate=February 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Oriental Shorthair was accepted as an actual breed for championship competition in the US-headquartered CFA in 1977.<ref name=\"CFA profile\" /> In 1985, the CFA recognized the bicolor variant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfa.org/Breeds/BreedsKthruR/Oriental.aspx|title=Breed Profile: The Oriental|first=Cat Fanciers|last=Association|website=Cfa.org|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> Two decades later, the breed was finally recognized by the [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Governing Council of the Cat Fancy]] (GCCF) in 1997, but with some differences from CFA on coat conformation.<ref name=\"Palantir\" /> GCCF publishes separate breed registration policies for a number of specific-coat Oriental Shorthair variants today.<ref name=\"GCCF Breeds\" />  The [[Germany]]-based [[World Cat Federation]] (WCF) recognizes the breed, but with color requirements that are comparatively unrestrictive in some way, but notably opposed to white (\"All colours and patterns without white and without points are recognized.\")<ref name=\"WCF std\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wcf-online.de/WCF-EN/standard/siam/orientale.html  |title=Oriental Shorthair |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 1, 2010 |work=WCF-Online.de |publisher=World Cat Federation |location=Essen, Germany |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA), some of the [[Point coloration|point-colored]] offspring from Oriental Shorthair parents are considered \"any other variety\" (AOV), but depending on the pedigree, some may compete as Colorpoints.<ref name=\"CFA profile\" /> In [[The International Cat Association]] (TICA) and many other [[Cat fancy|cat fancier and breeder]] associations, these cats are considered to be, and compete as, Siamese, when recognized at all.\n\n== Patterns ==\n[[File:BlackWhiteOrientalShorthair.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Black and white bicolor female]]\n[[File:OSH 24-CH Clamoris Epeius (Omar).JPG|thumb|left|180px|Red spotted tabby]]\n[[File:Ticked Oriental Shorthair.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ebony silver-ticked tabby male kitten]]\n\n{{see also|Cat coat genetics}}\nIn total, over 300 coat color and pattern combinations are possible under CFA conformation rules.<ref name=\"CFA profile\" />  The basic types include:\n*Solid : The coat color is uniform across the entire cat.

The [[gene]] that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (solid). When the cats from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as \"non-blue eyed Siamese\" or \"foreign shorthair\".

Legend has it that before the fight, the barely literate Louis wrote his name so large that there was no room for his last name, and thus became known as \"Joe Louis\" for the remainder of his boxing career. More likely, Louis simply omitted his last name to keep his boxing a secret from his mother. After this debut\u2014a loss to future Olympian Johnny Miler\u2014Louis compiled numerous amateur victories, eventually winning the club championship of his Brewster Street recreation centre, the home of many aspiring [[Golden Gloves]] fighters.\n\nIn 1933, Louis won the Detroit-area Golden Gloves Novice Division championship against Joe Biskey for the light heavyweight classification. He later lost in the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. The next year, competing in the Golden Gloves' Open Division, he won the light heavyweight classification, this time also winning the Chicago Tournament of Champions. However, a hand injury forced Louis to miss the New York/Chicago Champions' cross-town bout for the ultimate Golden Gloves championship. In April 1934, he followed up his [[Chicago]] performance by winning the [[United States national amateur boxing championships|United States Amateur Champion National AAU tournament]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\nBy the end of his amateur career, Louis's record was 50\u20133, with 43 knockouts.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nJoe Louis had only three losses in his 69 professional fights. He tallied 52 knockouts and held the championship from 1937 to 1949, the longest span of any heavyweight titleholder. After returning from retirement, Louis failed to regain the championship in 1950, and his career ended after he was knocked out by [[Rocky Marciano]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nagler |first=Barney |title=Joe Louis The Brown Bomber |url=http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |work=Sport Magazine Article |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028161153/http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |archivedate=October 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n\nLouis's amateur performances attracted the interest of professional promoters, and he was soon represented by a black Detroit-area bookmaker named John Roxborough. As Louis explained in his autobiography, Roxborough convinced the young fighter that white managers would have no real interest in seeing a black boxer work his way up to title contention:\n\n<blockquote>[Roxborough] told me about the fate of most black fighters, ones with white managers, who wound up burned-out and broke before they reached their prime. The white managers were not interested in the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn't take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular. \n</blockquote>\n  \nRoxborough knew a Chicago area boxing promoter named Julian Black who already had a stable of mediocre boxers against which Louis could hone his craft, this time in the heavyweight division. After becoming part of the management team, Black hired fellow Chicago native Jack \"Chappy\" Blackburn as Louis's trainer. Louis' initial professional fights were all in the Chicago area, his professional debut coming on July 4, 1934, against Jack Kracken in the Bacon Casino on Chicago's south side. Louis earned $59 for knocking out Kracken in the first round. $59.00 in 1934 is equivalent to $1,148.60 in 2020 dollars. Louis won all 12 of his professional fights that year, 10 by knockout.\n\nIn September 1934, while promoting a Detroit-area \"coming home\" bout for Louis against Canadian Alex Borchuk, Roxborough was pressured by members of the Michigan State Boxing Commission to have Louis sign with white management. Roxborough refused and continued advancing Louis's career with bouts against heavyweight contenders Art Sykes and Stanley Poreda.\n\nWhen training for a fight against Lee Ramage, Louis noticed a young female secretary for the black newspaper at the gym. After Ramage was defeated, the secretary, Marva Trotter, was invited to the celebration party at Chicago's Grand Hotel. Trotter later became Louis's first wife in 1935.\n\nDuring this time, Louis also met [[Truman Gibson]], the man who would become his personal lawyer. As a young associate at a law firm hired by Julian Black, Gibson was charged with personally entertaining Louis during the pendency of business deals.\n\n===Title contention===\nAlthough Louis' management was finding him bouts against legitimate heavyweight contenders, no path to the title was forthcoming. While professional boxing was not officially segregated, many white Americans had become wary of the prospect of another black champion in the wake of [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s highly unpopular (among whites) \"reign\" atop the heavyweight division.<ref name=deardorff>{{cite news |url=http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |title=Joe Louis became both a black hero and a national symbol to whites after overcoming racism in the media |date=October 1, 1995 |work=St. Louis Journalism Review |last=Deardorff, II |first=Don |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226224232/http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |archivedate=February 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  During an era of severe anti-black repression, Jack Johnson's unrepentant masculinity and marriage to a white woman engendered an enormous backlash that greatly limited opportunities of black fighters in the heavyweight division. Black boxers were denied championship bouts, and there were few heavyweight black contenders at the time, though there were African Americans who fought for titles in other weight divisions, and a few notable black champions, such as [[Tiger Flowers]]. Louis and his handlers would counter the legacy of Johnson by emphasizing the Brown Bomber's modesty and sportsmanship.<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Erenberg|Erenberg]], p. 33.</ref> Biographer Gerald Astor stated that \"Joe Louis' early boxing career was stalked by the specter of Jack Johnson\".<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Astor|Astor]], p. 47.</ref>\n\nIf Louis were to rise to national prominence among such cultural attitudes, a change in management would be necessary. In 1935, boxing promoter [[Mike Jacobs (boxing)|Mike Jacobs]] sought out Louis' handlers. After Louis' narrow defeat of Natie Brown on March 29, 1935, Jacobs and the Louis team met at the Frog Club, a black nightclub, and negotiated a three-year exclusive boxing promotion deal.<ref>[[#Vitale|Vitale]], pp. 91\u201392.</ref> The contract, however, did not keep Roxborough and Black from attempting to cash in as Louis' managers; when Louis turned 21 on May 13, 1935, Roxborough and Black each signed Louis to an onerous long-term contract that collectively dedicated half of Louis' future income to the pair.<ref name=pbsrox>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fight/peopleevents/p_managers.html |title=American Experience: John Roxborough and Julian Black |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBlack and Roxborough continued to carefully and deliberately shape Louis' media image. Mindful of the tremendous public backlash Johnson had suffered for his unapologetic attitude and flamboyant lifestyle, they drafted \"Seven Commandments\" for Louis' personal conduct. These included:\n\n<blockquote>\n*Never have his picture taken with a white woman\n*Never gloat over a fallen opponent\n*Never engage in fixed fights\n*Live and fight clean<ref name=espn>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016109.html |first=Larry |last=Schwartz |title='Brown Bomber' was a hero to all |accessdate=April 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8iSImJVDkb8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22joe+louis%22+biography |title=Muhammed Ali: A Biography |last=Edmonds |first=Anthony O. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33092-6 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs a result, Louis was generally portrayed in the white media as a modest, clean-living person, which facilitated his burgeoning celebrity status.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8iSImJVDkb8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22joe+louis%22+biography |title=Muhammed Ali: A Biography |last=Edmonds |first=Anthony O. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33092-6 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |page=9}}</ref>\n\nWith the backing of major promotion, Louis fought thirteen times in 1935. The bout that helped put him in the media spotlight occurred on June 25, when Louis knocked out 6'6\", 265-pound former world heavyweight champion [[Primo Carnera]] in six rounds. Foreshadowing the Louis\u2013Schmeling rivalry to come, the Carnera bout featured a political dimension. Louis' victory over Carnera, who symbolized [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in the popular eye, was seen as a victory for the international community, particularly among African Americans, who were sympathetic to [[Ethiopia]], which was attempting to maintain its independence by [[Abyssinia Crisis|fending off an invasion by fascist Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Reader's Companion to American History |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton-Mifflin |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KrWDw-_devcC&pg=PA680&dq=%22joe+louis%22 |editor1=Eric Foner |editor2=John A.

[[#Bak|Bak]], pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n \t\nHelping the white press to overcome its reluctance to feature a black contender was the fact that in the mid-1930s boxing desperately needed a marketable hero. Since the retirement of [[Jack Dempsey]] in 1929, the sport had devolved into a sordid mixture of poor athletes, gambling, fixed fights, thrown matches, and control of the sport by organized crime.<ref name=deardorff/> ''[[New York Times]]'' Columnist Edward Van Ness wrote, \"Louis ... is a boon to boxing. Just as Dempsey led the sport out of the doldrums ... so is Louis leading the boxing game out of a slump.\"<ref name=deardorff/> Likewise, biographer [[Bill Libby]] asserted that \"The sports world was hungry for a great champion when Louis arrived in New York in 1935.\"<ref name=deardorff/><ref name=\"Libbyp61\">[[Joe Louis#Libby|Libby]], p. 61.</ref>\n\t  \t\nWhile the mainstream press was beginning to embrace Louis, many still opposed the prospect of another black heavyweight champion. In September 1935, on the eve of Louis' fight with former titleholder [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] sportswriter [[Shirley Povich]] wrote about some Americans' hopes for the white contender, \"They say Baer will surpass himself in the knowledge that he is the lone white hope for the defense of Nordic superiority in the prize ring.\"<ref name=\"deardorff\" /> However, the hopes of white suprematists would soon be dashed.\n\nAlthough Baer had been knocked down only once before in his professional career (by [[Frankie Campbell]]), Louis dominated the former champion, knocking him out in the fourth round. Unknowingly, Baer suffered from a unique disadvantage in the fight; earlier that evening, Louis had married Marva Trotter at a friend's apartment and was eager to end the fight in order to consummate the relationship.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 94.</ref> Later that year, Louis also knocked out [[Paolino Uzcudun]], who had never been knocked down before.\n\n===Louis vs. Schmeling I===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Louis vs. Schmeling, 1936]]\n{{Main|Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling}}\n\nBy this time, Louis was ranked as the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |title=Joe Louis Barrow: Boxing Day Tribute |first=Stoker |last=MacIntosh |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612022722/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |archivedate=June 12, 2009 }}</ref> and had won the [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Associated Press' \"Athlete of the Year\"]] award for 1935.<ref name=jrank>{{cite web |url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/2931/Louis-Joe-Brown-Bomber.html |title=JRank.org: Joe Louis \u2013 the brown bomber |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> What was considered to be a final tune-up bout before an eventual title shot was scheduled for June 1936 against [[Max Schmeling]].

Braddock]], who had unexpectedly defeated [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] for the heavyweight title the previous June. [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] (MSG) had a contract with Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock\u2013Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock's manager [[Joe Gould (manager)|Joe Gould]] had been planning a Braddock\u2013Louis matchup for months.<ref name=Schaap>Schaap, p. 271.</ref> \n[[File:Joe Louis cph.3b09981.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis in 1937]]\nSchmeling's victory gave Gould tremendous leverage, however.  If he were to offer Schmeling the title chance instead of Louis, there was a very real possibility that Nazi authorities would never allow Louis a shot at the title.<ref name=Schaap/> Gould's demands were therefore onerous: Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis's future bouts) for ten years.<ref name=Bakp127/> Braddock and Gould would eventually receive more than $150,000 from this arrangement.<ref name=Bakp127/> Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937.<ref name=Bakp127>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 127.</ref> Figuring that the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] would not sanction the fight in deference to MSG and Schmeling, Jacobs scheduled the fight for Chicago.<ref name=Bakp127/>\n\nEach of the parties involved worked to facilitate the controversial Braddock\u2013Louis matchup. Louis did his part by knocking out former champion [[Jack Sharkey]] on August 18, 1936. Meanwhile, Gould trumped up anti-Nazi sentiment against Schmeling,<ref name=Bakp128>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 128.</ref> and Jacobs defended a lawsuit by MSG to halt the Braddock\u2013Louis fight. A federal court in [[Newark, New Jersey]], eventually ruled that Braddock's contractual obligation to stage his title defense at MSG was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration.<ref name=Bakp128/>\n\nThe stage was set for Louis's title shot. On the night of the fight, June 22, 1937, Braddock was able to knock Louis down in round one, but afterward could accomplish little. After inflicting constant punishment, Louis defeated Braddock in round eight, knocking him out cold with a strong right hand that busted James' teeth through his gum shield and lip and sent him to the ground for a few minutes. It was the first and only time that Braddock was knocked out (the one other stoppage of Braddock's career was a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] due to a cut). Louis's ascent to the world heavyweight championship was complete.\n\nLouis's victory was a seminal moment in African American history. Thousands of African Americans stayed up all night across the country in celebration.<ref name=matters/> Noted author and member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] [[Langston Hughes]] described Louis's effect in these terms:\n\n<blockquote>Each time Joe Louis won a fight in those depression years, even before he became champion, thousands of black Americans on relief or [[Works Progress Administration|W.P.A.]], and poor, would throng out into the streets all across the land to march and cheer and yell and cry because of Joe's one-man triumphs. No one else in the United States has ever had such an effect on Negro emotions\u2014or on mine. I marched and cheered and yelled and cried, too.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3m1hM1JrpV8C&pg=PA307 |page=307 |title=Autobiography: The Collected Works of Langston Hughes, Vol. 14 |editor=Joseph McLaren |last= Hughes |first=Langston |isbn=978-0-8262-1434-8 |year=2002 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |location=Columbia, Missouri}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Initial title defenses===\nDespite his championship, Louis was haunted by the earlier defeat to Schmeling. Shortly after winning the title, he was quoted as saying, \"I don't want to be called champ until I whip Max Schmeling.\"<ref name=hbo/> Louis's manager Mike Jacobs attempted to arrange a rematch in 1937, but negotiations broke down when Schmeling demanded 30% of the gate.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 113.</ref> When Schmeling instead attempted to arrange for a fight against British Empire champion [[Tommy Farr]], known as the \"Tonypandy Terror\",\u2014ostensibly for a world championship to rival the claims of American boxing authorities\u2014Jacobs outmaneuvered him, offering Farr a guaranteed $60,000 to fight Louis instead. The offer was too lucrative for Farr to turn down.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nOn August 30, 1937, after a postponement of four days due to rain, Louis and Farr finally touched gloves at New York's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] before a crowd of approximately 32,000.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 115.</ref> Louis fought one of the hardest battles of his life. The bout was closely contested and went the entire 15 rounds, with Louis being unable to knock Farr down. Referee Arthur Donovan was even seen shaking Farr's hand after the bout, in apparent congratulation.<ref name=Mylerp116>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 116.</ref> Nevertheless, after the score was announced, Louis had won a controversial unanimous decision.<ref name=Mylerp116/><ref>{{Cite news\n |last        = Bennison\n |first       = Bill\n |title       = Joe Louis vs Tommy Farr\n |newspaper   = Evening Standard (N.Y.)\n |date        = 1937-08-31\n |url         = http://www.boxinggyms.com/news/louis_farr1937/standard_louis1937rounds.htm\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130118183350/http://www.boxinggyms.com/news/louis_farr1937/standard_louis1937rounds.htm\n |archivedate = January 18, 2013\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the scene thus: \"After collecting the judges' votes, referee Arthur Donovan announced that Louis had won the fight on points.

Seven years later, in his published account of the fight, Donovan spoke of the \"mistake\" that may have led to this confusion. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As Tommy walked back to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I followed him and seized his glove. \"Tommy, a wonderful perform\u2014\" I began ... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I had given him the fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. \"No! No! No!\" realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground ... That's the last time my emotions will get the better of me in a prize fight! There was much booing at the announced result, but, as I say it, it was all emotional.

Schmeling's hotel was picketed by anti-Nazi protesters in the days before the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nOn the night of June 22, 1938, Louis and Schmeling met for the second time in the boxing ring. The fight was held in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 70,043. It was broadcast by radio to millions of listeners throughout the world, with radio announcers reporting on the fight in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Before the bout, Schmeling weighed in at 193&nbsp;pounds; Louis weighed in at 198\u00be&nbsp;pounds.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nThe fight lasted two minutes and four seconds.<ref name=ring/> Louis battered Schmeling with a series of swift attacks, forcing him against the ropes and giving him a paralyzing body blow (Schmeling afterward claimed it was an illegal kidney punch). Schmeling was knocked down three times and only managed to throw two punches in the entire bout. On the third knockdown, Schmeling's trainer threw in the towel and referee Arthur Donovan stopped the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\n===\"Bum of the Month Club\"===\nIn the 29 months from January 1939 through May 1941, Louis defended his title thirteen times, a frequency unmatched by any heavyweight champion since the end of the bare-knuckle era.

In his autobiography, Joe Louis said:\n\n<blockquote>I made a mistake going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them to say in the papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as possible so I could weigh in under 200&nbsp;pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.<ref name=eastside2/>\n</blockquote>\n\nConn had the better of the fight through 12 rounds, although Louis was able to stun Conn with a left hook in the fifth, cutting his eye and nose. By the eighth round, Louis began suffering from dehydration. By the twelfth round, Louis was exhausted, with Conn ahead on two of three boxing scorecards. But against the advice of his corner, Conn continued to closely engage Louis in the later stages of the fight. Louis made the most of the opportunity, knocking Conn out with two seconds left in the thirteenth round.<ref name=eastside2/>\n\nThe contest created an instant rivalry that Louis's career had lacked since the Schmeling era, and a rematch with Conn was planned for late 1942.

When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, he said: \"Lots of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain't going to fix them.\" In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical ''[[This Is the Army]]'', directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. He appeared as himself in a musical number, \"The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem,\" which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.\n\nLouis's celebrity power was not, however, merely directed toward African Americans. In a famous wartime recruitment slogan, he echoed his prior comments of 1942: \"We'll win, because we're on God's side.\" The publicity of the campaign made Louis widely popular stateside, even outside the world of sports.<ref name=matters/> Never before had white Americans embraced a black man as their representative to the world.<ref name=matters/>\n\nAlthough Louis never saw combat, his military service saw challenges of its own. During his travels, he often experienced blatant racism. On one occasion, a military policeman (MP) ordered Louis and Ray Robinson to move their seats to a bench in the rear of an Alabama Army camp bus depot. \"We ain't moving\", said Louis. The MP tried to arrest them, but Louis forcefully argued the pair out of the situation.<ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 238</ref> In another incident, he allegedly had to resort to bribery to persuade a commanding officer to drop charges against Jackie Robinson for punching a captain who had called Robinson a \"nigger.\"<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 12\"/>\n\nLouis was eventually promoted to the rank of [[technical sergeant]] on April 9, 1945. On September 23 of the same year, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] (a military decoration rarely awarded to enlisted soldiers) for \"incalculable contribution to the general morale.\"<ref name=afmuseum/><ref name=answers/> Receipt of the honor qualified him for immediate release from military service on October 1, 1945.<ref name=arlington/><ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Later career and retirement===\nLouis emerged from his wartime service significantly in debt. In addition to his looming tax bill\u2014which had not been finally determined at the time, but was estimated at greater than $100,000<ref name=si1985/>\u2014Jacobs claimed that Louis owed him $250,000.<ref>[[#Ginson|Gibson]], p. 236.</ref>\n\nDespite the financial pressure on Louis to resume boxing, his long-awaited rematch against Billy Conn had to be postponed to the summer of 1946, when weather conditions could accommodate a large outdoor audience. On June 19, a disappointing 40,000 saw the rematch at Yankee Stadium,<ref name=si1985/> in which Louis was not seriously tested. Conn, whose skills had deteriorated during the long layoff, largely avoided contact until being dispatched by knockout in the eighth round. Although the attendance did not meet expectations, the fight was still the most profitable of Louis's career to date. His share of the purse was $600,000, of which Louis' managers got $140,000, his ex-wife $66,000 and the U.S. state of New York $30,000.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nAfter trouble finding another suitable opponent, on December 5, 1947, Louis met [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], a 33-year-old veteran with a 44\u201311\u20132 record. Walcott entered the fight as a 10-to-1 underdog. Nevertheless, Walcott knocked down Louis twice in the first four rounds. Most observers in Madison Square Garden felt Walcott dominated the 15-round fight. When Louis was declared the winner in a split decision, the crowd booed.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis was under no delusion about the state of his boxing skills, yet he was too embarrassed to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213\u00bd, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis would not defend his title again before announcing his retirement from boxing on March 1, 1949.<ref name=cyber/> In his bouts with Conn and Walcott, it had become apparent that Louis was no longer the fighter he had once been. As he had done earlier in his career, however, Louis would continue to appear in numerous exhibition matches worldwide.<ref name=arlington/><ref name=cyber>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jlouis.htm |title=CyberBoxingZone.com:Joe Louis' Professional and exhibition/sparring records |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> In August 1949 [[Cab Calloway]] rendered homage to the \u201cking of the ring\u201d with his song ''Ol\u2019 Joe Louis''.<ref>Cab Calloway in Chronology, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe80N5Snxmo&list=OLAK5uy_nb5sgXFO6MktnBBkpadhGVAL8InutwBPE&index=4&t=0s ''Ol' Joe Louis (08-18-49)''].</ref>\n\n===Post-retirement comeback===\nAt the time of Louis's initial retirement, the IRS was still completing its investigation of his prior tax returns, which had always been handled by Mike Jacobs's personal accountant.<ref>Gibson, p. 243.</ref> In May 1950, the IRS finished a full audit of Louis's past returns and announced that, with interest and penalties, he owed the government more than $500,000.<ref name=si1985/> Louis had no choice but to return to the ring.\n\nAfter asking Gibson to take over his personal finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles,<ref name=ring/><ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 488.</ref> the Louis camp negotiated a deal with the IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with [[Ezzard Charles]]\u2014who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott\u2014was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling.<ref name=ring/> He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458.<ref name=ring>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fightersfactory.com/story_detail.php?i=33 |title=Joe Louis \u2013 The man who reigned as champion longer than any boxer in modern history |journal=The Ring |date=November 1980 |postscript=<!--None--> }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Louis had to continue fighting.\n\nAfter facing several club-level opponents and scoring an early knockout victory over EBU champion [[Lee Savold]] (also defeating top contender [[Jimmy Bivins]] by unanimous decision), the International Boxing Club guaranteed Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender [[Rocky Marciano]] on October 26, 1951.<ref name=si1985/> Despite his being a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance.<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070332/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php |date=August 9, 2012 }}</ref> Marciano himself was reluctant to participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: \"This is the last guy on earth I want to fight.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Levine |first=Ben |url=http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411100138/http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Over the ropes |work=The Muehlenberg (College) Weekly |date=October 23, 2008 }}</ref> It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury.

He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949, and is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. Nicknamed the '''Brown Bomber''', Louis' championship reign lasted 140 consecutive months, during which he participated in 26 championship fights. The 27th fight, against [[Ezzard Charles]] in 1950, was a challenge for Charles' heavyweight title and so is not included in Louis' reign.

His mother attempted to get him interested in playing the violin.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 22.</ref> A classic story is that he tried to hide his pugilistic ambitions from his mother by carrying his boxing gloves inside his violin case.\n\nLouis made his debut in early 1932 at the age of 17. Legend has it that before the fight, the barely literate Louis wrote his name so large that there was no room for his last name, and thus became known as \"Joe Louis\" for the remainder of his boxing career. More likely, Louis simply omitted his last name to keep his boxing a secret from his mother. After this debut\u2014a loss to future Olympian Johnny Miler\u2014Louis compiled numerous amateur victories, eventually winning the club championship of his Brewster Street recreation centre, the home of many aspiring [[Golden Gloves]] fighters.\n\nIn 1933, Louis won the Detroit-area Golden Gloves Novice Division championship against Joe Biskey for the light heavyweight classification. He later lost in the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions. The next year, competing in the Golden Gloves' Open Division, he won the light heavyweight classification, this time also winning the Chicago Tournament of Champions. However, a hand injury forced Louis to miss the New York/Chicago Champions' cross-town bout for the ultimate Golden Gloves championship. In April 1934, he followed up his [[Chicago]] performance by winning the [[United States national amateur boxing championships|United States Amateur Champion National AAU tournament]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\nBy the end of his amateur career, Louis's record was 50\u20133, with 43 knockouts.\n\n==Professional career==\n\nJoe Louis had only three losses in his 69 professional fights. He tallied 52 knockouts and held the championship from 1937 to 1949, the longest span of any heavyweight titleholder. After returning from retirement, Louis failed to regain the championship in 1950, and his career ended after he was knocked out by [[Rocky Marciano]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nagler |first=Barney |title=Joe Louis The Brown Bomber |url=http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |work=Sport Magazine Article |accessdate=December 5, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028161153/http://www.thesportgallery.com/blog/sport-articles/the-brown-bomber-2/ |archivedate=October 28, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n\nLouis's amateur performances attracted the interest of professional promoters, and he was soon represented by a black Detroit-area bookmaker named John Roxborough. As Louis explained in his autobiography, Roxborough convinced the young fighter that white managers would have no real interest in seeing a black boxer work his way up to title contention:\n\n<blockquote>[Roxborough] told me about the fate of most black fighters, ones with white managers, who wound up burned-out and broke before they reached their prime. The white managers were not interested in the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn't take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular. \n</blockquote>\n  \nRoxborough knew a Chicago area boxing promoter named Julian Black who already had a stable of mediocre boxers against which Louis could hone his craft, this time in the heavyweight division. After becoming part of the management team, Black hired fellow Chicago native Jack \"Chappy\" Blackburn as Louis's trainer. Louis' initial professional fights were all in the Chicago area, his professional debut coming on July 4, 1934, against Jack Kracken in the Bacon Casino on Chicago's south side. Louis earned $59 for knocking out Kracken in the first round. $59.00 in 1934 is equivalent to $1,148.60 in 2020 dollars. Louis won all 12 of his professional fights that year, 10 by knockout.\n\nIn September 1934, while promoting a Detroit-area \"coming home\" bout for Louis against Canadian Alex Borchuk, Roxborough was pressured by members of the Michigan State Boxing Commission to have Louis sign with white management. Roxborough refused and continued advancing Louis's career with bouts against heavyweight contenders Art Sykes and Stanley Poreda.\n\nWhen training for a fight against Lee Ramage, Louis noticed a young female secretary for the black newspaper at the gym. After Ramage was defeated, the secretary, Marva Trotter, was invited to the celebration party at Chicago's Grand Hotel. Trotter later became Louis's first wife in 1935.\n\nDuring this time, Louis also met [[Truman Gibson]], the man who would become his personal lawyer. As a young associate at a law firm hired by Julian Black, Gibson was charged with personally entertaining Louis during the pendency of business deals.\n\n===Title contention===\nAlthough Louis' management was finding him bouts against legitimate heavyweight contenders, no path to the title was forthcoming. While professional boxing was not officially segregated, many white Americans had become wary of the prospect of another black champion in the wake of [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]]'s highly unpopular (among whites) \"reign\" atop the heavyweight division.<ref name=deardorff>{{cite news |url=http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |title=Joe Louis became both a black hero and a national symbol to whites after overcoming racism in the media |date=October 1, 1995 |work=St. Louis Journalism Review |last=Deardorff, II |first=Don |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160226224232/http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social-assistance-lifestyle/ethnicity-race-racism/1285818-1.html |archivedate=February 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  During an era of severe anti-black repression, Jack Johnson's unrepentant masculinity and marriage to a white woman engendered an enormous backlash that greatly limited opportunities of black fighters in the heavyweight division. Black boxers were denied championship bouts, and there were few heavyweight black contenders at the time, though there were African Americans who fought for titles in other weight divisions, and a few notable black champions, such as [[Tiger Flowers]]. Louis and his handlers would counter the legacy of Johnson by emphasizing the Brown Bomber's modesty and sportsmanship.<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Erenberg|Erenberg]], p. 33.</ref> Biographer Gerald Astor stated that \"Joe Louis' early boxing career was stalked by the specter of Jack Johnson\".<ref name=deardorff/><ref>[[#Astor|Astor]], p. 47.</ref>\n\nIf Louis were to rise to national prominence among such cultural attitudes, a change in management would be necessary. In 1935, boxing promoter [[Mike Jacobs (boxing)|Mike Jacobs]] sought out Louis' handlers. After Louis' narrow defeat of Natie Brown on March 29, 1935, Jacobs and the Louis team met at the Frog Club, a black nightclub, and negotiated a three-year exclusive boxing promotion deal.<ref>[[#Vitale|Vitale]], pp. 91\u201392.</ref> The contract, however, did not keep Roxborough and Black from attempting to cash in as Louis' managers; when Louis turned 21 on May 13, 1935, Roxborough and Black each signed Louis to an onerous long-term contract that collectively dedicated half of Louis' future income to the pair.<ref name=pbsrox>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/fight/peopleevents/p_managers.html |title=American Experience: John Roxborough and Julian Black |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBlack and Roxborough continued to carefully and deliberately shape Louis' media image. Mindful of the tremendous public backlash Johnson had suffered for his unapologetic attitude and flamboyant lifestyle, they drafted \"Seven Commandments\" for Louis' personal conduct. These included:\n\n<blockquote>\n*Never have his picture taken with a white woman\n*Never gloat over a fallen opponent\n*Never engage in fixed fights\n*Live and fight clean<ref name=espn>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016109.html |first=Larry |last=Schwartz |title='Brown Bomber' was a hero to all |accessdate=April 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8iSImJVDkb8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22joe+louis%22+biography |title=Muhammed Ali: A Biography |last=Edmonds |first=Anthony O. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33092-6 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |pages=8\u20139}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAs a result, Louis was generally portrayed in the white media as a modest, clean-living person, which facilitated his burgeoning celebrity status.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8iSImJVDkb8C&pg=PA8&dq=%22joe+louis%22+biography |title=Muhammed Ali: A Biography |last=Edmonds |first=Anthony O. |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-313-33092-6 |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Incorporated |page=9}}</ref>\n\nWith the backing of major promotion, Louis fought thirteen times in 1935. The bout that helped put him in the media spotlight occurred on June 25, when Louis knocked out 6'6\", 265-pound former world heavyweight champion [[Primo Carnera]] in six rounds. Foreshadowing the Louis\u2013Schmeling rivalry to come, the Carnera bout featured a political dimension. Louis' victory over Carnera, who symbolized [[Benito Mussolini]]'s regime in the popular eye, was seen as a victory for the international community, particularly among African Americans, who were sympathetic to [[Ethiopia]], which was attempting to maintain its independence by [[Abyssinia Crisis|fending off an invasion by fascist Italy]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Reader's Companion to American History |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton-Mifflin |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KrWDw-_devcC&pg=PA680&dq=%22joe+louis%22 |editor1=Eric Foner |editor2=John A.

[[#Bak|Bak]], pp. 81\u201382.</ref>\n \t\nHelping the white press to overcome its reluctance to feature a black contender was the fact that in the mid-1930s boxing desperately needed a marketable hero. Since the retirement of [[Jack Dempsey]] in 1929, the sport had devolved into a sordid mixture of poor athletes, gambling, fixed fights, thrown matches, and control of the sport by organized crime.<ref name=deardorff/> ''[[New York Times]]'' Columnist Edward Van Ness wrote, \"Louis ... is a boon to boxing.

In September 1935, on the eve of Louis' fight with former titleholder [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post'']] sportswriter [[Shirley Povich]] wrote about some Americans' hopes for the white contender, \"They say Baer will surpass himself in the knowledge that he is the lone white hope for the defense of Nordic superiority in the prize ring.\"<ref name=\"deardorff\" /> However, the hopes of white suprematists would soon be dashed.\n\nAlthough Baer had been knocked down only once before in his professional career (by [[Frankie Campbell]]), Louis dominated the former champion, knocking him out in the fourth round. Unknowingly, Baer suffered from a unique disadvantage in the fight; earlier that evening, Louis had married Marva Trotter at a friend's apartment and was eager to end the fight in order to consummate the relationship.<ref>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 94.</ref> Later that year, Louis also knocked out [[Paolino Uzcudun]], who had never been knocked down before.\n\n===Louis vs. Schmeling I===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Louis vs. Schmeling, 1936]]\n{{Main|Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling}}\n\nBy this time, Louis was ranked as the No. 1 contender in the heavyweight division<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |title=Joe Louis Barrow: Boxing Day Tribute |first=Stoker |last=MacIntosh |accessdate=January 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612022722/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/96920-joe-louis-barrow-boxing-day-tribute |archivedate=June 12, 2009 }}</ref> and had won the [[Associated Press Athlete of the Year|Associated Press' \"Athlete of the Year\"]] award for 1935.<ref name=jrank>{{cite web |url=http://sports.jrank.org/pages/2931/Louis-Joe-Brown-Bomber.html |title=JRank.org: Joe Louis \u2013 the brown bomber |accessdate=April 29, 2009}}</ref> What was considered to be a final tune-up bout before an eventual title shot was scheduled for June 1936 against [[Max Schmeling]].

Braddock]], who had unexpectedly defeated [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]] for the heavyweight title the previous June. [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Madison Square Garden]] (MSG) had a contract with Braddock for the title defense and also sought a Braddock\u2013Schmeling title bout. But Jacobs and Braddock's manager [[Joe Gould (manager)|Joe Gould]] had been planning a Braddock\u2013Louis matchup for months.<ref name=Schaap>Schaap, p. 271.</ref> \n[[File:Joe Louis cph.3b09981.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Louis in 1937]]\nSchmeling's victory gave Gould tremendous leverage, however.  If he were to offer Schmeling the title chance instead of Louis, there was a very real possibility that Nazi authorities would never allow Louis a shot at the title.<ref name=Schaap/> Gould's demands were therefore onerous: Jacobs would have to pay 10% of all future boxing promotion profits (including any future profits from Louis's future bouts) for ten years.<ref name=Bakp127/> Braddock and Gould would eventually receive more than $150,000 from this arrangement.<ref name=Bakp127/> Well before the actual fight, Jacobs and Gould publicly announced that their fighters would fight for the heavyweight title on June 22, 1937.<ref name=Bakp127>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 127.</ref> Figuring that the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] would not sanction the fight in deference to MSG and Schmeling, Jacobs scheduled the fight for Chicago.<ref name=Bakp127/>\n\nEach of the parties involved worked to facilitate the controversial Braddock\u2013Louis matchup. Louis did his part by knocking out former champion [[Jack Sharkey]] on August 18, 1936. Meanwhile, Gould trumped up anti-Nazi sentiment against Schmeling,<ref name=Bakp128>[[#Bak|Bak]], p. 128.</ref> and Jacobs defended a lawsuit by MSG to halt the Braddock\u2013Louis fight. A federal court in [[Newark, New Jersey]], eventually ruled that Braddock's contractual obligation to stage his title defense at MSG was unenforceable for lack of mutual consideration.<ref name=Bakp128/>\n\nThe stage was set for Louis's title shot. On the night of the fight, June 22, 1937, Braddock was able to knock Louis down in round one, but afterward could accomplish little. After inflicting constant punishment, Louis defeated Braddock in round eight, knocking him out cold with a strong right hand that busted James' teeth through his gum shield and lip and sent him to the ground for a few minutes. It was the first and only time that Braddock was knocked out (the one other stoppage of Braddock's career was a [[Technical knockout|TKO]] due to a cut). Louis's ascent to the world heavyweight championship was complete.\n\nLouis's victory was a seminal moment in African American history. Thousands of African Americans stayed up all night across the country in celebration.<ref name=matters/> Noted author and member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]] [[Langston Hughes]] described Louis's effect in these terms:\n\n<blockquote>Each time Joe Louis won a fight in those depression years, even before he became champion, thousands of black Americans on relief or [[Works Progress Administration|W.P.A.]], and poor, would throng out into the streets all across the land to march and cheer and yell and cry because of Joe's one-man triumphs.

Shortly after winning the title, he was quoted as saying, \"I don't want to be called champ until I whip Max Schmeling.\"<ref name=hbo/> Louis's manager Mike Jacobs attempted to arrange a rematch in 1937, but negotiations broke down when Schmeling demanded 30% of the gate.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 113.</ref> When Schmeling instead attempted to arrange for a fight against British Empire champion [[Tommy Farr]], known as the \"Tonypandy Terror\",\u2014ostensibly for a world championship to rival the claims of American boxing authorities\u2014Jacobs outmaneuvered him, offering Farr a guaranteed $60,000 to fight Louis instead. The offer was too lucrative for Farr to turn down.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], pp. 113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nOn August 30, 1937, after a postponement of four days due to rain, Louis and Farr finally touched gloves at New York's [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] before a crowd of approximately 32,000.<ref>[[#Myler|Myler]], p. 115.</ref> Louis fought one of the hardest battles of his life.

Seven years later, in his published account of the fight, Donovan spoke of the \"mistake\" that may have led to this confusion. He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>As Tommy walked back to his corner after shaking Louis' hand, I followed him and seized his glove. \"Tommy, a wonderful perform\u2014\" I began ... Then I dropped his hand like a red-hot coal! He had started to raise his arm. He thought I had given him the fight and the world championship! I literally ran away, shaking my head and shouting. \"No! No! No!\" realising how I had raised his hopes for a few seconds only to dash them to the ground ...

A few weeks before the bout, Louis visited the White House, where President [[Franklin D.

Schmeling's hotel was picketed by anti-Nazi protesters in the days before the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nOn the night of June 22, 1938, Louis and Schmeling met for the second time in the boxing ring. The fight was held in Yankee Stadium before a crowd of 70,043. It was broadcast by radio to millions of listeners throughout the world, with radio announcers reporting on the fight in English, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. Before the bout, Schmeling weighed in at 193&nbsp;pounds; Louis weighed in at 198\u00be&nbsp;pounds.<ref name=hbo/>\n\nThe fight lasted two minutes and four seconds.<ref name=ring/> Louis battered Schmeling with a series of swift attacks, forcing him against the ropes and giving him a paralyzing body blow (Schmeling afterward claimed it was an illegal kidney punch). Schmeling was knocked down three times and only managed to throw two punches in the entire bout. On the third knockdown, Schmeling's trainer threw in the towel and referee Arthur Donovan stopped the fight.<ref name=hbo/>\n\n===\"Bum of the Month Club\"===\nIn the 29 months from January 1939 through May 1941, Louis defended his title thirteen times, a frequency unmatched by any heavyweight champion since the end of the bare-knuckle era. The pace of his title defenses, combined with his convincing wins, earned Louis' opponents from this era the collective nickname \"Bum of the Month Club\".<ref name=espn/> Notables of this lambasted pantheon include:\n\n* world light heavyweight champion [[John Henry Lewis]] who, attempting to move up a weight class, was knocked out in the first round by Louis on January 25, 1939.<ref name=eastside/>\n* \"Two Ton\" [[Tony Galento]], who was able to knock Louis to the canvas with a left hook in the third round of their bout on June 28, 1939, before letting his guard down and being knocked out in the fourth.<ref name=eastside/>\n* Chilean [[Arturo Godoy]], whom Louis fought twice in 1940, on February 9 and June 20.

Of the 12 fighters Louis faced during this period, five were rated by ''The Ring'' as top-10 heavyweights in the year they fought Louis: Galento (overall #2 heavyweight in 1939), Bob Pastor (#3, 1939), Godoy (#3, 1940), Simon (#6, 1941) and Baer (#8, 1941); four others (Musto, Dorazio, Burman and Johnny Paychek) were ranked in the top 10 in a different year.<ref>See BoxRec.com's record of ''The Ring'' magazine's ratings for [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1938 1938], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1939 1939], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1940 1940], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1941 1941], [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1942 1942], and [http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1943 1943].</ref>\n\n===Billy Conn fight===\nLouis' string of lightly regarded competition ended with his bout against [[Billy Conn]], the light heavyweight champion and a highly regarded contender.

In his autobiography, Joe Louis said:\n\n<blockquote>I made a mistake going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them to say in the papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight I did a little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as possible so I could weigh in under 200&nbsp;pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.<ref name=eastside2/>\n</blockquote>\n\nConn had the better of the fight through 12 rounds, although Louis was able to stun Conn with a left hook in the fifth, cutting his eye and nose. By the eighth round, Louis began suffering from dehydration. By the twelfth round, Louis was exhausted, with Conn ahead on two of three boxing scorecards. But against the advice of his corner, Conn continued to closely engage Louis in the later stages of the fight. Louis made the most of the opportunity, knocking Conn out with two seconds left in the thirteenth round.<ref name=eastside2/>\n\nThe contest created an instant rivalry that Louis's career had lacked since the Schmeling era, and a rematch with Conn was planned for late 1942.

Slowly, the press began to eliminate its stereotypical racial references when covering Louis and instead treated him as an unqualified sports hero.<ref name=deardorff/> Despite the public relations boon, Louis's charitable fights proved financially costly. Although he saw none of the roughly $90,000 raised by these and other charitable fights, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] later credited these amounts as taxable income paid to Louis.<ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], pp. 234\u2013235.</ref> After the war, the IRS pursued the issue.\n\nFor basic training, Louis was assigned to a segregated cavalry unit based in [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].

When he was asked about his decision to enter the racially segregated U.S. Army, he said: \"Lots of things wrong with America, but Hitler ain't going to fix them.\" In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical ''[[This Is the Army]]'', directed by [[Michael Curtiz]]. He appeared as himself in a musical number, \"The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem,\" which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.\n\nLouis's celebrity power was not, however, merely directed toward African Americans. In a famous wartime recruitment slogan, he echoed his prior comments of 1942: \"We'll win, because we're on God's side.\" The publicity of the campaign made Louis widely popular stateside, even outside the world of sports.<ref name=matters/> Never before had white Americans embraced a black man as their representative to the world.<ref name=matters/>\n\nAlthough Louis never saw combat, his military service saw challenges of its own. During his travels, he often experienced blatant racism. On one occasion, a military policeman (MP) ordered Louis and Ray Robinson to move their seats to a bench in the rear of an Alabama Army camp bus depot. \"We ain't moving\", said Louis. The MP tried to arrest them, but Louis forcefully argued the pair out of the situation.<ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 238</ref> In another incident, he allegedly had to resort to bribery to persuade a commanding officer to drop charges against Jackie Robinson for punching a captain who had called Robinson a \"nigger.\"<ref name=\"Gibson, p. 12\"/>\n\nLouis was eventually promoted to the rank of [[technical sergeant]] on April 9, 1945. On September 23 of the same year, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]] (a military decoration rarely awarded to enlisted soldiers) for \"incalculable contribution to the general morale.\"<ref name=afmuseum/><ref name=answers/> Receipt of the honor qualified him for immediate release from military service on October 1, 1945.<ref name=arlington/><ref>[[#Gibson|Gibson]], p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Later career and retirement===\nLouis emerged from his wartime service significantly in debt. In addition to his looming tax bill\u2014which had not been finally determined at the time, but was estimated at greater than $100,000<ref name=si1985/>\u2014Jacobs claimed that Louis owed him $250,000.<ref>[[#Ginson|Gibson]], p. 236.</ref>\n\nDespite the financial pressure on Louis to resume boxing, his long-awaited rematch against Billy Conn had to be postponed to the summer of 1946, when weather conditions could accommodate a large outdoor audience. On June 19, a disappointing 40,000 saw the rematch at Yankee Stadium,<ref name=si1985/> in which Louis was not seriously tested. Conn, whose skills had deteriorated during the long layoff, largely avoided contact until being dispatched by knockout in the eighth round. Although the attendance did not meet expectations, the fight was still the most profitable of Louis's career to date. His share of the purse was $600,000, of which Louis' managers got $140,000, his ex-wife $66,000 and the U.S. state of New York $30,000.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nAfter trouble finding another suitable opponent, on December 5, 1947, Louis met [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], a 33-year-old veteran with a 44\u201311\u20132 record. Walcott entered the fight as a 10-to-1 underdog. Nevertheless, Walcott knocked down Louis twice in the first four rounds. Most observers in Madison Square Garden felt Walcott dominated the 15-round fight. When Louis was declared the winner in a split decision, the crowd booed.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis was under no delusion about the state of his boxing skills, yet he was too embarrassed to quit after the Walcott fight. Determined to win and retire with his title intact, Louis signed on for a rematch. On June 25, 1948, about 42,000 people came to Yankee Stadium to see the aging champion, who weighed 213\u00bd, the heaviest of his career to date. Walcott knocked Louis down in the third round, but Louis survived to knock out Walcott in the eleventh.<ref name=si1985/>\n\nLouis would not defend his title again before announcing his retirement from boxing on March 1, 1949.<ref name=cyber/> In his bouts with Conn and Walcott, it had become apparent that Louis was no longer the fighter he had once been. As he had done earlier in his career, however, Louis would continue to appear in numerous exhibition matches worldwide.<ref name=arlington/><ref name=cyber>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jlouis.htm |title=CyberBoxingZone.com:Joe Louis' Professional and exhibition/sparring records |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref> In August 1949 [[Cab Calloway]] rendered homage to the \u201cking of the ring\u201d with his song ''Ol\u2019 Joe Louis''.<ref>Cab Calloway in Chronology, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe80N5Snxmo&list=OLAK5uy_nb5sgXFO6MktnBBkpadhGVAL8InutwBPE&index=4&t=0s ''Ol' Joe Louis (08-18-49)''].</ref>\n\n===Post-retirement comeback===\nAt the time of Louis's initial retirement, the IRS was still completing its investigation of his prior tax returns, which had always been handled by Mike Jacobs's personal accountant.<ref>Gibson, p. 243.</ref> In May 1950, the IRS finished a full audit of Louis's past returns and announced that, with interest and penalties, he owed the government more than $500,000.<ref name=si1985/> Louis had no choice but to return to the ring.\n\nAfter asking Gibson to take over his personal finances and switching his management from Jacobs and Roxborough to Marshall Miles,<ref name=ring/><ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 488.</ref> the Louis camp negotiated a deal with the IRS under which Louis would come out of retirement, with all Louis's net proceeds going to the IRS. A match with [[Ezzard Charles]]\u2014who had acquired the vacant heavyweight title in June 1949 by outpointing Walcott\u2014was set for September 27, 1950. By then, Louis was 36 years old and had been away from competitive boxing for two years. Weighing in at 218, Louis was still strong, but his reflexes were gone. Charles repeatedly beat him to the punch. By the end of the fight, Louis was cut above both eyes, one of which was shut tight by swelling.<ref name=ring/> He knew he had lost even before Charles was declared the winner. The result was not the only disappointing aspect of the fight for Louis; only 22,357 spectators paid to witness the event at Yankee Stadium, and his share of the purse was a mere $100,458.<ref name=ring>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fightersfactory.com/story_detail.php?i=33 |title=Joe Louis \u2013 The man who reigned as champion longer than any boxer in modern history |journal=The Ring |date=November 1980 |postscript=<!--None--> }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Louis had to continue fighting.\n\nAfter facing several club-level opponents and scoring an early knockout victory over EBU champion [[Lee Savold]] (also defeating top contender [[Jimmy Bivins]] by unanimous decision), the International Boxing Club guaranteed Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender [[Rocky Marciano]] on October 26, 1951.<ref name=si1985/> Despite his being a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance.<ref>[http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070332/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/boxing-news/mccoy2404.php |date=August 9, 2012 }}</ref> Marciano himself was reluctant to participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: \"This is the last guy on earth I want to fight.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Levine |first=Ben |url=http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411100138/http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/media/storage/paper300/news/2008/10/23/Sports/Over-The.Ropes-3506639.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Over the ropes |work=The Muehlenberg (College) Weekly |date=October 23, 2008 }}</ref> It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury.

It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table.\n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]]. Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.\n\nThe film has been controversial and received largely polarized reviews, with some critics calling the film a religious classic while others found the extreme violence distracting and excessive, and claimed that the film promoted [[antisemitism]].<ref name=EW /><ref name=tomatoes >{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passion_of_the_christ/|title=''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004)|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref><ref name=metacritic>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/passionofthechrist|title= ''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004): reviews|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> The film grossed over $622 million worldwide<ref name=\"POTC TN\"/> and became the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|seventh-highest-grossing film]] domestically at the end of its theatrical run.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It is currently the highest-grossing [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian Movies at the Box Office|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref> It received three nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]] in 2005, for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Gibson|first=Mel|title=The Passion of the Christ|date=February 25, 2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/awards?ref_=tt_awd|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late hours of the night at the forested garden of Gethsemane, at the height of his cause, Jesus prays while his disciples Saint Peter, James, son of Zebedee James, and John the Evangelist sleep. While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas (as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth). After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified.\n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Aleksander Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C. DiMare 2011 {{ISBN|1-59884-296-X}} page 909</ref>\n\nHowever, Brentano's attribution of the book ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' to Emmerich has been subject to dispute, with allegations that Brentano wrote much of the book himself; a Vatican investigation concluding that: \"It is absolutely not certain that she ever wrote this\".<ref name=Anvil >Emmerich, Anne Catherine, and Clemens Brentano.

Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic.

It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table.\n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]].

While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas (as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth). After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified.\n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies.

Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C.

Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic.

This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004. Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film.\n\nGibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including [[Jonathan Morris (priest)|Fr.

In the first, Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem (at the eighth station of the cross) and falls to the ground as the women wail around him, and [[Simon of Cyrene]] attempts to hold up the cross and help up Jesus simultaneously. Afterwards, while both are holding up the cross, Jesus says to the women weeping for him, \"Do not weep for me, but for yourselves and for your children\". In the second, Pilate washes his hands, turns to Caiaphas, and says: \"Look you to it\" (i.e., the Pharisees wish to have Jesus crucified). Pilate then turns to Abanader and says: \"Do as they wish\". The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\", in Latin and Hebrew. He then holds the board above his head in full view of Caiaphas, who after reading it challenges Pilate on its content. Pilate replies angrily to Caiaphas in non-subtitled Hebrew.

It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest [[Caiaphas]], who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

The Giffard family had been settled at Chillington since the late 12th century.<ref name=vchmanors>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53395#s3 Victoria County History, volume 5, chapter 8, s.3.]</ref>\n\nLittle is known of his early life. He married Jane Horde, daughter of [[Bridgnorth]]'s wealthiest landowner, in 1483, when he was about 17 years old. About the age of 20, in 1486, his father Robert died and he inherited the substantial Giffard estates, centred on Brewood.\n\nIt is thought that Thomas Horde, his father-in-law might have advanced his career, perhaps introducing him at the [[royal court]] during the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]. Certainly he was well enough known there to be present in 1509 at Henry VII's funeral and at the coronation of his son, Henry VIII.<ref name=constaffs>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/staffordshire The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509\u20131558 \u2013 Staffordshire (Author: N.

He was able to repair relations, but only after paying a fine.\n\nGiffard was at court regularly for thirty years or more, and accompanied the royal family on many important state occasions. In 1520 he crossed the Channel again to attend the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], Henry's meeting with [[Francis I of France]], and was also at [[Gravelines]] two weeks later for the king's meeting with the queen's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. He was a confidant of both the king and the queen, [[Catherine of Aragon]], but his position seems not to have been damaged when they separated. He was present at the coronation of [[Anne Boleyn]] on 1 June 1533. Late in 1539, he and his son, [[Thomas Giffard (died 1560)|Thomas]] were sent to Kent to prepare for the arrival of [[Anne of Cleves]] at [[Dover Castle]] and at [[Sittingbourne]].<ref name=tgiff>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/giffard-thomas-1491-1560 The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 GIFFARD, Thomas (Author: A.

He was allowed to carry the [[Royal Standard of England]] before the king<ref name=jgiff /> during this campaign, on which he was accompanied by his friend and near neighbour [[Edward Littleton (died 1558)|Edward Littleton]] of [[Pillaton Hall]]. It was after the taking of Tournai that he was knighted.\n\nGiffard was granted a standard in 1523 and may have served in southern France. At some time by 1533, he was made a [[knight of the body]], a member of the royal body guard, a courtly and military honour. In 1536 he was sent to help fight the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], the rising in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]] against the [[Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act]].\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nGiffard's only definite period as a Member of the [[English Parliament]] was during the [[English Reformation Parliament]], which lasted from 1529 until 1536. However, his name appears on subsidy commissions, the bodies charged with imposing taxation and made up mainly of MPs, between 1512 and 1524, so he may have held a seat outside Staffordshire before the known election.\n\nGiffard's election in 1529 was as a [[knight of the shire]] for his native county of [[Staffordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Staffordshire]]. He was placed first in the [[order of precedence]], above his friend and neighbour Littleton. In the first half of the 16th century, most member for the county sat for only one term, and Littleton's record in serving in five parliaments was unique. Members came from a small circle of [[landed gentry]] families: Giffard was reckoned a leading man in the county at the time of his election \u2013 second only to the [[George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury|Earl of Shrewsbury]].<ref name=constaffs />\n\nGiffard joined Queen's Head group \u2013 a discussion meeting of MPs in the Queen's Head tavern.<ref name=jgiff /> Another member of the group was Sir [[George Throckmorton]], whose sister married Thomas Giffard. Throckmorton, Littleton and Sir John Giffard were all placed by [[Thomas Cromwell]] on a list believed to be of members opposed to the 1533 [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]]. This abolished the right of appeal to the Pope in both civil and ecclesiastical cases, and opposition to it was considered a touchstone of religious conservatism. However, Giffard attended the coronation of Ann Boleyn at the end of the 1533 session, and there is no hint that he opposed any of the more radical reforms that came later. Thomas Giffard and Littleton were soon involved in friendly competition for the monastic properties made available after the dissolution of 1536,<ref name=tgiff /><ref name=elitt /> while Sir John himself enquired after monastic lands at the Blackheath reception 1540.<ref name=jgiff />\n\nIt is possible that Giffard was feeling some disquiet at the pace of change, however, and on 5 June 1533 he obtained a licence for himself and his wife to leave the country on a pilgrimage to [[Amiens]], a shrine of [[John the Baptist]], celebrated for his resistance to royal power. It is not known how long they stayed in France, but it seems likely that Giffard returned for further sessions of the Reformation Parliament. He certainly went off northward to defend its decisions by force of arms in 1536. There is no record of who Staffordshire returned to Parliament in 1536, but Henry VIII had forcefully requested that all existing members serve again, so it is likely that both he and Littleton were re-elected. He was now over seventy years of age and his son Thomas took over from him in the 1539 election.\n\n==Landowner==\n[[File:Giffards Cross and Lodge.JPG|thumb|right|Giffard's Cross and the Georgian entrance lodge at the Upper Avenue, Chillington. The cross is said to commemorate the shooting dead of an escaped and dangerous panther by Sir John Giffard.]]\nGiffard's main estate was Chillington, which had a small village, since disappeared, and a water mill, as well as the medieval [[moat]]ed and [[fortified manor house]]. Sir John carried out a complete reconstruction of the house on the same site.<ref name=vchmanors /> The new hall was a quadrangular building house with a [[gatehouse]] on its eastern side \u2013 a plan similar to the roughly contemporary [[Pillaton Hall]] built by Edward Littleton. It was considered \"remarkable for the various forms of its windows and chimneys.\" As the same site was also used for the extant [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house, only fragments of Sir John's building remain, probably including carved panels incorporated into the present fireplace of the [[State room|saloon]], thought to occupy the site of the 16th century [[great hall]].\n\nAllegedly Giffard kept a [[menagerie]] at Chillington, from which a panther escaped. The point at which he shot it with a crossbow is marked by Giffard's Cross, which is now in the garden of a small Georgian gate lodge. The original wooden cross, with its [[trefoil]] terminals to the arms, decayed and the present cross is a replica.\n\nIn addition to Chillington, Giffard inherited the small estate of Walton, near [[Eccleshall]]. He began to extend his family's holdings locally. In 1495 he leased the estate of Hatton from the [[Bishop of Lichfield]] By the time of his death he also held a substantial part of Broom Hall as tenant of the bishop, although it seems that Sir John made a wedding present of his land at Broom Hall to Thomas Giffard in 1531. The estate was divided between the Giffards and the Lanes of [[Bentley, West Midlands|Bentley]]. One of Sir John's tenants at Broom Hall was Thomas Careless. This partnership of the Lane, Giffard and Careless families was to prove crucial in the [[Escape of Charles II]] in 1651. In addition to these important local acquisitions, he also obtained from the king a number of lordships in Staffordshire, including Plardiwick, near [[Gnosall]], [[Pattingham]] and Marston.\n\nAs befitting an important landowner in the county, Giffard was [[Pricking the Lites|pricked]] High Sheriff of [[Staffordshire]] in 1509 \u2013 part of a shower of honours that descended on him that year. However, he was also Sheriff a further five times: 1517\u201318, 1522\u20133, 1526\u20137, 1530\u20131, 1541\u20132.\n\n==Marriages and family==\n[[File:Sir John Giffard-Elizabeth-Jane-Brewood 1556.JPG|thumb|Sir John Giffard, who died in 1556, during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]], when Catholicism was temporarily restored.

Most of the children seem to have died at birth or while still young.\n*Elizabeth Montgomery, daughter of Sir Thomas Gresley of [[Colton, Staffordshire]], was his second wife. The date of the marriage is uncertain but was by April 1515, when Giffard got into trouble with Henry VIII for marrying without permission. Elizabeth was the widow of Sir John Montgomery of [[Cubley, Derbyshire]]. She and Giffard had 4 sons and a daughter, Frances. Frances was the mother of [[John Talbot of Grafton]], MP (d.1611).\n\nGiffard and his wives were interred in the parish church of St. Mary and St. Chad in Brewood.

At that time, [[Perth]], the capital of [[Western Australia]], was isolated from the remaining [[Australian states|Australian States]] by thousands of miles of desert terrain and the only practicable method of transport was by sea, a time-consuming, inconvenient and often uncomfortable voyage across the [[Great Australian Bight]], a stretch of water known for rough seas. One of the inducements held out to Western Australians to join the new federation was the promise of a federally funded railway line linking Western Australia with the rest of the continent.\n\nIn 1907 legislation was passed, allowing for the route to be surveyed. The survey was completed in 1909 and proposed a route from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] (the existing railhead at the head of [[Spencer Gulf]] in South Australia's wheatfields) via [[Tarcoola railway station|Tarcoola]] to the gold mining centre of [[Kalgoorlie railway station|Kalgoorlie]] in Western Australia, a distance of {{convert|1063|miles|km}}.

Its cost was estimated at \u00a34,045,000.\n\nLegislation authorising the construction was passed in December 1911 by the [[Andrew Fisher]] Government and work commenced in September 1912 in [[Port Augusta]].\n\nWork proceeded eastwards from [[Kalgoorlie]] and westwards from Port Augusta through the years of the First World War.

In the days of steam locomotion, about half the total load was water for the engine.\n\nAccording to Adelaide-born astronaut [[Andy Thomas]], the line is identifiable from space, because of its unnatural straightness. \"It's a very fine line, it's like someone has drawn a very fine pencil line across the desert,\" he has said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Debelle|first1=Penelope|title=Adelaide's own spaceman Andy Thomas|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/lifestyle/sa-lifestyle/adelaides-own-spaceman-andy-thomas/story-fnizi7vf-1227086757447|accessdate=19 October 2014|work=The Advertiser|location=Adelaide|date=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Names of stopping places==\n{{see also|List of localities and stopping places related to the Trans Australian railway line}}\n\n[[File:Trans-Australia Railway map provided to passengers circa 1960.png|thumb|450px|A map on one side of a leaflet provided to passengers showing all localities on the Trans-Australian Railway (click to enlarge)]]\n\nMost of the stopping locations in the 129\u00b0 E to 134\u00b0 E part of the railway in South Australia (except for Deakin, which is {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} inside Western Australia's state border) were named after the first seven [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Ministers]].\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Location\n!Name of Prime Minister\n!Prime Minister number\n!Distance from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]] in km (mi)<ref>(1927)  \t''Travel in comfort across Australia on the Trans-Australian Railway.''\nMelbourne : Commonwealth Railways. internal map titled ''Map shewing Connections between Capital Cities via Trans- Australian Railway''</ref>\n|-\n|Barton, South Australia\n|[[Edmund Barton]]\n|First \n|605.11 (376) \n|-\n|[[Watson, South Australia]]\n|[[Chris Watson]]\n|Third \n|716.16 (445)\n|-\n| Fisher, South Australia \n|[[Andrew Fisher]] \n|Fifth \n|770.88 (479) \n|-\n|[[Cook, South Australia]]\n|[[Joseph Cook]]\n|Sixth\n|825.59 (513) \n|-\n|Hughes, South Australia\n|[[Billy Hughes]] \n|Seventh \n|912.5 (567)\n|-\n|[[Deakin, Western Australia]]\n|[[Alfred Deakin]]\n|Second\n|964 (599)\n|-\n|Reid, Western Australia\n|[[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] \n|Fourth  \n|1,017.11 (632) This station is west of Deakin.\n|}\n\nOther federal ministers from the 1900\u20131917 era occur outside of this sequence amongst stopping places on the rail route.\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:GM29 Rawlinna, 1986.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Commonwealth Railways GM class|GM29 and GM3]] with an [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal|Adelaide]] bound ''[[Trans Australian]]'' at [[Rawlinna]] in 1986]]\nBecause of the inevitable problems of finding suitable water for [[steam locomotive]]s in a desert, the original engineer, [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]] envisaged [[diesel locomotive]]s for the line.

Crossing loops have self restoring points, so that points are reset to the straight route when a train departs from a crossing loop. The loops are fitted with radio controls so that train crew can set the points as they approach. Locomotives are fitted with an in-cab activated points system (ICAPS), enabling the remote operation of the self-restoring point machines  at crossing loops by the crew from the locomotive cab, allowing train crews to set the required route without having to stop the train.<ref name=atsb/>\n\nThe [[safeworking]] is [[Train order operation|Train Orders]], via a verbal communications-based train order working system.<ref name=atsb>{{cite web|title=Overrun of authority involving train 6MP5|url=https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/4914756/ro-2013-019_final.docx |publisher=Australian Transport Safety Bureau|accessdate=3 May 2017|location=Canberra|format=pdf|date=7 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Trains|Railways|Australia}}\n*[[Transcontinental railroad]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*Adam-Smith, Patsy (1974) ''The Desert Railway''.

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=March 7, 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien told Gutwillig he had \"given a considerable amount of time and thought\" to a film adaptation, noting \"some ideas concerning what I think would be desirable\" as well as the \"difficulties\" involved.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tolkien spoke with Gutwillig's agent and producer, [[Samuel Gelfman|Samuel W. Gelfman]]. Their discussion was appearantly amicable, with Tolkien finding Gelfman intelligent and reasonable,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?do=post_view_printable;post=133383;guest=126989777|title=FLASHBACK for...August 31 to September 13|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and Gelfman later recalled that they talked about specifics to do with an adaptation.<ref name=\":26\" /> Tolkien directed Gelfman to his publishers, but nothing came out of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien later received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=978-1119656029|location=|pages=518\u201321}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions. By 1967, Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered negotiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":26\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title='LORD OF THE RINGS'; Serious Issues|last=|first=|date=December 29, 2002|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio.

Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that United Artists themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf. [[Donovan]] was keen on Merry, and they wanted [[Twiggy]] for Galadriel and \"a lot of other people\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mcall.com/sd-me-music-beatles-lord-of-the-rings-20180731-story.html|title=Help!

Kubrick's own films never exceeded the three-hour runtime before, and splitting the story (an approach considered with such widescreen epics as ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' around that time) would have been risky given that 60s widescreen epics rarely had sequels, and the nature of the story would result in the first part feeling unresolved.

While Rankin wanted it to be released in theaters if it was successful enough, this did not come to pass, making Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' the only theatrical feature based on Tolkien's works to appear before the WingNut films productions.\n\nThe television special received mixed reactions.

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=January 2, 2007|first=Jim |last=Korkis |date =June 24, 2003 |publisher=Jim Hill Media}}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]''. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \"a Roger Corman film\".<ref name=\":8\" /> He would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Medavoy didn't want to produce Bakshi's film, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. Zaentz was only able to offer a humble budget of $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=Weiner|first=David|date=November 10, 2018|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz's Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nWith Conkling, Bakshi considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some inconsistencies like the spelling of Saruman's (originally changed to Ruman to avoid confusion with Sauron) name in the film. Fans were threatening Bakshi to get it right, and he would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans.<ref name=\":34\">{{Cite book|last=Ash|first=Roger|title=Modern Masters Volume 19: Mike Ploog|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref>\n\nBakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \"always seen it as animation.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19021.php|title=John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made half-joking remarks about television spin-off shows<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref> and films.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19958.php|title=20 QUESTIONS WITH PETER JACKSON - PART 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, but his agent Ken Kamins convinced Harvey Weinstein that getting another filmmaker to work on the project will result in further delays and costs, at which point Harvey conceded to give Jackson the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct. Other director's considered before Jackson took over are said to have included [[Neill Blomkamp|Neil Blomkamp]], [[David Yates]], [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] and [[Brett Ratner|Bret Ratner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/hobbit-rumor-neill-blomkamp-direct-no-job-mgm-gets-together/|title=Neill Blomkamp Rumored to Direct THE HOBBIT and Why No One Is Getting the Job Until MGM Gets It Together|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tel Toro's ''The Hobbit'' would have had a similar scenario to Jackson's eventual film, but with a different design aesthetic.

Directed by [[Dome Karukoski]], a fan of Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'', the film was in development since 2013, and was released in 2019 to mixed reviews and was a box office disappointment.\n\n==Fan films==\n''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'', a [[fan film]] based on elements of the appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings'', was released on the internet in May 2009.  It is set between the events of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', and depicts [[Aragorn]]'s quest to find [[Gollum]].  The film's visual style is based on that of the Jackson films.  Although it is completely unofficial, it has received coverage in major media.<ref>{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Masters |title=Making Middle-earth on a shoestring |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8022623.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009}}<br/>{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Sydell |authorlink=Laura Sydell |title=High-Def 'Hunt For Gollum' New Lord Of The Fanvids |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103673352 |work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=30 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nAnother fan made feature film, ''[[Born of Hope]]'', produced and directed by [[Kate Madison]], was released online on December 1, 2009 on [[Dailymotion]] and later on [[YouTube]].

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=978-1119656029|location=|pages=518\u201321}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2002|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that United Artists themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92\u2013105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf.

When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol.

He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about television spin-off shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers).
