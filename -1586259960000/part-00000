Founded by [[Semie Moseley]], Mosrite guitars were played by many [[rock and roll]] and [[country music|country]] artists.\n\nMosrite guitars were known for innovative design, high-quality engineering, very thin, low-fretted and narrow necks, and extremely hot (high output) pickups. Moseley's design for [[The Ventures]], known as the \"Ventures Model\" (later known as the \"Mark I,\") was generally considered to be the flagship of the line.\nMosrite also made a very limited number of acoustic guitars that are somewhat rare.  They are the Serenade and Balladere models.  The Balladere models were made between 1968-1969, while the Serenade was an earlier model made between 1965-1969.\n\n==History==\n\n===Apprenticeship===\n{{multiple image\n|perrow = \n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width = 250\n|header =  \n|image1 = Mosrite headstock 2.jpg\n|caption1 = [[The Ventures|Ventures]] model headstock\n|image2 = Mosrite, Nirvana, EMP Museum.jpg\n|caption2 = Mark V Guitar \n|footer =\n}}\nIn Bakersfield, Semie Moseley started playing guitar in an evangelical group at age 13.<ref name=\"GP\">Thompson, Art, [http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mosrite-40th-anniversary/jan-07/24776  \"Mosrite 40th Anniversary\"], ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, January 2007.</ref> Semie and his brother Andy experimented with guitars from their teen-age years, refinishing instruments and building new necks.<ref name=\"BC\">Price, Robert, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080712034122/http://www.bakersfield.com/static/FP/baksound/mosrite.htm \"The Man Behind the Mosrite\"] (archived 2008 copy), ''[[The Bakersfield Californian]]''. Has biographical notes on Semie Moseley.</ref>\n\nSemie Moseley began building guitars in the Los Angeles area around 1952 or 1953. He began by apprenticing at the [[Rickenbacker]] factory, where he learned much of his guitar making skills from [[Roger Rossmeisl]], a German immigrant who brought old-world [[luthier]] techniques into the modern electric guitar manufacturing process. One of the most recognizable features on most Mosrite guitars is the \"German Carve\" on the top that Moseley learned from Rossmeisl. During the same time, Moseley apprenticed with [[Paul Bigsby]] in [[Downey, California]], the man who made the first modern solid-body guitar for Merle Travis in 1948, and who invented the [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]], which is still used today.\n\n===Mosrite founded===\nIn 1954, Semie built a triple-neck guitar in his garage (the longest neck was a standard guitar, the second-longest neck an octave higher, the shortest was an eight-string mandolin.) He presented a double-neck to [[Joe Maphis]], a [[Los Angeles]]-area TV performer of country music. By 1956, with an investment from Ray Boatright, a local Los Angeles Foursquare Gospel minister, Semie and Andy started their company, Mosrite of California. In gratitude to Reverend Boatright, Moseley named the company by combining his and Boatright's last names; the name is properly pronounced MOZE-rite, based on the pronunciation Semie Moseley used for his own name.<ref name=roberts>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=James H.|title=American basses: an illustrated history & player's guide|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-721-9|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lBKzcs746oC&pg=PA128}}</ref> Semie, who built guitars for the L.A.-based Rickenbacker company, said to his co-workers that he was making his own product, and he was fired by Rickenbacker.<ref name=\"BC\"/>\n\n[[File:Joe Maphis double-neck guitar by Semie Moseley - Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Joe Maphis]]'s double-neck by Mosrite]]\nWhen they began, their production was all custom, handmade guitars, built in garages, tin storage sheds, wherever the Moseleys could put equipment.<ref name=\"BC\"/>\n\nIn 1959, Andy moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], for a year to popularize the Mosrite name and sold a few, including to [[Grand Ole Opry]] entertainers and road musicians. Andy said: \"And that\u2019s how we kept the factory going at the time: custom guitars\".<ref name=\"BC\"/>\n\nMoseley made guitars in Los Angeles until 1959, when he moved to [[Oildale, California]], just north of Bakersfield. In 1962, he moved his shop to Panama Lane where he designed and produced the first Joe Maphis model guitars, one model of which would eventually evolve into the \"Ventures model\" guitar and bass (Joe Maphis would later get a model of his own, similar to a Mosrite Combo model but without the [[F-hole]]). At this time, Mosrite made everything in-house, except for the tuners.<ref name=hunter/>\n\nMosrite pickups after the 50s usually came in several ways through Mosrite's history, none with metal casing; 1: the large single coil similar to (but not the same as) a P90, 2: a cheaper version of the first pickup that showed on cheaper models (Celebrity III, Mark V,) 3: a cheaper pickup only found on the first iteration of the Ventures II and 4: a Mosrite Humbucker mostly found on some 1970s models.\n\nThe full \"The Ventures\" line consisted of the Mark I, Ventures II (of several versions,) Mark V, Mark X (bass) and Mark XII (12 string). \"The Ventures\" line started in 1963 and ran through 1967 when the licensing agreement with The Ventures ended.\n\nAt the peak of production, in 1968, Mosrite was making around 600 guitars per month.<ref name=roberts/>\n\n===Bankruptcy and restart===\nMosrite of California went bankrupt in late 1968 after they contracted with the [[Thomas Organ Company]] to market their guitars. After this, they tried to deal directly with stores, and they sold 280 guitars in 1969 before they came to the shop one day in February and found their doors pad-locked.<ref name=\"BC\"/> Two years after his bankruptcy, Semie was able to get back the Mosrite name, and in 1970 he started making guitars again in [[Pumpkin Center, Kern County, California|Pumpkin Center]] near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. He moved his factory three times in the next 20 years, to [[Oklahoma City]] in the mid-1970s, to the township of Jonas Ridge, in [[Burke County, North Carolina]], in 1981 (where a factory fire destroyed the operation,) and to [[Leachville, Arkansas]], in 1991.<ref name=\"BC\"/>  Only one guitar was produced in Leachville and is now on display at the town's Melody Theater.\n\nThough an acknowledged genius at guitar design and construction, Moseley lacked many basic skills necessary to be a good businessman, and thus the company fell on hard times repeatedly in the late 1960s and 1970s, but continued to produce Mosrite guitars until 1993 in North Carolina and Arkansas. Most of them were exported to Japan, where their popularity remained very strong. The quality of the instruments always remained very respectable. Semie Moseley died in 1992. His wife Loretta continued to produce Mosrites a year or so after his death, and since 2008 has been selling custom Mosrites via their website.\n\nThe company now has recently{{when|date=July 2011}} released the Semie Moseley Model \u201963 and \u201965, based on the Ventures models made in those two years. Both models are made to the exact specifications as the original models; they are 100&nbsp;% hand-made and were created to commemorate Semie Moseley.\n\nSemie's daughter, Dana Moseley, is also a luthier and continues to build Mosrite guitars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edroman.com/guitars/mosrite/dana-moseley.htm|title=Mosrite Guitars - Dana Moseley of Moseley Family|first=Ed|last=Roman|website=Edroman.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> She also helps kick off the monthly \"Mosrite Jam\" in Bakersfield.<ref>Munoz, Matt, [http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/local/x914961517/Mos-rite-teous-Lovers-of-Bakersfield-guitar-ready-to-jam \"Mos-rite-teous!

Mosrite is a company where outliers aren't unheard of.\n\nMosrite also used other names occasionally; \"Gospel\" was often a name associated with guitars given away to churches although it was also used during Mosrite's bankruptcy period when they didn't have their Mosrite name (1969-1970,) Semie also used his last name \"Moseley\" for guitars built during the same period.\n\n===1950s===\n:* One [[double neck guitar]] built for [[Joe Maphis]], \n:* A [[multi-neck guitar|triple-neck guitar]] built for [[Semie Moseley]] personally, \n:More various guitars though none in commercial production.\n\n===1960s===\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction=horizontal\n|total_width = 230\n|image1= Mosrite branca johnny ramone.jpg\n|caption1= Ventures II (1965, Slab Body Type) Reissue\n|image2=Mosrite Joe Maphis double neck (1968).jpg\n|caption2= Joe Maphis Double Neck (1968)\n}}\n;Pre-1963: \n:* '''Joe Maphis''' model &mdash; Same general body shape as the later ''Ventures'' model; This was to be ''Joe Maphis' '' model before Semie Moseley and The Ventures settled on a contract and the body shape became the ''Ventures'' model. This is not the same as the later ''Joe Maphis'' model which is similar to the ''Combo'' model.\n\n;1963-1968: \n:* '''The Ventures''' Model &mdash; Also came as a [[bass guitar|bass]] and later on, A [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string]]. Post Ventures, 1968 and 1969 it was named the \"'''Mark I'''\". <br/>The first [[The Ventures|Ventures]] Models came with a [[set-in neck|set neck]], [[Inlay (guitar)#Binding|bound]] body and a large Ventures and Mosrite logo, less than 250 of these were made before settling on the standard Ventures Model sometime in 1964, without body binding and the neck became [[bolt-on neck|bolt on]]. The Mosrite logo and Ventures model logo were slightly reduced.\n:* '''Ventures Bass''' (AKA \"'''Mark X'''\")\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar &mdash; Most of these have [[Stoptail bridge|stoptail]]s although some have [[Vibrato systems for guitar#The Mosrite Vibrato|tremolo]]s.\n\n;1965: \n:* '''The Ventures II''' (\"Slab Body\" Type) Model &mdash; Only built as a six-string guitar in 1965. Production started in mid-1965 and ended several months later with small production numbers. The Slab Body was replaced with the second ''Ventures II'' design, reportedly because Semie Moseley was disappointed in this original design, thinking it looked too cheap for Mosrite. This is the model that [[Johnny Ramone]] of the [[Ramones]] was mostly known to play.\n\n;1965-1966: \n:* '''The Ventures II''' (German Carve Body Type) Model &mdash; Replaced the earlier Ventures II; Same body design as the ''Mark V'' model. Only came as a six-string guitar. Some of these, mostly earlier models with a few exceptions, have longer pickguards than later models; the neck pickup on the long pickguard models is slightly farther from the bridge, possibly to utilize older shorter Ventures II \"Slab Body\" necks. Re-named the \"Ventures Mark V\" in 1966.\n\n;1965-1968/1969: \n:* '''Joe Maphis''' models &mdash; These are similar in body shape to the later ''Combo'' model without [[F-hole]]s and are painted in a natural finish. Came as:\n:* '''Mark I''' Six-String Guitar\n:* '''Mark X''' Bass\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar\n\n; 1966-?:\n:* '''Joe Maphis Dual Neck''' model&mdash; Two-necked guitar based on the '''Ventures''' model. Has 6 string and 12 string necks. Variants may exist.\n\n;1966-1969: \n:* '''The Ventures Mark V''' Model &mdash; Later just named \"'''Mark V'''\" after the Ventures contract ended in 1967/1968. Only sold as a six-string guitar commercially though bass prototypes were made. A battered Ink Blue version of this model was used by the [[B-52s]]' [[Ricky Wilson (American musician)|Ricky Wilson]] with only four strings and a custom tuning for some of their distinctive sound and was featured on the inner sleeve of their debut 'yellow' album.\n\n:* '''Celebrity I''', '''Celebrity II''' and '''Celebrity III''' Hollow-Body Guitars &mdash; came as:\n\n:* '''Mark I''' Six-String Guitar\n:* '''Mark X''' Bass\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar\n\n:* '''Combo''' Semi-Hollow Body Guitar; came as:\n\n:* '''Mark I''' Six-String Guitar\n:* '''Mark X''' Bass\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar\n\nAcoustic Guitars:\n\n:* '''Balladere''' 6-String Guitar.\n:* '''Serenade''' 6-String Guitar.\n\n===1970s===\n\nUnlike 1960s models, the 1970s marked a departure from the skinny necks; Mosrite didn't always make thin necks in the 70s.\n\n:* '''300''' (''[[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]]''-Style Body Shape, One [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] in the neck position, no German Carve) &mdash; Came as both six-string guitar and four-string bass. Came with a Mosrite Humbucker Pickup. Mahogany Body and Mahogany Neck.\n:* '''350''' (''Telecaster''-Style Body Shape, Two pickups, no German Carve) &mdash; Came in both \"[[stereophonic sound|Stereo]]\" for two output [[Phone connector (audio)|jacks]] and \"[[monaural|Mono]]\" for one output jack. Came as six-string guitar and four-string bass. Mostly came with Mosrite Humbucker Pickups though some may exist with Mosrite single coils. Mahogany Body and Mahogany Neck, mostly (with at least one exception.)\n:* '''Blues Bender''' &mdash; Six-String Guitar similar in shape to a [[Gibson Les Paul]] but with typical Mosrite features; German Carve, Basswood body, Maple neck and Rosewood fretboard. Unlike 1960s Mosrite models, this model has a wider neck then 60s Mosrites and features Mosrite Humbucker pickups not found on stock 60s models. \n:* '''Celebrity''' &mdash; Mosrite continued production of the Celebrity models into the 70s with Mosrite Humbucker pickups.\n:* '''Mark I''' &mdash; Similar design of guitar as the ''Ventures'' models, minus the Ventures logo.\n:* '''Mark X''' &mdash; Ventures bass minus the Ventures logo.\n:* '''V2''' or '''V II''' &mdash; Same body style as a Mark I or Ventures model but with Mosrite Humbuckers and more electronics.\n:* '''S.M. (Semie Moseley) Model''' &mdash; Six-String Guitar similar in shape to the Blues Bender and Brass Rail models. 84 or fewer are estimated to have been built and these do not have a German Carve.\n;1976:\n:* '''Brass Rail''' &mdash; Six-String Guitar similar in body shape to a [[Gibson Les Paul]] with [[guitar fret|fret]]s attached to a [[brass]] rod in the neck for [[sustain]]. Has a German Carve.\n:* '''Brass Rail Deluxe''' &mdash; Came with [[electric guitar#Construction|passive and active circuit]]s and two output jacks.

Founded by [[Semie Moseley]], Mosrite guitars were played by many [[rock and roll]] and [[country music|country]] artists.\n\nMosrite guitars were known for innovative design, high-quality engineering, very thin, low-fretted and narrow necks, and extremely hot (high output) pickups. Moseley's design for [[The Ventures]], known as the \"Ventures Model\" (later known as the \"Mark I,\") was generally considered to be the flagship of the line.\nMosrite also made a very limited number of acoustic guitars that are somewhat rare.  They are the Serenade and Balladere models.  The Balladere models were made between 1968-1969, while the Serenade was an earlier model made between 1965-1969.\n\n==History==\n\n===Apprenticeship===\n{{multiple image\n|perrow = \n|align = right\n|direction = horizontal\n|total_width = 250\n|header =  \n|image1 = Mosrite headstock 2.jpg\n|caption1 = [[The Ventures|Ventures]] model headstock\n|image2 = Mosrite, Nirvana, EMP Museum.jpg\n|caption2 = Mark V Guitar \n|footer =\n}}\nIn Bakersfield, Semie Moseley started playing guitar in an evangelical group at age 13.<ref name=\"GP\">Thompson, Art, [http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/mosrite-40th-anniversary/jan-07/24776  \"Mosrite 40th Anniversary\"], ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, January 2007.</ref> Semie and his brother Andy experimented with guitars from their teen-age years, refinishing instruments and building new necks.<ref name=\"BC\">Price, Robert, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080712034122/http://www.bakersfield.com/static/FP/baksound/mosrite.htm \"The Man Behind the Mosrite\"] (archived 2008 copy), ''[[The Bakersfield Californian]]''. Has biographical notes on Semie Moseley.</ref>\n\nSemie Moseley began building guitars in the Los Angeles area around 1952 or 1953. He began by apprenticing at the [[Rickenbacker]] factory, where he learned much of his guitar making skills from [[Roger Rossmeisl]], a German immigrant who brought old-world [[luthier]] techniques into the modern electric guitar manufacturing process. One of the most recognizable features on most Mosrite guitars is the \"German Carve\" on the top that Moseley learned from Rossmeisl. During the same time, Moseley apprenticed with [[Paul Bigsby]] in [[Downey, California]], the man who made the first modern solid-body guitar for Merle Travis in 1948, and who invented the [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]], which is still used today.\n\n===Mosrite founded===\nIn 1954, Semie built a triple-neck guitar in his garage (the longest neck was a standard guitar, the second-longest neck an octave higher, the shortest was an eight-string mandolin.) He presented a double-neck to [[Joe Maphis]], a [[Los Angeles]]-area TV performer of country music. By 1956, with an investment from Ray Boatwright, a local Los Angeles minister, Semie and Andy started their company, Mosrite of California. In gratitude to Boatwright, Moseley named the company by combining his and Boatwright's last names; the name is properly pronounced MOZE-rite, based on the pronunciation Semie Moseley used for his own name.<ref name=roberts>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=James H.|title=American basses: an illustrated history & player's guide|year=2003|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-0-87930-721-9|page=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lBKzcs746oC&pg=PA128}}</ref> Semie, who built guitars for the L.A.-based Rickenbacker company, said to his co-workers that he was making his own product, and he was fired by Rickenbacker.<ref name=\"BC\"/>\n\n[[File:Joe Maphis double-neck guitar by Semie Moseley - Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Joe Maphis]]'s double-neck by Mosrite]]\nWhen they began, their production was all custom, handmade guitars, built in garages, tin storage sheds, wherever the Moseleys could put equipment.<ref name=\"BC\"/>\n\nIn 1959, Andy moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], for a year to popularize the Mosrite name and sold a few, including to [[Grand Ole Opry]] entertainers and road musicians. Andy said: \"And that\u2019s how we kept the factory going at the time: custom guitars\".<ref name=\"BC\"/>\n\nMoseley made guitars in Los Angeles until 1959, when he moved to [[Oildale, California]], just north of Bakersfield. In 1962, he moved his shop to Panama Lane where he designed and produced the first Joe Maphis model guitars, one model of which would eventually evolve into the \"Ventures model\" guitar and bass (Joe Maphis would later get a model of his own, similar to a Mosrite Combo model but without the [[F-hole]]). At this time, Mosrite made everything in-house, except for the tuners.<ref name=hunter/>\n\nMosrite pickups after the 50s usually came in several ways through Mosrite's history, none with metal casing; 1: the large single coil similar to (but not the same as) a P90, 2: a cheaper version of the first pickup that showed on cheaper models (Celebrity III, Mark V,) 3: a cheaper pickup only found on the first iteration of the Ventures II and 4: a Mosrite Humbucker mostly found on some 1970s models.\n\nThe full \"The Ventures\" line consisted of the Mark I, Ventures II (of several versions,) Mark V, Mark X (bass) and Mark XII (12 string). \"The Ventures\" line started in 1963 and ran through 1967 when the licensing agreement with The Ventures ended.\n\nAt the peak of production, in 1968, Mosrite was making around 600 guitars per month.<ref name=roberts/>\n\n===Bankruptcy and restart===\nMosrite of California went bankrupt in late 1968 after they contracted with the [[Thomas Organ Company]] to market their guitars. After this, they tried to deal directly with stores, and they sold 280 guitars in 1969 before they came to the shop one day in February and found their doors pad-locked.<ref name=\"BC\"/> Two years after his bankruptcy, Semie was able to get back the Mosrite name, and in 1970 he started making guitars again in [[Pumpkin Center, Kern County, California|Pumpkin Center]] near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. He moved his factory three times in the next 20 years, to [[Oklahoma City]] in the mid-1970s, to the township of Jonas Ridge, in [[Burke County, North Carolina]], in 1981 (where a factory fire destroyed the operation,) and to [[Leachville, Arkansas]], in 1991.<ref name=\"BC\"/>  Only one guitar was produced in Leachville and is now on display at the town's Melody Theater.\n\nThough an acknowledged genius at guitar design and construction, Moseley lacked many basic skills necessary to be a good businessman, and thus the company fell on hard times repeatedly in the late 1960s and 1970s, but continued to produce Mosrite guitars until 1993 in North Carolina and Arkansas. Most of them were exported to Japan, where their popularity remained very strong. The quality of the instruments always remained very respectable. Semie Moseley died in 1992. His wife Loretta continued to produce Mosrites a year or so after his death, and since 2008 has been selling custom Mosrites via their website.\n\nThe company now has recently{{when|date=July 2011}} released the Semie Moseley Model \u201963 and \u201965, based on the Ventures models made in those two years. Both models are made to the exact specifications as the original models; they are 100&nbsp;% hand-made and were created to commemorate Semie Moseley.\n\nSemie's daughter, Dana Moseley, is also a luthier and continues to build Mosrite guitars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edroman.com/guitars/mosrite/dana-moseley.htm|title=Mosrite Guitars - Dana Moseley of Moseley Family|first=Ed|last=Roman|website=Edroman.com|accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref> She also helps kick off the monthly \"Mosrite Jam\" in Bakersfield.<ref>Munoz, Matt, [http://www.bakersfield.com/entertainment/local/x914961517/Mos-rite-teous-Lovers-of-Bakersfield-guitar-ready-to-jam \"Mos-rite-teous!

Mosrite is a company where outliers aren't unheard of.\n\nMosrite also used other names occasionally; \"Gospel\" was often a name associated with guitars given away to churches although it was also used during Mosrite's bankruptcy period when they didn't have their Mosrite name (1969-1970,) Semie also used his last name \"Moseley\" for guitars built during the same period.\n\n===1950s===\n:* One [[double neck guitar]] built for [[Joe Maphis]], \n:* A [[multi-neck guitar|triple-neck guitar]] built for [[Semie Moseley]] personally, \n:More various guitars though none in commercial production.\n\n===1960s===\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction=horizontal\n|total_width = 230\n|image1= Mosrite branca johnny ramone.jpg\n|caption1= Ventures II (1965, Slab Body Type) Reissue\n|image2=Mosrite Joe Maphis double neck (1968).jpg\n|caption2= Joe Maphis Double Neck (1968)\n}}\n;Pre-1963: \n:* '''Joe Maphis''' model &mdash; Same general body shape as the later ''Ventures'' model; This was to be ''Joe Maphis' '' model before Semie Moseley and The Ventures settled on a contract and the body shape became the ''Ventures'' model. This is not the same as the later ''Joe Maphis'' model which is similar to the ''Combo'' model.\n\n;1963-1968: \n:* '''The Ventures''' Model &mdash; Also came as a [[bass guitar|bass]] and later on, A [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string]]. Post Ventures, 1968 and 1969 it was named the \"'''Mark I'''\". <br/>The first [[The Ventures|Ventures]] Models came with a [[set-in neck|set neck]], [[Inlay (guitar)#Binding|bound]] body and a large Ventures and Mosrite logo, less than 250 of these were made before settling on the standard Ventures Model sometime in 1964, without body binding and the neck became [[bolt-on neck|bolt on]]. The Mosrite logo and Ventures model logo were slightly reduced.\n:* '''Ventures Bass''' (AKA \"'''Mark X'''\")\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar &mdash; Most of these have [[Stoptail bridge|stoptail]]s although some have [[Vibrato systems for guitar#The Mosrite Vibrato|tremolo]]s.\n\n;1965: \n:* '''The Ventures II''' (\"Slab Body\" Type) Model &mdash; Only built as a six-string guitar in 1965. Production started in mid-1965 and ended several months later with small production numbers. The Slab Body was replaced with the second ''Ventures II'' design, reportedly because Semie Moseley was disappointed in this original design, thinking it looked too cheap for Mosrite. This is the model that [[Johnny Ramone]] of the [[Ramones]] was mostly known to play.\n\n;1965-1966: \n:* '''The Ventures II''' (German Carve Body Type) Model &mdash; Replaced the earlier Ventures II; Same body design as the ''Mark V'' model. Only came as a six-string guitar. Some of these, mostly earlier models with a few exceptions, have longer pickguards than later models; the neck pickup on the long pickguard models is slightly farther from the bridge, possibly to utilize older shorter Ventures II \"Slab Body\" necks. Re-named the \"Ventures Mark V\" in 1966.\n\n;1965-1968/1969: \n:* '''Joe Maphis''' models &mdash; These are similar in body shape to the later ''Combo'' model without [[F-hole]]s and are painted in a natural finish.

Has 6 string and 12 string necks. Variants may exist.\n\n;1966-1969: \n:* '''The Ventures Mark V''' Model &mdash; Later just named \"'''Mark V'''\" after the Ventures contract ended in 1967/1968. Only sold as a six-string guitar commercially though bass prototypes were made. A battered Ink Blue version of this model was used by the [[B-52s]]' [[Ricky Wilson (American musician)|Ricky Wilson]] with only four strings and a custom tuning for some of their distinctive sound and was featured on the inner sleeve of their debut 'yellow' album.\n\n:* '''Celebrity I''', '''Celebrity II''' and '''Celebrity III''' Hollow-Body Guitars &mdash; came as:\n\n:* '''Mark I''' Six-String Guitar\n:* '''Mark X''' Bass\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar\n\n:* '''Combo''' Semi-Hollow Body Guitar; came as:\n\n:* '''Mark I''' Six-String Guitar\n:* '''Mark X''' Bass\n:* '''Mark XII''' Twelve-String Guitar\n\nAcoustic Guitars:\n\n:* '''Balladere''' 6-String Guitar.\n:* '''Serenade''' 6-String Guitar.\n\n===1970s===\n\nUnlike 1960s models, the 1970s marked a departure from the skinny necks; Mosrite didn't always make thin necks in the 70s.\n\n:* '''300''' (''[[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]]''-Style Body Shape, One [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] in the neck position, no German Carve) &mdash; Came as both six-string guitar and four-string bass.

Came as six-string guitar and four-string bass. Mostly came with Mosrite Humbucker Pickups though some may exist with Mosrite single coils. Mahogany Body and Mahogany Neck, mostly (with at least one exception.)\n:* '''Blues Bender''' &mdash; Six-String Guitar similar in shape to a [[Gibson Les Paul]] but with typical Mosrite features; German Carve, Basswood body, Maple neck and Rosewood fretboard. Unlike 1960s Mosrite models, this model has a wider neck then 60s Mosrites and features Mosrite Humbucker pickups not found on stock 60s models. \n:* '''Celebrity''' &mdash; Mosrite continued production of the Celebrity models into the 70s with Mosrite Humbucker pickups.\n:* '''Mark I''' &mdash; Similar design of guitar as the ''Ventures'' models, minus the Ventures logo.\n:* '''Mark X''' &mdash; Ventures bass minus the Ventures logo.\n:* '''V2''' or '''V II''' &mdash; Same body style as a Mark I or Ventures model but with Mosrite Humbuckers and more electronics.\n:* '''S.M.
