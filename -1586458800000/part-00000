While not restricted to America by any means, Latin pop was profoundly affected by production techniques and other [[music genre|style]]s of music \u2014 both Latin and otherwise \u2014 that originated primarily in the United States. [[Tejano music]], centered in [[Texas]] and the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S./Mexico border region]], had begun to introduce [[synthesizer]]s, slicker [[Music production|production]], and a more urban sensibility to formerly root styles like [[norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] and conjunto. \n\n[[File:Thal\u00eda_Primera_Fila_cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Thal\u00eda]] Mexican singer referred to as the \"Queen of Latin Pop\".]]\n\nMoreover, [[New York City|New York]] and [[Miami]] were home to thriving Latin club scenes, which during the 1980s led to the rise of Latin [[freestyle music|freestyle]], a club-oriented [[dance music]] that was rooted in Latin rhythms but relied on synthesizers and [[drum machines]] for most of its [[arrangements]]. Both of these sounds influenced the rise of Latin pop, which retained Latin [[rhythm]]s in its [[uptempo]] numbers but relied more on [[mainstream]] pop for its melodic sense.\n\nLatin pop's first major [[wikt:crossover|crossover star]] was [[Gloria Estefan]], who scored a succession of non-club-oriented dance-pop hits during the mid- to late 1980s, but eventually became known more as an [[adult contemporary]] diva with an affinity for sweeping [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]]. This blend of Latinized dance-pop and adult contemporary balladeering dominated Latin pop through the 1990s. Most of its artists sang in Spanish for Latino audiences, although Latin pop's similarity to the mainstream helped several performers score crossover hits when they chose to record in English.

While not restricted to America by any means, Latin pop was profoundly affected by production techniques and other [[music genre|style]]s of music \u2014 both Latin and otherwise \u2014 that originated primarily in the United States. [[Tejano music]], centered in [[Texas]] and the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S./Mexico border region]], had begun to introduce [[synthesizer]]s, slicker [[Music production|production]], and a more urban sensibility to formerly root styles like [[norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]] and conjunto. \n\n[[File:Thal\u00eda_Primera_Fila_cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Thal\u00eda]] Mexican singer referred to as the \"Queen of Latin Pop.\"]]\n\nMoreover, [[New York City|New York]] and [[Miami]] were home to thriving Latin club scenes, which during the 1980s led to the rise of Latin [[freestyle music|freestyle]], a club-oriented [[dance music]] that was rooted in Latin rhythms but relied on synthesizers and [[drum machines]] for most of its [[arrangements]]. Both of these sounds influenced the rise of Latin pop, which retained Latin [[rhythm]]s in its [[uptempo]] numbers but relied more on [[mainstream]] pop for its melodic sense.\n\nLatin pop's first major [[wikt:crossover|crossover star]] was [[Gloria Estefan]], who scored a succession of non-club-oriented dance-pop hits during the mid- to late 1980s, but eventually became known more as an [[adult contemporary]] diva with an affinity for sweeping [[Sentimental ballad|ballads]]. This blend of Latinized dance-pop and adult contemporary balladeering dominated Latin pop through the 1990s. Most of its artists sang in Spanish for Latino audiences, although Latin pop's similarity to the mainstream helped several performers score crossover hits when they chose to record in English. [[Jon Secada]] landed several pop hits during the mid-1990s, and Tejano pop star [[Selena]]'s album ''[[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]]'' actually debuted posthumously at number one on the album charts upon its 1995 release.<ref name=AMDancePop>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/latin-pop-ma0000004461/ Latin Pop], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 8 January 2015.</ref>\n\nThe late 90s and early 2000s saw Latin artists such as [[Ricky Martin]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Shakira]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and  ex-husband [[Marc Anthony]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Jade Esteban Estrada]], [[Thal\u00eda]], among others, achieve crossover mainstream success.

The denomination consists of approximately 90 congregations in the United States, Japan, Mexico and Canada.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==History==\nThe origins of the [[Apostolic Christian Church]] are found in the conversion experience of [[Samuel Heinrich Froehlich]]<ref>{{Citation | title = Handbook of Denominations | first1 = Frank S | last1 = Mead | first2 = Samuel S | last2 = Hill | first3 = Craig D | last3 = Atwood}}.</ref> (1803\u201357) of [[Switzerland]].  Froehlich was baptized in 1832 and soon founded the ''Evangelical Baptist Church.''  The first American church was formed in [[Lewis County, New York]] in 1847 by Benedict Weyeneth (1819\u201387), who had been sent by Froehlich at the request of Joseph Virkler, a Lewis County minister in an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Amish]]-[[Mennonite]] church.  In 1848 a church was formed in [[Sardis, Ohio]]. The church experienced primary growth in the midwest, where many congregations gained membership from local Amish and Mennonite churches.  Though sometimes referred to as the ''New Amish'', these believers generally called themselves ''Evangelical Baptist''.  In 1917, the church adopted a uniform name: ''Apostolic Christian Church''.\n\nFrom the 1920s on, most of the new churches formed in America were founded in metropolitan areas. This was because many of the church's offspring sought occupational opportunities outside of farming. Thus, today the Apostolic Christian Church consists of a blend of city and rural congregations<ref>http://www.apostolicchristian.org/history</ref>.\n\n[[File:SamuelFroehlich.jpg|thumb|300px|A sketch of Froehlich; the only known surviving likeness of him]]\n\n==Biblical practices and traditions==\n*Members seek to obey the [[Bible]], which they hold to be the infallible Word of God. Many of their practices, however, are not explicitly derived from the Bible. Rather, some of them are biblically inspired traditions derived from the writings of Froehlich (who was strongly influenced by early church writers such as Tertullian) and some are past practices believed to be beneficial. These traditions are passed from one generation to the next and are held in high esteem, but they are never meant to approach the level of Biblical commandments. Traditions within the Apostolic Christian Church are said to help encourage believers in their commitment to serving the Lord, help to knit generations together, and provide close harmony among the various congregations.\n* [[Holy Communion]] is served typically once, or possibly multiple times, during the year for church members, often (but not necessarily) near [[Easter]].  The Holy Communion service is a closed service, with only members present.  Holy Communion is typically preceded by a period, typically around a month, of self-examination and restitution.\n*The [[Holy Kiss]] is the greeting used in Apostolic Christian churches, based on instructions in the epistles of Paul and the general epistle of 1 Peter.\n*When single members seek a marriage partner, they are expected to do that within the denomination so that they will be equally yoked. Faith marriage is practiced (seeking the Lord's direction regarding a spouse).  Dating and courtship are discouraged.\n*When there was a [[Selective Service]] draft, church members, and sometimes friends (unconverted people, often family members, who attend regularly), served in a non-combatant status in the military.\n*The taking and swearing of an [[oath]] is strongly discouraged, based on Christ's teachings. An affirmation may be used as an alternative in legal, and other, matters.\n* Almost all congregations practice separated seating for men and women, though this may be relaxed from time to time for special occasions.\n* Formal business attire is expected during worship services representing unity.  Men wear suits and ties to church. Women wear dresses or skirts and are encouraged to be modestly dressed, including not adorning yourself with expensive or flashy jewelry. The use of a lot of [[cosmetics]] is discouraged.\n* Different congregations typically exchange \"greetings\" between each other and their members, either in person or at-large after the worship service when church announcements are shared to the congregation.\n* Church members are encouraged to use Early Modern English (including the familiar second-person forms \"thee\" and \"thou\" instead of \"you\") when petitioning God in public prayer. (Early Modern English is the form of English used in the translation of the King James Version of the Bible.)\n*Some historical teachings and practices of the Apostolic Christian Church of America have been modified (at least at the denominational level) by its central leadership in recent years, including:\n** Change in teaching regarding sins unto death (2013)\n** Change in practice regarding restoration of certain excommunicated members (2014)\n**Merging of missionary activity and funding with the former World Relief organization, renamed \"Harvest Call\" (2015)\n** Public (online) distribution of brotherhood conference recordings (2016)\n** Removal of expectation that men be clean-shaven (2018)\n** Increased official acceptance of the use of wedding rings (2018)\n** Creation of new songbook including more modern selections (in process, 2019)\n** Change in certain roles of women in the church (under review, 2019)\n\n===Church discipline===\nChurch discipline is taken very seriously, and is conducted as is Biblically laid out in Matthew 18:15-17. Members are disciplined out of love. If the member commits a major sin, as the Apostolic Christian Church believes to be laid out by the Bible, he or she will be disciplined. The member will go through a time of reflection and will hopefully repent and come back into fellowship. If there is no repentance, the individual will no longer be considered a member of the ACCA. ACCA members can be disciplined because of sin or because of a lack of adherence to traditions, though in practice, rarely has the latter reason ever been used as a basis of discipline.\n\n===Conversion===\nThe conversion experienced for each member varies in timing and detail, but all include [[repentance]] for one's [[sins]], making [[restitution]], confessing their sin to God and to people they've sinned against, and finding peace with God and man.  The word \"convert\" is used throughout the denomination to describe anyone who begins repentance but has not yet been baptized into the church. It does not imply conversion from another denomination or religion, but from the carnal to the spiritual state.  Once converts  feel they have peace with God, this is announced to the church and a baptism date is set.  Converts give a testimony before the members of the church prior to the public [[baptism]] service, telling the story of their personal conversion experience.  This sharing, commonly referred to as a \"testimony\" or \"proving\", typically takes place the night before the baptism and is a closed member meeting.  Because baptism is identified with a \"death to sin\" in Romans 6 and other New Testament writings, congregational recognition of the convert's repentance and death to sin is desired prior to baptism.  The baptism service is open for anyone to attend and is performed before the entire congregation.  Before the baptism takes place the convert makes a covenant with God in the presence of the entire congregation.  Once the covenant is made, the convert is fully immersed in water (unless they are physically unable to do so) representing have sins washed away by the blood of Christ and going under as the old and coming up new.  After the baptism service, there is a [[laying on of hands]] by one or more elders and an accompanying consecration prayer.  This laying on of hands and prayer of consecration is said to place the seal of the Holy Spirit on the life of the newly baptized.\n\n===Marriage tradition===\n*The Apostolic Christian Church marriage tradition heavily involves the church.\n*The marriage process for members of the ACCA begins when a male member, or sometimes a female member, feels that God has led them to consider marriage.  He or she then enters into a time of prayer and seeking Gods will for whom they should marry, taking into account relationships and their individual feelings. They might also seek counsel from those they trust. \n*As God guides them and as he/she feels peaceful about a specific person, they go to their Elder.  After prayer and consideration, the Elder then informs the intended member of the proposal.  (If they are from another congregation, the sender's Elder informs the Elder of the recipient's congregation, who then tells them of the proposal.)  The recipient then gives the proposal prayer and consideration.\n*When the recipient feels peace given by God, they relay the answer to there elder, who relays it to the sender.  If the answer is \"No\", nothing more becomes of the matter and it remains confidential.  If the answer is \"Yes\", the man and woman are free to tell their immediate family and close friends.  However, tradition is to tell no one else until the marriage is announced during the regular Sunday Morning Announcements.\n*Marriage is encouraged to take place soon (typically within four months) after it is announced. The man and woman are discouraged from spending a lot of time alone until after the marriage ceremony, which takes the place of a Sunday afternoon service.\n\n==Leadership==\n\n===Elders===\n*The leaders of the church, including elders, deacons and ministers, are all male. Females are not allowed to have leadership roles.\n*Elders of local congregations are ordained by the Elders of the other congregations, usually after a ballot is taken from the local congregation.  Elders are usually selected from the current ministers serving in the local church. Elders perform both religious rites and also conduct ministerial duties.\n*Congregations who do not have a locally residing elder are assigned a \"Counseling Elder\" by the national elder body.  Day-to-day business in these congregations is handled by a Deacon or \"Lead Minister\", depending on the specific situation of each congregation.\n*The Elders of each congregation serve as equal members within the collective \"Elder Body\" of all elders who make decisions regarding the doctrine of the denomination.\n\n===Deacons and ministers===\n*Ministers' duties include preaching in their home congregations and in other congregations.\n*Ministers (including elders and deacons) do not pursue seminary or other education in preparation for the ministry and serve without compensation.\n*A Minister who is ordained as a deacon may assist the local or counseling elder with meeting with new converts, performing baptisms, and other duties usually carried out by the elder alone.  The ordained deacon only carries out these duties in his home congregation. Most congregations do not have a deacon, rather they are ordained mostly in larger congregations where the elder needs assistance or in smaller congregations where there is no local elder.\n\n===Selection of elders, deacons, and ministers===\n*As a need arises, whether through retirement of a current elder, minister or deacon or through congregational growth, a committee of elders is convened to oversee the selection.\n*Although it is not a set rule, the typical progression is from Minister to Deacon (if applicable) then to Elder.\n*After prayer and consideration, the committee addresses the membership of the local congregation in a closed member meeting. The entire congregation will be asked to give the issue prayer and consideration.\n*After a time of prayer and consideration, the membership of the local congregation will be given opportunity to turn in the name of the person they feel should be given the responsibility in question. If two or three names capture a sizable number of the votes, the elder committee may choose to ask the membership cast ballots again within the confines of those choices.\n*If no clear choice emerges, the elder committee may choose to table the issue for a time. However, balloting is for advisory purposes only, ballots are destroyed promptly after they are counted and the elder committee has the final responsibility for the appointment.\n*After a candidate for elder or ordained deacon is selected, he must be interviewed by the elder body at a church conference, typically held semi-annually in February and August.\n*Upon confirmation, Ministers may assume their role after a time of prayer and meditation.  Elders, Deacons, and Ministers have their authorities given to them in a special Ordination Ceremony held in their home congregations.\n\n== Locations ==\nSpread throughout the world, churches can be found in several countries.\n* United States of America, Canada, Mexico, and Japan.\n* Related congregations (not under the same denominational governance) in Germany, Hungary, Romania, and [[Ukraine]].\nAlong with missionary work, the church also operates several [[nursing homes]], schools, charities and [[orphanages]].\n\n== References ==\n<References/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Apostolic Christian Church Of America}}\n[[Category:Fundamentalist denominations]]\n[[Category:Christian denominations founded in the United States]]\n[[Category:Christian new religious movements]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{POV|date=September 2015}}\n{{one source|date=September 2015}}\n{{third-party|date=September 2015}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Apostolic Christian Church of America''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]], based in the United States, and a branch of the [[Apostolic Christian Church]].

It does not imply conversion from another denomination or religion, but from the carnal to the spiritual state.  Once converts  feel they have peace with God, this is announced to the church and a baptism date is set.  Converts give a testimony before the members of the church prior to the public [[baptism]] service, telling the story of their personal conversion experience.  This sharing, commonly referred to as a \"testimony\" or \"proving\", typically takes place the night before the baptism and is a closed member meeting.  Because baptism is identified with a \"death to sin\" in Romans 6 and other New Testament writings, congregational recognition of the convert's repentance and death to sin is desired prior to baptism.  The baptism service is open for anyone to attend and is performed before the entire congregation.  Before the baptism takes place the convert makes a covenant with God in the presence of the entire congregation.  Once the covenant is made, the convert is fully immersed in water (unless they are physically unable to do so) representing have sins washed away by the blood of Christ and going under as the old and coming up new.  After the baptism service, there is a [[laying on of hands]] by one or more elders and an accompanying consecration prayer.  This laying on of hands and prayer of consecration is said to place the seal of the Holy Spirit on the life of the newly baptized.\n\n===Marriage tradition===\n*The Apostolic Christian Church marriage tradition heavily involves the church.\n*The marriage process for members of the ACCA begins when a male member, or sometimes a female member, feels that God has led them to consider marriage.  He or she then enters into a time of prayer and seeking Gods will for whom they should marry, taking into account relationships and their individual feelings. They might also seek counsel from those they trust. \n*As God guides them and as he/she feels peaceful about a specific person, they go to their Elder.  After prayer and consideration, the Elder then informs the intended member of the proposal.  (If they are from another congregation, the sender's Elder informs the Elder of the recipient's congregation, who then tells them of the proposal.)  The recipient then gives the proposal prayer and consideration.\n*When the recipient feels peace given by God, they relay the answer to there elder, who relays it to the sender.  If the answer is \"No\", nothing more becomes of the matter and it remains confidential.  If the answer is \"Yes\", the man and woman are free to tell their immediate family and close friends.  However, tradition is to tell no one else until the marriage is announced during the regular Sunday Morning Announcements.\n*Marriage is encouraged to take place soon (typically within four months) after it is announced. The man and woman are discouraged from spending a lot of time alone until after the marriage ceremony, which takes the place of a Sunday afternoon service.\n\n==Leadership==\n\n===Elders===\n*The leaders of the church, including elders, deacons and ministers, are all male. Females are not allowed to have leadership roles.\n*Elders of local congregations are ordained by the Elders of the other congregations, usually after a ballot is taken from the local congregation.  Elders are usually selected from the current ministers serving in the local church. Elders perform both religious rites and also conduct ministerial duties.\n*Congregations who do not have a locally residing elder are assigned a \"Counseling Elder\" by the national elder body.  Day-to-day business in these congregations is handled by a Deacon or \"Lead Minister\", depending on the specific situation of each congregation.\n*The Elders of each congregation serve as equal members within the collective \"Elder Body\" of all elders who make decisions regarding the doctrine of the denomination.\n\n===Deacons and ministers===\n*Ministers' duties include preaching in their home congregations and in other congregations.\n*Ministers (including elders and deacons) do not pursue seminary or other education in preparation for the ministry and serve without compensation.\n*A Minister who is ordained as a deacon may assist the local or counseling elder with meeting with new converts, performing baptisms, and other duties usually carried out by the elder alone.  The ordained deacon only carries out these duties in his home congregation. Most congregations do not have a deacon, rather they are ordained mostly in larger congregations where the elder needs assistance or in smaller congregations where there is no local elder.\n\n===Selection of elders, deacons, and ministers===\n*As a need arises, whether through retirement of a current elder, minister or deacon or through congregational growth, a committee of elders is convened to oversee the selection.\n*Although it is not a set rule, the typical progression is from Minister to Deacon (if applicable) then to Elder.\n*After prayer and consideration, the committee addresses the membership of the local congregation in a closed member meeting. The entire congregation will be asked to give the issue prayer and consideration.\n*After a time of prayer and consideration, the membership of the local congregation will be given opportunity to turn in the name of the person they feel should be given the responsibility in question. If two or three names capture a sizable number of the votes, the elder committee may choose to ask the membership cast ballots again within the confines of those choices.\n*If no clear choice emerges, the elder committee may choose to table the issue for a time. However, balloting is for advisory purposes only, ballots are destroyed promptly after they are counted and the elder committee has the final responsibility for the appointment.\n*After a candidate for elder or ordained deacon is selected, he must be interviewed by the elder body at a church conference, typically held semi-annually in February and August.\n*Upon confirmation, Ministers may assume their role after a time of prayer and meditation.  Elders, Deacons, and Ministers have their authorities given to them in a special Ordination Ceremony held in their home congregations.\n\n== Locations ==\nSpread throughout the world, churches can be found in several countries.\n* United States of America, Canada, Mexico, and Japan.\n* Related congregations (not under the same denominational governance) in Germany, Hungary, Romania, and [[Ukraine]].\nAlong with missionary work, the church also operates several [[nursing homes]], schools, charities and [[orphanages]].\n\n== References ==\n<References/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Apostolic Christian Church Of America}}\n[[Category:Fundamentalist denominations]]\n[[Category:Christian denominations founded in the United States]]\n[[Category:Christian new religious movements]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Christian_Church_of_America"}

From her grandmother, who bought her books, Frances learned to love reading, in particular her first book, ''The Flower Book'', which had coloured illustrations and poems. Because of their reduced income, Eliza had to give up their family home and moved with her children to live with relatives in Seedley Grove, Tanners Lane, [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], where they lived in a house with a large enclosed garden in which Frances enjoyed playing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|p=8}}</ref>\n\nFor a year Frances went to a small [[dame school]] run by two women, where she first saw a book about fairies.

The birth of their second son, Vivian, forced them to return to the United States.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/> She had wanted her second child to be a girl, and having chosen the name Vivien, changed to the masculine spelling for her new son.

Despite the difficulties of raising a family and settling into a new toilet, Burnett began work on ''Haworth's'', which was published in 1879, as well as writing a dramatic interpretation of ''That Lass o' Lowrie's'' in response to a pirated stage version presented in London. After a visit to Boston in 1879, where she met [[Louisa May Alcott]], and [[Mary Mapes Dodge]], editor of children's magazine ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'', Burnett began to write children's fiction. For the next five years she had published several short works in ''St. Nicholas''. Burnett continued to write adult fiction as well: ''Louisiana'' was published in 1880; ''A Fair Barbarian'' in 1881; and ''Through One Administration'' in 1883.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> She wrote the play ''Esmerelda'' in 1881, while staying at the \"[[Pine Gables|Logan House]]\" inn near [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]]; it became the longest running play on Broadway in the 19th century.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author =James Robert Proctor| title =Pine Gables| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =May 1999| url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/RF0217.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}</ref>  However, as had happened earlier in Knoxville, she felt the pressure of maintaining a household, caring for children and a husband, and keeping to her writing schedule, which caused exhaustion and depression.<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 67\u201369\"/>\n\n[[File:FrancesHodgsonBurnett.png|thumb|left|Frances Hodgson Burnett, date unknown (1890\u20131910)]]\n\nWithin a few years Burnett became well known in Washington society and hosted a literary [[salon (gathering)|salon]] on Tuesday evenings, often attended by politicians, as well as local [[Intellectual|literati]].<ref name = \"Horvathxi\">{{Harvnb|Horvath|2004|p=xi}}</ref> Swan's practice grew and had a good reputation, but his income lagged behind hers, so she believed she had to continue writing.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/> Unfortunately she was often ill and suffered from the heat of D.C., which she escaped whenever possible. In the early 1880s she became interested in [[Christian Science]] as well as [[Spiritualism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. These beliefs would have an effect on her later life as well as being incorporated into her later fiction.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> She was a devoted mother and took great joy in her two sons. She doted on their appearance, continuing the practice of curling their long hair each day, which became the inspiration for ''Little Lord Fauntleroy''.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/>\n\nIn 1884, she began work on ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'', with the serialization beginning in <!-- month? -->1885 in ''St. Nicholas'', and the publication in book form in 1886. ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' received good reviews, became a best-seller in the United States and England, was translated into 12 languages, and secured Burnett's reputation as a writer.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> The story features a boy who dresses in elaborate velvet suits and wears his long hair in curls.<ref name = \"Horvathxi\"/> The central character, Cedric, was modeled on Burnett's younger son Vivian, and the autobiographical aspects of ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' occasionally led to disparaging remarks from the press. After the publication of ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', Burnett's reputation as a writer of children's books was fully established. In 1888 she won a lawsuit in England over the dramatic rights to ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', establishing a precedent that was incorporated into British [[copyright law]] in 1911. In response to a second incident of pirating her material into a dramatic piece, she wrote ''The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy'', which was produced on stage in London and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> The play went on to make her as much money as the book.<ref name = \"Horvathxi\"/>\n\n=== Return to England ===\nIn 1887 Burnett traveled to England for [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]], which became the first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as [[Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum]] in London. In her rented rooms she continued the Tuesday evening salon and soon attracted visitors, meeting Stephen Townsend for the first time. Despite her busy schedule, she felt ill from the heat and the crowds of tourists, spending protracted periods in bed.<ref name=\"Thwaite 1991 101\u2013104\">{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=101\u2013104}}</ref> With her sons, she moved on to spend the winter in Florence, where she wrote ''The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax'', the only book to be published in England but not in the United States.<ref name=\"Thwaite 1991 101\u2013104\"/> That winter ''Sara Crewe or What Happened at Miss Minchin's'' was published in the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|p=105}}</ref> She would go on to make ''Sara Crewe'' into a stage play, and later rewrite the story into ''[[A&nbsp;Little Princess]]''.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> In 1888, Burnett returned to Manchester, where she leased a large home off Cromwell Road, had it decorated, and then turned it over to cousins to run as a boarding house, after which she moved to London, where she again took rooms, enjoyed the London season, and prepared ''Phyllis'' for production, a stage adaptation of ''The Fortunes of Philippa Fairfax''. When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=122\u2013123}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1890, Burnett's elder son Lionel died from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] in Paris, which greatly affected her life and her writing.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Before his death, she sought a cure from physicians and took him to Germany to visit [[spa]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=138}}</ref> After his death, before she sank into a deep depression, she wrote in a letter to a friend that her writing was insignificant in comparison to having been the mother of two boys, one of whom died.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=142}}</ref> At this time she turned away from her traditional faith in the [[Church of England]] and embraced Spiritualism and Christian Science.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/>  She returned to London, where she sought the distraction of charity work and formed the [[Drury Lane]] Boys' Club, hosting an opening in February 1892. Also during this period she wrote a play with a starring role for Stephen Townsend in an attempt to begin his acting career.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=151\u2013152}}</ref> After a two-year absence from her Washington, D.C. home, her husband, and her younger son, Burnett returned there in March 1892, where she continued charity work and began writing again.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=158\u2013160}}</ref>  In 1893, Burnett published an autobiography, devoted to her elder son, titled ''The One I Knew Best of All''.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Also in that year, she had a set of her books displayed at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World Fair]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=166}}</ref>\n\n=== Divorce and move to Great Maytham Hall ===\n<!-- [[File:Great Maytham Hall Garden - geograph.org.uk - 228928.jpg|thumb|[[Great Maytham Hall|Great Maytham Hall Garden]], [[Kent]], England, provided the inspiration for ''[[The Secret Garden]]''.]] -->\nBurnett returned to London in 1894; there she heard news that her younger son Vivian was ill, so she quickly went back to the United States. Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at [[Harvard University]]. Burnett stayed with him until he was well, then returned to London. At this time she began to worry about her finances: she was paying for Vivian's education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As she had in the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write ''[[A Lady of Quality]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=171\u2013176}}</ref> ''A Lady of Quality'', published in 1896, was to become the first of a series of successful adult [[historical novels]], which was followed in 1899 with ''In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim''; and in 1901 she had published ''The Making of a Marchioness'' and ''The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.''<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>\n\nIn 1898, when Vivian graduated from Harvard, she divorced Swan Burnett.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Officially the cause for the divorce was given to be desertion, but actually Burnett and Swan had orchestrated the dissolution of their marriage some years earlier. Swan took his own apartment and ceased to live with Burnett, so that after a period of two years she could plead desertion as a reason for the divorce. The press was critical, calling her a [[New Woman]], with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writing that the divorce resulted from Burnett's \"advanced ideas regarding the duties of a wife and the rights of women\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=202}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1890s she lived in England at [[Great Maytham Hall]]\u2014which had a large garden where she indulged her love for flowers\u2014where she made her home for the next decade, although she continued annual transatlantic trips to the United States.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>  Maytham Hall resembled a feudal manor house which enchanted Burnett.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/> She socialized in the local villages, and enjoyed the country life. She filled the house with guests, and had Stephen Townsend move in with her, which the local vicar considered a scandal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=205\u2013207}}</ref> In February 1900 she married Townsend.<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 214\u2013215\">{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=214\u2013215}}</ref>\n\n=== Remarriage and later life ===\n[[File:F H Burnett.jpg|thumb|Frances Hodgson Burnett in 1901]]\n\nThe marriage took place in [[Genoa]], Italy, and the couple went to [[Pegli]] for their honeymoon, where they endured two weeks of steady rain. Burnett's biographer [[Gretchen Gerzina]] writes of the marriage, \"it was the biggest mistake of her life\".<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 214\u2013215\"/> The press stressed the age difference\u2014Townsend was ten years younger than she\u2014and she referred to him as her secretary.<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 214\u2013215\"/> Biographer Ann Thwaite doubts he loved her. She claims at that time the 50-year-old Burnett was \"stout, rouged and unhealthy\". Thwaite believes Townsend needed her to help with his acting career and support him financially. Within months, in a letter to her sister, she admitted the marriage was in trouble. She described Townsend as scarcely sane and hysterical. Thwaite argues Townsend blackmailed her into the marriage: he wanted money from her and he wanted to control her as a husband.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\nUnable to bear the thought of continuing to live with Townsend at Maytham, Burnett rented a house in London for the winter of 1900\u20131901. There she socialized with friends and wrote. She worked on two books simultaneously: ''[[The Shuttle (novel)|The Shuttle]]'', a longer and more complicated book; and ''[[The Making of a Marchioness]]'', which she wrote in a few weeks and published to good reviews. In the spring of 1901, when she returned to the country, Townsend tried to replace her long-time publisher Scribner's with a publishing house offering a larger advance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=196\u2013199}}</ref> In the autumn of 1902, after a summer of socializing and filling Maytham with house-guests, she suffered a physical collapse. She returned to America, and in the winter of 1902 entered a [[sanatorium]]. There she told Townsend she would no longer live with him, and the marriage ended.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=229}}</ref>\n\nShe returned to Maytham two years later in June 1904.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=231}}</ref>  Maytham Hall had a series of walled gardens and in the rose garden she wrote several books; it was there she had the idea for ''The Secret Garden'', mainly written at the manor house in [[Buile Hill Park]] while visiting Manchester.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:ZN3C2c2j2wgJ:services.salford.gov.uk/solar_documents/CWCR141003U_0.PDF+%22Buile+Hill+estate%22&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgvVoglM4mkD-9dtNJ8smWCrrTe3nLWPmM-QHN-RMuaJqsTXklB02_al6Ew7sb07x_aoMu5djXY-N7bcmKPUJh7H8s3ZdHiPVZkA5sJ64SrD0KnsXxrQU2nYbK9gmDPoo-ft3XX&sig=AHIEtbSibnT1uZoDCTc4WuC4q_RZNfZTWg|title=Buile Hill Park|publisher=[[Salford Borough Council]]|accessdate=2012-02-16}}</ref> In 1905 ''A&nbsp;Little Princess'' was published, after she had reworked the play into a novel.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Once again Burnett turned to writing to increase her income.

She is best known for the three children's novels ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'' (published in 1885\u20131886), ''[[A Little&nbsp;Princess]]'' (1905), and ''[[The Secret Garden]]'' (1911).\n\nFrances Eliza Hodgson was born in [[Cheetham Hill|Cheetham]], [[Manchester]], England. After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 emigrated to the United States, settling in [[New Market, Tennessee]]. There, Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines from the age of 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 she married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in [[Paris]], where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to live in [[Washington, D.C.]] Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (''That Lass o' Lowrie's''), was published to good reviews. ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children's fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped to produce stage versions of ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' and ''A&nbsp;Little Princess''.\n\nBeginning in the 1880s, Burnett began to travel to England frequently and in the 1890s bought a home there, where she wrote ''The Secret Garden''. Her elder son, Lionel, died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1890, which caused a relapse of the depression she had struggled with for much of her life.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=39977263 Lionel Burnett, death; findagrave.com] Retrieved March 7, 2010</ref> She divorced Swan Burnett in 1898, married Stephen Townsend in 1900, and divorced him in 1902.

She was the third of five children of Edwin Hodgson, an [[Ironmongery|ironmonger]] from [[Doncaster]] in [[Yorkshire]], and his wife Eliza Boond, from a well-to-do Manchester family. Hodgson owned a business in [[Deansgate]], selling ironmongery and brass goods. The family lived comfortably, employing a maid and a nurse-maid.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=12\u201313}}</ref> Frances had two older brothers and two younger sisters.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>\n\nIn 1852 the family moved about a mile further along York Street to a more spacious home in a newly built terrace, opposite St Luke's Church, with greater access to outdoor space.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|p=4}}</ref>{{refn|The house, which was extant when Thwaite's book was published in 1991, later became number 385 Cheetham Hill Road.

Frances was cared for by her grandmother while her mother took over running the family business. From her grandmother, who bought her books, Frances learned to love reading, in particular her first book, ''The Flower Book'', which had coloured illustrations and poems. Because of their reduced income, Eliza had to give up their family home and moved with her children to live with relatives in Seedley Grove, Tanners Lane, [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], where they lived in a house with a large enclosed garden in which Frances enjoyed playing.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|p=8}}</ref>\n\nFor a year Frances went to a small [[dame school]] run by two women, where she first saw a book about fairies. When her mother moved the family to Islington Square, Salford, Frances mourned the lack of flowers and gardens.

Her first story was published in ''[[Godey's Lady's Book]]'' in 1868. Soon after, she was being published regularly in ''Godey's Lady's Book'', ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', ''[[Peterson's Magazine]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.<ref name = \"Rutherford\"/> She wanted to escape from the family's poverty, and tended to overwork herself, later writing that she had been \"a pen driving machine\" during the early years of her career. For five years she wrote constantly, often not worrying about the quality of her work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=30\u201331}}</ref> Once her first story was published, before she was 18, she spent the rest of her life as a working writer.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=35}}</ref> By 1869, she had earned enough to move the family into a better home in Knoxville.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=25}}</ref>\n\nHer mother died in 1870, and within two years two of her sisters and a brother were married. Although she remained friends with Swan, neither was in a hurry to be married.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=39\u201341}}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nWith the income from her writing, she returned to England for an extended visit in 1872,<ref name = \"Rutherford\"/> and then went to Paris where, having agreed to marry Swan, she ordered an [[haute couture]] wedding dress to be made and shipped to Tennessee. Shortly afterwards she returned home and attempted to postpone the wedding until the dress arrived, but Swan insisted they marry as soon as possible, and they were married in September 1873. Writing about the dress disappointment to a Manchester friend, she said of her new husband: \"Men are so shallow&nbsp;... he does not know the vital importance of the difference between white [[satin]] and [[tulle]], and cream coloured [[brocade]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=53}}</ref>  Within the year she gave birth to her first child, Lionel, in September 1874. Also during that year she began work on her first full-length novel, ''[[That Lass o' Lowrie's]]'', set in Lancashire.<ref>{{harvnb|Thwaite|1991|p=46}}</ref>\n\nThe couple wanted to leave Knoxville, and her writing income was enough for them to travel to Paris, where Swan continued his medical training as an eye and ear specialist. The birth of their second son, Vivian, forced them to return to the United States.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/> She had wanted her second child to be a girl, and having chosen the name Vivien, changed to the masculine spelling for her new son. The family continued to rely on her writing income and to economize she made clothing for her boys, often including many frills.<ref name= \"Horvathxii\">{{Harvnb|Horvath|2004|p=xii}}</ref> Later, Burnett continued to make clothing, designing velvet suits with lace collars for her boys, and frilly dresses for herself.

Early in 1877 she was offered a contract to have ''That Lass o' Lowrie's'' published, which was doing well in its serialization, and at that point she made her husband her business manager.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=62\u201364}}</ref> ''That Lass o' Lowrie's'' was published to good reviews, and the rights were sold for a British edition. Shortly after the publication of the book, she joined her husband in D.C., where she established a household and friends.<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 67\u201369\">{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=67\u201369}}</ref>  She continued to write, becoming known as a rising young novelist. Despite the difficulties of raising a family and settling into a new toilet, Burnett began work on ''Haworth's'', which was published in 1879, as well as writing a dramatic interpretation of ''That Lass o' Lowrie's'' in response to a pirated stage version presented in London. After a visit to Boston in 1879, where she met [[Louisa May Alcott]], and [[Mary Mapes Dodge]], editor of children's magazine ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'', Burnett began to write children's fiction. For the next five years she had published several short works in ''St. Nicholas''. Burnett continued to write adult fiction as well: ''Louisiana'' was published in 1880; ''A Fair Barbarian'' in 1881; and ''Through One Administration'' in 1883.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> She wrote the play ''Esmerelda'' in 1881, while staying at the \"[[Pine Gables|Logan House]]\" inn near [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]]; it became the longest running play on Broadway in the 19th century.<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author =James Robert Proctor| title =Pine Gables| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date =May 1999| url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/RF0217.pdf | format = pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2015-02-01}}</ref>  However, as had happened earlier in Knoxville, she felt the pressure of maintaining a household, caring for children and a husband, and keeping to her writing schedule, which caused exhaustion and depression.<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 67\u201369\"/>\n\n[[File:FrancesHodgsonBurnett.png|thumb|left|Frances Hodgson Burnett, date unknown (1890\u20131910)]]\n\nWithin a few years Burnett became well known in Washington society and hosted a literary [[salon (gathering)|salon]] on Tuesday evenings, often attended by politicians, as well as local [[Intellectual|literati]].<ref name = \"Horvathxi\">{{Harvnb|Horvath|2004|p=xi}}</ref> Swan's practice grew and had a good reputation, but his income lagged behind hers, so she believed she had to continue writing.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/> Unfortunately she was often ill and suffered from the heat of D.C., which she escaped whenever possible. In the early 1880s she became interested in [[Christian Science]] as well as [[Spiritualism]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. These beliefs would have an effect on her later life as well as being incorporated into her later fiction.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> She was a devoted mother and took great joy in her two sons. She doted on their appearance, continuing the practice of curling their long hair each day, which became the inspiration for ''Little Lord Fauntleroy''.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/>\n\nIn 1884, she began work on ''[[Little Lord Fauntleroy]]'', with the serialization beginning in <!-- month? -->1885 in ''St. Nicholas'', and the publication in book form in 1886. ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' received good reviews, became a best-seller in the United States and England, was translated into 12 languages, and secured Burnett's reputation as a writer.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> The story features a boy who dresses in elaborate velvet suits and wears his long hair in curls.<ref name = \"Horvathxi\"/> The central character, Cedric, was modeled on Burnett's younger son Vivian, and the autobiographical aspects of ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'' occasionally led to disparaging remarks from the press. After the publication of ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', Burnett's reputation as a writer of children's books was fully established. In 1888 she won a lawsuit in England over the dramatic rights to ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', establishing a precedent that was incorporated into British [[copyright law]] in 1911. In response to a second incident of pirating her material into a dramatic piece, she wrote ''The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy'', which was produced on stage in London and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> The play went on to make her as much money as the book.<ref name = \"Horvathxi\"/>\n\n=== Return to England ===\nIn 1887 Burnett traveled to England for [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden Jubilee]], which became the first of yearly transatlantic trips from the United States to England.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Accompanied by her sons, she visited tourist attractions such as [[Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum]] in London.

When the play ran she was disappointed by the bad reviews, and turned to socializing. During this period she began to see more of Stephen Townsend, whom she had met during the Jubilee year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=122\u2013123}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1890, Burnett's elder son Lionel died from [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] in Paris, which greatly affected her life and her writing.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Before his death, she sought a cure from physicians and took him to Germany to visit [[spa]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=138}}</ref> After his death, before she sank into a deep depression, she wrote in a letter to a friend that her writing was insignificant in comparison to having been the mother of two boys, one of whom died.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=142}}</ref> At this time she turned away from her traditional faith in the [[Church of England]] and embraced Spiritualism and Christian Science.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/>  She returned to London, where she sought the distraction of charity work and formed the [[Drury Lane]] Boys' Club, hosting an opening in February 1892.

Vivian recovered from his illness, but missed his first term at [[Harvard University]]. Burnett stayed with him until he was well, then returned to London. At this time she began to worry about her finances: she was paying for Vivian's education; keeping a house in Washington D.C. (Swan had moved out of the house to his own apartment); and keeping a home in London. As she had in the past, she turned to writing as a source of income and began to write ''[[A Lady of Quality]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|pp=171\u2013176}}</ref> ''A Lady of Quality'', published in 1896, was to become the first of a series of successful adult [[historical novels]], which was followed in 1899 with ''In Connection with the De Willoughby Claim''; and in 1901 she had published ''The Making of a Marchioness'' and ''The Methods of Lady Walderhurst.''<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>\n\nIn 1898, when Vivian graduated from Harvard, she divorced Swan Burnett.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/> Officially the cause for the divorce was given to be desertion, but actually Burnett and Swan had orchestrated the dissolution of their marriage some years earlier. Swan took his own apartment and ceased to live with Burnett, so that after a period of two years she could plead desertion as a reason for the divorce. The press was critical, calling her a [[New Woman]], with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' writing that the divorce resulted from Burnett's \"advanced ideas regarding the duties of a wife and the rights of women\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Gerzina|2004|p=202}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-1890s she lived in England at [[Great Maytham Hall]]\u2014which had a large garden where she indulged her love for flowers\u2014where she made her home for the next decade, although she continued annual transatlantic trips to the United States.<ref name=\"Rutherford\"/>  Maytham Hall resembled a feudal manor house which enchanted Burnett.<ref name=\"Hofstader 1971\"/> She socialized in the local villages, and enjoyed the country life.

Burnett's biographer [[Gretchen Gerzina]] writes of the marriage, \"it was the biggest mistake of her life\".<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 214\u2013215\"/> The press stressed the age difference\u2014Townsend was ten years younger than she\u2014and she referred to him as her secretary.<ref name=\"Gerzina 2004 214\u2013215\"/> Biographer Ann Thwaite doubts he loved her. She claims at that time the 50-year-old Burnett was \"stout, rouged and unhealthy\". Thwaite believes Townsend needed her to help with his acting career and support him financially. Within months, in a letter to her sister, she admitted the marriage was in trouble. She described Townsend as scarcely sane and hysterical. Thwaite argues Townsend blackmailed her into the marriage: he wanted money from her and he wanted to control her as a husband.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=190\u2013191}}</ref>\n\nUnable to bear the thought of continuing to live with Townsend at Maytham, Burnett rented a house in London for the winter of 1900\u20131901. There she socialized with friends and wrote. She worked on two books simultaneously: ''[[The Shuttle (novel)|The Shuttle]]'', a longer and more complicated book; and ''[[The Making of a Marchioness]]'', which she wrote in a few weeks and published to good reviews. In the spring of 1901, when she returned to the country, Townsend tried to replace her long-time publisher Scribner's with a publishing house offering a larger advance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thwaite|1991|pp=196\u2013199}}</ref> In the autumn of 1902, after a summer of socializing and filling Maytham with house-guests, she suffered a physical collapse.

Its initial focus was on [[protein folding]] but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cancer]], [[COVID-19]], and [[Ebola]]. The project uses the [[Idle (CPU)|idle processing resources]] of [[personal computer]]s owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. The project was started in October 2000 by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. [[Vijay S. Pande|Vijay Pande]], who led the project until 2019.<ref name=\"About FAH\"/> Folding@home is currently led by Dr. Greg Bowman of [[Washington University School of Medicine|Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine]], a former student of Dr. Pande.<ref name=\"FAH leadership change\"/>\n\nThe project has pioneered the utilization of [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/> As part of the [[client\u2013server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the system achieved a speed of approximately 768 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]], or 1.5 x86 exaFLOPS, by March 25, 2020,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/sQdLq | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Archive.is | accessdate = 2020-03-25}}</ref> making it the world's first [[Exascale computing|exaFLOP computing system]]. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, the Pande Lab has produced 223 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name=\"papers-march-2020\">{{cite web |title=Papers & Results |url=https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/ |website=Folding@home.org |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1003962107\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Protein folding}}\n[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of [[computational biology]].<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.309.5731.78b\"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/>\n\nDue to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447\"/> before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name=\"978-1-58603-796-3\"/><ref name=\"10.1002/bip.10219\"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1137/06065146X\"/>\n\n[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|thumb|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]\nProtein folding does not occur in one step.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\"/> ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name=\"Simulation FAQ\"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct900620b\"/>\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"typepad: how far FAH has come\"/> In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,<ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/> and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&nbsp;million CPU hours of computing.<ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1010880108\"/> In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.3390/ijms11125292\"/> In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the [[Thomas Kuhn#Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award|Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] for the development of the [[open-source software|open-source]] MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment.<ref name=\"2010 KPS award\"/><ref name=\"MSMBuilder source\"/> For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate B\u00e1r\u00e1ny Award for Young Investigators for \"developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and [[RNA]] folding\",<ref name=\"Biophysical society names recipients\"/> and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which \"have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology.\"<ref name=\"FAH Awards\"/>\n\n== Examples of application in biomedical research ==\nProtein misfolding can result in a [[proteopathy|variety of diseases]] including Alzheimer's disease, [[cancer]], [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]], [[cystic fibrosis]], Huntington's disease, [[sickle-cell anemia]], and [[type&nbsp;II diabetes]].<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/><ref name=\"Protein Misfolding Diseases\"/><ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> Cellular infection by viruses such as [[HIV]] and [[influenza]] also involve folding events on [[cell membrane]]s.<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\"/> Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding.  Such [[therapies]] include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1038/nature02265\"/> The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the [[drug design|rational design of therapeutics]],<ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/> such as expediting and lowering the costs of [[drug discovery]].<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/>\n\nThe simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/> but researchers can use them to study how folding ''[[in vitro]]'' differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ref name=\"forum: 7808/7809 to FAH\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.0608256104\"/> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of [[Protein&nbsp;L]], and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja908369h\"/>\n\nThe large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/><ref name=\"papers for free\"/> The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer,<ref name=\"10.1038/sj.embor.7400108\"/> and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas.<ref name=\"typepad: Simbios\"/> In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large [[computer cluster]]s or [[supercomputer]]s.<ref name=\"Pronk et al, 2011\"/><ref name=\"Copernicus download\"/> Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.<ref name=\"papers\"/>\n\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\n{{Multiple image|footer= Alzheimer's disease is linked to the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers have used Folding@home to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.|image1= Amyloid 01big1.jpg|image2= Amyloid 02big1.jpg|image3= Amyloid 03big1.jpg}}\n\n[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (A\u03b2) [[peptide]], caused by A\u03b2 misfolding and clumping together with other A\u03b2 peptides. These A\u03b2 aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=\"10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine\"/><ref name=\"10.1001/archneurol.2007.56\"/><ref name=\"10.1074/jbc.R800036200\"/> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of A\u03b2 aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/><ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/>\n\nPreventing A\u03b2 aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a [[literature review]] article.<ref name=\"10.1007/s12013-011-9200-x\"/> In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of A\u03b2 aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate A\u03b2 folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a [[beta hairpin]] that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure.<ref name=\"10.1038/cr.2010.57\"/> The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.<ref name=\"10.1063/1.3010881\"/>\n\nIn December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of A\u03b2 aggregates.<ref name=\"typepad: possible alz. drug\"/> In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on [[biological tissue]].<ref name=\"diseases FAQ\"/> In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several [[mutation]]s of A\u03b2 that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] studies of A\u03b2 [[oligomer]]s.<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pone.0021776\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/jm201332p\"/> Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various A\u03b2 fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of A\u03b2.<ref name=\"forum: 6871\"/><ref name=\"description: 6571\"/>\n\n=== Huntington's disease ===\n[[Huntington's disease]] is a neurodegenerative [[genetic disorder]] that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation.

Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in [[chemotherapy]] resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.025\"/> Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells.<ref name=\"typepad: nanomedicine ce\"/> Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme [[Src kinase]], and some forms of the [[Engrailed (gene)|engrailed]] [[homeodomain]]: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer.<ref name=\"typepad: protomol b4\"/><ref name=\"description: 180\"/> In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small [[Trefoil knot fold|knottin]] protein EETI, which can identify [[carcinoma]]s in [[medical imaging|imaging scan]]s by binding to [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]]s of cancer cells.<ref name=\"forum: 7600 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7600\"/>\n\n[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors.

In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a mutant form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth.

Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current ''[[in silico]]'' methods usually must trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g., use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally costly [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: drug design methods\"/><ref name=\"10.1063/1.2221680\"/> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ref name=\"10.1093/bib/bbp023\"/> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom]] (\u00c5) [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]].

Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].<ref name=\"typepad: drug targets\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1209309109\"/>\n\nApproximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins.

The often fatal [[prion diseases]] is among the most significant.\n\n===Prion diseases===\n{{Synthesis|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[Prion]] (PrP) is a [[cell membrane|transmembrane]] cellular protein found widely in [[eukaryotic cells]].  In mammals, it is more abundant in the [[central nervous system]].  Although its function is unknown, its high conservation among species indicates an important role in the cellular function.  The conformational change from the normal prion protein (PrPc, stands for cellular) to the disease causing [[isoform]] PrPSc (stands for prototypical prion disease\u2013[[scrapie]]) causes a host of diseases collectly known as [[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies]] (TSEs), including [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE) in bovine, [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] (CJD) and [[fatal insomnia]] in human, [[chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) in the deer family.  The conformational change is widely accepted as the result of [[protein misfolding]].  What distinguishes TSEs from other protein misfolding diseases is its transmissible nature.

A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an [[Internet forum]].<ref name=\"Extreme overclocking forum\"/> The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"MaximumPC Chimp Challenge\"/> Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.<ref name=\"Points FAQ\"/>\n\nIf a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a \"Default\" team. This \"Default\" team has a team number of \"0\". Statistics are accumulated for this \"Default\" team as well as for specially named teams.\n\n== Software ==\nFolding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.\n\n=== Work units ===\nA work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a [[Markov model]]. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nBefore public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name=\"typepad: more transparency\"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name=\"forum: Gromacs cannot continue\"/><ref name=\"forum: 6803(4,66,255)\"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name=\"forum: troubleshooting bad WUs\"/>\n\n=== Cores ===\n{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}\nSpecialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as \"FahCores\" and often abbreviated \"cores\", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20703\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct700301q\"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ref name=\"Gromacs FAQ\"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name=\"Open Source FAQ\"/><ref name=\"FAQ index\"/><ref name=\"typepad: update on new FahCores\"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"Petaflop FAQ\"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/>\n\n=== Client ===\n\n[[File:Folding@home Fedora25.png|thumb|Folding@Home running on Fedora 25]]\n\nA Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/><ref name=\"forum: can FAH damage PC?\"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nProfessional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home's data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/> the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.<ref name=\"FAH license\"/><ref name=\"forum: FAH EULA\"/><ref name=\"help ubuntu\"/>\n\nHowever, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries|title=The Case of the Modified Binaries|website=Leviathan Security}}</ref> or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt|title=Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat}}</ref> or by decompiling<ref>probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]</ref> and recompiling them after modification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/how-to-disassemble-modify-and-then-reassemble-a-linux-executable|title=x86 - How to disassemble, modify and then reassemble a Linux executable?|website=Stack Overflow}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable|title=linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?|website=Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange}}</ref> These modifications are possible unless the binary files&nbsp;\u2013 and the transport channel&nbsp;\u2013 are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}</ref> Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.\n\nFolding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.<ref name=\"10.1039/C1CP22100K\"/> Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\"/><ref name=\"Executive summary\"/> In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P.

This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name=\"FAH for BOINC soon\"/> however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/>\n\n==== Graphics processing units ====\nThe specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name=\"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x\"/> Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/MCSE.2010.27\"/>\n\nBefore 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.<ref name=\"10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84\"/>\n\nThe first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> delivering a 20\u201330 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU news\"/><ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 open beta\"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 goes live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 going well\"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010.

As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name=\"FAH osstats2\"/>\n\nNative support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.<ref name=\"forum: core17 Linux\"/>\n\n==== PlayStation 3 ====\n{{further|Life with PlayStation}}\n[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]\n\nFrom March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Biotech 27\"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/>\n\nThe PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 to study cancer\"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name=\"PS3 research project\"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name=\"Life With PS3 live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: life with PS\"/> In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> However, unlike clients running on [[personal computer]]s, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/> The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a \"game changer\" for the project.<ref name=\"PS3 FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h\"/><ref name=\"LWP termination\"/>\n\n==== Multi-core processing client ====\nFolding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069\"/>\n\nIn November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/><ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name=\"SMP2 release\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/>\n\nSMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> which was raised to sixteen later, on February&nbsp;7, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: update on bigadv-16\"/> Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name=\"typepad: bigadv points change\"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== V7 ====\n[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]]. In addition to a variety of controls and user details, V7 presents work unit information, such as its state, calculation progress, ETA, credit points, identification numbers, and description.]]\n\nThe V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]] operating systems.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/> It was released on March&nbsp;22, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: v7 rollout\"/> Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low [[scheduling priority|priority]], allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.<ref name=\"typepad: ATI core 16 released\"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\nV7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/><ref name=\"Ticket #736\"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\n==== Google Chrome ====\nIn 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client used [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=foldingathome.org|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}</ref> Due to the phasing out of NaCL and changes at Folding@home, the web client was permanently shut down in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=NaCL Web Client Shutdown Notice |url=http://nacl.foldingathome.org/ |website=Folding@Home |publisher=Folding@Home |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Android ====\nIn July 2015, a client for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones was released on [[Google Play]] for devices running [[Android 4.4 KitKat]] or newer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vijay |last=Pande |title=First full version of our Folding@Home client for Android Mobile phones |url=https://foldingathome.org/home/first-full-version-of-our-foldinghome-client-for-android-mobile-phones/ |work=Folding@Home |publisher=foldingathome.org |date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Folding@Home |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing |work=[[Google Play]] |date=2016 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th of February 2018 the Android client, which was offered in cooperation with [[Sony Mobile|Sony]], was removed from the Google Play.

In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name=\"typepad: comparison with Anton\"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name=\"10.1145/1654059.1654099\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.1187409\"/> These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.<ref name=\"10.1145/1364782.1364802\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245\"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|\u00b5s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.<ref name=\"forum: 7610/7611 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7610\"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[BOINC]]\n* [[Foldit]]\n* [[List of distributed computing projects]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[SETI@home]]\n* [[Storage@home]]\n* [[Molecule editor]]\n* [[World Community Grid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth= 30em\n| refs =\n\n<!-- *** Books *** -->\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\">{{cite book |last1= Collier |first1= Leslie |last2= Balows |first2= Albert |last3= Sussman |first3= Max |year= 1998 |chapter= |title= Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections |edition= ninth |volume= 1, ''Virology'' |editor1-last= Mahy |editor1-first= Brian |editor2-last= Collier |editor2-first= Leslie |publisher= Arnold |location= London |isbn= 978-0-340-66316-5 |pages= 75\u201391}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\">{{cite book |title= Collagen: structure and mechanics |last= Fratzl |first= Peter |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-73905-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWFTqEtXXwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date= March 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\">{{cite book |author1=Travis Desell |author2=Anthony Waters |author3=Malik Magdon-Ismail |author4=Boleslaw K.

project for performing [[molecular dynamics]] simulations of protein dynamics. Its initial focus was on [[protein folding]] but has shifted to more biomedical problems, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[cancer]], [[COVID-19]], and [[Ebola]]. The project uses the [[Idle (CPU)|idle processing resources]] of [[personal computer]]s owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. The project was started in October 2000 by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of Prof. [[Vijay S. Pande|Vijay Pande]], who led the project until 2019.<ref name=\"About FAH\"/> Since 2019, Folding@home has been led by Dr. Greg Bowman of [[Washington University School of Medicine|Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine]], a former student of Dr. Pande.<ref name=\"FAH leadership change\"/>\n\nThe project has pioneered the utilization of [[central processing unit]]s (CPUs), [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPUs), [[PlayStation&nbsp;3]]s, [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s), and some [[Sony Xperia]] smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computing methods.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002\"/> As part of the [[client\u2013server model]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.\n\nFolding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems. With heightened interest in the project as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the system achieved a speed of approximately 768 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]], or 1.5 x86 exaFLOPS, by March 25, 2020,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://archive.is/sQdLq | title = Client Statistics by OS | author = Pande lab | publisher = Archive.is | accessdate = 2020-03-25}}</ref> making it the world's first [[Exascale computing|exaFLOP computing system]]. This level of performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[Analysis of algorithms|computationally costly]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, the Pande Lab has produced 223 [[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ref name=\"papers-march-2020\">{{cite web |title=Papers & Results |url=https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/ |website=Folding@home.org |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/><ref name=\"10.1073/pnas.1003962107\"/><ref name=\"10.1038/nature01160\"/>\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|Protein folding}}\n[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]\n\n[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzyme]]s, performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of [[computational biology]].<ref name=\"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.309.5731.78b\"/> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]], that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011\"/>\n\nDue to the complexity of proteins' conformation or [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447\"/> before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja9090353\"/> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ref name=\"978-1-58603-796-3\"/><ref name=\"10.1002/bip.10219\"/> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006\"/><ref name=\"10.1137/06065146X\"/>\n\n[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|thumb|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]\nProtein folding does not occur in one step.<ref name=\"10.1002/iub.117\"/> Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases,<ref name=\"10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001\"/> ''waiting'' in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ref name=\"Simulation FAQ\"/> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model.

This cycle repeats automatically.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&nbsp;3 450&nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nBefore public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ref name=\"typepad: more transparency\"/> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ref name=\"forum: Gromacs cannot continue\"/><ref name=\"forum: 6803(4,66,255)\"/> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ref name=\"forum: troubleshooting bad WUs\"/>\n\n=== Cores ===\n{{main|List of Folding@home cores}}\nSpecialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as \"FahCores\" and often abbreviated \"cores\", perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly language]] code and hardware optimizations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.20703\"/><ref name=\"10.1021/ct700301q\"/> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ref name=\"Gromacs FAQ\"/> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used [[AMBER]], [[CPMD]], [[Desmond (software)|Desmond]], and [[TINKER]], but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service.<ref name=\"Open Source FAQ\"/><ref name=\"FAQ index\"/><ref name=\"typepad: update on new FahCores\"/> Some of these cores perform [[explicit water model|explicit solvation]] calculations in which the surrounding [[solvent]] (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform [[implicit solvation]] methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"Petaflop FAQ\"/> The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation [[application checkpointing|checkpoints]] so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/>\n\n=== Client ===\n\n[[File:Folding@home Fedora25.png|thumb|Folding@Home running on Fedora 25]]\n\nA Folding@home participant installs a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]]. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/> The computer clients run continuously in the [[background (computer software)|background]] at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/> The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.<ref name=\"Uni Guide\"/><ref name=\"forum: can FAH damage PC?\"/> The client connects to a Folding@home [[server (computing)|server]] and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]] systems, and [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/>\n\nProfessional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development.<ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Folding@home's data servers (over [[Computer port (software)|port]]&nbsp;8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> While the client's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is open-source,<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/> the client is [[proprietary software]] citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.<ref name=\"FAH license\"/><ref name=\"forum: FAH EULA\"/><ref name=\"help ubuntu\"/>\n\nHowever, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as [[Patch (computing)|patching]]) of the executable [[binary file]]s. Likewise, [[binary-only software|binary-only]] distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] while being downloaded via the internet,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries|title=The Case of the Modified Binaries|website=Leviathan Security}}</ref> or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. [[Patch (computing)|patched]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-02/clowes/bh-us-02-clowes-binaries.ppt|title=Fixing/Making Holes in ELF Binaries/Programs - Black Hat}}</ref> or by decompiling<ref>probably using tools such as [https://github.com/thorkill/eresi ERESI]</ref> and recompiling them after modification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309771/how-to-disassemble-modify-and-then-reassemble-a-linux-executable|title=x86 - How to disassemble, modify and then reassemble a Linux executable?|website=Stack Overflow}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/185/how-do-i-add-functionality-to-an-existing-binary-executable|title=linux - How do I add functionality to an existing binary executable?|website=Reverse Engineering Stack Exchange}}</ref> These modifications are possible unless the binary files&nbsp;\u2013 and the transport channel&nbsp;\u2013 are [[digital signature|signed]] and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-16/materials/us-16-Nipravsky-Certificate-Bypass-Hiding-And-Executing-Malware-From-A-Digitally-Signed-Executable-wp.pdf |title=Certificate Bypass: Hiding and Executing Malware from a Digitally Signed Executable |publisher=[[Deep Instinct]] |website=BlackHat.com |date=August 2016}}</ref> Either way, since in the case of Folding@home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed,<ref name=\"Main FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Uninstall\"/> the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.\n\nFolding@home uses the [[Cosm (software)|Cosm]] software libraries for networking.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/> Folding@home was launched on October&nbsp;1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems.<ref name=\"10.1039/C1CP22100K\"/> Its first client was a [[screensaver]], which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use.<ref name=\"10.1126/science.290.5498.1903\"/><ref name=\"Executive summary\"/> In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with [[David P. Anderson]] to test a supplemental client on the open-source [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing|BOINC]] framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005;<ref name=\"FAH for BOINC soon\"/> however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/>\n\n==== Graphics processing units ====\nThe specialized hardware of [[graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ref name=\"10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x\"/> Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open-source software|open-source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21209\"/><ref name=\"10.1109/MCSE.2010.27\"/>\n\nBefore 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.<ref name=\"10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84\"/>\n\nThe first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October&nbsp;2, 2006,<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> delivering a 20\u201330 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based [[GROMACS]] counterparts.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU news\"/><ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\"/> GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPGPU]] software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with [[DirectX]], on April&nbsp;10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 open beta\"/> Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"ATI FAQ\"/> Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on [[ATI (brand)|ATI]] and [[CUDA]]-enabled [[Nvidia]] GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 goes live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU2 going well\"/> Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May&nbsp;25, 2010. While [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities,<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/> and used OpenMM on top of an [[OpenCL]] framework.<ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 prep\"/><ref name=\"typepad: GPU3 open beta\"/> Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems [[Linux]] and [[macOS]], Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] software application.<ref name=\"forum: 7.1.38 released\"/><ref name=\"forum: GPU3 headless guide\"/> GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in [[FLOPS]]. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.<ref name=\"FAH osstats2\"/>\n\nNative support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.<ref name=\"forum: core17 Linux\"/>\n\n==== PlayStation 3 ====\n{{further|Life with PlayStation}}\n[[File:LifeWithPlayStation Folding.jpg|thumb|The PlayStation 3's ''Life With PlayStation'' client displays a 3-D animation of the protein being folded]]\n\nFrom March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"Biotech 27\"/> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/>\n\nThe PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&nbsp;23, 2007.<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 to study cancer\"/> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ref name=\"PS3 research project\"/> On September&nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ref name=\"Life With PS3 live\"/><ref name=\"typepad: life with PS\"/> In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ref name=\"10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922\"/> However, unlike clients running on [[personal computer]]s, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ref name=\"cnn ps3\"/> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ref name=\"Press FAQ\"/> The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.<ref name=\"10.1002/jcc.21054\"/>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a \"game changer\" for the project.<ref name=\"PS3 FAQ\"/><ref name=\"PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h\"/><ref name=\"LWP termination\"/>\n\n==== Multi-core processing client ====\nFolding@home can use the [[parallel computing]] abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ref name=\"10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069\"/>\n\nIn November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ref name=\"High-Per FAQ\"/> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ref name=\"SMP FAQ\"/> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref name=\"typepad: what does SMP do\"/><ref name=\"typepad: new client dev\"/> On January&nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ref name=\"SMP2 release\"/><ref name=\"typepad: how does dev get done\"/>\n\nSMP2 supports a trial of a special category of ''bigadv'' work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> which was raised to sixteen later, on February&nbsp;7, 2012.<ref name=\"typepad: update on bigadv-16\"/> Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[random-access memory]] (RAM) and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ref name=\"typepad: bigadv points change\"/> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ref name=\"bigadv\"/> Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |access-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== V7 ====\n[[File:F@h v7 novice shot.png|thumb|A sample image of the V7 client in Novice mode running under [[Windows&nbsp;7]].

It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients.<ref name=\"typepad: ATI core 16 released\"/> V7 uses [[Trac]] for [[Bug tracking system|managing its bug tickets]] so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.<ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\nV7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], named FAHControl.<ref name=\"FAHControl source code\"/><ref name=\"Ticket #736\"/> This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a [[backend as a service|back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or ''slot''). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ref name=\"V7 install guide\"/><ref name=\"typepad: V7 in open beta\"/>\n\n==== Google Chrome ====\nIn 2014, a client for the [[Google Chrome]] and [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]] web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client used [[Google]]'s [[Native Client]] (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@home code at near-native speed in a [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]] on the user's machine.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pande|first1=Vijay|title=Adding a completely new way to fold, directly in the browser|url=https://foldingathome.org/home/adding-a-completely-new-way-to-fold-directly-in-the-browser/|website=foldingathome.org|publisher=Pande Lab, Stanford University|access-date=13 February 2015|date=24 February 2014}}</ref> Due to the phasing out of NaCL and changes at Folding@home, the web client was permanently shut down in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=NaCL Web Client Shutdown Notice |url=http://nacl.foldingathome.org/ |website=Folding@Home |publisher=Folding@Home |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Android ====\nIn July 2015, a client for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile phones was released on [[Google Play]] for devices running [[Android 4.4 KitKat]] or newer.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vijay |last=Pande |title=First full version of our Folding@Home client for Android Mobile phones |url=https://foldingathome.org/home/first-full-version-of-our-foldinghome-client-for-android-mobile-phones/ |work=Folding@Home |publisher=foldingathome.org |date=July 7, 2015 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Folding@Home |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sonymobile.androidapp.gridcomputing |work=[[Google Play]] |date=2016 |access-date=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn the 16th of February 2018 the Android client, which was offered in cooperation with [[Sony Mobile|Sony]], was removed from the Google Play.

In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems.<ref name=\"typepad: comparison with Anton\"/> Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories,<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range.<ref name=\"10.1145/1654059.1654099\"/><ref name=\"10.1126/science.1187409\"/> These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems.<ref name=\"10.1145/1364782.1364802\"/><ref name=\"10.1146/annurev-biophys-042910-155245\"/> However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|\u00b5s]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/> In June 2011 Folding@home added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's.<ref name=\"forum: 7610/7611 in beta\"/><ref name=\"description: 7610\"/> However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's [[phase space]]. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.<ref name=\"10.1021/ja207470h\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[BOINC]]\n* [[Foldit]]\n* [[List of distributed computing projects]]\n* [[Comparison of software for molecular mechanics modeling]]\n* [[Molecular modeling on GPUs]]\n* [[SETI@home]]\n* [[Storage@home]]\n* [[Molecule editor]]\n* [[World Community Grid]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n| colwidth= 30em\n| refs =\n\n<!-- *** Books *** -->\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-340-66316-5\">{{cite book |last1= Collier |first1= Leslie |last2= Balows |first2= Albert |last3= Sussman |first3= Max |year= 1998 |chapter= |title= Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections |edition= ninth |volume= 1, ''Virology'' |editor1-last= Mahy |editor1-first= Brian |editor2-last= Collier |editor2-first= Leslie |publisher= Arnold |location= London |isbn= 978-0-340-66316-5 |pages= 75\u201391}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-0-387-73905-2\">{{cite book |title= Collagen: structure and mechanics |last= Fratzl |first= Peter |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-387-73905-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWFTqEtXXwC&lpg=PR1&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date= March 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"978-3-642-14389-2\">{{cite book |author1=Travis Desell |author2=Anthony Waters |author3=Malik Magdon-Ismail |author4=Boleslaw K.

The oldest surviving child, Caroline Price (1860-1936), was a concert musician before marriage to Walter S. Wilson and children ended her career. The next, Isabella Sterling Price (1864-1931), was considered an excellent actress but as that career was \"out of bounds for young girls\" at that time, she married William Arthur Charters. Beveline Arcadia Price (1867-1942) married David Sloan Craig. The marriage broke up and she returned to Dahlonega, Georgia, to look after her parents. Sarah Wansley Price (1869-194?) enjoyed art, but gave this up for marriage to John Calhoun West. She also taught domestic science at North Georgia College.

The oldest surviving child, Caroline Price (1860-1936), was a concert musician before marriage to Walter S. Wilson and children ended her career.

Beveline Arcadia Price (1867-1942) married David Sloan Craig. The marriage broke up and she returned to Dahlonega, Georgia, to look after her parents. Sarah Wansley Price (1869-194?) enjoyed art, but gave this up for marriage to John Calhoun West. She also taught domestic science at North Georgia College.

''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 2010.</ref> The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See [[#Scrolls and fragments|Scrolls and fragments]]) housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. [[John C. Trever]] reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the [[Bedouin]]. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]], [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]], and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Trever, John C. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2003.</ref> The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them, periodically taking them out to show to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in [[Bethlehem]]. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, \"Kando\", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or ${{inflation|US|28|1947}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\">{{cite book|first1=James |last1=VanderKam|first2=Peter|last2=Flint|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC|accessdate=15 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-08468-2|page=5}}</ref> The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See [[#Ownership|Ownership]].)\n\nIn 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. [[John C. Trever]], of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to that of the [[Nash Papyrus]], the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] prompted the move of some of the scrolls to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, [[Millar Burrows]], head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.\n\n===Search for the Qumran caves (1948\u20131949)===\nEarly in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop [[Mar Samuel]] brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to Professor [[Ovid R. Sellers]], the new Director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken safely. Sellers tried to get the [[Syrian people|Syrians]] to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1949, the government of Jordan gave permission to the [[Arab Legion]] to search the area where the original Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949, by Belgian [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|observer]] Captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn.<ref>{{cite web |first = Frantisek |last=Trstensky|title=The Archaeological Site of Qumran and the Personality of Roland De Vaux |url=http://www.biblicaltheology.com/Research/TrstenskyF01.pdf |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949\u20131951)===\n[[File:View of the Dead Sea from a Cave at Qumran.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Dead Sea from a cave at Qumran in which some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.]]\nThe rediscovery of what became known as \"Cave 1\" at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities led by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]].<ref>VanderKam, James C., The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 9.</ref> The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.<ref name=\"biblicaltheology.com\">{{cite web |author=S.S.L.

The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were the product of a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran called the [[Essenes]], but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.<ref>{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7727/|title=The Qumran paradigm: A critical evaluation of some foundational hypotheses in the construction of the 'Qumran Sect.|last=De-Looijer|first=G. A. M.|publisher=PhD Thesis, Durham University|year=2013|pages=1\u201313|type=Doctoral}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran\u2013Essene theory===\n{{main|Qumran#Qumran-Essene hypothesis}}\nThe view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the \"Qumran\u2013Essene\" hypothesis originally posited by [[Roland De Vaux|Roland Gu\u00e9rin de Vaux]]<ref>de Vaux, Roland, ''Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, 1959). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> and [[J\u00f3zef Milik|J\u00f3zef Tadeusz Milik]],<ref>Milik, J\u00f3zef Tadeusz, ''Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judea'', London: SCM, 1959.</ref> though independently both [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran.<ref>For Sowmy, see: Trever, John C., ''The Untold Story of Qumran'', (Westwood: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1965), p. 25.</ref> The Qumran\u2013Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]]. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] sometime between 66 and 68&nbsp;CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered.\nA number of arguments are used to support this theory.\n* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the [[Community Rule]] and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius [[Josephus]] \u2013 a Jewish\u2013Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.\n* Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.\n* During the excavation of [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]], two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. [[Roland de Vaux|De Vaux]] called this area the \"[[scriptorium]]\" based upon this discovery.\n* Several Jewish [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] (Hebrew: ''[[Mikvah|miqvah]]'' = \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant [[Jew]]ish presence at the site.\n* [[Pliny the Elder]] (a geographer writing after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 70&nbsp;CE) describes a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the [[Dead Sea]] near the ruined town of '[[Ein Gedi]].\n\n===Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory===\nQumran\u2013Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran\u2013Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran\u2013Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians are Essenes.\n\nA specific variation on the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory that has gained much recent popularity is the work of [[Lawrence Schiffman|Lawrence H. Schiffman]], who proposes that the community was led by a group of Zadokite priests ([[Sadducees]]).<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H., ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: their True Meaning for Judaism and Christianity'', Anchor Bible Reference Library (Doubleday) 1995.</ref> The most important document in support of this view is the \"[[4QMMT|Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah]]\" ([[4QMMT]]), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. [[4QMMT]] also reproduces a festival calendar that follows [[Sadducee]] principles for the dating of certain festival days.\n\n===Christian origin theory===\n[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jos\u00e9 O'Callaghan Mart\u00ednez]] argued in the 1960s that one fragment ([[7Q5]]) preserves a portion of text from the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Mark]] 6:52\u201353.<ref>O'Callaghan\u2013Mart\u00ednez, Josep, ''Cartas Cristianas Griegas del Siglo V'', Barcelona: E. Balmes, 1963.</ref> This theory was [[Falsifiability|falsified]] in the year 2000 by paleographic analysis of the particular fragment.<ref>Enste, Stefan. (2000). ''Kein Markustext in Qumran: Eine Untersuchung der These; Qumran-Fragment 7Q5 = Mk 6, 52\u201353 (No Mark text: an enquiry of the thesis; Qumran fragment 7Q5 = Gospel of Mark 6: 52\u201353)''. G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. {{ISBN|978-3-525-53945-3}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Eisenman]] has advanced the theory that some scrolls describe the [[early Christian]] community. Eisenman also argued that the careers of [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] correspond to events recorded in some of these documents.<ref>Eisenman, Robert H. J''ames, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1st American ed. New York: Viking, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Jerusalem origin theory===\nSome scholars have argued that the scrolls were the product of [[Judaism|Jews]] living in [[Jerusalem]], who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;CE.<ref>Chernoivanenko, Vitaly. \"[http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf The Jerusalem Theory of the Dead Sea Scrolls Authorship: Origins, Evolution, and Discussions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317215902/http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf |date=17 March 2016 }},\" in ''Ukrainian Orientalistics: Special Issue on Jewish Studies'', \u041ayiv: NaUKMA Omeljan Pritsak Center for Oriental Studies, 2011: 9\u201329.</ref> Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>Rengstorf, Karl Heinrich.

The Search for the Secret of Qumran'', New York: Scribner, 1995.</ref> Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including [[Yizhar Hirschfeld]]<ref>Hirschfeld, Yizhar, ''Qumran in Context: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence'', Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2004.</ref> and more recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg,<ref>{{cite web |first1=Magen|last1= Yizhak |first2= Yuval |last2=Peleg |title=The Qumran Excavations 1993\u20132004: Preliminary Report'', JSP 6 |publisher=Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority |year=2007 |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/images/shop/jsp/JSP6_Qumran_color.pdf }}</ref> who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a [[Hasmonean]] fort that was reused during later periods.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:7Q6-1,2.png|thumb|right|Fragments 1 and 2 of '7Q6' from Cave 7 are written on papyrus.]]\n\n===Radiocarbon dating===\n{{Main|Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls}}\nParchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]].

The scrolls were controlled by a small group of scholars headed by [[John Strugnell]], while a majority of scholars had access neither to the scrolls nor even to photographs of the text. Scholars such as [[Norman Golb]], publishers and writers such as [[Hershel Shanks]], and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the \"Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls\", after an intervention of the Israeli government and the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910922&slug=1306832 |title=Copies of Dead Sea Scrolls To Go Public \u2013 Release Would End Scholars' Dispute' |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=22 September 1991}}</ref> In 1991 [[Emanuel Tov]] was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year.\n\n====Physical description====\nThe majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow.

The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|title=Radiocarbon dating and the dead sea scrolls: A comment on \"REDATING\"|author=Johannes Van Der Plitch|publisher=Center for Isotope Research, Groningen University and Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University|url=http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914023047/http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 September 2014}}</ref> This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.\n\nAccording to ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows, <blockquote>Of the 166 ''words'' in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen ''letters'' in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word \"light,\" which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Burrows|first=Millar|publisher=Moody Press|year=1986|location=Chicago|pages=304}}</ref></blockquote>It is important to note that differences were found among fragments of texts. According to ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology'':{{Quote|While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the [[Septuagint]], and of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until [[Development of the Old Testament canon|its canonization]] around A.D. 100.<!-- NOTE: this is a quotation so the value should stay \"A.D. 100\" as quoted --><ref>Fagan, Brian M., and Charlotte Beck, ''The Oxford Companion to Archeology'', entry on the \"Dead sea scrolls\", Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>|sign=|source=}}The conclusion, then, is that the Dead Sea scrolls have taken Biblical scholarship to a new era where much of what was previously believed can now be confirmed, and some of what was accepted as fact should now be reexamined so Biblical texts can correspond precisely with what was originally written.\n\nTo quote Gleason Archer's ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction:''<blockquote>In conclusion, we should accord to the Masoretes the highest praise for their meticulous care in preserving so sedulously the consonantal text of the Sopherim which had been entrusted to them. They, together with the Sopherim themselves, gave the most diligent attention to the accurate preservation of the Hebrew Scriptures that has ever been devoted to any ancient literature, secular or religious, in the history of human civilization... </blockquote><blockquote>Because of their faithfulness, we have today a form of the Hebrew text which in all essentials duplicates the recension which was considered authoritative in the days of Christ and the apostles, if not a century earlier. And this in turn, judging from Qumran evidence, goes back to an authoritative revision of the Old Testament text which was drawn up on the basis of the most reliable manuscripts available for collation from previous centuries. These bring us very close in all essentials to the original autographs themselves, and furnish us with an authentic record of God's revelation. As W. F. Albright has said, \"We may rest assured that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other Near Eastern literature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction|last=Archer|first=Gleason|publisher=Moody Press|year=1964|location=Chicago|pages=65}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Biblical books found===\nThere are 225 Biblical texts included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total, and with [[deuterocanonical books]] the number increases to 235.<ref name=\"AbeggFlint2012\"/><ref>Abegg et al. \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English.\" 1999.</ref> The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament]] [[Protocanonical books|protocanon]].

Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967).

That third party, [[George Isha'ya]], was a member of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who soon contacted [[Saint Mark Monastery of Jerusalem|St Mark's Monastery]] in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as [[Mar Samuel]]. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous ''Isaiah Scroll'' ([[1QIs-a|1QIsa<sup>a</sup>]]), the ''[[Community Rule]]'', the ''[[Habakkuk Commentary|Habakkuk Pesher]]'' (a commentary on the book of [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]]), and the ''[[Genesis Apocryphon]]''. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor [[Eleazer Sukenik]] and Professor [[Benjamin Mazar]], Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, ''The [[War Scroll]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving Hymns]]'', and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsa<sup>b</sup>).\n\nFour of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement in 1 June 1954, ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 Discovery and Publication|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication?locale=en_US|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the Metropolitan, arrived at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York.

This ambiguity arises from differences in [[copyright]] law across different countries and the variable interpretation of such law.\n\nIn 1992 a copyright case ''[[Qimron v. Shanks]]'' was brought before the Israeli District court by scholar [[Elisha Qimron]] against [[Hershel Shanks]] of the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] for violations of United States copyright law regarding his publishing of reconstructions of Dead Sea Scroll texts done by Qimron in ''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' which were included without his permission. Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge [[Dalia Dorner]] ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\">{{cite web |last=Nimmer |first=David |work=Houston Law Review |title=Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923111121/http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge [[Aharon Barak]], the verdict was upheld in [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in Qimron's favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/dead_sea_scrolls/index.html?query=SHANKS,%20HERSHEL&field=per&match=exact|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.\n\nThe court's ruling not only affirms that the \"deciphered text\" of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor [[David Nimmer]], \"freedom\" in access. Nimmer has shown how this freedom was in the theory of law applicable, but how it did not exist in reality as the Israeli Antiquities Authority tightly controlled access to the scrolls and photographs of the scrolls.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Hebrew writings]]\n* [[Cairo Geniza]]\n* [[Jordan Lead Codices]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]\n* [[Teacher of Righteousness]]\n* [[The Book of Mysteries]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |url = http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive |title = Leon Levy Collection|website = Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library |publisher = [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] |access-date = 22 January 2015 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\":0\">OakTree Software, Inc.

''Guide to the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 2010.</ref> The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See [[#Scrolls and fragments|Scrolls and fragments]]) housed in jars in a cave near what is now known as the Qumran site. [[John C. Trever]] reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the [[Bedouin]]. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one (the cave now called Cave 1). He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]], [[Habakkuk Commentary]], and the [[Community Rule]], and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Trever, John C. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2003.</ref> The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out what to do with them, periodically taking them out to show to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in [[Bethlehem]]. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, \"Kando\", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 Jordanian pounds (approximately $28, or ${{inflation|US|28|1947}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\">{{cite book|first1=James |last1=VanderKam|first2=Peter|last2=Flint|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Their Significance For Understanding the Bible, Judaism, Jesus, and Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBMXnB4CRpUC|accessdate=15 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=978-0-567-08468-2|page=5}}</ref> The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See [[#Ownership|Ownership]].)\n\nIn 1947 the original seven scrolls caught the attention of Dr. [[John C. Trever]], of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (ASOR), who compared the script in the scrolls to that of the [[Nash Papyrus]], the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] prompted the move of some of the scrolls to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, [[Millar Burrows]], head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of the scrolls in a general press release.\n\n===Search for the Qumran caves (1948\u20131949)===\nEarly in September 1948, Metropolitan bishop [[Mar Samuel]] brought some additional scroll fragments that he had acquired to Professor [[Ovid R. Sellers]], the new Director of ASOR. By the end of 1948, nearly two years after their discovery, scholars had yet to locate the original cave where the fragments had been found. With unrest in the country at that time, no large-scale search could be undertaken safely. Sellers tried to get the [[Syrian people|Syrians]] to assist in the search for the cave, but he was unable to pay their price. In early 1949, the government of Jordan gave permission to the [[Arab Legion]] to search the area where the original Qumran cave was thought to be. Consequently, Cave 1 was rediscovered on 28 January 1949, by Belgian [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|observer]] Captain Phillipe Lippens and Arab Legion Captain Akkash el-Zebn.<ref>{{cite web |first = Frantisek |last=Trstensky|title=The Archaeological Site of Qumran and the Personality of Roland De Vaux |url=http://www.biblicaltheology.com/Research/TrstenskyF01.pdf |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran caves rediscovery and new scroll discoveries (1949\u20131951)===\n[[File:View of the Dead Sea from a Cave at Qumran.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Dead Sea from a cave at Qumran in which some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.]]\nThe rediscovery of what became known as \"Cave 1\" at Qumran prompted the initial excavation of the site from 15 February to 5 March 1949 by the Jordanian Department of Antiquities led by [[Gerald Lankester Harding]] and [[Roland de Vaux]].<ref>VanderKam, James C., The Dead Sea Scrolls Today, Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1994. p. 9.</ref> The Cave 1 site yielded discoveries of additional Dead Sea Scroll fragments, linen cloth, jars, and other artifacts.<ref name=\"biblicaltheology.com\">{{cite web |author=S.S.L.

The dominant theory remains that the scrolls were the product of a sect of Jews living at nearby Qumran called the [[Essenes]], but this theory has come to be challenged by several modern scholars.<ref>{{Cite thesis|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/7727/|title=The Qumran paradigm: A critical evaluation of some foundational hypotheses in the construction of the 'Qumran Sect.|last=De-Looijer|first=G. A. M.|publisher=PhD Thesis, Durham University|year=2013|pages=1\u201313|type=Doctoral}}</ref>\n\n===Qumran\u2013Essene theory===\n{{main|Qumran#Qumran-Essene hypothesis}}\nThe view among scholars, almost universally held until the 1990s, is the \"Qumran\u2013Essene\" hypothesis originally posited by [[Roland De Vaux|Roland Gu\u00e9rin de Vaux]]<ref>de Vaux, Roland, ''Archaeology and the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Schweich Lectures of the British Academy, 1959). Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1973.</ref> and [[J\u00f3zef Milik|J\u00f3zef Tadeusz Milik]],<ref>Milik, J\u00f3zef Tadeusz, ''Ten Years of Discovery in the Wilderness of Judea'', London: SCM, 1959.</ref> though independently both [[Eliezer Sukenik]] and Butrus Sowmy of St Mark's Monastery connected scrolls with the Essenes well before any excavations at Qumran.<ref>For Sowmy, see: Trever, John C., ''The Untold Story of Qumran'', (Westwood: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1965), p. 25.</ref> The Qumran\u2013Essene theory holds that the scrolls were written by the Essenes, or by another Jewish sectarian group, residing at [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]]. They composed the scrolls and ultimately hid them in the nearby caves during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] sometime between 66 and 68&nbsp;CE. The site of Qumran was destroyed and the scrolls never recovered.\nA number of arguments are used to support this theory.\n* There are striking similarities between the description of an initiation ceremony of new members in the [[Community Rule]] and descriptions of the Essene initiation ceremony mentioned in the works of Flavius [[Josephus]] \u2013 a Jewish\u2013Roman historian of the Second Temple Period.\n* Josephus mentions the Essenes as sharing property among the members of the community, as does the Community Rule.\n* During the excavation of [[Qumran|Khirbet Qumran]], two inkwells and plastered elements thought to be tables were found, offering evidence that some form of writing was done there. More inkwells were discovered nearby. [[Roland de Vaux|De Vaux]] called this area the \"[[scriptorium]]\" based upon this discovery.\n* Several Jewish [[Mikvah|ritual baths]] (Hebrew: ''[[Mikvah|miqvah]]'' = \u05de\u05e7\u05d5\u05d4) were discovered at Qumran, offering evidence of an observant [[Jew]]ish presence at the site.\n* [[Pliny the Elder]] (a geographer writing after the fall of [[Jerusalem]] in 70&nbsp;CE) describes a group of Essenes living in a desert community on the northwest shore of the [[Dead Sea]] near the ruined town of '[[Ein Gedi]].\n\n===Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory===\nQumran\u2013Sectarian theories are variations on the Qumran\u2013Essene theory. The main point of departure from the Qumran\u2013Essene theory is hesitation to link the Dead Sea Scrolls specifically with the Essenes. Most proponents of the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory understand a group of Jews living in or near Qumran to be responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, but do not necessarily conclude that the sectarians are Essenes.\n\nA specific variation on the Qumran\u2013Sectarian theory that has gained much recent popularity is the work of [[Lawrence Schiffman|Lawrence H. Schiffman]], who proposes that the community was led by a group of Zadokite priests ([[Sadducees]]).<ref>Schiffman, Lawrence H., ''Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls: their True Meaning for Judaism and Christianity'', Anchor Bible Reference Library (Doubleday) 1995.</ref> The most important document in support of this view is the \"[[4QMMT|Miqsat Ma'ase Ha-Torah]]\" ([[4QMMT]]), which cites purity laws (such as the transfer of impurities) identical to those attributed in rabbinic writings to the Sadducees. [[4QMMT]] also reproduces a festival calendar that follows [[Sadducee]] principles for the dating of certain festival days.\n\n===Christian origin theory===\n[[Spain|Spanish]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jos\u00e9 O'Callaghan Mart\u00ednez]] argued in the 1960s that one fragment ([[7Q5]]) preserves a portion of text from the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel of Mark]] 6:52\u201353.<ref>O'Callaghan\u2013Mart\u00ednez, Josep, ''Cartas Cristianas Griegas del Siglo V'', Barcelona: E. Balmes, 1963.</ref> This theory was [[Falsifiability|falsified]] in the year 2000 by paleographic analysis of the particular fragment.<ref>Enste, Stefan. (2000). ''Kein Markustext in Qumran: Eine Untersuchung der These; Qumran-Fragment 7Q5 = Mk 6, 52\u201353 (No Mark text: an enquiry of the thesis; Qumran fragment 7Q5 = Gospel of Mark 6: 52\u201353)''. G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht. {{ISBN|978-3-525-53945-3}}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Eisenman]] has advanced the theory that some scrolls describe the [[early Christian]] community. Eisenman also argued that the careers of [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]] and [[Paul the Apostle]] correspond to events recorded in some of these documents.<ref>Eisenman, Robert H. J''ames, the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1st American ed. New York: Viking, 1997.</ref>\n\n===Jerusalem origin theory===\nSome scholars have argued that the scrolls were the product of [[Judaism|Jews]] living in [[Jerusalem]], who hid the scrolls in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70&nbsp;CE.<ref>Chernoivanenko, Vitaly. \"[http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf The Jerusalem Theory of the Dead Sea Scrolls Authorship: Origins, Evolution, and Discussions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317215902/http://history.ukma.edu.ua/docs/faculty/chernoivanenko/publications/chernoivanenko_jerusalem-theoryen.pdf |date=17 March 2016 }},\" in ''Ukrainian Orientalistics: Special Issue on Jewish Studies'', \u041ayiv: NaUKMA Omeljan Pritsak Center for Oriental Studies, 2011: 9\u201329.</ref> Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish [[Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>Rengstorf, Karl Heinrich. ''Hirbet Qumran und die Bibliothek vom Toten Meer''. Translated by J. R. Wilkie. Stuttgart: [[Kohlhammer Verlag]], 1960.</ref> Later, [[Norman Golb]] suggested that the scrolls were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem, and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library.<ref>Golb, Norman, On the Jerusalem Origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, University of Chicago Oriental Institute, 5 June 2009.</ref><ref>Golb, Norman, ''Who Wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls? The Search for the Secret of Qumran'', New York: Scribner, 1995.</ref> Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among the scrolls as evidence against a Qumran origin of the scrolls. Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of the scrolls other than Qumran, including [[Yizhar Hirschfeld]]<ref>Hirschfeld, Yizhar, ''Qumran in Context: Reassessing the Archaeological Evidence'', Peabody: Hendrickson Publishers, 2004.</ref> and more recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg,<ref>{{cite web |first1=Magen|last1= Yizhak |first2= Yuval |last2=Peleg |title=The Qumran Excavations 1993\u20132004: Preliminary Report'', JSP 6 |publisher=Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority |year=2007 |url=http://www.antiquities.org.il/images/shop/jsp/JSP6_Qumran_color.pdf }}</ref> who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a [[Hasmonean]] fort that was reused during later periods.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:7Q6-1,2.png|thumb|right|Fragments 1 and 2 of '7Q6' from Cave 7 are written on papyrus.]]\n\n===Radiocarbon dating===\n{{Main|Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls}}\nParchment from a number of the Dead Sea Scrolls has been [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]]. The initial test performed in 1950 was on a piece of linen from one of the caves. This test gave an indicative dating of 33&nbsp;CE plus or minus 200 years, eliminating early hypotheses relating the scrolls to the medieval period.<ref>Doudna, G. \"Carbon-14 Dating\", in ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, & VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000)</ref> Since then two large series of tests have been performed on the scrolls themselves.

During a portion of the conflict during the [[Suez Crisis|1956 war]] waged by Israel, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] against [[Egypt]], the scrolls collection of the Palestine Archaeological Museum was stored in the [[bank vault|vault]] of the [[Ottoman Bank]] in Amman, Jordan.<ref name=\"Fitzmyer, Joseph A 1992\">Fitzmyer, Joseph A. ''Responses to 101 Questions on the Dead Sea Scrolls''. 1992.</ref> Damp conditions from temporary storage of the scrolls in the Ottoman Bank vault from 1956 to the Spring of 1957 led to a more rapid rate of deterioration of the scrolls. The conditions caused [[mildew]] to develop on the scrolls and fragments, and some fragments were partially destroyed or made illegible by the glue and paper of the [[Manila folder|manila envelopes]] in which they were stored while in the vault.<ref name=\"Fitzmyer, Joseph A 1992\"/> By 1958 it was noted that up to 5% of some of the scrolls had completely deteriorated.<ref name=\"Burrows, Millar 1958\"/> Many of the texts had become illegible and many of the parchments had darkened considerably.<ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\"/><ref name=\"antiquities.org.il\"/>\n\nUntil the 1970s, the scrolls continued to deteriorate because of poor storage arrangements, exposure to different adhesives, and being trapped in moist environments.<ref name=\"antiquities.org.il\"/> Fragments written on parchment (rather than papyrus or bronze) in the hands of private collectors and scholars suffered an even worse fate than those in the hands of the museum, with large portions of fragments being reported to have disappeared by 1966.<ref>Trever, John. ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: A Personal Account''. 2003.</ref> In the late 1960s, the deterioration was becoming a major concern with scholars and museum officials alike. Scholars [[John M. Allegro|John Allegro]] and Sir Francis Frank were among the first to strongly advocate for better preservation techniques.<ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\"/> Early attempts made by both the [[British Museum|British]] and Israel Museums to remove the adhesive tape ended up exposing the parchment to an array of chemicals, including \"[[British Museum leather dressing|British Leather Dressing]],\" and darkening some of them significantly.<ref name=\"VanderKamFlint2005\"/> In the 1970s and 1980s, other preservation attempts were made that included removing the glass plates and replacing them with cardboard and removing pressure against the plates that held the scrolls in storage; however, the fragments and scrolls continued to rapidly deteriorate during this time.<ref name=\"antiquities.org.il\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the Israeli Antiquities Authority established a temperature-controlled laboratory for the storage and [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of the scrolls.

Scholars such as [[Norman Golb]], publishers and writers such as [[Hershel Shanks]], and many others argued for decades for publishing the texts, so that they become available to researchers. This controversy only ended in 1991, when the Biblical Archaeology Society was able to publish the \"Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls\", after an intervention of the Israeli government and the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910922&slug=1306832 |title=Copies of Dead Sea Scrolls To Go Public \u2013 Release Would End Scholars' Dispute' |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=22 September 1991}}</ref> In 1991 [[Emanuel Tov]] was appointed as the chairman of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation, and publication of the scrolls followed in the same year.\n\n====Physical description====\nThe majority of the scrolls consist of tiny, brittle fragments, which were published at a pace considered by many to be excessively slow.

The biblical manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls push that date back a full thousand years, to the 2nd century BCE.<ref>{{cite book|title=Radiocarbon dating and the dead sea scrolls: A comment on \"REDATING\"|author=Johannes Van Der Plitch|publisher=Center for Isotope Research, Groningen University and Faculty of Archaeology, Leiden University|url=http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914023047/http://ehacksandcheats.com/pdf/2007DeadSeaDiscovvdPlicht.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 September 2014}}</ref> This was a significant discovery for Old Testament scholars who anticipated that the Dead Sea Scrolls would either affirm or repudiate the reliability of textual transmission from the original texts to the oldest Masoretic texts at hand. The discovery demonstrated the unusual accuracy of transmission over a thousand-year period, rendering it reasonable to believe that current Old Testament texts are reliable copies of the original works.\n\nAccording to ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' by Hebrew scholar Millar Burrows, <blockquote>Of the 166 ''words'' in Isaiah 53, there are only seventeen ''letters'' in question. Ten of these letters are simply a matter of spelling, which does not affect the sense. Four more letters are minor stylistic changes, such as conjunctions. The remaining three letters comprise the word \"light,\" which is added in verse 11, and does not affect the meaning greatly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls|last=Burrows|first=Millar|publisher=Moody Press|year=1986|location=Chicago|pages=304}}</ref></blockquote>It is important to note that differences were found among fragments of texts. According to ''The Oxford Companion to Archaeology'':{{Quote|While some of the Qumran biblical manuscripts are nearly identical to the Masoretic, or traditional, Hebrew text of the Old Testament, some manuscripts of the books of Exodus and Samuel found in Cave Four exhibit dramatic differences in both language and content. In their astonishing range of textual variants, the Qumran biblical discoveries have prompted scholars to reconsider the once-accepted theories of the development of the modern biblical text from only three manuscript families: of the Masoretic text, of the Hebrew original of the [[Septuagint]], and of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Old Testament scripture was extremely fluid until [[Development of the Old Testament canon|its canonization]] around A.D. 100.<!-- NOTE: this is a quotation so the value should stay \"A.D. 100\" as quoted --><ref>Fagan, Brian M., and Charlotte Beck, ''The Oxford Companion to Archeology'', entry on the \"Dead sea scrolls\", Oxford University Press, 1996.</ref>|sign=|source=}}The conclusion, then, is that the Dead Sea scrolls have taken Biblical scholarship to a new era where much of what was previously believed can now be confirmed, and some of what was accepted as fact should now be reexamined so Biblical texts can correspond precisely with what was originally written.\n\nTo quote Gleason Archer's ''A Survey of Old Testament Introduction:''<blockquote>In conclusion, we should accord to the Masoretes the highest praise for their meticulous care in preserving so sedulously the consonantal text of the Sopherim which had been entrusted to them. They, together with the Sopherim themselves, gave the most diligent attention to the accurate preservation of the Hebrew Scriptures that has ever been devoted to any ancient literature, secular or religious, in the history of human civilization... </blockquote><blockquote>Because of their faithfulness, we have today a form of the Hebrew text which in all essentials duplicates the recension which was considered authoritative in the days of Christ and the apostles, if not a century earlier. And this in turn, judging from Qumran evidence, goes back to an authoritative revision of the Old Testament text which was drawn up on the basis of the most reliable manuscripts available for collation from previous centuries. These bring us very close in all essentials to the original autographs themselves, and furnish us with an authentic record of God's revelation. As W. F. Albright has said, \"We may rest assured that the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, though not infallible has been preserved with an accuracy perhaps unparalleled in any other Near Eastern literature.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Old Testament Introduction|last=Archer|first=Gleason|publisher=Moody Press|year=1964|location=Chicago|pages=65}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n===Biblical books found===\nThere are 225 Biblical texts included in the Dead Sea Scroll documents, or around 22% of the total, and with [[deuterocanonical books]] the number increases to 235.<ref name=\"AbeggFlint2012\"/><ref>Abegg et al. \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English.\" 1999.</ref> The Dead Sea Scrolls contain parts of all but one of the books of the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Old Testament]] [[Protocanonical books|protocanon]].

That third party, [[George Isha'ya]], was a member of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], who soon contacted [[Saint Mark Monastery of Jerusalem|St Mark's Monastery]] in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as [[Mar Samuel]]. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous ''Isaiah Scroll'' ([[1QIs-a|1QIsa<sup>a</sup>]]), the ''[[Community Rule]]'', the ''[[Habakkuk Commentary|Habakkuk Pesher]]'' (a commentary on the book of [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]]), and the ''[[Genesis Apocryphon]]''. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor [[Eleazer Sukenik]] and Professor [[Benjamin Mazar]], Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, ''The [[War Scroll]]'', ''[[Thanksgiving Hymns]]'', and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsa<sup>b</sup>).\n\nFour of the Dead Sea Scrolls eventually went up for sale in an advertisement in 1 June 1954, ''[[Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls \u2013 Discovery and Publication|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/discovery-and-publication?locale=en_US|publisher=Israel Antiquities Authority|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> On 1 July 1954, the scrolls, after delicate negotiations and accompanied by three people including the Metropolitan, arrived at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York.

Qimron's suit against the Biblical Archaeology Society was done on the grounds that the research they had published was his intellectual property as he had reconstructed about 40% of the published text. In 1993, the district court Judge [[Dalia Dorner]] ruled for the plaintiff, Elisha Qimron, in context of both United States and Israeli copyright law and granted the highest compensation allowed by law for aggravation in compensation against Hershel Shanks and others.<ref name=\"houstonlawreview.org\">{{cite web |last=Nimmer |first=David |work=Houston Law Review |title=Copyright in the Dead Sea Scrolls |url=http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |accessdate=15 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923111121/http://www.houstonlawreview.org/archive/downloads/38-1_pdf/HLR38P1.pdf |archive-date=23 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In an appeal in 2000 in front of Judge [[Aharon Barak]], the verdict was upheld in [[Israeli Supreme Court]] in Qimron's favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/d/dead_sea_scrolls/index.html?query=SHANKS,%20HERSHEL&field=per&match=exact|title=Dead Sea Scrolls|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> The court case established the two main principles from which facsimiles are examined under copyright law of the United States and Israel: authorship and originality.\n\nThe court's ruling not only affirms that the \"deciphered text\" of the scrolls can fall under copyright of individuals or groups, but makes it clear that the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves do not fall under this copyright law and scholars have a degree of, in the words of U.S. copyright law professor [[David Nimmer]], \"freedom\" in access.
