A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sig\u00fcenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in [[Northwest Florida]] during the expedition. While traveling in the area of [[East Bay (Santa Rosa County, Florida)|East Bay]] in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the [[East Bay River]].<ref name=\":13\" /> In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sig\u00fcenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://robledal.org/history/history.htm|title=Robledal History|last=|first=|date=|website=robledal.org|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish.<ref name=\":13\" /> After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sig\u00fcenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andr\u00e9s de Arriola y Guzm\u00e1n (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.<ref name=\":13\">{{cite web|url=http://navarrepress.com/headlines/navarres-earliest-recorded-heritage-began-spanish-explorers-1693/|title=Navarre's earliest recorded heritage began with Spanish explorers in 1693|last=|first=|date=|website=www.navarrepress.com|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Axelson Point ===\n\n==== Settlement and Shipyard ====\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] by the Axelson Family.

The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Staff reporters |title=When Navarre was Eagan |url=http://navarrepress.com/community/when-navarre-was-eagan |website=Navarre Press |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Guy Wyman and town development===\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was [[Guy Wyman]], a colonel in the [[United States Army]].

A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sig\u00fcenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in [[Northwest Florida]] during the expedition. While traveling in the area of [[East Bay (Santa Rosa County, Florida)|East Bay]] in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the [[East Bay River]].<ref name=\":13\" /> In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sig\u00fcenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://robledal.org/history/history.htm|title=Robledal History|last=|first=|date=|website=robledal.org|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish.<ref name=\":13\" /> After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sig\u00fcenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andr\u00e9s de Arriola y Guzm\u00e1n (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.<ref name=\":13\">{{cite web|url=http://navarrepress.com/headlines/navarres-earliest-recorded-heritage-began-spanish-explorers-1693/|title=Navarre's earliest recorded heritage began with Spanish explorers in 1693|last=|first=|date=|website=www.navarrepress.com|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Axelson Point ===\n\n==== Settlement and Shipyard ====\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] by the Axelson Family.

The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Staff reporters |title=When Navarre was Eagan |url=http://navarrepress.com/community/when-navarre-was-eagan |website=Navarre Press |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Guy Wyman and town development===\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was [[Guy Wyman]], a colonel in the [[United States Army]].

This project eventually added approximately {{convert|200|ft|m}} of sand and a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} high berm to the Gulf side of Santa Rosa Island for the entire length of Navarre Beach.  The project was completed in December 2006. Another round of beach renourishment was completed in 2016.\n\nThe entirety of Navarre Beach has been closed during the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19 Coronavirus Outbreak]], with only residents of the beach neighborhood being allowed on that area of the island.

He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old.

As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run for a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]], skipping his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]].

Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team, consisting of Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m, at the 2012 Swedish Junior Curling Championships with the aim of qualifying for the World Junior Curling Championship.

His official team during this period was Team Lit, alternatively known as Team Lindstr\u00f6m and eventually Team Eriksson. Eriksson skipped the team for most of this period through 2014.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 5 April 2020|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> From 2009 through February 2014, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Niklas Edin]], [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, Team Lit became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2012/10/04/topplag-i-samma-bo |title=Topplag i samma bo|publisher=Nya Wermlands Tidningen |date= 4 October 2012|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship gold medal (2013) and two bronze medals (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played in the second position for all games except three because Niklas Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played this position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won its second World Curling Championship bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2012), and European Masters (2013), as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Elite Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and reaching their first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, the new Team Edin team immediately saw their increased potential and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed,  Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and finished in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured medals in the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been consistently ranked in the top ten teams in the world since they joined forces, due to their performance in Canada and around the world. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In the 2016-17 season, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup) of all but one of the slams, securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup, the first non-Canadian men's team to do so. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping only the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref name=Erikssonhistoria /> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

for the [[Niklas Edin]] rink. He is a four-time World Curling Champion, seven-time European Curling Champion, and the first curler in history to win gold medals in three major curling championships in a single calendar year \u2013 the World Men's Curling Championship, the European Curling Championship, and the World Mixed Doubles Championship. He is the only member of Team Sweden to have competed in all of the World Men's Curling Championships from 2011 to 2019. He won medals in all but one of these championships, as well as playing in multiple positions \u2013 as skip (silver, [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship|2014]]), third (gold, [[2015 World Men's Curling Championship|2015]], [[2018 World Men's Curling Championship|2018]], [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|2019]] and silver, [[2017 World Men's Curling Championship|2017]]) second (bronze, [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship|2012]]), and as an alternate (gold, [[2013 World Men's Curling Championship|2013]] and bronze, [[2011 World Men's Curling Championship|2011]]). As a member of Team Niklas Edin, he has also won three Grand Slam Curling Events, as well as the Pinty's Cup, being part of the first non-Canadian men's team to do so.\n\n==Career==\n===Career Beginnings===\nEriksson began curling before he was six years old. He followed his older brothers [[Anders Eriksson (Karlstad curler)|Anders Eriksson]] and [[Markus_Eriksson_(curler)|Marcus Eriksson]] into the sport, but his skill level advanced more rapidly.<ref name=Erikssonhistoria>{{cite web|url=https://www.vf.se/2019/12/24/plats-1-oskar-eriksson-skrev-historia-under-guldkantat-2019/|title=Plats 1: Oskar Eriksson skrev historia under guldkantat 2019|publisher=V\u00e4rmlands Folkblad |date= 24 December 2019|accessdate=2019-12-24}}</ref> He was part of a curling team at age seven,<ref name=Erikssonhistoria /> debuting in Sweden's Elite Series at the age of thirteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/12/30/framtiden-osaker-for-lag-eriksson/|title=Framtiden os\u00e4ker f\u00f6r Lag Eriksson|publisher=Nya Wermlands Tidningen|date= 30 December 2009|accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> He won his first Swedish Men's Curling Championship title in his junior career and has gone on to win six more championship titles since then.<ref>[[Swedish Men%27s Curling Championship]]</ref>. As a junior, Eriksson also competed at three World Junior Curling Championships, winning both a gold medal and a silver medal. At those three World Junior Championships, Eriksson skipped two different Swedish teams, winning a total of 24 games and losing only 9.\n\nEriksson made his first run for a junior world championship title when he was sixteen at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships]], skipping his first team, consisting of Henric Jonsson, Markus Franz\u00e9n, and Nils Karlsson, to a silver medal, losing in the final to the US team skipped by [[Chris Plys]]. In 2008, Eriksson moved to H\u00e4rnosand to join other promising curlers at H\u00e4rnosands gymnasium.<ref name=Eriksson2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2009/01/06/oskar-kom-hem-och-vann/|title=Oskar kom hem \u2013 och vann|publisher=Nya Wermalands Tidningen|date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> He also joined Team Lindstr\u00f6m from [[Lit, Sweden|Lit]], formed by brothers [[Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m]] and [[Alexander Lindstr\u00f6m]] along with [[Christoffer Sundgren]] and [[Henrik Leek]]. The team had immediate success on the junior tour and also scored wins in the senior division.<ref name=Eriksson2008 /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltz.se/artikel/lag-lindstrom-bast-i-norska-elitserien |title=Lag Lindstr\u00f6m b\u00e4st i Norden|publisher=L\u00e4nstidningen \u00d6stersund|date= 12 October 2008|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> With this team, Eriksson made his second run for the gold medal at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]], but reached only a fourth-place finish, losing in the bronze-medal game to the US team that was again skipped by Plys. Though the team did not qualify to compete at the championships in 2010, Eriksson and his teammates finally won a gold medal at the [[2011 World Junior Curling Championships]], defeating Team Switzerland, skipped by [[Peter de Cruz]], by a score of 6\u20135 in the final. In 2012, his teammates were no longer eligible for junior competition, so Eriksson skipped a team, consisting of Ludwig Grann, Erik \u00d6lund and Magnus Rudstr\u00f6m, at the 2012 Swedish Junior Curling Championships with the aim of qualifying for the World Junior Curling Championship. The team was undefeated until the finals but came in second place to the team from Sundyberg skipped by his future teammate [[Rasmus Wran\u00e5]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cuponline.se/teamView.aspx?cupid=1570&id=17105/|title=Junior SM 2012: Granit-G\u00e4vle|publisher=CupOnline|date= 7 January 2012|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Seniors I (2009-2014): Team Lindstr\u00f6m/Eriksson and Team Edin ===\n\nShortly after joining Team Lit in 2008, Eriksson played simultaneously with two teams. His official team during this period was Team Lit, alternatively known as Team Lindstr\u00f6m and eventually Team Eriksson. Eriksson skipped the team for most of this period through 2014.<ref>https://litcurling.wordpress.com/</ref><ref name=Erikssoncareer>{{cite web|url=https://worldcurl.com/player.php?playerid=14370&view=Teams |title=Oskar Eriksson, Career Results|publisher=WorldCurl.com |date= 5 April 2020|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref> From 2009 through February 2014, he also effectively became the presumptive alternate for Team [[Niklas Edin]] with [[Niklas Edin]], [[Sebastian Kraupp]], [[Fredrik Lindberg]], and [[Viktor Kj\u00e4ll]], playing at the World Curling Championships, European Curling Championships, and 2010 and 2014 Olympic Games. During this period, however, Team Lit became more competitive with Team Edin and was well recognized as one of the top two men's curling teams in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2012/10/04/topplag-i-samma-bo |title=Topplag i samma bo|publisher=Nya Wermlands Tidningen |date= 4 October 2012|accessdate=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternate for Team Edin during this period, Eriksson received numerous medals, including two gold medals at the European Curling Championships (2009 and 2012) and three World Curling Championship medals, including his first World Championship Gold medal (2013) and two bronze medals (2011 and 2012). At the [[2012 World Men's Curling Championship]], however, he notably played in the second position for all games except three because Niklas Edin, the permanent skip, was suffering from a herniated disc in his back. Eriksson also played this position in the playoffs, in which Team Sweden won its second World Curling Championship bronze medal. He also made his first Olympic appearances with Team Edin, coming in fourth in the 2010 Winter Olympics and receiving a bronze medal in the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nWith his own team, however, Eriksson and his teammates were recognized as a very competitive team and won several international events, including the Oslo Cup (2009), Swiss Cup Basel (2012), and European Masters (2013), as well as the Winter Universiade (2013).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> In the 2013-14 season, Team Eriksson reached second place at the Swiss Cup Basel, Mercure Perth Masters, and Sweden's Elite Series and competed in Canada on the World Curling Tour, coming in fifth place in three events and reaching their first Grand Slam Quarterfinal at the [[2014 The National (March)|National]]. Winning the Swedish Men's Curling Championships that year as well, the team was selected to represent Sweden in the [[2014 World Men's Curling Championship]], as Team Edin had represented Sweden in the European Curling Championships. Team Eriksson reached the final and won the silver medal in their World Curling Championship debut.\n\n=== Seniors II (2014-present): Team Edin ===\n\nIn May 2014, Edin and Team Eriksson came to an agreement to form a new Team Edin, with Edin skipping the team in the fourth position and Oskar Eriksson playing third along with Kristian Lindstr\u00f6m playing second and Christoffer Sundgren in the lead position.<ref name=nwt2014>{{cite web|url=https://www.nwt.se/2014/05/13/edin-och-eriksson-bildar-supercurlinglag/ |title=Edin och Eriksson bilder supercurlinglag|publisher=Nya Wermlands-Tidningen |date= 13 May 2014|accessdate=2020-04-05}}.</ref> When Lindstr\u00f6m underwent surgery in 2016, Rasmus Wran\u00e5 took over as second. From the start, however, the new Team Edin team immediately saw their increased potential and aimed to become the number one team in the world.<ref name=nwt2014 /> Indeed,  Team Edin was ranked first at the end of the [[2016\u201317 curling season]] on both lists and finished in first place on the prize money list in the [[2017-18 curling season]]. The team also reached the finals of the European Curling Championships every year since forming a new team, winning gold in all years but one (2014-2017 and 2019) and winning silver once (2018). The team also secured medals in the finals of the World Curling Championships every year except 2016, winning three gold (2015, 2018 and 2019) and one silver (2017).\n\nAs part of Team Edin, Eriksson and his teammates have been consistently ranked in the top ten teams in the world since they joined forces, due to their performance in Canada and around the world. The team has reached the playoffs in 20 Grand Slam of Curling Events. In the 2016-17 season, Team Edin had their most successful year on tour, winning three Slams (the Masters, the Tour Challenge, and the Players\u2019 Championship) and reaching the finals (the Canadian Open) and semifinals (the National and Champions Cup) of all but one of the slams, securing the Pinty\u2019s Cup, the first non-Canadian men's team to do so. The Team has also won several other World Curling Tour events, including the European Masters (2014), Swiss Cup Basel (2016, 2018), Baden Masters (2015, 2017), Curling Masters Champery (2016, 2017), and Perth Masters (2018).<ref name=Erikssoncareer /> Team Edin has also won the [[Swedish Men's Curling Championships]] six times between 2014 and 2020, skipping only the 2017 championships to prepare for the World Championships.\n\n=== Career Achievements  ===\n\nCurrently, Eriksson is the only Swedish curler to have taken part in nine consecutive [[World Curling Championships]] in the men's division (2011-2019). Eriksson has also competed in eleven consecutive [[European Curling Championships]], winning a record seven gold medals, a record that he shares only with Niklas Edin. With Team Edin, Eriksson has won four World Curling Championship gold medals (in 2015, 2018 and 2019), placing him in an elite group of curlers to hold four World Championship titles.<ref>[[List of men%27s World Curling champions]]</ref> In 2019, Eriksson became the first curler in history to hold three key gold medals in a single calendar year: the [[2019 World Men's Curling Championship|World Curling Championship]], the [[2019 European Curling Championships|European Curling Championship]], and the [[2019 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship|World Mixed Doubles Championship]] (with Anna Hasselborg).<ref name=Erikssonhistoria /> As part of Team Edin, Eriksson, Niklas Edin, and Christoffer Sundgren also became the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold the World Curling Championship and European Curling Championship titles in two separate calendar years (2015 and 2019).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref> Eriksson and Edin had previously become the first men's curlers to simultaneously hold those same titles in three separate competition seasons (2012-2013, 2014\u20132015, and 2017-2018).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_men%27s_World_Curling_champions and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Curling_Championships</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Eriksson was inducted into the [[Swedish Curling Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Grand Slam record==\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
