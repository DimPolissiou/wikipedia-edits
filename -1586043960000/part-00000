The team takes part in the annual [[Rugby Europe International Championships|Rugby Europe Championship]] (previously named European Nations Cup) and participates in the [[Rugby World Cup]], which takes place every four years.\n\nGeorgia is currently considered a second-tier rugby union nation and is one of the world's fastest-growing rugby nations. The Lelos participate in the Rugby Europe Championship, winning the tournament in [[2000\u201301 European Nations Cup First Division|2001]], [[2006\u201308 European Nations Cup First Division|2008]], [[2008\u201310 European Nations Cup First Division|2009]], [[2010\u201312 European Nations Cup First Division|2011]], [[2010\u201312 European Nations Cup First Division|2012]], [[2012\u201314 European Nations Cup First Division|2013]], [[2012\u201314 European Nations Cup First Division|2014]], [[2014\u201316 European Nations Cup First Division|2015]], [[2014\u201316 European Nations Cup First Division|2016]], [[2018 Rugby Europe Championship|2018]] and [[2019 Rugby Europe Championship|2019]] seasons. The bulk of the national squad are based in France, in both the Top 14 and lower divisions. This is a practice that was popularized by former national team coach, [[Claude Saurel]], a Frenchman.\n\nRugby is one of the most popular sports in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The national team qualified for the [[Rugby World Cup]] four times, first in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] \u2013 playing against rugby powers such as [[England national rugby union team|England]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. The Lelos recorded their first ever World Cup win in [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], where they beat [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]] 30\u20130. As of 6 February 2017, Georgia are [[World Rugby Rankings|ranked]] 12th in the world by [[World Rugby]]. Since 2013, Georgia has hosted the [[World Rugby Tbilisi Cup]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Rugby union in Georgia}}\n\n===Soviet era===\nThere were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce a rugby union into Georgia, the earliest known being in 1928, with subsequent attempts also in 1940 and in 1948. Rugby was introduced to Georgia by [[Jacques Haspekian]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] man from [[Marseilles]] in [[France]] who taught the game to students in the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, although he then subsequently returned in France. He is still alive and living in Marseilles, he was interviewed on French radio on the occasion of Georgia playing France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The very first rugby session was held on October 15, 1959 in [[Tbilisi]], at the racecourse, where 20 people attended the meeting. The first Georgian club formed was the GPI (Georgian Polytechnical Institute), now known as \"Qochebi\".\n\nRugby's popularity in Georgia might be explained by its resemblance to the traditional Georgian game named [[Lelo Burti|\"Lelo\" or \"Lelo Burti\"]] (meaning \"Field Ball\"). This game was played in Georgia from ancient times and is still played on occasions in rural areas. A field (\"Lelo\") was selected between two river creeks which represented a playing ground. Two teams, usually consisting of the male population of neighboring villages, would face each other. The number of players from each side was not set, but included any able men each village could summon. A large, heavy ball was placed in the middle of the field and the goal of the game was to carry it over the river creek of the opposing side.\n\nThe first teams appeared in 1959. The [[Georgia Rugby Union]] was founded in 1964, but until the late 1980s it was part of the Soviet Union's rugby federation. The rugby union connection between France and Georgia started as links were established by the then powerful French Communist Party and many other left-wing organisations. Georgia initially did not have its own team and its best players would play for the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|USSR team]].\n\nIn 1988 Georgia produced their first national sevens side. In September 1989, Georgia got together with other FIRA countries to host a tour by [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Zimbabwe]]. Zimbabwe's first match on the tour was in the wet against Georgia in [[Kutaisi]], west of [[Tbilisi]], which Georgia won 16\u20133. The next year Georgia went to [[Zimbabwe]] where they played two tests, losing the first in [[Bulawayo]] and winning the second 26\u201310 in [[Harare]].\n\n===1990s===\nOn 9 April 1991 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union. Georgia was now a rugby union nation but getting matches was not easy: the old Soviet team continued under the name [[CIS (rugby)|Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Georgia were limited to the odd game against [[Ukraine national rugby union team|Ukraine]] until they gained membership of the [[World Rugby]] in 1992.\n\nFrench coach, [[Claude Saurel]], first arrived in Georgia in 1997 with a brief to assess the standard of sport; he and his development team have helped boost the profile of the sport. Saurel went on to work with the [[Georgia national rugby sevens team]], until he was appointed as the national coach in the summer of 1999.\n\nGeorgia's 1998 loss to [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] saw them play a two legged repechage [[1999 Rugby World Cup \u2013 repechage qualification|play-off]] against [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] to qualify for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. On that occasion Georgia lost the first leg 37\u20136 in [[Nuku\u02bbalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]] before a 28\u201327 win in Tbilisi. This was not enough and Georgia failed to qualify.\n\n===2000s: World Cup play===\n[[File:Georgia Rugby RUGBY union.jpg|thumb|Georgian team celebrating victory]]\nAfter France and Italy dropped from the reborn [[Rugby Europe International Championships|European Nations Cup]], Georgia became a major force in the tournament. In 2000, Georgia finished second in the competition, finishing behind [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]]. The following year, Georgia improved upon this, winning all five of their matches during the 2000\u201301 tournament, and thus finishing at the top of the table. They clinched the title by beating Romania away 31\u201320 on the final day.\nRugby union took off in the country, the travel and opportunities to land lucrative contracts in [[France]] made rugby union a glamorous pursuit in Georgia. Georgia placed second in the 2001\u201302 tournament. When Georgia played Russia in the European Nations Cup 65,000 people crammed into the national stadium in [[Tbilisi]].\n\nGeorgian first made an impact at [[Rugby Sevens]] by finishing a respectable 10th in the [[2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2001]] edition of the [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]] in Argentina.\n\nIn October 2002 Georgia faced Russia, in what was at the time one of the most important clashes ever between the two national sides. The victorious nation would head to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], and the loser would be relegated to fight it out for a repechage position. Neither nation had ever been to a World Cup, though Georgia had come close in 1999. 50,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia v Russia|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/24298.html|website=ESPN scrum|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> spectators turned out to the [[Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena|national stadium]]. Both nations kicked penalty goals in the first half, but Russia moved ahead with a 13\u20139 lead through a try, but Georgia were able to score a try of their own just before half time, with Levan Tsabadze putting them in front 14\u201313 at the break. Georgia held on, winning 17\u201313, a victory which sparked celebrations throughout the capital.<ref name=scrum>{{cite web|publisher=International Rugby Board |title=When Georgia\u2019s XV came of age |url=http://www.rwc2003.irb.com/EN/RWC+History/Great+Moments/Georgia.htm |accessdate=29 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507230540/http://www.rwc2003.irb.com/EN/RWC+History/Great+Moments/Georgia.htm |archivedate=7 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> Three of the 75 French-based Georgian players were denied permission to play in the tournament and were suspended. Another five were sacked and arrived in Australia as free agents. In a warm-up game held in [[Asti]] the Georgians lost to Italians 31\u201322.\n\nIn the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], Georgia were grouped into pool C alongside giants \u2013 [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]]. They suffered their heaviest ever defeat when beaten by England 84\u20136 in their opening game. In their second match, [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] comfortably eased to a 46\u20139 victory. Although they performed well against the Springboks (losing 46\u201319) they were disappointingly defeated by [[Uruguay national rugby union team|Uruguay]] 24\u201312, in a match that they were expected to win. They lost all four of their matches but had impressed against South Africa. Despite the sad financial state of their union, qualification has seen the sport's profile rise throughout Georgia.\n\n[[File:Ireland vs Georgia, Rugby World Cup 2007 line up.jpg|thumb|Lineout for Georgia during their loss to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]].]]\nIn the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] Georgia were drawn against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]] and tournament hosts [[France national rugby union team|France]] in [[2007 Rugby World Cup Pool D|Pool D]].\nThe team recorded their first win in the rugby world cup with a 30\u20130 win over Namibia in their Pool D match at Stade Felix-Bollaert. The foundation for the victory was laid by Georgia's experienced forward pack who wore down their opponents at the breakdown. The 2007 world cup campaign is also well remembered for Georgians by brilliant display against Ireland, where Georgia narrowly lost the match 10\u201314. The tournament was over with 7\u201364 defeat to hosts France on 30 September.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nAt [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], Georgia's  [[2011 Rugby World Cup Pool B|Pool B]] included England, [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] and  [[Scotland rugby union team|Scotland]], as well as local rivals [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]]. Despite the close nature of their pool, Georgia were impressive in all matches, including a tight match against Scotland which was lost 15\u20136, thus missing a bonus point narrowly and a 41\u201310 loss against England, which featured a man-of-the-match performance by flanker [[Mamuka Gorgodze]]. Georgia went on to record only their second ever Rugby World Cup win against Romania, winning 25\u20139 with another man-of-the-match performance by Mamuka Gorgodze. Georgia finished their campaign with a strong showing against Argentina, leading 7\u20135 at half time before conceding 20 unanswered points to lose 25\u20137. Thus Georgia finished their campaign with 1 win and 3 losses.\n\nIn the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] Georgia played against [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]], Argentina, title holders [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and the top African qualifier Namibia in [[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool C|Pool C]].\nThe group opener finished with Georgia's 17\u201310 victory against Tonga. It totally paid off for what the Lelos have worked so hard during RWC preparations. With this history-maker fixture, they won the third World Cup match in the history of Georgian Rugby.\nGeorgia lost second match against Argentina 9\u201354, although in the first half finished 14\u20139 for the Pumas. In the third match Georgia were defeated by New Zealand 43\u201310 in [[Cardiff]]. Again in the first half The Lelos held very well against the mighty All Blacks, with score remaining 22\u201310 for the world champions. \nIn the last match Georgia defeated Namibia 17\u201316, for the first time ever finished the group on third place with two wins and two defeats and secured their qualification for [[2019 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nIn 2016, Georgia once again cemented its claim to be the seventh best national rugby team in Europe, when they won the [[2014\u201316 European Nations Cup First Division|European Nations Cup]] for the sixth consecutive time, with 10 wins from 10 matches. In the [[2016 mid-year rugby union internationals|2016 mid-year internationals]] the Lelos traveled to the Pacific islands for the first time and finished the historic tour unbeaten with 19\u201319 draw against Samoa, 23\u201320 victory against Tonga and 14\u20133 victory against Fiji.\n\n==Lelo==\nThe team's nickname, The Lelos, comes from [[lelo burti]], a traditional Georgian sport with strong similarities to rugby. ''Lelo'' has been adopted as the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] word for [[Try (rugby)|try]] (the highest-valued score in rugby). One standard cheer of Georgian rugby union fans is ''Lelo, Lelo, Sakartvelo'' (Try, Try, Georgia).\n\n== Record ==\n\n=== Overall ===\n{{World Rugby Rankings|Georgia|history=yes}}\nGeorgia has won 140 of their 225 representative matches, a winning record of 62.22%.

A member of their inaugural World Cup side in 2003, he captained Georgia in the 2007 tournament, but was forced out of the squad because of an injury. This injury ultimately led to him announcing his retirement from international rugby, after gaining 48 caps. He returned to the squad in late 2008, playing against [[Scotland A national rugby union team|Scotland A]] and taking part in the [[2008\u201310 European Nations Cup First Division|2009 European Nations Cup]], where he scored a game-saving try against [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portugal]] on 14 February 2009.\n*[[Malkhaz Urjukashvili]] \u2013 Moved to France, where he has been playing. He is one of the best players and scorers for Georgia, holding currently 65 caps for his National Team, with 18 tries and 300 points. His first match was a 29\u201315 win over [[Croatia national rugby union team|Croatia]], in [[Tbilisi]], at 12 October 1997, aged only 17 years old. This made him one of the youngest players ever to be capped at international rugby level. He was present at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], playing three matches and scoring 9 points. In the game against England, he kicked a long range penalty that registered as Georgia's first Rugby World Cup points (England eventually won the game 84\u20136). He was called once again for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], playing in all the four matches and scoring one conversion. He continued to be a valuable player in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] qualification, the third Georgia gained in a row.\n\n[[File:Mamuka Gorgodze 2011.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mamuka Gorgodze]]\n*[[Mamuka Gorgodze]] \u2013 Switched to rugby from basketball aged 17. His first club was [[Lelo Saracens|Lelo]] in the [[Georgia Championship|Georgian Top League]], he was soon selected for the Georgia national team and made his debut in 2003 against [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], at the age of just 18 and not long after he started playing rugby. However he was not selected for Georgia's first appearance at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] later that year. In 2004 he became a regular fixture for the Georgia side. He was a regular in the Georgia side though and was selected for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], and started three of Georgia's four matches at the World Cup, being one of Georgia's star players. Gorgodze became a success as [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]] during this season, and halfway through the season French newspaper [[L'\u00c9quipe]] commented that he improved his technique and became a mobile and unstoppable player. Gorgodze played a big role in Montpellier finishing the [[2010\u201311 Top 14 season]] as runners up.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=Julien|title=Gorgodze percute, tamponne, caram\u00e9lise, retourne.

The team takes part in the annual [[Rugby Europe International Championships|Rugby Europe Championship]] (previously named European Nations Cup) and participates in the [[Rugby World Cup]], which takes place every four years.\n\nGeorgia is currently considered a second-tier rugby union nation and is one of the world's fastest-growing rugby nations. The Lelos participate in the Rugby Europe Championship, winning the tournament in [[2000\u201301 European Nations Cup First Division|2001]], [[2006\u201308 European Nations Cup First Division|2008]], [[2008\u201310 European Nations Cup First Division|2009]], [[2010\u201312 European Nations Cup First Division|2011]], [[2010\u201312 European Nations Cup First Division|2012]], [[2012\u201314 European Nations Cup First Division|2013]], [[2012\u201314 European Nations Cup First Division|2014]], [[2014\u201316 European Nations Cup First Division|2015]], [[2014\u201316 European Nations Cup First Division|2016]], [[2018 Rugby Europe Championship|2018]] and [[2019 Rugby Europe Championship|2019]] seasons. The bulk of the national squad are based in France, in both the Top 14 and lower divisions. This is a practice that was popularized by former national team coach, [[Claude Saurel]], a Frenchman.\n\nRugby is one of the most popular sports in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The national team qualified for the [[Rugby World Cup]] four times, first in [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003]] \u2013 playing against rugby powers such as [[England national rugby union team|England]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. The Lelos recorded their first ever World Cup win in [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], where they beat [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]] 30\u20130. As of 6 February 2017, Georgia are [[World Rugby Rankings|ranked]] 12th in the world by [[World Rugby]]. Since 2013, Georgia has hosted the [[World Rugby Tbilisi Cup]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|Rugby union in Georgia}}\n\n===Soviet era===\nThere were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce a rugby union into Georgia, the earliest known being in 1928, with subsequent attempts also in 1940 and in 1948. Rugby was introduced to Georgia by [[Jacques Haspekian]], an [[Armenians|Armenian]] man from [[Marseilles]] in [[France]] who taught the game to students in the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, although he then subsequently returned in France. He is still alive and living in Marseilles, he was interviewed on French radio on the occasion of Georgia playing France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The very first rugby session was held on October 15, 1959 in [[Tbilisi]], at the racecourse, where 20 people attended the meeting. The first Georgian club formed was the GPI (Georgian Polytechnical Institute), now known as \"Qochebi\".\n\nRugby's popularity in Georgia might be explained by its resemblance to the traditional Georgian game named [[Lelo Burti|\"Lelo\" or \"Lelo Burti\"]] (meaning \"Field Ball\"). This game was played in Georgia from ancient times and is still played on occasions in rural areas. A field (\"Lelo\") was selected between two river creeks which represented a playing ground. Two teams, usually consisting of the male population of neighboring villages, would face each other. The number of players from each side was not set, but included any able men each village could summon. A large, heavy ball was placed in the middle of the field and the goal of the game was to carry it over the river creek of the opposing side.\n\nThe first teams appeared in 1959. The [[Georgia Rugby Union]] was founded in 1964, but until the late 1980s it was part of the Soviet Union's rugby federation. The rugby union connection between France and Georgia started as links were established by the then powerful French Communist Party and many other left-wing organisations. Georgia initially did not have its own team and its best players would play for the [[Soviet Union national rugby union team|USSR team]].\n\nIn 1988 Georgia produced their first national sevens side. In September 1989, Georgia got together with other FIRA countries to host a tour by [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team|Zimbabwe]]. Zimbabwe's first match on the tour was in the wet against Georgia in [[Kutaisi]], west of [[Tbilisi]], which Georgia won 16\u20133. The next year Georgia went to [[Zimbabwe]] where they played two tests, losing the first in [[Bulawayo]] and winning the second 26\u201310 in [[Harare]].\n\n===1990s===\nOn 9 April 1991 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union. Georgia was now a rugby union nation but getting matches was not easy: the old Soviet team continued under the name [[CIS (rugby)|Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Georgia were limited to the odd game against [[Ukraine national rugby union team|Ukraine]] until they gained membership of the [[World Rugby]] in 1992.\n\nFrench coach, [[Claude Saurel]], first arrived in Georgia in 1997 with a brief to assess the standard of sport; he and his development team have helped boost the profile of the sport. Saurel went on to work with the [[Georgia national rugby sevens team]], until he was appointed as the national coach in the summer of 1999.\n\nGeorgia's 1998 loss to [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] saw them play a two legged repechage [[1999 Rugby World Cup \u2013 repechage qualification|play-off]] against [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]] to qualify for the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. On that occasion Georgia lost the first leg 37\u20136 in [[Nuku\u02bbalofa|Nuku{{Okina}}alofa]] before a 28\u201327 win in Tbilisi. This was not enough and Georgia failed to qualify.\n\n===2000s: World Cup play===\n[[File:Georgia Rugby RUGBY union.jpg|thumb|Georgian team celebrating victory]]\nAfter France and Italy dropped from the reborn [[Rugby Europe International Championships|European Nations Cup]], Georgia became a major force in the tournament. In 2000, Georgia finished second in the competition, finishing behind [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]]. The following year, Georgia improved upon this, winning all five of their matches during the 2000\u201301 tournament, and thus finishing at the top of the table. They clinched the title by beating Romania away 31\u201320 on the final day.\nRugby union took off in the country, the travel and opportunities to land lucrative contracts in [[France]] made rugby union a glamorous pursuit in Georgia. Georgia placed second in the 2001\u201302 tournament. When Georgia played Russia in the European Nations Cup 65,000 people crammed into the national stadium in [[Tbilisi]].\n\nGeorgian first made an impact at [[Rugby Sevens]] by finishing a respectable 10th in the [[2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2001]] edition of the [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]] in Argentina.\n\nIn October 2002 Georgia faced Russia, in what was at the time one of the most important clashes ever between the two national sides. The victorious nation would head to the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], and the loser would be relegated to fight it out for a repechage position. Neither nation had ever been to a World Cup, though Georgia had come close in 1999. 50,000<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia v Russia|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/scrum/rugby/match/24298.html|website=ESPN scrum|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref> spectators turned out to the [[Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena|national stadium]]. Both nations kicked penalty goals in the first half, but Russia moved ahead with a 13\u20139 lead through a try, but Georgia were able to score a try of their own just before half time, with Levan Tsabadze putting them in front 14\u201313 at the break. Georgia held on, winning 17\u201313, a victory which sparked celebrations throughout the capital.<ref name=scrum>{{cite web|publisher=International Rugby Board |title=When Georgia\u2019s XV came of age |url=http://www.rwc2003.irb.com/EN/RWC+History/Great+Moments/Georgia.htm |accessdate=29 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507230540/http://www.rwc2003.irb.com/EN/RWC+History/Great+Moments/Georgia.htm |archivedate=7 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> Three of the 75 French-based Georgian players were denied permission to play in the tournament and were suspended. Another five were sacked and arrived in Australia as free agents. In a warm-up game held in [[Asti]] the Georgians lost to Italians 31\u201322.\n\nIn the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], Georgia were grouped into pool C alongside giants \u2013 [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and [[England national rugby union team|England]]. They suffered their heaviest ever defeat when beaten by England 84\u20136 in their opening game. In their second match, [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] comfortably eased to a 46\u20139 victory. Although they performed well against the Springboks (losing 46\u201319) they were disappointingly defeated by [[Uruguay national rugby union team|Uruguay]] 24\u201312, in a match that they were expected to win. They lost all four of their matches but had impressed against South Africa. Despite the sad financial state of their union, qualification has seen the sport's profile rise throughout Georgia.\n\n[[File:Ireland vs Georgia, Rugby World Cup 2007 line up.jpg|thumb|Lineout for Georgia during their loss to [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007 World Cup]].]]\nIn the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] Georgia were drawn against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]] and tournament hosts [[France national rugby union team|France]] in [[2007 Rugby World Cup Pool D|Pool D]].\nThe team recorded their first win in the rugby world cup with a 30\u20130 win over Namibia in their Pool D match at Stade Felix-Bollaert. The foundation for the victory was laid by Georgia's experienced forward pack who wore down their opponents at the breakdown. The 2007 world cup campaign is also well remembered for Georgians by brilliant display against Ireland, where Georgia narrowly lost the match 10\u201314. The tournament was over with 7\u201364 defeat to hosts France on 30 September.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nAt [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], Georgia's  [[2011 Rugby World Cup Pool B|Pool B]] included England, [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] and  [[Scotland rugby union team|Scotland]], as well as local rivals [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]]. Despite the close nature of their pool, Georgia were impressive in all matches, including a tight match against Scotland which was lost 15\u20136, thus missing a bonus point narrowly and a 41\u201310 loss against England, which featured a man-of-the-match performance by flanker [[Mamuka Gorgodze]]. Georgia went on to record only their second ever Rugby World Cup win against Romania, winning 25\u20139 with another man-of-the-match performance by Mamuka Gorgodze. Georgia finished their campaign with a strong showing against Argentina, leading 7\u20135 at half time before conceding 20 unanswered points to lose 25\u20137. Thus Georgia finished their campaign with 1 win and 3 losses.\n\nIn the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] Georgia played against [[Tonga national rugby union team|Tonga]], Argentina, title holders [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] and the top African qualifier Namibia in [[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool C|Pool C]].\nThe group opener finished with Georgia's 17\u201310 victory against Tonga. It totally paid off for what the Lelos have worked so hard during RWC preparations. With this history-maker fixture, they won the third World Cup match in the history of Georgian Rugby.\nGeorgia lost second match against Argentina 9\u201354, although in the first half finished 14\u20139 for the Pumas. In the third match Georgia were defeated by New Zealand 43\u201310 in [[Cardiff]]. Again in the first half The Lelos held very well against the mighty All Blacks, with score remaining 22\u201310 for the world champions. \nIn the last match Georgia defeated Namibia 17\u201316, for the first time ever finished the group on third place with two wins and two defeats and secured their qualification for [[2019 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nIn 2016, Georgia once again cemented its claim to be the seventh best national rugby team in Europe, when they won the [[2014\u201316 European Nations Cup First Division|European Nations Cup]] for the sixth consecutive time, with 10 wins from 10 matches. In the [[2016 mid-year rugby union internationals|2016 mid-year internationals]] the Lelos traveled to the Pacific islands for the first time and finished the historic tour unbeaten with 19\u201319 draw against Samoa, 23\u201320 victory against Tonga and 14\u20133 victory against Fiji.\n\n==Lelo==\nThe team's nickname, The Lelos, comes from [[lelo burti]], a traditional Georgian sport with strong similarities to rugby. ''Lelo'' has been adopted as the [[Georgian language|Georgian]] word for [[Try (rugby)|try]] (the highest-valued score in rugby). One standard cheer of Georgian rugby union fans is ''Lelo, Lelo, Sakartvelo'' (Try, Try, Georgia).\n\n== Record ==\n\n=== Overall ===\n{{World Rugby Rankings|Georgia|history=yes}}\nGeorgia has won 140 of their 225 representative matches, a winning record of 62.22%. Since [[World Rugby Rankings|World Rankings]] were introduced by [[World Rugby]] in September 2003, Georgia have occupied below number ten the majority of the time.\n\nBelow is table of the representative rugby matches played by a Georgia national team at test level up until 16 September 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby Union \u2013 ESPN Scrum \u2013 Statsguru \u2013 Test matches \u2013 Team records|url=http://stats.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/stats/index.html?class=1;orderby=team;team=81;template=results;type=team;view=opposition|website=ESPN scrum|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

A member of their inaugural World Cup side in 2003, he captained Georgia in the 2007 tournament, but was forced out of the squad because of an injury. This injury ultimately led to him announcing his retirement from international rugby, after gaining 48 caps. He returned to the squad in late 2008, playing against [[Scotland A national rugby union team|Scotland A]] and taking part in the [[2008\u201310 European Nations Cup First Division|2009 European Nations Cup]], where he scored a game-saving try against [[Portugal national rugby union team|Portugal]] on 14 February 2009.\n*[[Malkhaz Urjukashvili]] \u2013 Moved to France, where he has been playing. He is one of the best players and scorers for Georgia, holding currently 65 caps for his National Team, with 18 tries and 300 points. His first match was a 29\u201315 win over [[Croatia national rugby union team|Croatia]], in [[Tbilisi]], at 12 October 1997, aged only 17 years old. This made him one of the youngest players ever to be capped at international rugby level. He was present at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], playing three matches and scoring 9 points. In the game against England, he kicked a long range penalty that registered as Georgia's first Rugby World Cup points (England eventually won the game 84\u20136). He was called once again for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], playing in all the four matches and scoring one conversion. He continued to be a valuable player in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] qualification, the third Georgia gained in a row.\n\n[[File:Mamuka Gorgodze 2011.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mamuka Gorgodze]]\n*[[Mamuka Gorgodze]] \u2013 Switched to rugby from basketball aged 17. His first club was [[Lelo Saracens|Lelo]] in the [[Georgia Championship|Georgian Top League]], he was soon selected for the Georgia national team and made his debut in 2003 against [[Spain national rugby union team|Spain]], at the age of just 18 and not long after he started playing rugby. However he was not selected for Georgia's first appearance at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] later that year. In 2004 he became a regular fixture for the Georgia side. He was a regular in the Georgia side though and was selected for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], and started three of Georgia's four matches at the World Cup, being one of Georgia's star players. Gorgodze became a success as [[Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]] during this season, and halfway through the season French newspaper [[L'\u00c9quipe]] commented that he improved his technique and became a mobile and unstoppable player. Gorgodze played a big role in Montpellier finishing the [[2010\u201311 Top 14 season]] as runners up.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=Julien|title=Gorgodze percute, tamponne, caram\u00e9lise, retourne.

The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |website=United States Department of State |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of  Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197,  translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155-156, & 164-169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903-1907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 - U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set - U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command. The remnants of the First Philippine Republic continued the struggle for independence into local regional and provincial levels as late as 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/war |title=The Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |publisher=Office of the Historian, Foreign Service Institute |website=United States Department of State |access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n===Works cited in footnotes===\n* Almario, Virgilio (1998) *Rebolusyong Filipino, Intimas Memorias, memoirs of  Colonel Sityar, in Spanish, page 197,  translated to Tagalog by Almario\n* {{cite book|last= Alvarez|first=Santiago V.|title=The katipunan and the revolution: memoirs of a general : with the original Tagalog text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F3q-krDckHwC|year=1992|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-077-7|ref=harv}}<!--note: also mentions \n\na General Mariano Alvarez (Apoy) on p.43, \na Lieutenant General Artemio Ricarte (Vibora) on p. 80, \na General Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo) on p.132, \na General Ramon Bernardo (Salogo) on p.145 & 163, \na General Luis Malinis on p.147,157 \na General Lucino de la Cruz (Ipo-Ipo) on p.150,\na General Francisco de Asis (Labe, Heneral Kiko) on p.152-153, 155-156, & 164-169\na General Vincente Leyba (Kalentong) on p.159 \na General Felipe Estrella on p. 182-189\na General Eusebio Roque  (Maestrong Sebio,Dimabunggo) on p. 182-189\na General Julian Santos on p. 195\na General Salvador Estrella on p. 197\na General Modesto Ritual on p.201-202 \na Information about \"Kolorum\" (Colorum) and religious-insurrection movements on p. 207\n-->\n\n* {{cite book|last= Halili|first=M.c.|title=Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC|year=2004|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-3934-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last= Linn|first=Brian McAllister|authorlink=Brian McAllister Linn|title=The U.S. Army and Counterinsurgency in the Philippine War, 1899-1902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5WOrmt_VxcC|year=2000|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4948-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Nakpil|first=Carmen Guerrero |title=Whatever: a new collection of later essays, 1987-2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fV0Ro1qPjXAC|year=2002|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=978-971-550-417-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite news |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/98377/king-of-the-philippines |title=King of the Philippines |last=Ocampo |first=Ambeth |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=October 21, 2016 |access-date=December 27, 2017}}\n* {{cite book |last= Ochosa |first= Orlino |date= January 1, 1995|title=Bandoleros, Outlawed Guerrillas of the Philippine-American War, 1903-1907 |url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Bandoleros-Outlawed-Guerrillas-Philippine-American-War-1903-1907-Orlino-Ochosa/9789711005559 |location=United States of America |publisher=New Day Publishers |isbn=9711005557|ref=harv}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Macario Sakay on  p.25\n-->\n* {{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Sonia M.|last2=Zaide|first2=Gregorio F.|title=The Philippines: a unique nation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6ZtAQAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co.|isbn=978-971-642-064-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|title=United States Congressional Serial Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HwtHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA664|year=1902|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}<!--\nnote: also mentions \n\na General Berixio Consola on  p.292\n-->\n* {{Google books| kO_WgIWHPH8C|Report of the Lieutenant-General Commanding the Army, Part 9 - U.S. Government Printing Office, 1902}}<!--note: also mentions\n\na Colonel Norberto Mayo on p. 175\n--> \n* {{Google books| ML9MAAAAYAAJ|1904 Annual Report of the Secretary of War: Volume 7 United States War Dept|page=38}}\n* {{Google books| ZEhUAAAAIAAJ|1907 Congressional Serial Set - U.S. Government Printing Office|page=240}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/ulatfilipino/311705/sino-si-heneral-kalentong-na-kilalang-kalye-sa-mandaluyong/story/ |title=Sino Si Heneral Kalentong Na Kilalang Kalye Sa Mandaluyong?

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as [[Hampstead Heath]] in London.<ref name=\"London\" /> Filming [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on February 4, 2020.<ref name=\"Wrap\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn March 2020, [[Scanline VFX]], one of

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. Although, the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike; jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses and manipulates the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\", thus making the narrator go further into distress.\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. Although, the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

Passion there was none.\"). Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\", which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong.

Adults have a white beak, with a pale white \u2018cape\u2019 that extends to halfway between the dorsal fin and head. The dorsal fin is set far back down the body and is white-tipped. The flukes also have white tips. When observed closely, either at sea or when stranded, these whales show a pale neckband that separates the darker grey colouration found upon the head and melon from the rest of the body. While adult whales show striking colouration, juvenile animals are harder to distinguish from other beaked whale species, having a uniform grey colouration. <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pitman |first1= RL |last2= Totterdell|first2= J|last3= Wellard |first3= R |last4= Cullen |first4= P |last5= De Boer |first5= M |date= 2019 |title=Long in the tooth: Biological observations from at-sea sightings of strap-toothed beaked whales ('''''Mesoplodon layardii''''') |url= https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.12575| journal= Marine Mammal Science|volume= 35|issue= 3|pages= 1141- 1161|doi= 10.1111/mms.12575}} </ref> Males can reach around {{convert|5.9|m|ft}}, whereas females reach {{convert|6.2|m|ft}} and likely weigh around {{convert|1000|-|1300|kg|lb}}.

Male strap-toothed beaked whales begin to develop a large flat tusk from each lower jaw as juveniles, growing at a 45\u00b0 angle back towards the head and over the [[rostrum]] (beak). Reaching up to 34cm in length <ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Best | first1 = P\n| title = Whales and dolphins of the southern African subregion.\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2007 | location = Cambridge}}</ref>, the teeth may overlap at the tips, restricting the gape size of the animal.

Adults have a white beak, with a pale white \u2018cape\u2019 that extends to halfway between the dorsal fin and head. The dorsal fin is set far back down the body and is white-tipped. The flukes also have white tips. When observed closely, either at sea or when stranded, these whales show a pale neckband that separates the darker grey colouration found upon the head and melon from the rest of the body. While adult whales show striking colouration, juvenile animals are harder to distinguish from other beaked whale species, having a uniform grey colouration. <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pitman |first1= RL |last2= Totterdell|first2= J|last3= Wellard |first3= R |last4= Cullen |first4= P |last5= De Boer |first5= M |date= 2019 |title=Long in the tooth: Biological observations from at-sea sightings of strap-toothed beaked whales ('''''Mesoplodon layardii''''') |url= https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.12575| journal= Marine Mammal Science|volume= 35|issue= 3|pages= 1141- 1161|doi= 10.1111/mms.12575}} </ref> Males can reach around {{convert|5.9|m|ft}}, whereas females reach {{convert|6.2|m|ft}} and likely weigh around {{convert|1000|-|1300|kg|lb}}.

Male strap-toothed beaked whales begin to develop a large flat tusk from each lower jaw as juveniles, growing at a 45\u00b0 angle back towards the head and over the [[rostrum]] (beak). Reaching up to 34cm in length <ref>{{cite book\n | last1 = Best | first1 = P\n| title = Whales and dolphins of the southern African subregion.\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2007 | location = Cambridge}}</ref>, the teeth may overlap at the tips, restricting the gape size of the animal. Two stranded adult male strap-toothed beaked whales were recorded as only being able to open their mouths 3.2cm and 4cm wide, compared to females and juveniles that had a gape size of 6.5cm.

It can indicate one or more of the following:\n\n* As the name of the worldview according to which one's own religion is not held to be the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus the acknowledgement that at least some truths and true values exist in other religions.\n* As acceptance of the concept that two or more religions with mutually exclusive truth claims are equally valid, this may be considered a form of either [[toleration]] (a concept that arose as a result of the [[European wars of religion]]) or [[moral relativism]].\n* The understanding that the exclusive claims of different religions turn out, upon closer examination, to be variations of universal truths that have been taught since time immemorial. This is called ''Perennialism'' (based on the concept of ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]]'') or [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].\n* Sometimes as a synonym for [[ecumenism]], i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s within a single religion.\n* As a term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different [[religion]]s or [[religious denomination]]s.\n*As a [[social norm]] and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\">{{Citation | last = Silk | first = Mark| title = Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis | volume = 612 | pages = 64\u201381\n  | date = July 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and scopes==\n{{Main|Religious tolerance}}\n[[File:Kazan church.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of All Religions]] in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]] ]]\n[[File:1893parliament.jpg|thumb|Congress of [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], [[Chicago]], 1893]]\n\nReligious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in ''Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism'', explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century [[United States]]. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]]:<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\">Beneke 2006: 6.</ref> \"The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.\"<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from \"a late eighteenth-century perspective\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-5\">Beneke 2006: 5.</ref> Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with \"something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> Mark Silka, in \"Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis\", states that Religious pluralism \"enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a [[cultural construct]] that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.\"<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\"/>\n\nReligious pluralism can be defined as \"respecting the otherness of others\". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[Paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].\n\nGiving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.<ref name=meister>Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 32-57</ref>\n\n[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/what-relativism|title=What is relativism?|work=CARM - The Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry}}</ref> Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. [[Syncretism]] must not be confused with [[ecumenism]], the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of religious pluralism}}\n[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Front page of the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]], which recognized two different churches in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n[[Cultural pluralism|Cultural]] and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[post-modernity]].\n\nGerman philosophers of religion [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] concluded that [[Eastern religions|Asian religious traditions]], in particular [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], were the earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of [[Freedom of religion|freedom to the individuals to choose their own faith]] and develop a personal religious construct within it<ref name=meister2/><ref>Roof & McKinney (1985), ''Denominational America and the new religious pluralism'', The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 480(1), pp. 24-38</ref> (see also [[Buddhism and Hinduism|Relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism]]); [[Jainism]], another [[Indian religions|ancient Indian religion]], as well as [[Daoism]] have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints.<ref name=meister2>Chad Meister (2010), ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp. 62-72</ref> The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion after the [[French Revolution]] ([[liberalism]], [[democracy]], [[civil and political rights]], [[freedom of thought]], [[separation of Church and State]], [[secularization]]), with rising acceptance of religious pluralism and [[decline of Christianity]]. According to Chad Meister,<ref name=meister2/> these pluralist trends in the Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism and religious tolerance.\n\n==Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\n[[File:Religions 4x5.png|thumb|1st row: [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Buddhism]], [[Cao Dai]], [[Christianity]]<br />2nd row: [[Druidism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]]<br />3rd row: [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], [[Ra\u00eblism]], [[Satanism]]<br />4th row: [[Shinto]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Tenrikyo]]<br />5th row: [[Thelema]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Wicca]], [[Zoroastrianism]]]]\n\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the unity of religion}}\n[[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], founder of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], a religion that developed in Persia, though not a sect of Islam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|title=Not a Sect|work=bci.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215112206/http://bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|archivedate=2005-12-15}}</ref> urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic messengers. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h taught that Bah\u00e1'\u00eds must associate with peoples of all religions, showing the love of God in relations with them, whether this is reciprocated or not.\n\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed's refer to the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Progressive revelation]], which means that God's will is revealed to mankind progressively as mankind matures and is better able to comprehend the purpose of God in creating humanity. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: [[Abraham]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (the founder of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]) among them. In the ''[[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]]'' (''Book of Certitude''), Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.\n\n==Buddhism==\nThe earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:\n\n<blockquote>All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\nWhen asked, \"Don\u2019t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?\" the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] said:<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a \"Fashion\"''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nPeople from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don\u2019t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.\n\nIn the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something\u2026 That is not healthy.\n\nFor individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.\n\nI am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Classical civilization: Greek and Roman religions==\n{{See also|Ancient Greek religion|Greco-Roman mysteries|Paganism|Pax deorum}}\n\nFor the Romans, [[Religion in Ancient Rome|religion was part of the daily life]].<ref>[[J\u00f6rg R\u00fcpke]], \"Roman Religion \u2013 Religions of Rome,\" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances; in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Era]], as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> [[Women in Ancient Rome|Women]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgins]], who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|disbanded under Christian persecution and domination]].\n\nThe Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored. The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.\n\n[[Mystery religions]] imported from the [[Near East]] ([[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Parthian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]), which offered initiates [[Soteriology|salvation through a personal God]] and [[Afterlife|eternal life after the death]], were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[Sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|Senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC.\n\n[[File:0 Relief repr\u00e9sentant Mithra - Louvre-Lens (2).JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marble relief of [[Tauroctony|Mithras slaying the bull]] (2nd century, [[Louvre-Lens]]); [[Mithraism]] was among the most widespread [[mystery religions]] of the Roman Empire.<ref>G.

Koch, \"lay at the core of the genius of cultural assimilation which made the Roman Empire possible\"; entry on \"Interpretatio romana\", in ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'' (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 974.</ref> since they believed that preserving tradition promoted social stability.<ref>R\u00fcpke, \"Roman Religion \u2013 Religions of Rome,\" p. 4; Benjamin H.

Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.</ref>\n\nOne way that Rome incorporated diverse peoples was by [[Freedom of religion|supporting their religious heritage]], building temples to local deities that framed their theology within the hierarchy of Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local Gods.<ref>Janet Huskinson, ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 261.</ref> By the height of the Empire, numerous [[Interpretatio graeca|international deities]] were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote [[Roman provinces|provinces]] (among them [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Serapis]], [[Epona]]), and Gods of [[Monism|solar monism]] such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]]. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one deity or one cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]].<ref>A classic essay on this topic is [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], \"The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State\", in ''Classical Philology'', 81.4 (1986), pp. 285\u2013297.</ref> The monotheistic rigor of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict.\n\n==Christianity==\n{{Main|Christianity and other religions}}\n{{See also|Ecumenism}}\nSome Christians<ref>[http://www.christians.eu/why-jesus/ Why Jesus?] Article stating that Jesus is the saviour and not Mohammed or Buddha\u2014see second part of this article.</ref> have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept.\n\nMaximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Most Christians hold this idea to be [[logic]]ally impossible from the [[Principle of contradiction]].<ref>[http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html Defending Salvation Through Christ Alone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003214003/http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html |date=2009-10-03 }} By Jason Carlson, Christian Ministries International</ref> The two largest Christian branches, the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Orthodox Church]], both claim to be the \"[[one true church]]\" and that \"[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus|outside the true Church there is no salvation]]\"; Protestantism however, which has many different denominations, has no consistent doctrine in this regard, and has a variety of different positions regarding religious pluralism.\n\nOther Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions.

Jones |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=October 1977}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Christian views===\nBefore the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], mainstream Christianity confessed \"one holy catholic and apostolic church\", in the words of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the [[Catholic Church]] makes the claim that it alone is the [[one true church|one and only true Church]] founded by [[Jesus Christ]], but the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.\n\nChurch unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of \"validity\" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as \"[[heresy|heterodox]]\" and \"[[schism]]atic\", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least [[secundum quid]]. (See [[ecumenicism]]).\n\n===Modern Christian views===\nSome other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in \"one\" church, an \"invisible church\" which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some [[evangelical]] Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this \"invisible church\", and usually they reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apologeticsindex.org/d01b.html#prot |title=The Protestant Principle |website=A Biblical Guide To Orthodoxy And Heresy |access-date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms \"developmental theology,\" understood to mean that the \"[[Holy Spirit]], in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the [[deposit of faith]] (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles--these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize [[baptism of desire]] quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14-16, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: \"When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires . . . . They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . . . .<ref>See Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), pp. 101-102.</ref> Various forms of \"implicit faith\" come to hold standing, until at [[Vatican Council II]], the Church declares: \"Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life\" (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration [[Nostra aetate]] addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them.\n\n==Hinduism==\n{{See also|Hinduism and other religions}}\n[[Hinduism]] is naturally pluralistic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: \"Truth is One, though the sages know it variously\" (''\u00c9kam sat vipra bahud\u0101 vadanti'').<ref>Rig Veda 1.164.46</ref> Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: \"As people approach me, so I receive them.

These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, [[Al-Ma'ida|Surah Al-Ma'idah]] verses 47 through 49 state:\n{{quote\n|Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than those who rebel. To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. '''If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people''', but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious. ({{cite quran|5|47|end=49|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Ankabut verse 45 through 47 state:\n{{quote\n|Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing in life without doubt. And Allah knows the deeds that ye do. And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, \"We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; '''Our Allah and your Allah is one'''; and it is to Him we bow in Islam.\" And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the [[People of the Book]] believe therein, as also do some of these pagan Arabs: and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. ({{cite quran|29|45|end=47|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-E-Imran verses 62 through 66 state:\n{{quote\n|This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: \"O People of the Book! '''come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah'''; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.\" If then they turn back, say ye: \"Bear witness that we at least are Muslims bowing to Allah's Will. Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing even in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! ({{cite quran|3|62|end=66|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:\n{{quote\n|Say : O ye that reject Faith!

To you be your Way, and to me mine. ({{cite quran|109|1|end=6|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSeveral verses of the [[Quran]]  state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the [[pagan]]s (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'):<ref name=mb/> \n{{quote|\nA (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:- Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith. But when the forbidden months are past, '''then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them''', seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ({{cite quran|9|1|end=5|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nHowever, this verse has been explained.<ref>Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53, emphasis added</ref>\n{{quote|\n. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; '''however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious.''' One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).({{cite Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53| style=nosup}}) }}\n\nBernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145\u2013150}} He writes of jihad as a distinct \"religious obligation\", but suggests that \"it is a pity\" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:\n{{quote|\nMuslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays.\"{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}\n\nIn Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the [[Jizya]], a tax, with willing submission.\n{{quote|\nFight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, '''even if they are of the People of the Book''', until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. ({{cite quran|9|29|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSome people have  concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:\n{{quote|\nThese Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.({{source=Abualrub, Holy Wars, Crusades, Jihad}}) }}\n\nIn Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the [[Apostasy|apostates]]. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n{{quote|\nWhy should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites?

But if they revert to [open] enmity, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (Of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If God had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (guarantees of) peace, then God hath opened no way for you (to war against them).

Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are [[Rumi]], [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Shadhili]], [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. See many more famous Sufis at the [[List of Sufis]]. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also [[Blind men and an elephant]]. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols.<ref>http://registan.net/2007/11/12/rumi-the-alchemist-of-interfaith-tolerance/</ref> Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other.  He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi\u2019s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.\n\nRumi says:\n<blockquote>\nI looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. \n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n<blockquote>\nHow many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.\n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n <blockquote>\nA true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,\nbe sure of that.\nSince in the religion of Love,\nthere is no irreverence or faith.\nWhen in Love,\nbody, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.\nBecome this,\nfall in Love,\nand you will not be separated again.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Ahmadiyya===\n{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}\nAhmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.\n\nThe Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:\n\"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America\u2014all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur\u2019an\" by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad.

First and the second commandment, you shall not have another God except me, worship your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Throughout the Hebrew Bible the sovereignty of Yahweh as the only God is the key pillar of a chosen community of Israel.\n\n==Sikhism==\n{{See|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]], influenced them and was influenced by them.\n\nThe [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy book of the [[Sikh]]s, says:\n{{quote|Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.|  Guru Granth Sahib page 1350<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1350&english=t&id=57718|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}</ref>}}\n\nAs well as:\n<blockquote>\nSome call the Lord \"Ram, Ram\", and some \"Khuda\". Some serve Him as \"Gusain\", others as \"Allah\". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885)<ref>{{cite web|title=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?ction=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=885|work=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nOne who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142)<ref>{{cite web|title=pluarism in sggs|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=142|work=pluarism in sggs|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that \"peoples of other faiths\" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.\n\nAdditionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:\n<blockquote>\nFirst, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| \n<ref>{{cite web|title=aval allah|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1349&english=t&id=57707#l57707|work=aval allah}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAgain, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:\n<blockquote>\n[[Bhagat Namdev|Naam Dayv]] the printer, and [[Kabir|Kabeer]] the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] (\"word\") lose their ego and class consciousness.

He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.\n\nSikhs have been considered eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar]], who on the pleas of a [[pandit]] of the [[Kashmiris]], agreed to fight against a tyrannic [[Moghul Empire]] (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.\n\n==Religious pluralism and human service professions==\nThe concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.<ref name=p97/><ref name=zp>Brian J.

New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}</ref> has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:\n\n<blockquote>\n...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path \"up the mountain of God,\" the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality.... (p. 167)<ref name=zp/>\n</blockquote>\n\nImportantly, \"the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy\" (p.&nbsp;168).<ref name=zp/> The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as \"should religious issues be discussed in counseling?\", have also been presented in tabular form (p.&nbsp;362, Table 12.1).<ref name=p97/>\n\nThe profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: \"With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative\" (p.&nbsp;182).<ref name=nf>Nils Friberg (2001).

This is called ''Perennialism'' (based on the concept of ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]]'') or [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].\n* Sometimes as a synonym for [[ecumenism]], i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s within a single religion.\n* As a term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different [[religion]]s or [[religious denomination]]s.\n*As a [[social norm]] and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\">{{Citation | last = Silk | first = Mark| title = Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis | volume = 612 | pages = 64\u201381\n  | date = July 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and scopes==\n{{Main|Religious tolerance}}\n[[File:Kazan church.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of All Religions]] in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]] ]]\n[[File:1893parliament.jpg|thumb|Congress of [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], [[Chicago]], 1893]]\n\nReligious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in ''Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism'', explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century [[United States]]. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]]:<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\">Beneke 2006: 6.</ref> \"The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.\"<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from \"a late eighteenth-century perspective\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-5\">Beneke 2006: 5.</ref> Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with \"something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> Mark Silka, in \"Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis\", states that Religious pluralism \"enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a [[cultural construct]] that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.\"<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\"/>\n\nReligious pluralism can be defined as \"respecting the otherness of others\". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[Paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].\n\nGiving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.<ref name=meister>Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 32-57</ref>\n\n[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/what-relativism|title=What is relativism?|work=CARM - The Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry}}</ref> Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. [[Syncretism]] must not be confused with [[ecumenism]], the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of religious pluralism}}\n[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Front page of the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]], which recognized two different churches in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n[[Cultural pluralism|Cultural]] and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[post-modernity]].\n\nGerman philosophers of religion [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] concluded that [[Eastern religions|Asian religious traditions]], in particular [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], were the earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of [[Freedom of religion|freedom to the individuals to choose their own faith]] and develop a personal religious construct within it<ref name=meister2/><ref>Roof & McKinney (1985), ''Denominational America and the new religious pluralism'', The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 480(1), pp. 24-38</ref> (see also [[Buddhism and Hinduism|Relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism]]); [[Jainism]], another [[Indian religions|ancient Indian religion]], as well as [[Daoism]] have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints.<ref name=meister2>Chad Meister (2010), ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp. 62-72</ref> The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion after the [[French Revolution]] ([[liberalism]], [[democracy]], [[civil and political rights]], [[freedom of thought]], [[separation of Church and State]], [[secularization]]), with rising acceptance of religious pluralism and [[decline of Christianity]]. According to Chad Meister,<ref name=meister2/> these pluralist trends in the Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism and religious tolerance.\n\n==Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\n[[File:Religions 4x5.png|thumb|1st row: [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Buddhism]], [[Cao Dai]], [[Christianity]]<br />2nd row: [[Druidism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]]<br />3rd row: [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], [[Ra\u00eblism]], [[Satanism]]<br />4th row: [[Shinto]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Tenrikyo]]<br />5th row: [[Thelema]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Wicca]], [[Zoroastrianism]]]]\n\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the unity of religion}}\n[[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], founder of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], a religion that developed in Persia, though not a sect of Islam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|title=Not a Sect|work=bci.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215112206/http://bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|archivedate=2005-12-15}}</ref> urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic messengers.

In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: [[Abraham]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (the founder of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]) among them. In the ''[[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]]'' (''Book of Certitude''), Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.\n\n==Buddhism==\nThe earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:\n\n<blockquote>All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\nWhen asked, \"Don\u2019t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?\" the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] said:<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a \"Fashion\"''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nPeople from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don\u2019t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.\n\nIn the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something\u2026 That is not healthy.\n\nFor individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.\n\nI am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Classical civilization: Greek and Roman religions==\n{{See also|Ancient Greek religion|Greco-Roman mysteries|Paganism|Pax deorum}}\n\nFor the Romans, [[Religion in Ancient Rome|religion was part of the daily life]].<ref>[[J\u00f6rg R\u00fcpke]], \"Roman Religion \u2013 Religions of Rome,\" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered.

Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgins]], who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|disbanded under Christian persecution and domination]].\n\nThe Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored. The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.\n\n[[Mystery religions]] imported from the [[Near East]] ([[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Parthian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]), which offered initiates [[Soteriology|salvation through a personal God]] and [[Afterlife|eternal life after the death]], were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[Sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|Senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC.\n\n[[File:0 Relief repr\u00e9sentant Mithra - Louvre-Lens (2).JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marble relief of [[Tauroctony|Mithras slaying the bull]] (2nd century, [[Louvre-Lens]]); [[Mithraism]] was among the most widespread [[mystery religions]] of the Roman Empire.<ref>G.

Jones |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=October 1977}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Christian views===\nBefore the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], mainstream Christianity confessed \"one holy catholic and apostolic church\", in the words of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the [[Catholic Church]] makes the claim that it alone is the [[one true church|one and only true Church]] founded by [[Jesus Christ]], but the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.\n\nChurch unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of \"validity\" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as \"[[heresy|heterodox]]\" and \"[[schism]]atic\", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least [[secundum quid]]. (See [[ecumenicism]]).\n\n===Modern Christian views===\nSome other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in \"one\" church, an \"invisible church\" which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some [[evangelical]] Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this \"invisible church\", and usually they reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apologeticsindex.org/d01b.html#prot |title=The Protestant Principle |website=A Biblical Guide To Orthodoxy And Heresy |access-date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms \"developmental theology,\" understood to mean that the \"[[Holy Spirit]], in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the [[deposit of faith]] (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles--these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize [[baptism of desire]] quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14-16, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: \"When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires . . . . They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . . . .<ref>See Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), pp. 101-102.</ref> Various forms of \"implicit faith\" come to hold standing, until at [[Vatican Council II]], the Church declares: \"Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life\" (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration [[Nostrae Aetate]] addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them.\n\n==Hinduism==\n{{See also|Hinduism and other religions}}\n[[Hinduism]] is naturally pluralistic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: \"Truth is One, though the sages know it variously\" (''\u00c9kam sat vipra bahud\u0101 vadanti'').<ref>Rig Veda 1.164.46</ref> Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: \"As people approach me, so I receive them.

These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, [[Al-Ma'ida|Surah Al-Ma'idah]] verses 47 through 49 state:\n{{quote\n|Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than those who rebel. To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. '''If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people''', but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious. ({{cite quran|5|47|end=49|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Ankabut verse 45 through 47 state:\n{{quote\n|Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing in life without doubt. And Allah knows the deeds that ye do. And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, \"We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; '''Our Allah and your Allah is one'''; and it is to Him we bow in Islam.\" And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the [[People of the Book]] believe therein, as also do some of these pagan Arabs: and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. ({{cite quran|29|45|end=47|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-E-Imran verses 62 through 66 state:\n{{quote\n|This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: \"O People of the Book! '''come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah'''; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.\" If then they turn back, say ye: \"Bear witness that we at least are Muslims bowing to Allah's Will. Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing even in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! ({{cite quran|3|62|end=66|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:\n{{quote\n|Say : O ye that reject Faith!

To you be your Way, and to me mine. ({{cite quran|109|1|end=6|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSeveral verses of the [[Quran]]  state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the [[pagan]]s (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'):<ref name=mb/> \n{{quote|\nA (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:- Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith. But when the forbidden months are past, '''then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them''', seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ({{cite quran|9|1|end=5|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nHowever, this verse has been explained.<ref>Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53, emphasis added</ref>\n{{quote|\n. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; '''however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious.''' One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).({{cite Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53| style=nosup}}) }}\n\nBernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145\u2013150}} He writes of jihad as a distinct \"religious obligation\", but suggests that \"it is a pity\" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:\n{{quote|\nMuslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays.\"{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}\n\nIn Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the [[Jizya]], a tax, with willing submission.\n{{quote|\nFight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, '''even if they are of the People of the Book''', until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. ({{cite quran|9|29|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSome people have  concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:\n{{quote|\nThese Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.({{source=Abualrub, Holy Wars, Crusades, Jihad}}) }}\n\nIn Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the [[Apostasy|apostates]]. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n{{quote|\nWhy should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites?

But if they revert to [open] enmity, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (Of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people.

Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are [[Rumi]], [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Shadhili]], [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. See many more famous Sufis at the [[List of Sufis]]. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also [[Blind men and an elephant]]. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols.<ref>http://registan.net/2007/11/12/rumi-the-alchemist-of-interfaith-tolerance/</ref> Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other.  He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi\u2019s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.\n\nRumi says:\n<blockquote>\nI looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. \n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n<blockquote>\nHow many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.\n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n <blockquote>\nA true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,\nbe sure of that.\nSince in the religion of Love,\nthere is no irreverence or faith.\nWhen in Love,\nbody, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.\nBecome this,\nfall in Love,\nand you will not be separated again.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Ahmadiyya===\n{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}\nAhmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.\n\nThe Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:\n\"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America\u2014all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur\u2019an\" by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad.

In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth.<ref>Dundas (2002) p.231</ref><ref>Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp.400-7</ref> Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]]\u2014the omniscient beings\u2014can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it.<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.91</ref> Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth\u2014only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with  '' andhgajnyaya '' or the \"[[Blind men and an elephant|maxim of the blind men and elephant]]\", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective.<ref name = hughes>Hughes, Marilynn (2005) p.590-1</ref> For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of ''ek\u0101nta'' (one-sidedness).<ref name=\"The Metaphysics of Paradox\">{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm.

First and the second commandment, you shall not have another God except me, worship your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Throughout the Hebrew Bible the sovereignty of Yahweh as the only God is the key pillar of a chosen community of Israel.\n\n==Sikhism==\n{{See|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]], influenced them and was influenced by them.\n\nThe [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy book of the [[Sikh]]s, says:\n{{quote|Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.|  Guru Granth Sahib page 1350<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1350&english=t&id=57718|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}</ref>}}\n\nAs well as:\n<blockquote>\nSome call the Lord \"Ram, Ram\", and some \"Khuda\". Some serve Him as \"Gusain\", others as \"Allah\". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885)<ref>{{cite web|title=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?ction=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=885|work=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nOne who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142)<ref>{{cite web|title=pluarism in sggs|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=142|work=pluarism in sggs|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that \"peoples of other faiths\" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.\n\nAdditionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:\n<blockquote>\nFirst, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| \n<ref>{{cite web|title=aval allah|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1349&english=t&id=57707#l57707|work=aval allah}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAgain, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:\n<blockquote>\n[[Bhagat Namdev|Naam Dayv]] the printer, and [[Kabir|Kabeer]] the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] (\"word\") lose their ego and class consciousness. ([[Guru Granth Sahib]] page 67)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=67&english=t&id=2722|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nMost of the 15 [[Sikh Bhagats]] who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.\n\nThe pluralistic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words ''Na koi hindu na koi musalman'' - \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\". He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.\n\nSikhs have been considered eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar]], who on the pleas of a [[pandit]] of the [[Kashmiris]], agreed to fight against a tyrannic [[Moghul Empire]] (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.\n\n==Religious pluralism and human service professions==\nThe concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.<ref name=p97/><ref name=zp>Brian J.

New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}</ref> has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:\n\n<blockquote>\n...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path \"up the mountain of God,\" the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality.... (p. 167)<ref name=zp/>\n</blockquote>\n\nImportantly, \"the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy\" (p.&nbsp;168).<ref name=zp/> The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as \"should religious issues be discussed in counseling?\", have also been presented in tabular form (p.&nbsp;362, Table 12.1).<ref name=p97/>\n\nThe profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: \"With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative\" (p.&nbsp;182).<ref name=nf>Nils Friberg (2001).
