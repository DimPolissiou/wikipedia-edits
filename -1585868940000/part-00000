The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk (which is made by keeping milk in large shallow tanks to allow the cream to separate) of the previous evening's milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. This mixture is pumped into copper-lined vats, which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix.<ref>Molly McDonough, \"Why Copper Vats Matter\", ''Culture: The Word on Cheese'' [https://culturecheesemag.com/cheese-iq/copper-vats-cheesemaking July 19, 2017]</ref>\n\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano Factory.png|thumb|right|Copper-lined vats for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano]]\nStarter [[whey]] (containing a mixture of certain [[thermophile|thermophilic]] [[lactic acid bacteria]]) is added, and the temperature is raised to 33\u201335&nbsp;\u00b0C (91\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F). Calf [[rennet]] is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10\u201312 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55&nbsp;\u00b0C (131&nbsp;\u00b0F) with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45\u201360 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of [[muslin]] before being divided in two and placed in molds. There is 1100 L (291 US gallons or 250 imperial gallons) of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each [[truckle|wheel]] at this point weighs around 45&nbsp;kg (100&nbsp;lb). The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which ''Prosciutto di Parma'' ([[Prosciutto|cured Parma ham]]) was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few yards away from the cheese production rooms.\n\n[[File:Cracking a Parmesan Wheel-9MAR2013.ogv|thumb|right|Cracking open a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese]]\nThe cheese is put into a stainless steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20\u201325 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.\n\n[[File:parmigiano reggiano factory.jpg|thumb|A Parmigiano-Reggiano factory maturation room]]\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano.png|thumb|Product process of Parmesan cheese]]\n\nAt 12 months, the Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano inspects every wheel. The cheese is tested by a master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Wheels that pass the test are then heat branded on the rind with the Consorzio's logo. Those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.\n\nTraditionally, cows have to be fed only on [[grass]] or [[hay]], producing [[grass fed]] [[milk]]. Only natural whey culture is allowed as a starter, together with calf rennet.<ref>\"[http://www.famigliagastaldello.it/a_52_IT_251_1.html Standard di Produzione] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513123536/http://www.famigliagastaldello.it/a_52_IT_251_1.html |date=2006-05-13 }}\".

Its production soon spread to the Parma and Modena areas.

The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk (which is made by keeping milk in large shallow tanks to allow the cream to separate) of the previous evening's milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. This mixture is pumped into copper-lined vats, which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix.<ref>Molly McDonough, \"Why Copper Vats Matter\", ''Culture: The Word on Cheese'' [https://culturecheesemag.com/cheese-iq/copper-vats-cheesemaking July 19, 2017]</ref>\n\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano Factory.png|thumb|right|Copper-lined vats for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano]]\nStarter [[whey]] (containing a mixture of certain [[thermophile|thermophilic]] [[lactic acid bacteria]]) is added, and the temperature is raised to 33\u201335&nbsp;\u00b0C (91\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F). Calf [[rennet]] is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10\u201312 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55&nbsp;\u00b0C (131&nbsp;\u00b0F) with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45\u201360 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of [[muslin]] before being divided in two and placed in molds. There is 1100 L (291 US gallons or 250 imperial gallons) of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each [[truckle|wheel]] at this point weighs around 45&nbsp;kg (100&nbsp;lb). The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which ''Prosciutto di Parma'' ([[Prosciutto|cured Parma ham]]) was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few yards away from the cheese production rooms.\n\n[[File:Cracking a Parmesan Wheel-9MAR2013.ogv|thumb|right|Cracking open a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese]]\nThe cheese is put into a stainless steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20\u201325 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.\n\n[[File:parmigiano reggiano factory.jpg|thumb|A Parmigiano-Reggiano factory maturation room]]\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano.png|thumb|Product process of Parmesan cheese]]\n\nAt 12 months, the Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano inspects every wheel. The cheese is tested by a master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Wheels that pass the test are then heat branded on the rind with the Consorzio's logo. Those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.\n\nTraditionally, cows have to be fed only on [[grass]] or [[hay]], producing [[grass fed]] [[milk]].

Blood flow is usually interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing a limb.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Riggins|first=Christie|date=Fall 2000|title=Great inventions don't happen overnight: development of the Fogarty balloon catheter|url=http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2000fall/inventions.html|journal=Stanford Medicine|volume= 17| issue =  3|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAt home, the ideas that went through Fogarty's head concerned different ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a [[urethra]]l [[catheter]] and a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough to be pushed through a blood clot. As for the balloon, he basically cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical [[latex glove]] and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter.<ref name=\":3\" /> The resulting balloon could be inflated with [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] using a [[syringe]], and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted, withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision.\n\nThe main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], the material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was not available. Fogarty's own take on the catheter came about because of fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying was needed in fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the balloon to the catheter. \"I'd always tied flies and made lures so it was just a natural thing.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> His experimental balloon catheter, however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with [[Jell-o]], a model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first [[minimally invasive]] surgical device.\n\nFogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. \"Companies thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any credibility.\"<ref name=\":5\" />  Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon, during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961 and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for himself and for other vascular surgeons.\n\nAt the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used Fogarty's balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was willing to manufacture Fogarty's device, he asked one of his acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In 1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from [[Irvine, California]], was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the Fogarty embolectomy catheter.\n\nBecause of the decreased risk associated with the device, Fogarty's balloon catheter became the industry standard and remains the most widely used catheter for blood-clot removal. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. The balloon catheter is now used in over three hundred thousand procedures every year all over the world, and is estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately twenty million patients.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/thomas-j-fogarty|title=Thomas J. Fogarty. 2012 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, Medicine|website=National Science & Technology Medals Foundation|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Other inventions ==\n\nNumerous sequel applications of Fogarty's catheter came about. The first balloon [[angioplasty]], for example, was performed with a Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his catheter to less invasive [[biopsy]] techniques.\n\nAfter completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices. One of his most successful products is the [[Stent]]-Graft, which dealt with the difficult problem of [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]s (a term referring to a weakened [[blood vessel]]). The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but Fogarty's idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. A catheter transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and blood flows normally.\n\nFogarty's other inventions include Fogarty surgical clips and clamps, which are used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to temporarily occlude vessels during surgery. Working with Warren Hancock, he is co-inventor of the Hancock tissue heart valve \u2013 the world's first porcine valve.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFogarty's own inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed.

At the age of 17, he quit his boxing career after he broke his nose in a match that ended in a draw. A family priest gave him a recommendation, and because of his awful grades, he was admitted to Cincinnati's [[Xavier University]] on probation.<ref name=\":2\" /> Jack Cranley, one of the most prominent [[Vascular surgery|vascular surgeons]] in the United States became his mentor. Speaking of Cranley, Fogarty later stated: \u201cI had a mentor who encouraged me and helped to persuade me to go to college\u2026 He had 10 kids and I became the 11th.

From 1960 to 1961, he interned at the [[University of Oregon Medical School]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], and he completed his surgical residency at the same school in 1965.\n\n== Invention of the embolectomy catheter ==\n\nDuring Fogarty\u2019s years at Good Samaritan Hospital, he witnessed the deaths of many patients who died from complications in blood clot surgeries in their limbs. \u201cFifty percent of the patients died.

Blood flow is usually interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing a limb.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Riggins|first=Christie|date=Fall 2000|title=Great inventions don't happen overnight: development of the Fogarty balloon catheter|url=http://sm.stanford.edu/archive/stanmed/2000fall/inventions.html|journal=Stanford Medicine|volume= 17| issue =  3|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAt home, the ideas that went through Fogarty's head concerned different ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a [[urethra]]l [[catheter]] and a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough to be pushed through a blood clot. As for the balloon, he basically cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical [[latex glove]] and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter.<ref name=\":3\" /> The resulting balloon could be inflated with [[Saline (medicine)|saline]] using a [[syringe]], and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted, withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision.\n\nThe main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], the material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was not available. Fogarty's own take on the catheter came about because of fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying was needed in fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the balloon to the catheter. \"I'd always tied flies and made lures so it was just a natural thing.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> His experimental balloon catheter, however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with [[Jell-o]], a model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first [[minimally invasive]] surgical device.\n\nFogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. \"Companies thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any credibility.\"<ref name=\":5\" />  Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon, during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961 and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for himself and for other vascular surgeons.\n\nAt the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used Fogarty's balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was willing to manufacture Fogarty's device, he asked one of his acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In 1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from [[Irvine, California]], was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the Fogarty embolectomy catheter.\n\nBecause of the decreased risk associated with the device, Fogarty's balloon catheter became the industry standard and remains the most widely used catheter for blood-clot removal. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. The balloon catheter is now used in over three hundred thousand procedures every year all over the world, and is estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately twenty million patients.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/thomas-j-fogarty|title=Thomas J. Fogarty. 2012 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, Medicine|website=National Science & Technology Medals Foundation|access-date=January 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Other inventions ==\n\nNumerous sequel applications of Fogarty's catheter came about. The first balloon [[angioplasty]], for example, was performed with a Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his catheter to less invasive [[biopsy]] techniques.\n\nAfter completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices. One of his most successful products is the [[Stent]]-Graft, which dealt with the difficult problem of [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]]s (a term referring to a weakened [[blood vessel]]). The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but Fogarty's idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. A catheter transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and blood flows normally.\n\nFogarty's other inventions include Fogarty surgical clips and clamps, which are used by cardiac and vascular surgeons to temporarily occlude vessels during surgery. Working with Warren Hancock, he is co-inventor of the Hancock tissue heart valve \u2013 the world's first porcine valve.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nFogarty's own inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed.
