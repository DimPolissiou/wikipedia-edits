Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist [[Kai Hansen]], bassist [[Markus Grosskopf]], guitarist [[Michael Weikath]], and drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]]. After the release of a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled EP]] and their debut album ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]'' in 1985, it expanded into a [[quintet]] with the addition of singer [[Michael Kiske]], Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the [[Keeper of the Seven Keys|''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' albums]] (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. Hansen left the band soon after the release of ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II|Part II]]'' and was replaced by [[Roland Grapow]]. After leaving Helloween, Hansen formed [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]].\n\nHelloween's first two albums without Hansen, ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' (1991) and ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' (1993), were commercial and critical failures,<ref name=official/> which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske. They were replaced by [[Uli Kusch]] and [[Andi Deris]] respectively. The albums released under this line-up, ''[[Master of the Rings]]'' (1994), ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' (1996), ''[[Better Than Raw]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Dark Ride]]'' (2000), received warmer reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again.\n\nHowever, tensions led to the dismissals in 2001 of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] together. Grapow was replaced by [[Sascha Gerstner]], but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and finally, Mikkey Dee recorded the drums for the next album ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]] in 2005. Under this line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]'' (2005), ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'' (2007), ''[[7 Sinners]]'' (2010), and ''[[Straight Out of Hell]]'' (2013). Their fifteenth and latest studio album, ''[[My God-Given Right]]'', was released on 29 May 2015.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the band announced that both Kai Hansen and Michael Kiske were rejoining Helloween for the Pumpkins United World Tour that would take place from October 2017 to December 2018. The tour ended up being the biggest one in the band's history as it comprised 69 shows and lasted for 14 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sonicperspectives.com/news/helloween-release-first-live-single-video-upcoming-blu-ray-dvd-pumpkins-united/|title=HELLOWEEN Release First Live Single/Video From Upcoming Blu Ray/DVD 'Pumpkins United'|website=Sonicperspectives.com|date=2 August 2019}}</ref> On 4 October 2019 the live album ''[[United Alive in Madrid]]'' and the live [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] ''United Alive'' were released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2019/10/helloween-united-alive-now-now-band-release-new-live-video-for-future-world/|title=HELLOWEEN &#124; \u2018United Alive band release new live video for \u2018Future World|date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The reunited line-up perdured after the tour, with a new studio album planned for a 2020 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|title=Officiale website for Pumpkins United|accessdate=14 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233944/http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Unbeatable>{{cite web|title=UNBEATABLE! |url=https://www.facebook.com/helloweenofficial/photos/a.10154216113858907/10155764840363907/?type=3&theater |website=Helloween's official [[Facebook]]|date=August 21, 2018| accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince its inception, Helloween has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than eight million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helloween.org/band/history.html|title=Helloween: Band History|accessdate=29 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002931/http://helloween.org/band/history.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years and first album (1984\u20131986) ===\nHelloween formed in 1984 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The original line-up included [[Kai Hansen]] on vocals and rhythm guitar, [[Michael Weikath]] on lead guitar, [[Markus Grosskopf]] on bass, and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] on drums. That year, the band signed with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called ''[[Death Metal (Split album)|Death Metal]]''. The compilation featured the bands [[Hellhammer]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], and [[Dark Avenger (band)|Dark Avenger]]. The two tracks were \"Oernst of Life\" by Weikath and Hansen's \"Metal Invaders,\" a faster version of which would appear on the band's first full-length album.\n\nHelloween recorded and released its first record in 1985, a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled]] EP containing five tracks. Also that year, the band released its first full-length album, ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]''.  During the following concert tour, Hansen had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time.  Kai's last recording as the band's lead singer was in 1986 on a vinyl EP titled ''Judas'', which contained the song \"Judas\" and live versions of \"Ride the Sky\" and \"Guardians\" recorded at Gelsenkirchen. (The CD edition has the live introduction, but the songs have been replaced with studio versions and crowd noise spliced in.) Following these releases, Helloween began the search for a new vocalist.\n\n=== ''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' (1986\u20131989) ===\nThe band found an 18-year-old vocalist, [[Michael Kiske]], from a local Hamburg band named Ill Prophecy. With their new lead vocalist in tow, Helloween approached record labels Noise International and RCA and proposed the release of a double-LP to introduce the line-up. This proposition was turned down. Instead, they recorded a single LP, ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I]]'', which was released in 1987. In 1988, Helloween released ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II]]'', the companion album. [[MTV]] put the single \"[[I Want Out]]\" into heavy rotation and in support of its \"[[Headbanger's Ball]]\" show. MTV also presented the inaugural [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with Helloween joining [[San Francisco Bay area]] thrash-metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] in support of headlining act [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. The band was slotted in the prestigious second spot, right before Anthrax's set. On the heels of this exposure to US audiences, the band achieved worldwide success.\n\n=== Hansen and Kiske's departures (1989\u20131993) ===\nGuitarist Kai Hansen unexpectedly left the band in 1989 soon after the European leg of the ''Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II'' tour, due to ill-health, conflicts within the band, troubles with Noise International, and a growing dissatisfaction with life on tour. Weikath chose his friend [[Roland Grapow]] to replace him, including for the rest of the tour. Grapow, who was a [[Auto mechanic|car mechanic]] at the time, stated in 2017 that, if Weikath had not happened to ask him to join the band, he would have kept his job and given up on his dream of becoming a professional musician.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROLAND GRAPOW Says HELLOWEEN Doesn't Want Him To Take Part In 'Pumpkins United' Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/roland-grapow-says-helloween-doesnt-want-him-to-take-part-in-pumpkins-united-tour/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=20 August 2017|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the band released a live album called ''[[Live in the U.K.]]'' (''Keepers Live'' in Japan and ''I Want Out Live'' in the United States), featuring material from its 1988 European tour. The remaining members continued on but ran into label problems with Noise, and after litigation kept them from touring and releasing new material, they were eventually released from their contract. A new album would not appear until 1991 when, after several rumors about the band breaking up, they released ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' for their new record company, EMI. The album was less heavy and, with song titles such as \"Heavy Metal Hamsters\", \"I'm Doing Fine, Crazy Man\", and \"Shit and Lobster\", showed a shift toward&nbsp;\u2013 and an emphasis on&nbsp;\u2013 humor rather than the epic moods on previous releases. As a result, ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' failed both commercially and critically, and tensions started to build amongst the band members.<ref name=official>{{cite web|title=Official Helloween Website: History |url=http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |accessdate=2009-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415013244/http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe pop-influenced follow-up ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' was released in 1993. Instead of taking a heavier approach, the band ventured into new territory, eschewing its signature double-guitar harmonies for synthesizers, horns, acoustic guitars, a children's chorus, country music, and swing. As with the previous album, ''Chameleon'' failed commercially and critically.<ref name=official/> Tensions within Helloween worsened, and the band split into three factions, with Michael Kiske and Ingo Schwichtenberg on one side, Michael Weikath and Roland Grapow on the other, and Markus Grosskopf in the middle, trying to keep peace between the four men.\n\nShortly after, the band began to disintegrate. During the ''Chameleon'' tour, the band would often play to half-filled venues. Drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] fell ill due to mental and drug-related issues, and was eventually fired, replaced by session drummer [[Ritchie Abdel-Nabi]]. Meanwhile, the conflicts within the rest of the band worsened, with Michael Weikath refusing to work any longer with Michael Kiske. The decision was made to fire Kiske. Since his firing, Kiske didn't get along with Helloween for many years, until 2016, when they announced that Kiske and Kai Hansen would rejoin the band for the Pumpkins United World Tour in 2017/2018. In May 2008, Kiske released ''[[Past in Different Ways]]''; an album featuring most of his old Helloween songs, albeit rearranged and re-recorded acoustically. Commenting on Kiske's dismissal, Grosskopf later said:<ref name=MRmarkus>{{cite web|last1=Syrjala|first1=Marko|title=Helloween \u2013 bassist Markus Grosskopf|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2011/01/11/helloween-bassist-markus-grosskopf/|website=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|People thought we were crazy for firing a singer like Kiske, but then after all those years and listening to what he's doing now I hope people will understand why we did that decision.  Otherwise he would have pushed us into the direction where he is going now and we didn't want that.}}\n\nIn addition to the firing of Kiske, Abdel-Nabi, whose inability to replicate Schwichtenberg's machine-gun style of drumming hindered Helloween's ability to play live fan-favorites like \"Eagle Fly Free\" and \"How Many Tears\", was let go by the band. 1993 would come to a close for Helloween with no singer, no drummer, and no record contract (EMI released the band from its agreement for the low sales numbers for ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' and ''Chameleon'').\n\n=== First years with Andi Deris (1994\u20132000) ===\nHelloween returned in 1994 with former [[Pink Cream 69]] frontman [[Andi Deris]] as their new lead vocalist and [[Uli Kusch]], formerly of Kai Hansen's [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], on drums. The band already knew Deris from some recording sessions in Hamburg.<ref name=MRmarkus/> He had been approached by Weikath to join the band in 1991, but he had declined, despite being intrigued by the offer and having to deal with emerging conflicts between him and his band. In the years since, however, Kiske was fired from Helloween and the issues within Pink Cream 69 worsened. Faced with the inevitability of his firing, Deris accepted Weikath's offer during a night out with the band members.<ref name=MRmarkus/> With this new lineup and a new record contract with Castle Communications, Helloween released its comeback album, ''[[Master of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn 1995, original drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in his native Hamburg.  In the years since his departure from Helloween, Schwichtenberg had gotten involved in drug-use and suffered from depression. 1996's ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' was dedicated to his memory. Following another world tour, a double live album called ''[[High Live]]'' was released. In 1998, Helloween released ''[[Better Than Raw]]'', one of the band's heaviest albums since the full-length debut. The subsequent supporting tour was made up of stops in Europe, Japan, and Brazil, but on 20 December 1998, the band visited New York and played a show at the venue Coney Island High in Manhattan, the first show for Helloween in the United States in nearly a decade.  The band would follow ''Better Than Raw'' with a 1999 release titled ''[[Metal Jukebox]]'', a cover-album featuring Helloween's versions of songs from such bands as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Beatles]], [[ABBA]], and [[Deep Purple]].\n\n===Line-up changes (2002\u20132004)===\nThe year 2000 saw the release of ''[[The Dark Ride]]'', a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch.<ref name=MRmarkus/> One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.\n\nThey were replaced by guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] (ex-[[Freedom Call]], Neumond) and drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (ex-[[Metalium]], [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], [[At Vance]], [[Firewind]]), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'', in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer [[Charlie Bauerfeind]]. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\"<ref name=MRmarkus/> Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated:\n\n{{cquote|I felt very secure in Helloween. In the middle of the tour I said something to Michael and Markus and I said my opinion about something. I wanted to make something the best for the band and I think they misunderstood me, like I wanted to be leader. I was telling the truth and that's how I am... It was a great time in Helloween... but I am happy when I left the band after Dark Ride because it's one of my favourite albums, it changed my life totally.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=MASTERPLAN's Roland Grapow \u2013 \"I Think HELLOWEEN Would Be Much Bigger If They Would Continue with the Style of Keepers Albums\"; New Audio Interview Online|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/193811|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=BW&BK|date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview With MASTERPLAN Mainman And Ex-HELLOWEEN Roland Grapow|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2012/11/15/interview-with-masterplan-mainman-and-ex-helloween-roland-grapow/|last=Fayyazi|first=Mohsen|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Metal Shock Finland|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nCross could not finish the album due to [[EBV infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s [[Mikkey Dee]]. [[Stefan Schwarzmann]], former drummer of [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]] would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \"Starlight\", \"Murderer\", \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" and \"How Many Tears\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.\n\n=== Steady line-up (2005\u20132016) ===\n[[File:2011-08 Woodstock 56.jpg|thumb|Helloween at [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2011]]\n2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the \"Rabbits on the Run\" tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts,<ref name=MRmarkus/> so he was replaced by [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]], the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they inked a deal with German label [[SPV GmbH|SPV]]. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween's new studio album, titled ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys - The Legacy]]'', was released on 28 October 2005 in Germany, and 8 November in the US to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, \"[[Mrs. God]]\", as well as a video for the track. The track \"[[Light the Universe]]\" was released as a single on 22 November, featuring [[Candice Night]] of [[Blackmore's Night]] on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.\n\nIn late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Sofia]] (Bulgaria), and Tokyo (Japan) for their live album ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys \u2013 The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006]]''. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band, as well as interviews and a road movie. This was the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman, and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) & 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |title=HELLOWEEN: 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' Live DVD/CD Chart Positions Revealed |publisher=BlabberMouth |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310175150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nHelloween has since completed their studio album ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'', which was released on 23 October 2007. It received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris-era albums. Despite being one of Helloween's heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. \"[[As Long as I Fall]]\", the first single, was released in early September and only available via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/media.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028224604/http://www.helloween.org/media.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Videos|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelloween teamed up with [[Kai Hansen]]'s current band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] for their 2007\u20132008 \"Hellish Rock\" world tour, which started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] were labeled as the \"very special guest\" with most shows also having fellow German \"guest\" [[Axxis]]. The tour went through Europe, Asia, and South America, as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for [[Kai Hansen]] stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits \"I Want Out\" and \"Future World\" in the last [[encore (concert)|encore]] segment of Helloween.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201092125/http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Hellish Rock 2007/2008|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=1 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 2009, Helloween released the ''[[Unarmed \u2013 Best of 25th Anniversary]]'' album in Japan. The album was released on 1 February 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of ten of the band's best known songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup. It features a seventeen-minute \"Keepers Medley\", recorded by a seventy-piece orchestra from Prague, mixing together  \"Halloween\", \"The Keeper of the Seven Keys\", and \"The King for a 1000 Years\". There is a [[limited edition]] [[digipak]], including a thirty-minute \"making of\"-DVD with interviews and studio footage.

metal]] band founded in 1984 in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]] by members of bands Iron Fist and Gentry. Its first lineup consisted of singer and guitarist [[Kai Hansen]], bassist [[Markus Grosskopf]], guitarist [[Michael Weikath]], and drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]]. After the release of a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled EP]] and their debut album ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]'' in 1985, it expanded into a [[quintet]] with the addition of singer [[Michael Kiske]], Hansen choosing to focus on guitar instead. Under this line-up, they released the [[Keeper of the Seven Keys|''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' albums]] (1987 and 1988), which established Helloween as a notable [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band and led to the creation of the power metal subgenre. Hansen left the band soon after the release of ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II|Part II]]'' and was replaced by [[Roland Grapow]]. After leaving Helloween, Hansen formed [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]].\n\nHelloween's first two albums without Hansen, ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' (1991) and ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' (1993), were commercial and critical failures,<ref name=official/> which created tensions between band members and led to the firing of Schwichtenberg and Kiske. They were replaced by [[Uli Kusch]] and [[Andi Deris]] respectively. The albums released under this line-up, ''[[Master of the Rings]]'' (1994), ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' (1996), ''[[Better Than Raw]]'' (1998) and ''[[The Dark Ride]]'' (2000), received warmer reception from both fans and critics, gradually establishing Helloween as a successful band again.\n\nHowever, tensions led to the dismissals in 2001 of both Grapow and Kusch, who then went on to found [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] together. Grapow was replaced by [[Sascha Gerstner]], but the attempts to find a new drummer were chaotic and finally, Mikkey Dee recorded the drums for the next album ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'' (2003). The band finally found a stable drummer in [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]] in 2005. Under this line-up, the longest in its history, the band has released four successful studio albums: ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: The Legacy]]'' (2005), ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'' (2007), ''[[7 Sinners]]'' (2010), and ''[[Straight Out of Hell]]'' (2013). Their fifteenth and latest studio album, ''[[My God-Given Right]]'', was released on 29 May 2015.\n\nOn 14 November 2016, the band announced that both Kai Hansen and Michael Kiske were rejoining Helloween for the Pumpkins United World Tour that would take place from October 2017 to December 2018. The tour ended up being the biggest one in the band's history as it comprised 69 shows and lasted for 14 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sonicperspectives.com/news/helloween-release-first-live-single-video-upcoming-blu-ray-dvd-pumpkins-united/|title=HELLOWEEN Release First Live Single/Video From Upcoming Blu Ray/DVD 'Pumpkins United'|website=Sonicperspectives.com|date=2 August 2019}}</ref> On 4 October 2019 the live album ''[[United Alive in Madrid]]'' and the live [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] ''United Alive'' were released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2019/10/helloween-united-alive-now-now-band-release-new-live-video-for-future-world/|title=HELLOWEEN &#124; \u2018United Alive band release new live video for \u2018Future World|date=4 October 2019}}</ref> The reunited line-up perdured after the tour, with a new studio album planned for a 2020 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|title=Officiale website for Pumpkins United|accessdate=14 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114233944/http://pumpkins-united.helloween.org/en/pumpkins-united.html|archivedate=14 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=Unbeatable>{{cite web|title=UNBEATABLE! |url=https://www.facebook.com/helloweenofficial/photos/a.10154216113858907/10155764840363907/?type=3&theater |website=Helloween's official [[Facebook]]|date=August 21, 2018| accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince its inception, Helloween has released fifteen studio albums, three live albums, three EPs, and twenty-seven singles, and has sold more than eight million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://helloween.org/band/history.html|title=Helloween: Band History|accessdate=29 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530002931/http://helloween.org/band/history.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early years and first album (1984\u20131986) ===\nHelloween formed in 1984 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The original line-up included [[Kai Hansen]] on vocals and rhythm guitar, [[Michael Weikath]] on lead guitar, [[Markus Grosskopf]] on bass, and [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] on drums. That year, the band signed with [[Noise Records (Germany)|Noise Records]] and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called ''[[Death Metal (Split album)|Death Metal]]''. The compilation featured the bands [[Hellhammer]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], and [[Dark Avenger (band)|Dark Avenger]]. The two tracks were \"Oernst of Life\" by Weikath and Hansen's \"Metal Invaders,\" a faster version of which would appear on the band's first full-length album.\n\nHelloween recorded and released its first record in 1985, a [[Helloween (album)|self-titled]] EP containing five tracks. Also that year, the band released its first full-length album, ''[[Walls of Jericho (album)|Walls of Jericho]]''.  During the following concert tour, Hansen had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time.  Kai's last recording as the band's lead singer was in 1986 on a vinyl EP titled ''Judas'', which contained the song \"Judas\" and live versions of \"Ride the Sky\" and \"Guardians\" recorded at Gelsenkirchen. (The CD edition has the live introduction, but the songs have been replaced with studio versions and crowd noise spliced in.) Following these releases, Helloween began the search for a new vocalist.\n\n=== ''Keeper of the Seven Keys'' (1986\u20131989) ===\nThe band found an 18-year-old vocalist, [[Michael Kiske]], from a local Hamburg band named Ill Prophecy. With their new lead vocalist in tow, Helloween approached record labels Noise International and RCA and proposed the release of a double-LP to introduce the line-up. This proposition was turned down. Instead, they recorded a single LP, ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part I]]'', which was released in 1987. In 1988, Helloween released ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II]]'', the companion album. [[MTV]] put the single \"[[I Want Out]]\" into heavy rotation and in support of its \"[[Headbanger's Ball]]\" show. MTV also presented the inaugural [[Headbangers Ball Tour]] with Helloween joining [[San Francisco Bay area]] thrash-metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] in support of headlining act [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. The band was slotted in the prestigious second spot, right before Anthrax's set. On the heels of this exposure to US audiences, the band achieved worldwide success.\n\n=== Hansen and Kiske's departures (1989\u20131993) ===\nGuitarist Kai Hansen unexpectedly left the band in 1989 soon after the European leg of the ''Keeper of the Seven Keys: Part II'' tour, due to ill-health, conflicts within the band, troubles with Noise International, and a growing dissatisfaction with life on tour. Weikath chose his friend [[Roland Grapow]] to replace him, including for the rest of the tour. Grapow, who was a [[Auto mechanic|car mechanic]] at the time, stated in 2017 that, if Weikath had not happened to ask him to join the band, he would have kept his job and given up on his dream of becoming a professional musician.<ref>{{cite web|title=ROLAND GRAPOW Says HELLOWEEN Doesn't Want Him To Take Part In 'Pumpkins United' Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/roland-grapow-says-helloween-doesnt-want-him-to-take-part-in-pumpkins-united-tour/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=20 August 2017|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, the band released a live album called ''[[Live in the U.K.]]'' (''Keepers Live'' in Japan and ''I Want Out Live'' in the United States), featuring material from its 1988 European tour. The remaining members continued on but ran into label problems with Noise, and after litigation kept them from touring and releasing new material, they were eventually released from their contract. A new album would not appear until 1991 when, after several rumors about the band breaking up, they released ''[[Pink Bubbles Go Ape]]'' for their new record company, EMI. The album was less heavy and, with song titles such as \"Heavy Metal Hamsters\", \"I'm Doing Fine, Crazy Man\", and \"Shit and Lobster\", showed a shift toward&nbsp;\u2013 and an emphasis on&nbsp;\u2013 humor rather than the epic moods on previous releases. As a result, ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' failed both commercially and critically, and tensions started to build amongst the band members.<ref name=official>{{cite web|title=Official Helloween Website: History |url=http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |accessdate=2009-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415013244/http://www.helloween.org/band/history.html |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe pop-influenced follow-up ''[[Chameleon (Helloween album)|Chameleon]]'' was released in 1993. Instead of taking a heavier approach, the band ventured into new territory, eschewing its signature double-guitar harmonies for synthesizers, horns, acoustic guitars, a children's chorus, country music, and swing. As with the previous album, ''Chameleon'' failed commercially and critically.<ref name=official/> Tensions within Helloween worsened, and the band split into three factions, with Michael Kiske and Ingo Schwichtenberg on one side, Michael Weikath and Roland Grapow on the other, and Markus Grosskopf in the middle, trying to keep peace between the four men.\n\nShortly after, the band began to disintegrate. During the ''Chameleon'' tour, the band would often play to half-filled venues. Drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] fell ill due to mental and drug-related issues, and was eventually fired, replaced by session drummer [[Ritchie Abdel-Nabi]]. Meanwhile, the conflicts within the rest of the band worsened, with Michael Weikath refusing to work any longer with Michael Kiske. The decision was made to fire Kiske. Since his firing, Kiske didn't get along with Helloween for many years, until 2016, when they announced that Kiske and Kai Hansen would rejoin the band for the Pumpkins United World Tour in 2017/2018. In May 2008, Kiske released ''[[Past in Different Ways]]''; an album featuring most of his old Helloween songs, albeit rearranged and re-recorded acoustically. Commenting on Kiske's dismissal, Grosskopf later said:<ref name=MRmarkus>{{cite web|last1=Syrjala|first1=Marko|title=Helloween \u2013 bassist Markus Grosskopf|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2011/01/11/helloween-bassist-markus-grosskopf/|website=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|People thought we were crazy for firing a singer like Kiske, but then after all those years and listening to what he's doing now I hope people will understand why we did that decision.  Otherwise he would have pushed us into the direction where he is going now and we didn't want that.}}\n\nIn addition to the firing of Kiske, Abdel-Nabi, whose inability to replicate Schwichtenberg's machine-gun style of drumming hindered Helloween's ability to play live fan-favorites like \"Eagle Fly Free\" and \"How Many Tears\", was let go by the band. 1993 would come to a close for Helloween with no singer, no drummer, and no record contract (EMI released the band from its agreement for the low sales numbers for ''Pink Bubbles Go Ape'' and ''Chameleon'').\n\n=== First years with Andi Deris (1994\u20132000) ===\nHelloween returned in 1994 with former [[Pink Cream 69]] frontman [[Andi Deris]] as their new lead vocalist and [[Uli Kusch]], formerly of Kai Hansen's [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], on drums. The band already knew Deris from some recording sessions in Hamburg.<ref name=MRmarkus/> He had been approached by Weikath to join the band in 1991, but he had declined, despite being intrigued by the offer and having to deal with emerging conflicts between him and his band. In the years since, however, Kiske was fired from Helloween and the issues within Pink Cream 69 worsened. Faced with the inevitability of his firing, Deris accepted Weikath's offer during a night out with the band members.<ref name=MRmarkus/> With this new lineup and a new record contract with Castle Communications, Helloween released its comeback album, ''[[Master of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn 1995, original drummer [[Ingo Schwichtenberg]] committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in his native Hamburg.  In the years since his departure from Helloween, Schwichtenberg had gotten involved in drug-use and suffered from depression. 1996's ''[[The Time of the Oath]]'' was dedicated to his memory. Following another world tour, a double live album called ''[[High Live]]'' was released. In 1998, Helloween released ''[[Better Than Raw]]'', one of the band's heaviest albums since the full-length debut. The subsequent supporting tour was made up of stops in Europe, Japan, and Brazil, but on 20 December 1998, the band visited New York and played a show at the venue Coney Island High in Manhattan, the first show for Helloween in the United States in nearly a decade.  The band would follow ''Better Than Raw'' with a 1999 release titled ''[[Metal Jukebox]]'', a cover-album featuring Helloween's versions of songs from such bands as [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Faith No More]], [[The Beatles]], [[ABBA]], and [[Deep Purple]].\n\n===Line-up changes (2002\u20132004)===\nThe year 2000 saw the release of ''[[The Dark Ride]]'', a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. It came complete with downtuned guitars and a gruffer singing style from Deris. Immediately following the tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch.<ref name=MRmarkus/> One version of events states that Weikath, Deris, and Grosskopf felt that Kusch and Grapow, in particular, were spending more time on and paying more attention to their new side-project, [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] (Grapow's output on Helloween albums had dropped to barely one song per album by that point); since the others believed that Kusch and Grapow were not one hundred percent dedicated to Helloween, they were dismissed.\n\nThey were replaced by guitarist [[Sascha Gerstner]] (ex-[[Freedom Call]], Neumond) and drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (ex-[[Metalium]], [[Kingdom Come (band)|Kingdom Come]], [[At Vance]], [[Firewind]]), culminating with the recording of another studio album, titled ''[[Rabbit Don't Come Easy]]'', in 2003. The band met Sascha via a recommendation by producer [[Charlie Bauerfeind]]. According to Grosskopf, one day he was recording something with Freedom Call \"and later on we called him up and he went to first meet Weiki because it was very important that Weiki finds a player that he can play with and also communicate and understand. [...] So we got him on the island where we recorded and let him hang out with us a little and then he decided 'Good, let's go'.\"<ref name=MRmarkus/> Later in 2012, on an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, Roland stated:\n\n{{cquote|I felt very secure in Helloween. In the middle of the tour I said something to Michael and Markus and I said my opinion about something. I wanted to make something the best for the band and I think they misunderstood me, like I wanted to be leader. I was telling the truth and that's how I am... It was a great time in Helloween... but I am happy when I left the band after Dark Ride because it's one of my favourite albums, it changed my life totally.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=MASTERPLAN's Roland Grapow \u2013 \"I Think HELLOWEEN Would Be Much Bigger If They Would Continue with the Style of Keepers Albums\"; New Audio Interview Online|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/193811|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=BW&BK|date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interview With MASTERPLAN Mainman And Ex-HELLOWEEN Roland Grapow|url=http://metalshockfinland.com/2012/11/15/interview-with-masterplan-mainman-and-ex-helloween-roland-grapow/|last=Fayyazi|first=Mohsen|date=15 November 2012|publisher=Metal Shock Finland|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nCross could not finish the album due to [[EBV infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], completing only two tracks; the drum tracks were completed by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]]'s [[Mikkey Dee]]. [[Stefan Schwarzmann]], former drummer of [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]] would shortly thereafter take over the drumming duties. Despite a somewhat tepid response to the album, Helloween nonetheless completed a successful world tour, highlighted by the return of classic songs such as \"Starlight\", \"Murderer\", \"Keeper of the Seven Keys\" and \"How Many Tears\" to the setlist. Additionally, the band toured the United States for the first time since 1989, playing to sold-out crowds at nearly every venue.\n\n=== Steady line-up (2005\u20132016) ===\n[[File:2011-08 Woodstock 56.jpg|thumb|Helloween at [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in 2011]]\n2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the \"Rabbits on the Run\" tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts,<ref name=MRmarkus/> so he was replaced by [[Daniel L\u00f6ble]], the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they inked a deal with German label [[SPV GmbH|SPV]]. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween's new studio album, titled ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys - The Legacy]]'', was released on 28 October 2005 in Germany, and 8 November in the US to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, \"[[Mrs. God]]\", as well as a video for the track. The track \"[[Light the Universe]]\" was released as a single on 22 November, featuring [[Candice Night]] of [[Blackmore's Night]] on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.\n\nIn late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (Brazil), [[Sofia]] (Bulgaria), and Tokyo (Japan) for their live album ''[[Keeper of the Seven Keys \u2013 The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006]]''. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band, as well as interviews and a road movie. This was the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman, and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) & 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |title=HELLOWEEN: 'Keeper Of The Seven Keys' Live DVD/CD Chart Positions Revealed |publisher=BlabberMouth |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310175150/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=68414 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nHelloween has since completed their studio album ''[[Gambling with the Devil]]'', which was released on 23 October 2007. It received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris-era albums. Despite being one of Helloween's heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. \"[[As Long as I Fall]]\", the first single, was released in early September and only available via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/media.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028224604/http://www.helloween.org/media.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Videos|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nHelloween teamed up with [[Kai Hansen]]'s current band [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] for their 2007\u20132008 \"Hellish Rock\" world tour, which started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] were labeled as the \"very special guest\" with most shows also having fellow German \"guest\" [[Axxis]]. The tour went through Europe, Asia, and South America, as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for [[Kai Hansen]] stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits \"I Want Out\" and \"Future World\" in the last [[encore (concert)|encore]] segment of Helloween.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201092125/http://www.helloween.org/tour/hellish-rock-20072008.html|url-status=dead|title=Official Helloween Website: Hellish Rock 2007/2008|website=Web.archive.org|archivedate=1 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 December 2009, Helloween released the ''[[Unarmed \u2013 Best of 25th Anniversary]]'' album in Japan. The album was released on 1 February 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of ten of the band's best known songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup.

Since Aeschylus\u2019s text in Ancient Greek has been directly set to music without alterations or cuts, Orff\u2019s score qualifies as one of the most typical examples for the operatic genre of [[Literaturoper]]. The [[premiere]] took place on March 24, 1968 at [[Staatstheater Stuttgart]] under the direction of [[Ferdinand Leitner]] in a production by [[Rudolf Sellner]] with sets and costumes by [[Teo Otto]].\n\n== Roles ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ {{sronly|Roles, voice types, and premiere cast}}\n!Greek name\n!Transliteration\n![[Voice type]]\n!

[[Hermes]] asks Prometheus one last time to finally name the hetaerae who would cost Zeus and his followers their eternal rule. When Prometheus refuses, he is struck by lightning and thunder from an earthquake which throws him into the shadowy realm of the [[Hades]].\n\n[[Kratos (mythology)|Kratos]] (Greek: \"Power\") and [[Bia (mythology)|Bia]] (Greek: \"Violence\"), the servants of [[Zeus]], drag Prometheus to the [[Caucasus]] mountains, where, at Zeus' command, the reluctant [[Hephaistos]] chains Prometheus to a rock of the Caucasus. Hephaistos takes pity on Prometheus, but is also afraid of Zeus and his accomplices.\n\nAfter Hephaistos, Kratos and Bia have left, the chorus of the daughters of [[Okeanos]] appears; they assures him of his friendship and inquire about the reason for this punishment. Prometheus tells about his fight against [[Cronus|Kronos]], helping Zeus to overthrow his father through cunning and cleverness. Zeus then passed the offices, but did not think of the humans, so that only Prometheus came to their support; he gave them the fire, hope and the art of prophecy. The chorus warns him of his audacity, whereupon Prometheus declares that despite his knowledge of his future punishment, he did it for the sake of people.\n\nThe chorus flies away, whereupon Okeanos rides on stage on his griffin. He describes himself as the greatest friend of Prometheus and claims that he hurried to his side as quickly as possible. But Prometheus asks him if he wants to indulge in his suffering and is outraged again about Zeus. Okeanos also warns him about the lack of submission to the new ruler. Prometheus should submit and ask for mercy so that he would be redeemed. But he reacts with irony to this advice from Okeanos, who had not supported the people with him. Okeanos offers to appeal to Zeus, but Prometheus advises him against it, referring to his brothers [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Typhon (mythology)|Typhon]]. Okeanos is persuaded and flies away.\n\nThe chorus returns and laments Prometheus's deplorable fate. Thereupon Prometheus tells what knowledge he brought to the human race, including medicine, seafaring, meteorology and divination. He also announces that Zeus will abdicate one day and Prometheus will be redeemed. The Okeanids, though, should not tell Zeus about his future so that his prophecy will come true. The chorus laments the suffering of Prometheus and the lack of help from the human race which had enjoyed Prometheus's support.\n\nThe horned [[Io (mythology)|Io]], daughter of Inachos, enters on stage. Prometheus announces the end of Zeus's reign to her by a son of [[Hera]]. When Io learns that Prometheus has mastered the art of divination, she wants him to predict her own fate. Before that, however, she reports how she dreamed of Zeus's love. Therefore, Inachos, the father of Io, received the news from an [[oracle]] and decided to expel his daughter from the country. To cover up the love for Io, he turned her into a cow. But this was not hidden from Hera; she sent Argos as a guard and had the cow chased by a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]]. Now Prometheus announces Io's future: She will cross the [[Bosphorus]] (which will be named after her) and will eventually reach [[Ethiopia]] following the Nile Delta to [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] to give birth to [[Epaphos]] there. A descendant of the Io's in the 13th generation, a \"hero of the bow\" (i.e. [[Herakles]]) will one day save Prometheus. Since Io can no longer bear the stings of the gadfly, she escapes.\n\nPrometheus reveals to the chorus of the [[Oceanids]] that Zeus' curse will come to an end. Hermes comes in and demands that Prometheus open up to Zeus who will overthrow him. He threatens with lightning and storm, which would hurt Prometheus badly; an eagle sent by Zeus would come to eat Prometheus's liver. Since Prometheus refuses to disclose this knowledge, he is punished by Zeus: the rock with the titan forged onto it sinks into Hades.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Orchestra ===\nThe score of Orff's ''Prometheus'' calls for an instrumentation that is unique in music history:\n{{div col}}\n* 6 [[flute|flutes]], all also [[piccolo]]s, 1 also bass flute\n* 6 [[oboe]]s, oboes 5\u20136 also [[cor anglais]]\n* 6 [[trumpet]]s\n* 6 [[trombone]]s\n* 4 [[harp]]s\n* 4 [[banjo|tenor banjo]]s\n* 1 [[organ (music)|organ]]\n* 1 [[regal (instrument)|regal]]\n* 1 [[electronic organ|electric organ]]\n* 4 [[grand piano]]s with 8 players\n* 9 [[double bass]]es\n{{div col end}}\n\nThe large percussion section requires 15 to 18 players:\n{{div col}}\n* 5 [[timpani]]\n* 2 small timpani with wooden cover\n* 1 [[snare drum]] with resonant strings\n* 3 Basque drums\n* 2 [[bass drum]]s, 1 with a cymbal attached\n* 1 O-Daiko\n* 1 [[taiko]]\n* 4 [[darabukka]]s\n* 2 [[conga]]s\n* 1 [[lithophone]]\n* 2 [[xylophone]]s\n* 2 chromatic tenor xylophones\n* 2 [[marimbaphone]]s\n* 1 bass xylophone\n* 1 [[glockenspiel]]\n* 1 metallophone\n* 1 bass metallophone\n* 6 [[tubular bells]]\n* 1 [[triangle]]\n* 1 pair of [[cymbal]]s \n* 3 hanging cymbals (small \u2013 medium \u2013 large)\n* 5 hanging Turkish cymbals\n* 3 hanging Chinese cymbals\n* 2 cymbales antiques\n* 1 pair of small cymbales antiques (c<sup>5</sup>)\n* 6 pairs [[Crotales|antique cymbals]]\n* 3 [[tamtam]]\n* 3 [[gong]]s\n* 2 large metal plates (e<sup>3</sup> and f<sup>3</sup>)\n* 1 plate bell (contra-C<sub>1</sub>)\n* 1 [[g\u00fciro]]\n* 5 wood blocks\n* 3 wood bells\n* 1 large wood bell\n* 1 African slot drum\n* wooden planks\n* 1 pair of bamboo tubes\n* 2 pairs of [[hy\u014dshigi]]\n* 1 wasamba\n* 1 [[binzasara]]\n* 4 [[maraca]]s\n* 2 [[angklung]] (g<sup>1</sup> and b flat<sup>1</sup>)\n* 7 glasses (tuned)\n* 1 [[wind machine]]\n* 1 thunder machine\n{{div col end}}\nThe chromatic tenor xylophones are instruments of the [[Orff-Schulwerk]]. Since they are not normally used in the percussion section of the symphony orchestra because of the [[chromatic]] arrangement of their keys, in current performance practice marimbaphones are substituted. However, since chromatic glissandi can only be performed on chromatic tenor xylphones, these instruments from Orff's Schulwerk are included in limited numbers in order to allow for the performance of chromatic glissandi. The score of '' Prometheus '' therefore reflects the performance practice of all three of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|M\u00f6ller|1995|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}}\n\nWhile at the time of the premiere, the performance of the percussion section required considerable skills from the percussionists, thanks to the extraordinary development of the percussion technology in the past decades, Orff's score no longer offers insurmountable obstacles.\n\n=== Musical language ===\nAs Pietro Massa was able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], the musicologist [[Thrasybulos Georgiades]] and with [[Wieland Wagner]], the director who had originally been selected by the composer for the staging of the world premiere,  accompanied the genesis of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|Massa|2006|passim}} Orff made the decision, revolutionary for the time when the work was created, to set the original Greek text after extensive consultation with Wolfgang Schadewaldt, who advised the composer on detailed questions of Greek metrics.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} Since the quantitative metrics of Ancient Greek poetry are incompatible with the accent metrics of modern European languages as well as with the metrical structure of European art music, the composer chose the solution not to let the text, which had to be declaimed rhythmically by the singer's speaking voice during long passages of the opera, be decanted in a rhythm that corresponded to the ancient Greek meter of the original, but to add to the syllable order of the ancient Greek text the second layer of an autonomous musical rhythm.{{sfn|R\u00f6sch|2003|passim}} Since vast parts of the score require a rhythmic declamation of the Greek text in the speaking voice of the soloists, which is only occasionally interrupted by strong accents of the gigantic percussion, the score of ''Prometheus'' also marked a new stage in Orff's departure from traditional pitch structures in comparison with his previous operas on Greek dramas.\n\nConcentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with a specific and indefinite pitch, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, appeared to be a veritable patent solution for a composer for whom the creation of purely diastematic organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of labor, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, in the orchestra of Orff's operas on Greek Antiquity appears transposed onto instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of ''Prometheus'', the six pianos and the xylophones, which in the traditional orchestra were only given marginal tasks, take on the role that the string body had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, the basic instruments of the traditional European symphony orchestra \u2013 such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses \u2013 become entrusted in Orff's scores with functions that had been the realm of the rare percussion instruments in the 19th-century orchestra tradition. Their special timbres, which possess an  almost exotic sound appeal, are only used for special, dramaturgically motivated tasks.{{sfn|Maehder|2015|pp=197\u2013229.}}\n\nThe inclusion of numerous non-European percussion instruments that had not previously been used in the orchestra of European art music cannot be interpreted as musical [[exoticism]], especially since the composer hardly uses the new timbres unmixed.{{sfn|Vars\u00e1ny|2015|pp=175\u2013196}} Rather, the gathering of instruments from all parts of the world in the orchestra of Orff's last works for the stage serves to substantiate the claim that the setting of the ancient Greek myth should reveal the all-encompassing nature of the Greek myth which appeals to mankind in its entirety.{{sfn|Maehder|2007|pp=441\u2013462}}\n\nIn the history of 20th-century music, Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity appear as an extraordinarily original development of musical dramaturgy after 1949. In recent decades, and especially after the year 2000, Orff's late style has attracted an increasing interest from opera houses and from musicological research alike, not least because of the obvious relationship between Orff's musical language and the tendencies of [[minimalism]].\n\n== Performance history ==\nOnly five months after the opera's world premiere, on 1 August 1968, Orff's ''Prometheus'' received a second, highly successful production at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] Munich, conducted by [[Michael Gielen]] and staged by [[August Everding]] with the sets and costumes designed by [[Josef Svoboda]]; this production has received the composer's special praise.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} After the great success of these initial performances, the enormous difficulties of the title role, the problem of assembling a large collection of exotic percussion instruments and the reluctance of smaller opera houses to stage a work written in Ancient Greek have hindered a broader diffusion of Orff's score, although some basic notions of Ancient Greek would have been present at least among some members of an educated opera audience in Western Germany. After the year 2000, a renewed interest in Carl Orff's late style has led to a rediscovery of his operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity; in the meantime, opera scores with a [[libretto]] in rare or non-Western languages had become increasingly common. Among the productions of the last decade, a production in the context of the festival [[Ruhrtriennale]] (Duisburg 2012), conducted by [[Peter Rundel]] and with the staging, sets and costumes by the Samoan director [[Lemi Ponifasio]], has met with special success. Further performances in concert were presented in 2013 (Munich), in 2015 in the context of the Orff festival in Diessen/Ammersee, and again 2015 in Munich. A new production of ''Prometheus'' had been announced for the summer of 2020; the opera should have been staged in the context of the ''Jugendfestspiele Bayreuth'', a branch of [[Bayreuth Festival]].\n\n== Recordings ==\n* Roland Hermann, [[Colette Lorand]], [[Fritz Uhl]], Heinz Cramer, [[Josef Greindl]], [[Kieth Engen]]; [[WDR Sinfonieorchester K\u00f6ln|Rundfunk-Symphonieorchester K\u00f6ln]], conductor: [[Ferdinand Leitner]]. 1972.

[[Hermes]] asks Prometheus one last time to finally name the hetaerae who would cost Zeus and his followers their eternal rule. When Prometheus refuses, he is struck by lightning and thunder from an earthquake which throws him into the shadowy realm of the [[Hades]].\n\n[[Kratos (mythology)|Kratos]] (Greek: \"Power\") and [[Bia (mythology)|Bia]] (Greek: \"Violence\"), the servants of [[Zeus]], drag Prometheus to the [[Caucasus]] mountains, where, at Zeus' command, the reluctant [[Hephaistos]] chains Prometheus to a rock of the Caucasus. Hephaistos takes pity on Prometheus, but is also afraid of Zeus and his accomplices.\n\nAfter Hephaistos, Kratos and Bia have left, the chorus of the daughters of [[Okeanos]] appears; they assures him of his friendship and inquire about the reason for this punishment. Prometheus tells about his fight against [[Cronus|Kronos]], helping Zeus to overthrow his father through cunning and cleverness. Zeus then passed the offices, but did not think of the humans, so that only Prometheus came to their support; he gave them the fire, hope and the art of prophecy. The chorus warns him of his audacity, whereupon Prometheus declares that despite his knowledge of his future punishment, he did it for the sake of people.\n\nThe chorus flies away, whereupon Okeanos rides on stage on his griffin. He describes himself as the greatest friend of Prometheus and claims that he hurried to his side as quickly as possible. But Prometheus asks him if he wants to indulge in his suffering and is outraged again about Zeus. Okeanos also warns him about the lack of submission to the new ruler. Prometheus should submit and ask for mercy so that he would be redeemed. But he reacts with irony to this advice from Okeanos, who had not supported the people with him. Okeanos offers to appeal to Zeus, but Prometheus advises him against it, referring to his brothers [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Typhon (mythology)|Typhon]]. Okeanos is persuaded and flies away.\n\nThe chorus returns and laments Prometheus's deplorable fate. Thereupon Prometheus tells what knowledge he brought to the human race, including medicine, seafaring, meteorology and divination. He also announces that Zeus will abdicate one day and Prometheus will be redeemed. The Okeanids, though, should not tell Zeus about his future so that his prophecy will come true. The chorus laments the suffering of Prometheus and the lack of help from the human race which had enjoyed Prometheus's support.\n\nThe horned [[Io (mythology)|Io]], daughter of Inachos, enters on stage. Prometheus announces the end of Zeus's reign to her by a son of [[Hera]]. When Io learns that Prometheus has mastered the art of divination, she wants him to predict her own fate. Before that, however, she reports how she dreamed of Zeus's love. Therefore, Inachos, the father of Io, received the news from an [[oracle]] and decided to expel his daughter from the country. To cover up the love for Io, he turned her into a cow. But this was not hidden from Hera; she sent Argos as a guard and had the cow chased by a [[Horse-fly|gadfly]]. Now Prometheus announces Io's future: She will cross the [[Bosphorus]] (which will be named after her) and will eventually reach [[Ethiopia]] following the Nile Delta to [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] to give birth to [[Epaphos]] there. A descendant of the Io's in the 13th generation, a \"hero of the bow\" (i.e. [[Herakles]]) will one day save Prometheus. Since Io can no longer bear the stings of the gadfly, she escapes.\n\nPrometheus reveals to the chorus of the [[Oceanids]] that Zeus' curse will come to an end. Hermes comes in and demands that Prometheus open up to Zeus who will overthrow him. He threatens with lightning and storm, which would hurt Prometheus badly; an eagle sent by Zeus would come to eat Prometheus's liver. Since Prometheus refuses to disclose this knowledge, he is punished by Zeus: the rock with the titan forged onto it sinks into Hades.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Orchestra ===\nThe score of Orff's ''Prometheus'' calls for an instrumentation that is unique in music history:\n{{div col}}\n* 6 [[flute|flutes]], all also [[piccolo]]s, 1 also bass flute\n* 6 [[oboe]]s, oboes 5\u20136 also [[cor anglais]]\n* 6 [[trumpet]]s\n* 6 [[trombone]]s\n* 4 [[harp]]s\n* 4 [[banjo|tenor banjo]]s\n* 1 [[organ (music)|organ]]\n* 1 [[regal (instrument)|regal]]\n* 1 [[electronic organ|electric organ]]\n* 4 [[grand piano]]s with 8 players\n* 9 [[double bass]]es\n\nThe large percussion section requires 15 to 18 players:\n* 5 [[timpani]]\n* 2 small timpani with wooden cover\n* 1 [[snare drum]] with resonant strings\n* 3 Basque drums\n* 2 [[bass drum]]s, 1 with a cymbal attached\n* 1 O-Daiko\n* 1 [[taiko]]\n* 4 [[darabukka]]s\n* 2 [[conga]]s\n* 1 [[lithophone]]\n* 2 [[xylophone]]s\n* 2 chromatic tenor xylophones\n* 2 [[marimbaphone]]s\n* 1 bass xylophone\n* 1 [[glockenspiel]]\n* 1 metallophone\n* 1 bass metallophone\n* 6 [[tubular bells]]\n* 1 [[triangle]]\n* 1 pair of [[cymbal]]s \n* 3 hanging cymbals (small \u2013 medium \u2013 large)\n* 5 hanging Turkish cymbals\n* 3 hanging Chinese cymbals\n* 2 cymbales antiques\n* 1 pair of small cymbales antiques (c<sup>5</sup>)\n* 6 pairs [[Crotales|antique cymbals]]\n* 3 [[tamtam]]\n* 3 [[gong]]s\n* 2 large metal plates (e<sup>3</sup> and f<sup>3</sup>)\n* 1 plate bell (contra-C<sub>1</sub>)\n* 1 [[g\u00fciro]]\n* 5 wood blocks\n* 3 wood bells\n* 1 large wood bell\n* 1 African slot drum\n* wooden planks\n* 1 pair of bamboo tubes\n* 2 pairs of [[hy\u014dshigi]]\n* 1 wasamba\n* 1 [[binzasara]]\n* 4 [[maraca]]s\n* 2 [[angklung]] (g<sup>1</sup> and b flat<sup>1</sup>)\n* 7 glasses (tuned)\n* 1 [[wind machine]]\n* 1 thunder machine\n{{div col end}}\nThe chromatic tenor xylophones are instruments of the [[Orff-Schulwerk]]. Since they are not normally used in the percussion section of the symphony orchestra because of the [[chromatic]] arrangement of their keys, in current performance practice marimbaphones are substituted. However, since chromatic glissandi can only be performed on chromatic tenor xylphones, these instruments from Orff's Schulwerk are included in limited numbers in order to allow for the performance of chromatic glissandi. The score of '' Prometheus '' therefore reflects the performance practice of all three of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|M\u00f6ller|1995|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}}\n\nWhile at the time of the premiere, the performance of the percussion section required considerable skills from the percussionists, thanks to the extraordinary development of the percussion technology in the past decades, Orff's score no longer offers insurmountable obstacles.\n\n=== Musical language ===\nAs Pietro Massa was able to show, an intensive exchange of ideas with the classical philologist [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], the musicologist [[Thrasybulos Georgiades]] and with [[Wieland Wagner]], the director who had originally been selected by the composer for the staging of the world premiere,  accompanied the genesis of Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity.{{sfn|Massa|2006|p={{page needed|date=April 2020}}}} Orff made the decision, revolutionary for the time when the work was created, to set the original Greek text after extensive consultation with Wolfgang Schadewaldt, who advised the composer on detailed questions of Greek metrics.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} Since the quantitative metrics of Ancient Greek poetry are incompatible with the accent metrics of modern European languages as well as with the metrical structure of European art music, the composer chose the solution not to let the text, which had to be declaimed rhythmically by the singer's speaking voice during long passages of the opera, be decanted in a rhythm that corresponded to the ancient Greek meter of the original, but to add to the syllable order of the ancient Greek text the second layer of an autonomous musical rhythm. Since vast parts of the score require a rhythmic declamation of the Greek text in the speaking voice of the soloists, which is only occasionally interrupted by strong accents of the gigantic percussion, the score of ''Prometheus'' also marked a new stage in Orff's departure from traditional pitch structures in comparison with his previous operas on Greek dramas.\n\nConcentrating on an ensemble of percussion instruments with a specific and indefinite pitch, originally certainly born out of the fascination that the orchestra's only still evolving group exercised on 20th-century composers, appeared to be a veritable patent solution for a composer for whom the creation of purely diastematic organizations had never been a central concern. The idea of a differentiated cooperation based on the division of labor, which has distinguished the orchestra of Western art music that has grown organically over the centuries, in the orchestra of Orff's operas on Greek Antiquity appears transposed onto instrument constellations that were previously unknown to European art music. In the score of ''Prometheus'', the six pianos and the xylophones, which in the traditional orchestra were only given marginal tasks, take on the role that the string body had in the orchestration of Viennese classical music. On the other hand, the basic instruments of the traditional European symphony orchestra \u2013 such as flutes, oboes, trumpets and double basses \u2013 become entrusted in Orff's scores with functions that had been the realm of the rare percussion instruments in the 19th-century orchestra tradition. Their special timbres, which possess an  almost exotic sound appeal, are only used for special, dramaturgically motivated tasks.{{sfn|Maehder|2015|pp=197\u2013229.}}\n\nThe inclusion of numerous non-European percussion instruments that had not previously been used in the orchestra of European art music cannot be interpreted as musical [[exoticism]], especially since the composer hardly uses the new timbres unmixed.{{sfn|Vars\u00e1ny|2015|pp=175\u2013196}} Rather, the gathering of instruments from all parts of the world in the orchestra of Orff's last works for the stage serves to substantiate the claim that the setting of the ancient Greek myth should reveal the all-encompassing nature of the Greek myth which appeals to mankind in its entirety.{{sfn|Maehder|2007|pp=441\u2013462}}\n\nIn the history of 20th-century music, Orff's operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity appear as an extraordinarily original development of musical dramaturgy after 1949. In recent decades, and especially after the year 2000, Orff's late style has attracted an increasing interest from opera houses and from musicological research alike, not least because of the obvious relationship between Orff's musical language and the tendencies of [[minimalism]].\n\n== Performance history ==\nOnly five months after the opera's world premiere, on 1 August 1968, Orff's ''Prometheus'' received a second, highly successful production at the [[Bavarian State Opera]] Munich, conducted by [[Michael Gielen]] and staged by [[August Everding]] with the sets and costumes designed by [[Josef Svoboda]]; this production has received the composer's special praise.{{sfn|Flashar|2015|pp=103\u2013111}} After the great success of these initial performances, the enormous difficulties of the title role, the problem of assembling a large collection of exotic percussion instruments and the reluctance of smaller opera houses to stage a work written in Ancient Greek have hindered a broader diffusion of Orff's score, although some basic notions of Ancient Greek would have been present at least among some members of an educated opera audience in Western Germany. After the year 2000, a renewed interest in Carl Orff's late style has led to a rediscovery of his operas on subjects from Greek Antiquity; in the meantime, opera scores with a [[libretto]] in rare or non-Western languages had become increasingly common. Among the productions of the last decade, a production in the context of the festival [[Ruhrtriennale]] (Duisburg 2012), conducted by [[Peter Rundel]], has met with special success. Further performances in concert were presented in 2013 (Munich), in 2015 in the context of the Orff festival in Diessen/Ammersee, and again 2015 in Munich. A new production of ''Prometheus'' had been announced for the summer of 2020; the opera should have been staged in the context of the ''Jugendfestspiele Bayreuth'', a branch of [[Bayreuth Festival]].\n\n== Recordings ==\n* Roland Hermann, [[Colette Lorand]], [[Fritz Uhl]], Heinz Cramer, [[Josef Greindl]], [[Kieth Engen]]; [[WDR Sinfonieorchester K\u00f6ln|Rundfunk-Symphonieorchester K\u00f6ln]], conductor: [[Ferdinand Leitner]]. 1972.

By entering the fray she wants to \"deglamourise\" politics. Politics should not be a full-time affair, she feels, and more like her should enter. Incidentally, she is known to have approached the Congress (I) for a ticket because, as she herself admits, she \"had the impression that Mrs Gandhi alone would fight for democracy in the country\". She changed her mind suddenly, she says, when Sanjay Gandhi was given a ticket to stand from Amethi in UP; \"I realised that Mrs. Gandhi had fooled me the way she had so many people.

This building was a big accomplishment for the team, previously one of two national top 20 teams without an [[Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic-sized swimming pool]]. The Aquatic and Fitness Center was built not only with a 50 meter Olympic-sized pool, but also with a warm-water pool, whirlpool and sauna, classrooms, fitness areas, locker rooms, a bookstore, and a dining area. The $18.5 million facility features a 50-meter pool that converts to a short course 25-yard pool, as well as state of the art lane lines and gutters. The facility underwent renovation in 2004, adding a three-court gymnasium, indoor running track, multipurpose rooms, a cycling room, and free weight and cardiovascular areas were added. Former head coach Mark Bernardino expressed his gratitude towards the building of the new facility when he said, \"With this facility, we are showing our potential student-athletes that we are interested in recruiting athletes with national and international aspirations, and that we are committed to the long-term excellence of the University of Virginia swimming and diving program.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Cavaliers|url=http://www.virginiasports.com/facilities/c-swim-facilities.html|work=website|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Yearly records ==\n=== Men ===\n{{CBB yearly record start | type = team | conference = | poll = both }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Unknown | conference = [[Southern Conference]] | startyear = 1925 | endyear = 1935 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1925\u201326|name = Unknown|overall = 1\u20130\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1926\u201327|name = Unknown|overall = 2\u20130\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1927\u201328|name = Unknown|overall = 2\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1928\u201329|name = Unknown|overall = 3\u20131\u20131|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1929\u201330|name = Unknown|overall = 4\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1930\u201331|name = Unknown|overall = 5\u20131\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1931\u201332|name = Unknown|overall = 5\u20131\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1932\u201333|name = Unknown|overall = 3\u20133\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1933\u201334|name = Unknown|overall = 4\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1934\u201335|name = Unknown|overall = 4\u20132\u20131|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = John Montague | conference = Southern Conference | startyear = 1935 | endyear = 1936 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1935\u201336|name = John Montague|overall = 5\u20131\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = John Montague | overall = 5\u20131\u20130 ({{winpct|5|1|0}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Unknown | conference = [[Southern Conference]] | startyear = 1936 | endyear = 1937 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1936\u201337|name = Unknown|overall = 1\u20135\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = Unknown | overall = 34\u201319\u20132 ({{winpct|34|19|2}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Douglas Lund | conference = Independent | startyear = 1937 | endyear = 1939 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1937\u201338|name = Douglas Lund|overall = 5\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1938\u201339|name = Douglas Lund|overall = 7\u20130\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = Douglas Lund | overall = 12\u20132\u20130 ({{winpct|12|2|0}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Hollis Fitch | conference = Independent | startyear = 1939 | endyear = 1940 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1939\u201340|name = Hollis Fitch|overall = 3\u20136\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = Hollis Fitch | overall = 3\u20136\u20130 ({{winpct|3|6|0}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = R.C.

This building was a big accomplishment for the team, previously one of two national top 20 teams without an [[Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic-sized swimming pool]]. The Aquatic and Fitness Center was built not only with a 50 meter Olympic-sized pool, but also with a warm-water pool, whirlpool and sauna, classrooms, fitness areas, locker rooms, a bookstore, and a dining area. The $18.5 million facility features a 50-meter pool that converts to a short course 25-yard pool, as well as state of the art lane lines and gutters. The facility underwent renovation in 2004, adding a three-court gymnasium, indoor running track, multipurpose rooms, a cycling room, and free weight and cardiovascular areas were added. Former head coach Mark Bernardino expressed his gratitude towards the building of the new facility when he said, \"With this facility, we are showing our potential student-athletes that we are interested in recruiting athletes with national and international aspirations, and that we are committed to the long-term excellence of the University of Virginia swimming and diving program.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia Cavaliers|url=http://www.virginiasports.com/facilities/c-swim-facilities.html|work=website|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Yearly records ==\n=== Men ===\n{{CBB yearly record start | type = team | conference = | poll = both }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Unknown | conference = [[Southern Conference]] | startyear = 1925 | endyear = 1935 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1925\u201326|name = Unknown|overall = 1\u20130\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1926\u201327|name = Unknown|overall = 2\u20130\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1927\u201328|name = Unknown|overall = 2\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1928\u201329|name = Unknown|overall = 3\u20131\u20131|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1929\u201330|name = Unknown|overall = 4\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1930\u201331|name = Unknown|overall = 5\u20131\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1931\u201332|name = Unknown|overall = 5\u20131\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1932\u201333|name = Unknown|overall = 3\u20133\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1933\u201334|name = Unknown|overall = 4\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1934\u201335|name = Unknown|overall = 4\u20132\u20131|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = John Montague | conference = Southern Conference | startyear = 1935 | endyear = 1936 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1935\u201336|name = John Montague|overall = 5\u20131\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = John Montague | overall = 5\u20131\u20130 ({{winpct|5|1|0}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Unknown | conference = [[Southern Conference]] | startyear = 1936 | endyear = 1937 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1936\u201337|name = Unknown|overall = 1\u20135\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = Unknown | overall = 34\u201319\u20132 ({{winpct|34|19|2}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Douglas Lund | conference = Independent | startyear = 1937 | endyear = 1939 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1937\u201338|name = Douglas Lund|overall = 5\u20132\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1938\u201339|name = Douglas Lund|overall = 7\u20130\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = Douglas Lund | overall = 12\u20132\u20130 ({{winpct|12|2|0}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = Hollis Fitch | conference = Independent | startyear = 1939 | endyear = 1940 }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry |championship = |season = 1939\u201340|name = Hollis Fitch|overall = 3\u20136\u20130|conference = |confstanding = }}\n{{CBB yearly record subtotal | name = Hollis Fitch | overall = 3\u20136\u20130 ({{winpct|3|6|0}}) | confrecord = }}\n{{CBB Yearly Record Subhead | name = R.C.

It was discovered in 1955 at the [[Butantan Institute]], in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], by [[Gast\u00e3o Rosenfeld]] and collaborators.\n\n==Mechanism of Action==\n\nHementerin is a [[protease]], i.e., it carries out an [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[Bond cleavage|cleaving]] of a [[plasma protein]] involved in rapid [[blood coagulation]] called [[fibrinogen]]. The absence of a significant amount of plasma fibrinogen retards coagulation, thus it is a naturally occurring anticoagulant. Hementerin breaks the alpha (FGA), gamma (FGG) and beta (FGB) chains, by degrading cross-linked [[fibrin]]. It has no degrading action on [[amide]], [[plasminogen]] and [[casein]]. In addition, hementerin inhibits [[platelet]] aggregation induced by [[collagen]] via the activation of a [[nitric oxide|nitridergic pathway]]. Inhibition is probably achieved by enhanced [[nitric oxide synthase]] activity. [[Calcium]] is a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] ([[ligand]]) in this activity.
