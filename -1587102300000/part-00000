The most obvious response is case-by-case, based on the \"watch\" button at the top of each article:  A user who sets that switch can get emails when that article is changed.  Another is an occasional (usually temporary) block.  At least some of these are documented in [[Wikipedia:Congressional staffer edits]].  \n\nFor edits from IP addresses associated with the U.S. Congress, Ed Summers also created a Twitter feed to notify the world of any changes made from those addresses:  ''[[CongressEdits|@congressedits]]'' was an automated Twitter account from 2014 to 2018 that tweeted anonymous changes to Wikipedia articles that originated from IP addresses belonging to the United States Congress. The changes were presumed to have been made by the staffs of US elected representatives and senators. \n\nPrior to the Twitter feed, the best information about what congressional staffers were editing was found in the present article on U.S. Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia and in the [[Wikipedia:Congressional staffer edits|Wikipedia project page for congressional staffer edits]], both of which are manually updated.\n\n== Proponents ==\nIn August 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] suggested that Congressional staffers should spend spare time editing Wikipedia. A panel hosted by the institute endorsed the idea so that congressional staffers could use their time to write neutral and informative articles about proposed legislation to better educate the public. Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia and the history of biased editing from Congressional staffers. The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues would be for the staffers to create user accounts and user profile pages disclosing their connections with Congress.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/08/18/cato-institute-experts-call-on-congressional-staffers-to-edit-wikipedia|title = Cato Institute Experts Call on Staffers to Edit Wikipedia|last = Schwab|first = Nikki|date = August 18, 2014|work = US News & World Report|accessdate = August 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[CongressEdits]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* David Mehegan [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/02/12/bias_sabotage_haunt_wikipedias_free_world/ Bias, sabotage haunt Wikipedia's free world] [[The Boston Globe]], February 12, 2006\n\n{{COI on Wikipedia}}\n{{Wikipediahistory}}{{Portal bar|United States|Politics|Wikipedia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Usa Congressional Staff Edits To Wikipedia}}\n[[Category:2000s controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:2010s controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:2000s in politics]]\n[[Category:2010s in politics]]\n[[Category:Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Congressional controversies in the United States|Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Employees of the United States Congress]]\n[[Category:History of Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia controversies]]\n", "text_old": "{{wikinewshas|news coverage related to this page|\n* [[n:Congressional staff actions prompt Wikipedia investigation|Congressional staff actions prompt Wikipedia investigation]]\n* [[n:United States Department of Justice workers among government Wikipedia vandals|United States Department of Justice workers among government Wikipedia vandals]]\n}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n\nSome edits to the online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] by staff of the [[United States Congress]] have created controversy, notably in early to mid-2006.

The most obvious response is case-by-case, based on the \"watch\" button at the top of each article:  A user who sets that switch can get emails when that article is changed.  Another is an occasional (usually temporary) block.  At least some of these are documented in [[Wikipedia:Congressional staffer edits]].  \n\nFor edits from IP addresses associated with the U.S. Congress, Ed Summers also created a Twitter feed to notify the world of any changes made from those addresses:  ''[[CongressEdits|@congressedits]]'' was an automated Twitter account from 2014 to 2018 that tweeted anonymous changes to Wikipedia articles that originated from IP addresses belonging to the United States Congress. The changes were presumed to have been made by the staffs of US elected representatives and senators. \n\nPrior to the Twitter feed, the best information about what congressional staffers were editing was found in the present article on U.S. Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia and in the [[Wikipedia:Congressional staffer edits|Wikipedia project page for congressional staffer edits]], both of which are manually updated.\n\n== Proponents ==\nIn August 2014, the [[Cato Institute]] suggested that Congressional staffers should spend spare time editing Wikipedia. A panel hosted by the institute endorsed the idea so that congressional staffers could use their time to write neutral and informative articles about proposed legislation to better educate the public. Experts on the panel considered the two main obstacles to doing this as being skepticism towards Wikipedia and the history of biased editing from Congressional staffers. The Cato Institute suggested one way to overcome these issues would be for the staffers to create user accounts and user profile pages disclosing their connections with Congress.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/08/18/cato-institute-experts-call-on-congressional-staffers-to-edit-wikipedia|title = Cato Institute Experts Call on Staffers to Edit Wikipedia|last = Schwab|first = Nikki|date = August 18, 2014|work = US News & World Report|accessdate = August 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[CongressEdits]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* David Mehegan [http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2006/02/12/bias_sabotage_haunt_wikipedias_free_world/ Bias, sabotage haunt Wikipedia's free world] [[The Boston Globe]], February 12, 2006\n\n{{COI on Wikipedia}}\n{{Wikipediahistory}}{{Portal bar|United States|Politics|Wikipedia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Usa Congressional Staff Edits To Wikipedia}}\n[[Category:2000s controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:2010s controversies in the United States]]\n[[Category:2000s in politics]]\n[[Category:2010s in politics]]\n[[Category:Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Congressional controversies in the United States|Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Employees of the United States Congress]]\n[[Category:History of Wikipedia]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia controversies]]\n", "name_user": "Vecr", "label": "safe", "comment": "doxxing -> Doxing", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congressional_staff_edits_to_Wikipedia"}

It is situated on the bank of the Northern [[Wairoa River (Northland)|Wairoa River]] in the [[Kaipara District]] of the [[Northland Region|Northland]] region. The town is located 55 kilometres southwest of [[Whangarei]].\n\nThe population was 4,251 at the 2013 Census, a decrease of 204 since 2006 and 282 from 2001.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|13158}}</ref>\n\nIt is noted for the high proportion of residents of [[Croats|Croatian]] descent. The area around it is one of the chief regions in the country for cultivating kumara ([[sweet potato]]) and so Dargaville is known by many locals as the Kumara Capital of New Zealand.\n\n==History and culture==\n[[Image:Gumdigger_Statue,_Dargaville_04.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Gumdigger statue at Dargaville]]\n\nThe town was named after timber merchant and politician [[Joseph Dargaville]] (1837\u20131896).<ref>{{cite book|title=Discover New Zealand:A Wises Guide|edition=9th|year=1994|page=15}}</ref> Founded{{when|date=June 2014}} during the 19th-century [[kauri gum]] and [[Forestry in New Zealand#History|timber trade]], it briefly{{when|date=June 2014}} had New Zealand's largest population.\n\nThe area became known for a thriving industry that included gum digging and [[kauri]] logging, which was based mainly at [[Te Kopuru]], several kilometres south of Dargaville on the banks of the Northern Wairoa river.  The river was used to transport the huge logs downstream to shipbuilders and as a primary means of transport to Auckland. Dalmatian migrants were particularly prominent in the kauri gum extraction.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dalmatians making their mark 150 years on |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/local-news/northland/dargaville-districts/619710/Dalmatians-making-their-mark-150-years-on |accessdate=11 September 2019 |work=Stuff (Dargaville News) |date=31 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nTe Houhanga Marae and R\u0101hiri meeting house is a traditional meeting place for [[Te Roroa]] and the [[Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua]] [[hap\u016b]] of [[Te Kuihi]] and [[Te Roroa (Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua)|Te Roroa]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\">{{cite web|title=Te K\u0101hui M\u0101ngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni K\u014dkiri]]}}</ref><ref name=\"maorimaps\">{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Boats_Moored_in_Dargaville.JPG|Boats moored near central Dargaville|thumb]]\n\nThe nearby [[Ripiro Beach]] has the longest unbroken stretches of sand beach in New Zealand, and is largely drivable from one end to the other.

Singapore's principal exports are electronic components, refined petroleum, gold, computers, and packaged medications. Singapore's main imports are electronic components, refined petroleum, crude petroleum, gold, and computers.\n\nTrade in Singapore has benefited from the extensive network of trade agreements Singapore has passed. According to [http://www.healyconsultants.com/singapore-company-registration/ Healy Consultants], Singapore has free trade access to the entirety of the ASEAN network, with import duty reduced when dealing with Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.\n\nThe Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) continues to attract investment funds on a large-scale for the country despite the city's relatively high-cost operating environment. The US leads in foreign investment, accounting for 40% of new commitments to the manufacturing sector in 2000. As of 1999, cumulative investment for manufacturing and services by American companies in Singapore reached approximately $20 billion (total assets). The bulk of US investment is in electronics manufacturing, oil refining and storage, and the chemical industry. More than 1,500 US firms operate in Singapore.\n\nSingapore's largely corruption-free government, skilled workforce, and advanced and efficient infrastructure have attracted investments from more than 3,000 [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs) from the United States, Japan, and Europe. Foreign firms are found in almost all sectors of the economy. MNCs account for more than two-thirds of manufacturing output and direct export sales, although certain services sectors remain dominated by government-linked corporations.\n\nThe government also has encouraged firms to invest outside Singapore, with the country's total direct investments abroad reaching $39 billion by the end of 1998. The People's Republic of China was the top destination, accounting for 14% of total overseas investments, followed by [[Malaysia]] (10%), Hong Kong (9%), [[Indonesia]] (8%) and US (4%). The rapidly growing economy of India, especially the high technology sector, is becoming an expanding source of foreign investment for Singapore. The United States provides no [[bilateral aid]] to Singapore, but the US appears keen to improve bilateral trade and signed the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.

As of 1999, cumulative investment for manufacturing and services by American companies in Singapore reached approximately $20 billion (total assets).

More than 1,500 US firms operate in Singapore.\n\nSingapore's largely corruption-free government, skilled workforce, and advanced and efficient infrastructure have attracted investments from more than 3,000 [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs) from the United States, Japan, and Europe. Foreign firms are found in almost all sectors of the economy. MNCs account for more than two-thirds of manufacturing output and direct export sales, although certain services sectors remain dominated by government-linked corporations.\n\nThe government also has encouraged firms to invest outside Singapore, with the country's total direct investments abroad reaching $39 billion by the end of 1998. The People's Republic of China was the top destination, accounting for 14% of total overseas investments, followed by [[Malaysia]] (10%), Hong Kong (9%), [[Indonesia]] (8%) and US (4%). The rapidly growing economy of India, especially the high technology sector, is becoming an expanding source of foreign investment for Singapore. The United States provides no [[bilateral aid]] to Singapore, but the US appears keen to improve bilateral trade and signed the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.

''With limited access to natural resources, Singapore had been forced to invest in its people.'' The country has the largest proficiency of English language speakers in Asia, making it an attractive place for multinational corporations. Singapore has come along way from where it once stood.

Government policy and pro-activity rather than labour legislation controls general labour and trade union matters.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\nThe Employment Act offers little protection to white-collar workers due to an income threshold. The [[Industrial Arbitration Court]] handles labour-management disputes that cannot be resolved informally through the Ministry of Manpower. The [[Singapore Government]] has stressed the importance of co-operation between unions, management and government ([[tripartism]]), as well as the early resolution of disputes. There has been only one strike in the past 15 years.\n\nSingapore has enjoyed virtually full employment for long periods of time. Amid an economic slump, the unemployment rate rose to 4.0% by the end of 2001, from 2.4% early in the year.

It was first enhanced in 2012 to provide employers with support in hiring older Singaporean workers and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). It helped the employers to cope with costs associated with the increase in Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution rates for older workers. The 5 year SEC scheme was further extended to additional 3 years, up to 2019 to encourage employers to voluntarily re-employ older workers aged 65 and above.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://singaporeaccounting.com/special-employment-credit|title=Special Employment Credit (SEC) Guide|work=singaporeaccounting.com|accessdate=31 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908020606/http://singaporeaccounting.com/special-employment-credit/|archive-date=8 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Singapore Government and the NTUC have tried a range of programs to increase lagging productivity and boost the labour force participation rates of women and older workers. However, labour shortages persist in the service sector and in many low-skilled positions in the construction and electronics industries. Foreign workers help make up this shortfall. In 2000, there were about 600,000 foreign workers in Singapore, constituting 27% of the total work force. As a result, wages are relatively suppressed or do not rise for all workers. To have some controls, the government imposes a foreign worker levy payable by employers for low end workers like domestic help and construction workers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aesperon \u2013 2015 Changes To Foreign Worker Levies|url=http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-coretrade-levy/|publisher=Aesperon \u2013 BCA CoreTrade & Levy Benefits|accessdate=1 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811180940/http://aesperoncoretrade.com/bca-coretrade-levy/|archivedate=11 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2012, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) reported that Singapore should continue to fine-tune the calibration of its inflow of foreigners as the country continues to face an ageing population and a shrinking workforce.

Instead, it chooses to do it via the foreign exchange mechanism, which it has been doing since 1981. In doing so it manages the Singapore dollar versus a number of currencies that they do not reveal publicly - a Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$ NEER). It carries this out by intervening in the SGD market as well as other operations in the money market. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/Monetary-Policy-and-Economics/Monetary-Policy/~/media/MAS/Monetary%20Policy%20and%20Economics/Monetary%20Policy/MP%20Framework/Singapores%20Exchange%20Ratebased%20Monetary%20Policy.ashx|title=Singapore's Exchange Rate-Based Monetary Policy|year=2013|work=Monetary Authority of Singapore|publisher=Monetary Authority of Singapore|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419000235/http://www.mas.gov.sg/Monetary-Policy-and-Economics/Monetary-Policy/~/media/MAS/Monetary%20Policy%20and%20Economics/Monetary%20Policy/MP%20Framework/Singapores%20Exchange%20Ratebased%20Monetary%20Policy.ashx|archive-date=19 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/IMF001/06244-9781451842722/06244-9781451842722/06244-9781451842722_A001.xml?redirect=true|title=Singapore's Unique Monetary Policy|website=IMF eLibrary|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> The MAS reviews its policy stance less frequently than most central banks, in a cycle that is around every 6 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/MAS/Monetary-Policy-and-Economics/Monetary-Policy/MP-Framework/Singapores-Exchange-Ratebased-Monetary-Policy.pdf|title=Singapore's Exchange Rate-based Monetary Policy|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In some circumstances, such as during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] MAS can change the date of its twice yearly meeting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mas-bring-forward-monetary-policy-statement-12568182|title=MAS brings forward monetary policy statement, firming easing bets|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n==Property policy==\nIn order to dampen property speculation, the government imposed Additional Buyer Stamp Duty (ABSD) starting in December 2011.

The graph gets arbitrarily close to the {{mvar|y}}-axis, but [[asymptotic|does not meet it]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''logarithm''' is the [[inverse function]] to [[exponentiation]]. That means the logarithm of a given number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[exponent]] to which another fixed number, the ''[[base (exponentiation)|base]]''&nbsp;{{mvar|b}}, must be raised, to produce that number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g., since {{math|1000 {{=}} 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 {{=}} 10<sup>3</sup>}}, the \"logarithm base {{math|10}}\" of {{math|1000}} is {{math|3}}, or {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(1000) {{=}} 3}}. The logarithm of {{mvar|x}} to ''base'' {{mvar|b}} is denoted as {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}}, or without parentheses, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;''x''}}, or even without the explicit base, {{math|log&thinsp;''x''}}, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in [[big O notation]]. \n\nMore generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n\n:<math> \\log_b(x) = y \\ </math> exactly if <math>\\ b^y = x\\ </math> and <math>\\ x > 0</math> and <math>\\ b > 0</math> and <math>\\ b \\ne 1</math>.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=log<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;64 = 6}}, as {{math|1=2<sup>6</sup> = 64}}.\n\nThe logarithm base {{math|10}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 10}}) is called the [[common logarithm]] and has many applications in science and engineering. The [[natural logarithm]] has the [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{mvar|e}}]]&nbsp;(that is {{math|''b'' \u2248 2.718}}) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and [[physics]], because of its simpler [[integral]] and [[derivative]]. The [[binary logarithm]] uses base {{math|2}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}) and is commonly used in [[computer science]].

Using [[Mathematical table|logarithm tables]], tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because of the fact\u2014important in its own right\u2014that the logarithm of a [[product (mathematics)|product]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,</math>\nprovided that {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive and {{math|''b'' \u2260 1}}. The [[slide rule]], also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision.\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from [[Leonhard Euler]], who connected them to the [[exponential function]] in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter {{mvar|e}} as the base of natural logarithms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of complex functions|last=Remmert, Reinhold.|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387971955|location=New York|oclc=21118309}}</ref>\n\n[[Logarithmic scale]]s reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the [[decibel]] (dB) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to express [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|ratio as logarithms]], mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which [[sound pressure]] is a common example). In chemistry, [[pH]] is a logarithmic measure for the [[acid]]ity of an [[aqueous solution]]. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific [[formula]]e, and in measurements of the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of algorithms]] and of geometric objects called [[fractal]]s. They help describing [[frequency]] ratios of [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]], appear in formulas counting [[prime number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation|approximating]] [[factorial]]s, inform some models in [[psychophysics]], and can aid in [[forensic accounting]].\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses [[exponentiation]], the [[complex logarithm]] is the [[inverse function]] of the exponential function applied to [[complex number]]s. The modular [[discrete logarithm]] is another variant; it has uses in [[public-key cryptography]].\n\n==Motivation and definition==\n\n[[Addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, is undone by subtraction: when you add {{math|5}} to {{mvar|x}} to get {{math|''x'' + 5}}, to reverse this operation you need to ''subtract'' {{math|5}} from {{math|''x'' + 5}}. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, is undone by [[division (mathematics)|division]]: if you multiply {{mvar|x}} by {{math|5}} to get {{math|5''x''}}, you then must divide {{math|5''x''}} by {{math|5}} in order to return to the original expression {{mvar|x}}. Logarithms also undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, exponentiation.  Exponentiation is when you raise a number to a certain power. For example, raising {{math|2}} to the power {{math|3}} equals {{math|8}}:\n\n: <math>2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8</math>\n\nThe general case is when you raise a number {{Math|''b''}} to the power of {{Math|''y''}} to get {{Math|''x''}}:\n\n: <math>b^y=x</math>\n\nThe number {{Math|''b''}} is referred to as the base of this expression. The base is the number that is raised to a particular power\u2014in the above example, the base of the expression  <math>2^3=8</math> is {{Math|2}}. It is easy to make the base the subject of the expression: all you have to do is take the {{nowrap|{{mvar|y}}-th}} root of both sides. This gives:\n\n: <math>b=\\sqrt[y]{{x}}</math>\n\nIt is less easy to make {{Math|''y''|}} the subject of the expression. Logarithms allow us to do this:\n\n: <math>y=</math>{{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&nbsp;''x''}}\n\nThis expression means that {{mvar|y}} is equal to the power that you need to raise {{mvar|b}} to in order to get {{mvar|x|}}. This operation undoes exponentiation because the logarithm of {{mvar|''x''}} tells you the ''exponent'' that the base has been raised to.\n\n===Exponentiation===\nThis subsection contains a short overview of the exponentiation operation, which is fundamental to understanding logarithms.\nRaising {{mvar|b}} to the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power, where {{mvar|n}} is a [[natural number]], is done by multiplying {{mvar|n}} factors equal to {{mvar|b}}. The {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power of {{mvar|b}} is written {{math|''b''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, so that\n\n: <math>b^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}</math>\n\nExponentiation may be extended to {{math|''b''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|b}} is a positive number and the ''exponent'' {{mvar|y}} is any [[real number]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0b0igbb3WaQC}}}}, esp. section 2</ref> For example, {{math|''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{mvar|b}}, that is, {{math|1/''b''}}. Raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to the power 1/2 is the [[square root]] of ''{{mvar|b}}''.\n\nMore generally, raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to a [[rational number|rational]] power {{math|''p''/''q''}}, where {{Mvar|p}} and {{Mvar|q}} are integers, is given by\n\n:<math>b^{p / q} = \\sqrt[q]{b^p},</math>\n\nthe {{Mvar|q}}-th root of <math>b^p\\!\\!</math>. \n\nFinally, any [[irrational number]] (a real number which is not rational) ''{{mvar|y}}'' can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers. This can be used to compute the ''{{mvar|y}}''-th power of ''{{mvar|b}}'': for example <math>\\sqrt 2 \\approx 1.414 ...</math> and <math>b^{\\sqrt 2}</math> is increasingly well approximated by <math>b^1, b^{1.4}, b^{1.41}, b^{1.414}, ...</math>.

Archimedes had written ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a [[geometric progression]] in its [[argument of a function|argument]] and an [[arithmetic progression]] of values, prompted [[A.

Briggs' first table contained the [[common logarithm]]s of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of {{math|log<sub>10</sub>''x''}}  for any number {{mvar|x}} in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of {{mvar|x}} can be separated into an [[integer part]] and a [[fractional part]], known as the characteristic and [[mantissa (logarithm)|mantissa]]. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p.&nbsp;264</ref> The characteristic of {{math|10 \u00b7 {{mvar|x}}}} is one plus the characteristic of {{mvar|x}}, and their mantissas are the same.  Thus using a three-digit log table, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542 = \\log_{10}(1000 \\cdot 3.542) = 3 + \\log_{10}3.542 \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 \\, </math>\n\nGreater accuracy can be obtained by [[interpolation]]:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542  \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 + 0.2 (\\log_{10}3.55-\\log_{10}3.54)\\, </math>\n\nThe value of {{math| 10<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be determined by reverse look up in the same table, since the logarithm is a [[monotonic function]].\n\n===Computations===\nThe product and quotient of two positive numbers {{Mvar|c}} and ''{{Mvar|d}}'' were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product ''{{Mvar|cd}}'' or quotient {{Mvar|c/d}} came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:\n\n:<math> c d = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c} \\, 10^{\\ \\log_{10} d} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c + \\ \\log_{10} d} \\,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac c d = c d^{-1} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c - \\ \\log_{10} d}. \\,</math>\n\nFor manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as [[prosthaphaeresis]], which relies on [[trigonometric identities]].\n\nCalculations of powers and [[nth root|roots]] are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by\n:<math>c^d = \\left(10^{\\ \\log_{10} c}\\right)^d =  10^{d \\ \\log_{10} c} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt[d]{c} = c^\\frac{1}{d} = 10^{\\frac{1}{d} \\ \\log_{10} c}. \\,</math>\n\nTrigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\n===Slide rules===\nAnother critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, [[Gunter's rule]], was invented shortly after Napier's invention. [[William Oughtred]] enhanced it to create the slide rule\u2014a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the logarithm of {{mvar|x}}.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]\n\nFor example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\n{{Harvard citations\n |last1=Maor |year=2009 |nb=yes |loc=sections 1, 13}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic properties==\nA deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''.

A function is ''continuous'' if it does not \"jump\", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.\n\nThis property can be shown to hold for the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}. Because ''{{mvar|f}}'' takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number {{math|''y'' > 0}} lies between {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} and {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}} for suitable {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|y}}}} has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function ''f'' is [[monotonic function|strictly increasing]] (for {{math|''b'' > 1}}), or strictly decreasing (for {{math|0 < {{mvar|b}} < 1}}).<ref name=LangIV.2>{{Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2}}</ref>\n\nThe unique solution {{mvar|x}} is the logarithm of {{mvar|y}} to base {{mvar|b}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

Conversely, given a positive number {{mvar|y}}, the formula\n:<math>b^{\\log_b y} = y</math>\nsays that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back {{mvar|y}}. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or [[function composition|composing]]) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number. Therefore, the logarithm to base {{mvar|b}} is the ''[[inverse function]]'' of {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Stewart | first1=James | title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont|isbn=978-0-495-01169-9 | year=2007}}, section 1.6</ref>\n\nInverse functions are closely related to the original functions. Their [[graph of a function|graphs]] correspond to each other upon exchanging the {{mvar|x}}- and the {{mvar|y}}-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}}), as shown at the right: a point {{math|1=(''t'', ''u'' = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''t''</sup>)}} on the graph of ''f'' yields a point {{math|1=(''u'', ''t'' = log<sub>''b''</sub>''u'')}} on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} [[divergent sequence|diverges to infinity]] (gets bigger than any given number) if {{mvar|x}} grows to infinity, provided that {{mvar|b}} is greater than one. In that case, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}}  is an [[increasing function]]. For {{math|''b'' < 1}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} tends to minus infinity instead. When {{mvar|x}} approaches zero, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''x''}} goes to minus infinity for {{math|''b'' > 1}} (plus infinity for {{math|''b'' < 1}}, respectively).\n\n===Derivative and antiderivative===\n[[File:Logarithm derivative.svg|right|thumb|220px|The graph of the [[natural logarithm]] (green) and its tangent at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1.5}} (black)|alt=A graph of the logarithm function and a line touching it in one point.]]\nAnalytic properties of functions pass to their inverses.<ref name=LangIII.3 /> Thus, as {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}} is a continuous and [[differentiable function]], so is {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

The Taylor series of {{math|ln(''z'')}} provides a particularly useful approximation to {{math|ln(1+''z'')}} when {{mvar|z}} is small, {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} < 1}}, since then\n:<math>\n\\ln (1+z) = z - \\frac{z^2}{2}  +\\frac{z^3}{3}\\cdots \\approx z.\n</math>\nFor example, with {{math|1=''z'' = 0.1}} the first-order approximation gives {{math|ln(1.1) \u2248 0.1}}, which is less than 5% off the correct value 0.0953.\n\n;More efficient series\nAnother series is based on the [[area hyperbolic tangent]] function:\n:<math>\n\\ln (z) = 2\\cdot\\operatorname{artanh}\\,\\frac{z-1}{z+1} = 2 \\left ( \\frac{z-1}{z+1} + \\frac{1}{3}{\\left(\\frac{z-1}{z+1}\\right)}^3 + \\frac{1}{5}{\\left(\\frac{z-1}{z+1}\\right)}^5 + \\cdots \\right ),\n</math>\nfor any real number {{math|''z'' > 0}}.{{refn|The same series holds for the principal value of the complex logarithm for complex numbers {{mvar|z}} with positive real part.|group=nb}}<ref name=AbramowitzStegunp.68 /> Using [[sigma notation]], this is also written as\n:<math>\\ln (z) = 2\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2k+1}\\left(\\frac{z-1}{z+1}\\right)^{2k+1}.</math>\nThis series can be derived from the above Taylor series. It converges more quickly than the Taylor series, especially if {{mvar|z}} is close to 1. For example, for {{math|1=''z'' = 1.5}}, the first three terms of the second series approximate {{math|ln(1.5)}} with an error of about {{val|3|e=-6}}. The quick convergence for {{mvar|z}} close to 1 can be taken advantage of in the following way: given a low-accuracy approximation {{math|''y'' \u2248 ln(''z'')}} and putting\n:<math>A = \\frac z{\\exp(y)}, \\,</math>\nthe logarithm of {{mvar|z}} is:\n:<math>\\ln (z)=y+\\ln (A). \\,</math>\nThe better the initial approximation {{mvar|y}} is, the closer {{mvar|A}} is to 1, so its logarithm can be calculated efficiently. {{mvar|A}} can be calculated using the [[exponential function|exponential series]], which converges quickly provided {{mvar|y}} is not too large. Calculating the logarithm of larger {{mvar|z}} can be reduced to smaller values of {{mvar|z}} by writing {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' \u00b7 10<sup>''b''</sup>}}, so that {{math|ln(''z'') {{=}} ln(''a'') + {{mvar|b}} \u00b7 ln(10)}}.\n\nA closely related method can be used to compute the logarithm of integers. Putting <math>\\textstyle z=\\frac{n+1}{n}</math> in the above series, it follows that:\n:<math>\\ln (n+1) = \\ln(n) + 2\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{1}{2k+1}\\left(\\frac{1}{2 n+1}\\right)^{2k+1}.</math>\nIf the logarithm of a large integer {{mvar|n}} is known, then this series yields a fast converging series for {{math|log(''n''+1)}}, with a [[rate of convergence]] of <math>\\frac{1}{2 n+1}</math>.\n\n===Arithmetic\u2013geometric mean approximation===\nThe [[arithmetic\u2013geometric mean]] yields high precision approximations of the [[natural logarithm]]. Sasaki and Kanada showed in 1982 that it was particularly fast for precisions between 400 and 1000 decimal places, while Taylor series methods were typically faster when less precision was needed. In their work {{math|ln(''x'')}} is approximated to a precision of {{math|2<sup>\u2212''p''</sup>}} (or ''p'' precise bits) by the following formula (due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]):<ref>{{Citation |first1=T. |last1=Sasaki |first2=Y. |last2=Kanada |title=Practically fast multiple-precision evaluation of log(x) |journal=Journal of Information Processing |volume=5|issue=4 |pages=247\u201350 |year=1982 | url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002673332 | accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first1=Timm |title=Stacs 99|last1=Ahrendt|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, New York|series=Lecture notes in computer science|doi=10.1007/3-540-49116-3_28|volume=1564|year=1999|pages=302\u201312|isbn=978-3-540-65691-3|chapter=Fast Computations of the Exponential Function}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\ln (x) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{2  M(1,2^{2-m}/x)} - m \\ln (2).</math>\n\nHere {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} denotes the [[arithmetic\u2013geometric mean]] of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. It is obtained by repeatedly calculating the average <math>(x+y)/2</math> ([[arithmetic mean]]) and <math>\\sqrt{xy}</math> ([[geometric mean]]) of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} then let those two numbers become the next {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. The two numbers quickly converge to a common limit which is the value of {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}}. ''m'' is chosen such that\n\n:<math>x \\,2^m > 2^{p/2}.\\, </math>\n\nto ensure the required precision. A larger ''m'' makes the {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} calculation take more steps (the initial x and y are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants {{math|pi}} and {{math|ln(2)}} can be calculated with quickly converging series.\n\n===Feynman's algorithm===\nWhile at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] working on the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Richard Feynman]] developed a bit-processing algorithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the [[Connection Machine]]. The algorithm uses the fact that every real number <math> 1 < x < 2 </math> is representable as a product of distinct factors of the form <math> 1 + 2^{-k} </math>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product <math>P</math>: if <math>P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) < x</math>, then it changes <math>P</math> to <math> P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) </math>. It then increase <math>k</math> by one regardless. The algorithm stops when <math>k</math> is large enough to give the desired accuracy. Because <math>\\log(x)</math> is the sum of the terms of the form <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> corresponding to those <math>k</math> for which the factor <math>1 + 2^{-k}</math> was included in the product <math>P</math>, <math>\\log(x)</math> may be computed by simple addition, using a table of <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> for all <math>k</math>. Any base may be used for the logarithm table.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Danny |last=Hillis |authorlink=Danny Hillis |title=Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine |journal=Physics Today |volume= 42|issue= 2|page= 78|date=January 15, 1989 |doi=10.1063/1.881196|bibcode=1989PhT....42b..78H}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|A [[nautilus]] displaying a logarithmic spiral|alt=A photograph of a nautilus' shell.]]\nLogarithms have many applications inside and outside mathematics.

In [[equal temperament]], the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or [[pitch (music)|pitch]], of the individual tones. For example, the [[a (musical note)|note ''A'']] has a frequency of 440 [[Hertz|Hz]] and [[B\u266d (musical note)|''B-flat'']] has a frequency of 466&nbsp;Hz. The interval between ''A'' and ''B-flat'' is a [[semitone]], as is the one between ''B-flat'' and [[b (musical note)|''B'']] (frequency 493&nbsp;Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:\n:<math>\\frac{466}{440} \\approx \\frac{493}{466} \\approx 1.059 \\approx \\sqrt[12]2.</math>\nTherefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the {{math|base-2<sup>1/12</sup>}} logarithm of the [[frequency]] ratio, while the {{math|base-2<sup>1/1200</sup>}} logarithm of the frequency ratio expresses the interval in [[cent (music)|cents]], hundredths of a semitone.

The graph gets arbitrarily close to the {{mvar|y}}-axis, but [[asymptotic|does not meet it]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''logarithm''' is the [[inverse function]] to [[exponentiation]]. That means the logarithm of a given number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[exponent]] to which another fixed number, the ''[[base (exponentiation)|base]]''&nbsp;{{mvar|b}}, must be raised, to produce that number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g., since {{math|1000 {{=}} 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 {{=}} 10<sup>3</sup>}}, the \"logarithm base {{math|10}}\" of {{math|1000}} is {{math|3}}, or {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(1000) {{=}} 3}}. The logarithm of {{mvar|x}} to ''base'' {{mvar|b}} is denoted as {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}}, or without parentheses, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;''x''}}, or even without the explicit base, {{math|log&thinsp;''x''}}, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in [[big O notation]]. \n\nMore generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n\n:<math> \\log_b(x) = y \\ </math> exactly if <math>\\ b^y = x\\ </math> and <math>\\ x > 0</math> and <math>\\ b > 0</math> and <math>\\ b \\ne 1</math>.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=log<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;64 = 6}}, as {{math|1=2<sup>6</sup> = 64}}.\n\nThe logarithm base {{math|10}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 10}}) is called the [[common logarithm]] and has many applications in science and engineering. The [[natural logarithm]] has the [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{mvar|e}}]]&nbsp;(that is {{math|''b'' \u2248 2.718}}) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and [[physics]], because of its simpler [[integral]] and [[derivative]]. The [[binary logarithm]] uses base {{math|2}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}) and is commonly used in [[computer science]].  Logarithms are examples of [[concave function]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Logarithm \u2014 Theory & Applications|date=2016-05-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\nLogarithms were introduced by [[John Napier]] in 1614 as a means of simplifying calculations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614; a lecture|last=Hobson|first=Ernest William|date=1914|publisher=Cambridge : University Press|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref> They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, surveyors and others to perform high-accuracy computations more easily. Using [[Mathematical table|logarithm tables]], tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because of the fact\u2014important in its own right\u2014that the logarithm of a [[product (mathematics)|product]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,</math>\nprovided that {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive and {{math|''b'' \u2260 1}}. The [[slide rule]], also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision.\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from [[Leonhard Euler]], who connected them to the [[exponential function]] in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter {{mvar|e}} as the base of natural logarithms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of complex functions|last=Remmert, Reinhold.|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387971955|location=New York|oclc=21118309}}</ref>\n\n[[Logarithmic scale]]s reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the [[decibel]] (dB) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to express [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|ratio as logarithms]], mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which [[sound pressure]] is a common example). In chemistry, [[pH]] is a logarithmic measure for the [[acid]]ity of an [[aqueous solution]]. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific [[formula]]e, and in measurements of the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of algorithms]] and of geometric objects called [[fractal]]s. They help describing [[frequency]] ratios of [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]], appear in formulas counting [[prime number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation|approximating]] [[factorial]]s, inform some models in [[psychophysics]], and can aid in [[forensic accounting]].\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses [[exponentiation]], the [[complex logarithm]] is the [[inverse function]] of the exponential function applied to [[complex number]]s. The modular [[discrete logarithm]] is another variant; it has uses in [[public-key cryptography]].\n\n==Motivation and definition==\n\n[[Addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, is undone by subtraction: when you add {{math|5}} to {{mvar|x}} to get {{math|''x'' + 5}}, to reverse this operation you need to ''subtract'' {{math|5}} from {{math|''x'' + 5}}. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, is undone by [[division (mathematics)|division]]: if you multiply {{mvar|x}} by {{math|5}} to get {{math|5''x''}}, you then must divide {{math|5''x''}} by {{math|5}} in order to return to the original expression {{mvar|x}}. Logarithms also undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, exponentiation.  Exponentiation is when you raise a number to a certain power. For example, raising {{math|2}} to the power {{math|3}} equals {{math|8}}:\n\n: <math>2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8</math>\n\nThe general case is when you raise a number {{Math|''b''}} to the power of {{Math|''y''}} to get {{Math|''x''}}:\n\n: <math>b^y=x</math>\n\nThe number {{Math|''b''}} is referred to as the base of this expression. The base is the number that is raised to a particular power\u2014in the above example, the base of the expression  <math>2^3=8</math> is {{Math|2}}. It is easy to make the base the subject of the expression: all you have to do is take the {{nowrap|{{mvar|y}}-th}} root of both sides. This gives:\n\n: <math>b=\\sqrt[y]{{x}}</math>\n\nIt is less easy to make {{Math|''y''|}} the subject of the expression. Logarithms allow us to do this:\n\n: <math>y=</math>{{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&nbsp;''x''}}\n\nThis expression means that {{mvar|y}} is equal to the power that you need to raise {{mvar|b}} to in order to get {{mvar|x|}}. This operation undoes exponentiation because the logarithm of {{mvar|''x''}} tells you the ''exponent'' that the base has been raised to.\n\n===Exponentiation===\nThis subsection contains a short overview of the exponentiation operation, which is fundamental to understanding logarithms.\nRaising {{mvar|b}} to the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power, where {{mvar|n}} is a [[natural number]], is done by multiplying {{mvar|n}} factors equal to {{mvar|b}}. The {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power of {{mvar|b}} is written {{math|''b''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, so that\n\n: <math>b^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}</math>\n\nExponentiation may be extended to {{math|''b''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|b}} is a positive number and the ''exponent'' {{mvar|y}} is any [[real number]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0b0igbb3WaQC}}}}, esp. section 2</ref> For example, {{math|''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{mvar|b}}, that is, {{math|1/''b''}}. Raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to the power 1/2 is the [[square root]] of ''{{mvar|b}}''.\n\nMore generally, raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to a [[rational number|rational]] power {{math|''p''/''q''}}, where {{Mvar|p}} and {{Mvar|q}} are integers, is given by\n\n:<math>b^{p / q} = \\sqrt[q]{b^p},</math>\n\nthe {{Mvar|q}}-th root of <math>b^p\\!\\!</math>. \n\nFinally, any [[irrational number]] (a real number which is not rational) ''{{mvar|y}}'' can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers. This can be used to compute the ''{{mvar|y}}''-th power of ''{{mvar|b}}'': for example <math>\\sqrt 2 \\approx 1.414 ...</math> and <math>b^{\\sqrt 2}</math> is increasingly well approximated by <math>b^1, b^{1.4}, b^{1.41}, b^{1.414}, ...</math>.

Archimedes had written ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a [[geometric progression]] in its [[argument of a function|argument]] and an [[arithmetic progression]] of values, prompted [[A. A. de Sarasa]] to make the connection of Saint-Vincent's quadrature and the tradition of logarithms in [[prosthaphaeresis]], leading to the term \"hyperbolic logarithm\", a synonym for natural logarithm. Soon the new function was appreciated by [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]]. The notation Log y was adopted by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in 1675,<ref>[[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: 5, 35, 75, 107, 148, 173, 205.</ref> and the next year he connected it to the [[integral calculus|integral]]\n<math>\\int \\frac{dy}{y} .</math>\n\n==Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications{{anchor|Antilogarithm}}==\n[[Image:Logarithms Britannica 1797.png|thumb|360px|right|The 1797 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' explanation of logarithms]]\n\nBy simplifying difficult calculations before calculators and computers became available, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, especially [[astronomy]].

Briggs' first table contained the [[common logarithm]]s of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of {{math|log<sub>10</sub>''x''}}  for any number {{mvar|x}} in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of {{mvar|x}} can be separated into an [[integer part]] and a [[fractional part]], known as the characteristic and [[mantissa (logarithm)|mantissa]]. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p.&nbsp;264</ref> The characteristic of {{math|10 \u00b7 {{mvar|x}}}} is one plus the characteristic of {{mvar|x}}, and their mantissas are the same.  Thus using a three-digit log table, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542 = \\log_{10}(1000 \\cdot 3.542) = 3 + \\log_{10}3.542 \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 \\, </math>\n\nGreater accuracy can be obtained by [[interpolation]]:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542  \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 + 0.2 (\\log_{10}3.55-\\log_{10}3.54)\\, </math>\n\nThe value of {{math| 10<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be determined by reverse look up in the same table, since the logarithm is a [[monotonic function]].\n\n===Computations===\nThe product and quotient of two positive numbers {{Mvar|c}} and ''{{Mvar|d}}'' were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product ''{{Mvar|cd}}'' or quotient {{Mvar|c/d}} came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:\n\n:<math> c d = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c} \\, 10^{\\ \\log_{10} d} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c + \\ \\log_{10} d} \\,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac c d = c d^{-1} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c - \\ \\log_{10} d}. \\,</math>\n\nFor manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as [[prosthaphaeresis]], which relies on [[trigonometric identities]].\n\nCalculations of powers and [[nth root|roots]] are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by\n:<math>c^d = \\left(10^{\\ \\log_{10} c}\\right)^d =  10^{d \\ \\log_{10} c} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt[d]{c} = c^\\frac{1}{d} = 10^{\\frac{1}{d} \\ \\log_{10} c}. \\,</math>\n\nTrigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\n===Slide rules===\nAnother critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, [[Gunter's rule]], was invented shortly after Napier's invention. [[William Oughtred]] enhanced it to create the slide rule\u2014a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the logarithm of {{mvar|x}}.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]\n\nFor example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\n{{Harvard citations\n |last1=Maor |year=2009 |nb=yes |loc=sections 1, 13}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic properties==\nA deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''.

A function is ''continuous'' if it does not \"jump\", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.\n\nThis property can be shown to hold for the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}. Because ''{{mvar|f}}'' takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number {{math|''y'' > 0}} lies between {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} and {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}} for suitable {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|y}}}} has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function ''f'' is [[monotonic function|strictly increasing]] (for {{math|''b'' > 1}}), or strictly decreasing (for {{math|0 < {{mvar|b}} < 1}}).<ref name=LangIV.2>{{Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2}}</ref>\n\nThe unique solution {{mvar|x}} is the logarithm of {{mvar|y}} to base {{mvar|b}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

Conversely, given a positive number {{mvar|y}}, the formula\n:<math>b^{\\log_b y} = y</math>\nsays that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back {{mvar|y}}. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or [[function composition|composing]]) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number. Therefore, the logarithm to base {{mvar|b}} is the ''[[inverse function]]'' of {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Stewart | first1=James | title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont|isbn=978-0-495-01169-9 | year=2007}}, section 1.6</ref>\n\nInverse functions are closely related to the original functions. Their [[graph of a function|graphs]] correspond to each other upon exchanging the {{mvar|x}}- and the {{mvar|y}}-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}}), as shown at the right: a point {{math|1=(''t'', ''u'' = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''t''</sup>)}} on the graph of ''f'' yields a point {{math|1=(''u'', ''t'' = log<sub>''b''</sub>''u'')}} on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} [[divergent sequence|diverges to infinity]] (gets bigger than any given number) if {{mvar|x}} grows to infinity, provided that {{mvar|b}} is greater than one. In that case, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}}  is an [[increasing function]]. For {{math|''b'' < 1}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} tends to minus infinity instead. When {{mvar|x}} approaches zero, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''x''}} goes to minus infinity for {{math|''b'' > 1}} (plus infinity for {{math|''b'' < 1}}, respectively).\n\n===Derivative and antiderivative===\n[[File:Logarithm derivative.svg|right|thumb|220px|The graph of the [[natural logarithm]] (green) and its tangent at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1.5}} (black)|alt=A graph of the logarithm function and a line touching it in one point.]]\nAnalytic properties of functions pass to their inverses.<ref name=LangIII.3 /> Thus, as {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}} is a continuous and [[differentiable function]], so is {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

The quick convergence for {{mvar|z}} close to 1 can be taken advantage of in the following way: given a low-accuracy approximation {{math|''y'' \u2248 ln(''z'')}} and putting\n:<math>A = \\frac z{\\exp(y)}, \\,</math>\nthe logarithm of {{mvar|z}} is:\n:<math>\\ln (z)=y+\\ln (A). \\,</math>\nThe better the initial approximation {{mvar|y}} is, the closer {{mvar|A}} is to 1, so its logarithm can be calculated efficiently. {{mvar|A}} can be calculated using the [[exponential function|exponential series]], which converges quickly provided {{mvar|y}} is not too large. Calculating the logarithm of larger {{mvar|z}} can be reduced to smaller values of {{mvar|z}} by writing {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' \u00b7 10<sup>''b''</sup>}}, so that {{math|ln(''z'') {{=}} ln(''a'') + {{mvar|b}} \u00b7 ln(10)}}.\n\nA closely related method can be used to compute the logarithm of integers.

The two numbers quickly converge to a common limit which is the value of {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}}. ''m'' is chosen such that\n\n:<math>x \\,2^m > 2^{p/2}.\\, </math>\n\nto ensure the required precision. A larger ''m'' makes the {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} calculation take more steps (the initial x and y are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants {{math|pi}} and {{math|ln(2)}} can be calculated with quickly converging series.\n\n===Feynman's algorithm===\nWhile at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] working on the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Richard Feynman]] developed a bit-processing algorithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the [[Connection Machine]]. The algorithm uses the fact that every real number <math> 1 < x < 2 </math> is representable as a product of distinct factors of the form <math> 1 + 2^{-k} </math>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product <math>P</math>: if <math>P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) < x</math>, then it changes <math>P</math> to <math> P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) </math>. It then increase <math>k</math> by one regardless. The algorithm stops when <math>k</math> is large enough to give the desired accuracy. Because <math>\\log(x)</math> is the sum of the terms of the form <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> corresponding to those <math>k</math> for which the factor <math>1 + 2^{-k}</math> was included in the product <math>P</math>, <math>\\log(x)</math> may be computed by simple addition, using a table of <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> for all <math>k</math>.

In [[equal temperament]], the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or [[pitch (music)|pitch]], of the individual tones. For example, the [[a (musical note)|note ''A'']] has a frequency of 440 [[Hertz|Hz]] and [[B\u266d (musical note)|''B-flat'']] has a frequency of 466&nbsp;Hz. The interval between ''A'' and ''B-flat'' is a [[semitone]], as is the one between ''B-flat'' and [[b (musical note)|''B'']] (frequency 493&nbsp;Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:\n:<math>\\frac{466}{440} \\approx \\frac{493}{466} \\approx 1.059 \\approx \\sqrt[12]2.</math>\nTherefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the {{math|base-2<sup>1/12</sup>}} logarithm of the [[frequency]] ratio, while the {{math|base-2<sup>1/1200</sup>}} logarithm of the frequency ratio expresses the interval in [[cent (music)|cents]], hundredths of a semitone.

Dropping the range restrictions on the argument makes the relations \"argument of {{mvar|z}}\", and consequently the \"logarithm of {{mvar|z}}\", [[multi-valued function]]s.\n\n===Inverses of other exponential functions===\nExponentiation occurs in many areas of mathematics and its inverse function is often referred to as the logarithm. For example, the [[logarithm of a matrix]] is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the [[matrix exponential]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Higham|first1=Nicholas|author1-link=Nicholas Higham|title=Functions of Matrices.

In the scientific literature on [[ecology]], the term is used more generally to indicate the time frame for any seasonal biological phenomena, including the dates of last appearance (e.g., the seasonal phenology of a species may be from April through September).\n\nBecause many such phenomena are very sensitive to small variations in [[climate]], especially to temperature, phenological records can be a useful [[proxy (climate)|proxy]] for temperature in [[historical climatology]], especially in the study of [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]] and [[global warming]].

Many cultures have traditional phenological proverbs and sayings which indicate a time for action: \"When the sloe tree is white as a sheet, sow your barley whether it be dry or wet\" or attempt to forecast future climate: \"If oak's before ash, you're in for a splash. If ash before oak, you're in for a soak\". But the indications can be pretty unreliable, as an alternative version of the rhyme shows: \"If the oak is out before the [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], 'Twill be a summer of wet and splash; If the ash is out before the oak, 'Twill be a summer of fire and smoke.\" Theoretically, though, these are not mutually exclusive, as one forecasts immediate conditions and one forecasts future conditions.\n\nThe [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) is in possession of a collection of millions of bird arrival and departure date records for over 870 species across North America, dating between 1880 and 1970. This program, originally started by [[Wells W. Cooke]], involved over 3,000 observers including many notable naturalists of the time. The program ran for 90 years and came to a close in 1970 when other programs starting up at PWRC took precedence. The program was again started in 2009 to digitize the collection of records and now with the help of citizens worldwide, each record is being transcribed into a database which will be publicly accessible for use.\n\nThe English naturalists [[Gilbert White]] and [[William Markwick]] reported the seasonal events of more than 400 plant and animal species, Gilbert White in [[Selborne]], Hampshire and William Markwick in [[Battle, Sussex]] over a 25-year period between 1768 and 1793. The data, reported in White's ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''<ref name=white>White, G (1789) [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]</ref> are reported as the earliest and latest dates for each event over 25 years; so annual changes cannot therefore be determined.\n\nIn Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Such historical records may, in principle, be capable of providing estimates of climate at dates before instrumental records became available. For example, records of the harvest dates of the [[pinot noir]] [[grape]] in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] have been used in an attempt to reconstruct spring\u2013summer temperatures from 1370 to 2003;<ref name=Chuine>{{cite journal | last1 = Chuine | first1 = I. | last2 = Yiou | first2 = P. | last3 = Viovy | first3 = N. | last4 = Seguin | first4 = B. | last5 = Daux | first5 = V. | last6 = Le Roy | first6 = Ladurie | year = 2004 | title = Grape ripening as a past climate indicator | url = http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fe/pdf/2004_Nature_432_289_290.pdf | journal = Nature | volume = 432 | issue = 7015 | pages = 289\u2013290 | doi = 10.1038/432289a | pmid = 15549085 | bibcode = 2004Natur.432..289C | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144441/http://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fe/pdf/2004_Nature_432_289_290.pdf | archivedate = 2011-09-28 }}</ref><ref name=Keenan2007>{{cite journal | last1 = Keenan | first1 = D.J. | year = 2007 | title = Grape harvest dates are poor indicators of summer warmth | url = http://www.informath.org/pubs/TAC06a.pdf | journal = Theoretical and Applied Climatology | volume = 87 | issue = 1\u20134| pages = 255\u2013256 | doi = 10.1007/s00704-006-0197-9 |bibcode = 2007ThApC..87..255K }}</ref> the reconstructed values during 1787\u20132000 have a correlation with Paris instrumental data of about 0.75.\n===Modern===\n{{anchor|Modern records}}\n====Great Britain====\n{{anchor|Phenological observations in Great Britain}}\n[[Robert Marsham]], the founding father of modern phenological recording, was a wealthy landowner who kept systematic records of \"Indications of spring\" on his estate at [[Stratton Strawless]], [[Norfolk]], from 1736. These took the form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Generations of Marsham's family maintained consistent records of the same events or \"phenophases\" over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years. Between 1850 and 1950 a long-term trend of gradual climate warming is observable, and during this same period the Marsham record of oak-leafing dates tended to become earlier.<ref name=\"Sparks & Carey\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sparks | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Carey | first2 = P.D. | year = 1995 | title = The responses of species to climate over two centuries: an analysis of the Marsham phenological record, 1736-1947 | url = | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 321\u2013329 | doi = 10.2307/2261570 | jstor = 2261570 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 1960 the rate of warming accelerated, and this is mirrored by increasing earliness of oak leafing, recorded in the data collected by Jean Combes in Surrey. Over the past 250 years, the first leafing date of oak appears to have advanced by about 8 days, corresponding to overall warming on the order of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in the same period.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century the recording of the appearance and development of plants and animals became a national pastime, and between 1891 and 1948 the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] (RMS) organised a programme of phenological recording across the British Isles. Up to 600 observers submitted returns in some years, with numbers averaging a few hundred.

These methods complement the traditional phenological methods which recorded the first occurrences of individual species and phenophases.\n\nThe most successful of these approaches is based on tracking the temporal change of a Vegetation Index (like [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]](NDVI)). NDVI makes use of the vegetation's typical low reflection in the red (red energy is mostly absorbed by growing plants for Photosynthesis) and strong reflection in the Near [[Infrared]] (Infrared energy is mostly reflected by plants due to their cellular structure). Due to its robustness and simplicity, NDVI has become one of the most popular remote sensing based products. Typically, a vegetation index is constructed in such a way that the attenuated reflected sunlight energy (1% to 30% of incident sunlight) is amplified by ratio-ing red and NIR following this equation:\n: <math>\\mathrm{NDVI}={\\mathrm{NIR}-\\mathrm{red} \\over \\mathrm{NIR}+\\mathrm{red}}</math>\n\nThe evolution of the vegetation index through time, depicted by the graph above, exhibits a strong [[correlation]] with the typical green vegetation growth stages (emergence, vigor/growth, maturity, and harvest/senescence). These temporal curves are analyzed to extract useful parameters about the vegetation growing season (start of season, end of season, length of [[growing season]], etc.). Other growing season [[parameter]]s could potentially be extracted, and global maps of any of these growing season parameters could then be constructed and used in all sorts of [[climate change|climatic change]] studies.\n\nA noteworthy example of the use of [[remote sensing]] based phenology is the work of Ranga Myneni<ref>[http://cybele.bu.edu/people/rmyneni.html Welcome to the Climate and Vegetation Research Group, Boston University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from [[Boston University]].

This is mainly due to the limitation of current space-based remote sensing, especially the spatial resolution, and the nature of vegetation index.

For example, if a plant species blooms its flowers earlier than previous years, but the pollinators that feed on and pollinate this flower does not arrive or grow earlier as well, then a phenological mismatch has occurred. This results in the plant population declining as there are no pollinators to aid in their reproductive success<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonsamo|first=Alemu|last2=Chen|first2=Jing M.|last3=Wu|first3=Chaoyang|date=2013-07-19|title=Citizen Science: linking the recent rapid advances of plant flowering in Canada with climate variability|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02239|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1038/srep02239|issn=2045-2322}}</ref>. Another example includes the interaction between plant species, where the presence of one specie aids in the pollination of another through attraction of pollinators. However, if these plant species develop at mismatched times, this interaction will be negatively affected and therefore the plant species that relies on the other will be harmed.  \n\nPhenological mismatches means the loss of many biological interactions and therefore [[Ecosystem function|ecosystem functions]] are also at risk of being negatively effects or lost all together. Phenological mismatches his will effect species and ecosystems [[Food web|food webs]], [[reproduction]] success, resource availability, population and community dynamics in future generations, and therefore evolutionary process and overall [[biodiversity]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Citizen science]]\n* [[Nature Detectives]]\n* [[Season creep]]\n* [[Growing degree-day]]\n* [[Biological life cycle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s00484-011-0442-5|pmid = 21713602|title = From \"Periodical Observations\" to \"Anthochronology\" and \"Phenology\" \u2013 the scientific debate between Adolphe Quetelet and Charles Morren on the origin of the word \"Phenology\"|journal = International Journal of Biometeorology|volume = 55|issue = 6|pages = 753\u2013761|year = 2011|last1 = Demar\u00e9e|first1 = Gaston R|last2 = Rutishauser|first2 = This|url = https://boris.unibe.ch/9252/8/484_2011_Article_442.pdf |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bpp/ North American Bird Phenology Program] Citizen science program to digitize bird phenology records\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110104054300/http://neoninc.org/budburst/ Project Budburst] Citizen Science for Plant Phenology in the USA\n* [http://www.usanpn.org/ USA National Phenology Network] Citizen science and research network observations on phenology in the USA\n* [http://www.outdoors.org/conservation/mountainwatch/index.cfm AMC's Mountain Watch] Citizen science and phenology monitoring in the Appalachian mountains\n* [http://www.pep725.eu/ Pan European Phenology Project PEP725] European open access database with plant phenology data sets for science, research and education\n* [http://www.naturescalendar.org.uk/ UK Nature's Calendar] UK Phenology network\n* [https://www.dwd.de/phaenologie DWD phenology website] Information on the plant phenological network operated by Germany's national meteorological service (DWD)\n* [http://www.biology.ie/ Nature's Calendar Ireland] Spring Watch & Autumn Watch\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040504141637/http://www.naturewatch.ca/english/ Naturewatch: A Canadian Phenology project]\n* [http://www.springalive.net/ Spring Alive Project] Phenological survey on birds for children\n* [http://www.mojpopek.org/ Moj Popek] Citizen Science for Plant Phenology in Slovenia\n* [http://www.obs-saisons.fr/ Observatoire des Saisons] French Phenology network\n* [http://video.wpt.org/video/1883119733/ Phenology] Video produced by [[Wisconsin Public Television]]\n* [http://www.phenowatch.at/ Austrian phenological network run by ZAMG]\n* [https://www.growapp.today/main.html the GrowApp] Citizen science program that follows trees\n\n[[Category:Periodic phenomena]]\n[[Category:Chronobiology]]\n[[Category:Ecology]]\n[[Category:Climatology]]\n[[Category:Branches of biology]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Phrenology|Phonology}}\n\n'''Phenology''' is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors (such as elevation). \n\nExamples include the date of emergence of leaves and flowers, the first flight of butterflies, the first appearance of [[bird migration|migratory]] birds, the date of leaf colouring and fall in deciduous trees, the dates of egg-laying of birds and amphibia, or the timing of the developmental cycles of [[temperate]]-zone [[honey bee]] colonies.

Many cultures have traditional phenological proverbs and sayings which indicate a time for action: \"When the sloe tree is white as a sheet, sow your barley whether it be dry or wet\" or attempt to forecast future climate: \"If oak's before ash, you're in for a splash. If ash before oak, you're in for a soak\". But the indications can be pretty unreliable, as an alternative version of the rhyme shows: \"If the oak is out before the [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], 'Twill be a summer of wet and splash; If the ash is out before the oak, 'Twill be a summer of fire and smoke.\" Theoretically, though, these are not mutually exclusive, as one forecasts immediate conditions and one forecasts future conditions.\n\nThe [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) is in possession of a collection of millions of bird arrival and departure date records for over 870 species across North America, dating between 1880 and 1970. This program, originally started by [[Wells W. Cooke]], involved over 3,000 observers including many notable naturalists of the time. The program ran for 90 years and came to a close in 1970 when other programs starting up at PWRC took precedence. The program was again started in 2009 to digitize the collection of records and now with the help of citizens worldwide, each record is being transcribed into a database which will be publicly accessible for use.\n\nThe English naturalists [[Gilbert White]] and [[William Markwick]] reported the seasonal events of more than 400 plant and animal species, Gilbert White in [[Selborne]], Hampshire and William Markwick in [[Battle, Sussex]] over a 25-year period between 1768 and 1793. The data, reported in White's ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''<ref name=white>White, G (1789) [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]</ref> are reported as the earliest and latest dates for each event over 25 years; so annual changes cannot therefore be determined.\n\nIn Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Such historical records may, in principle, be capable of providing estimates of climate at dates before instrumental records became available.

These took the form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Generations of Marsham's family maintained consistent records of the same events or \"phenophases\" over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years.

Up to 600 observers submitted returns in some years, with numbers averaging a few hundred. During this period 11 main plant phenophases were consistently recorded over the 58 years from 1891\u20131948, and a further 14 phenophases were recorded for the 20 years between 1929 and 1948.

These methods complement the traditional phenological methods which recorded the first occurrences of individual species and phenophases.\n\nThe most successful of these approaches is based on tracking the temporal change of a Vegetation Index (like [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]](NDVI)). NDVI makes use of the vegetation's typical low reflection in the red (red energy is mostly absorbed by growing plants for Photosynthesis) and strong reflection in the Near [[Infrared]] (Infrared energy is mostly reflected by plants due to their cellular structure). Due to its robustness and simplicity, NDVI has become one of the most popular remote sensing based products. Typically, a vegetation index is constructed in such a way that the attenuated reflected sunlight energy (1% to 30% of incident sunlight) is amplified by ratio-ing red and NIR following this equation:\n: <math>\\mathrm{NDVI}={\\mathrm{NIR}-\\mathrm{red} \\over \\mathrm{NIR}+\\mathrm{red}}</math>\n\nThe evolution of the vegetation index through time, depicted by the graph above, exhibits a strong [[correlation]] with the typical green vegetation growth stages (emergence, vigor/growth, maturity, and harvest/senescence). These temporal curves are analyzed to extract useful parameters about the vegetation growing season (start of season, end of season, length of [[growing season]], etc.). Other growing season [[parameter]]s could potentially be extracted, and global maps of any of these growing season parameters could then be constructed and used in all sorts of [[climate change|climatic change]] studies.\n\nA noteworthy example of the use of [[remote sensing]] based phenology is the work of Ranga Myneni<ref>[http://cybele.bu.edu/people/rmyneni.html Welcome to the Climate and Vegetation Research Group, Boston University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from [[Boston University]].

This is mainly due to the limitation of current space-based remote sensing, especially the spatial resolution, and the nature of vegetation index.

For example, if a plant species blooms its flowers earlier than previous years, but the pollinators that feed on and pollinate this flower does not arrive or grow earlier as well, then a phenological mismatch has occurred. This results in the plant population declining as there are no pollinators to aid in their reproductive success<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonsamo|first=Alemu|last2=Chen|first2=Jing M.|last3=Wu|first3=Chaoyang|date=2013-07-19|title=Citizen Science: linking the recent rapid advances of plant flowering in Canada with climate variability|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02239|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1038/srep02239|issn=2045-2322}}</ref>. Another example includes the interaction between plant species, where the presence of one specie aids in the pollination of another through attraction of pollinators. However, if these plant species develop at mismatched times, this interaction will be negatively affected and therefore the plant species that relies on the other will be harmed.  \n\nPhenological mismatches means the loss of many biological interactions and therefore [[Ecosystem function|ecosystem functions]] are also at risk of being negatively effects or lost all together.
