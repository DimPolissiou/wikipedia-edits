Sourvinou-Inwood, ''Tragedy and Athenian Religion'', Lexington, 2003. p.103. However, W. R. Connor, ''City Dionysia and Athenian Democracy''  1990 argues the Dionysia was created during the Kleisthenic reform.</ref> The first dramatic performances likely took place in the [[Agora]]  where it is recorded that the wooden bleachers set up for the plays (''ikria'')  collapsed.<ref>Schol. ad Ar.

It was perhaps both a retaining wall for the orchestra and peribolos for the sanctuary.

See Powers, 2014, p.13 ff for discussion of the competing views.</ref> terrace that would have been the first ''orchestra'' of the theatre. The excavations by [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] identified the foundations of this terrace as a section of polygonal masonry,<ref>Designated SM1 in the archaeological literature, see Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.6</ref> indicating an archaic date. It is probable there was an altar, or ''thymele'',  in the centre of the ''orchestra''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.9</ref> No formally constructed stone seating existed at this point, only ''ikria'' and the natural amphitheatre of the hill served as ''theatron''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.11-14. Recent excavation has revealed post-holes for ikria, see R. Frederiksen et al, ''The Architecture of the Ancient Greek Theatre'', 2015, pp.52-55.</ref>\n\nBesides the archaeological evidence, there is the literary testimonia of the contemporary plays from which there are clues as to the theatre\u2019s construction and [[scenography]]. For this earliest phase of the theatre there is the work of [[Aeschylus]], who flourished in the 480-460s. The dramatic action of the plays does point to the presence of a ''skene'' or background scenery of some description, the strongest evidence of which is from the ''[[Oresteia]]'' that requires a number of entrances and exits from a palace door.<ref>O. Taplin, ''The Stagecraft of Aeschylus'', Oxford, 1977, p.459</ref> Whether this was a temporary or permanent wooden structure or simply a tent remains unclear since there is no physical evidence for a ''skene'' building until the Periclean phase.<ref>C. Papastamati-von Moock, ''The Wooden Theatre of Dionysos Eleuthereus in Athens'', in R. Frederiksen et al, ''The Architecture of the Ancient Greek Theatre'', 2015.</ref> However, the hypothesis of a ''skene'' is not contradicted by the known archaeology of the site. The ''[[Oresteia]]'' also refers to a roof from which a watchman looks out, a step to the palace and an altar.<ref>O. Taplin, ''The Stagecraft of Aeschylus'', Oxford, 1977, Appendix B, for a description of the stage resources.</ref> It is sometimes argued that an ''[[ekkyklema]]'',  a wheeled trolly, was used for the revelation of the bodies by Clytemnestra at line 1372 in ''Agamemnon'' amongst other passages.  If so it was an innovation of Aeschylus' stagecraft. However, [[Oliver Taplin]] questions the seemingly inconsistent use of the device for the dramatic passages claimed for it, and doubts whether the mechanism existed in Aeschylus' lifetime.<ref>O. Taplin, ''The Stagecraft of Aeschylus'', Oxford, 1977, p.443</ref>\n\n==Periclean Theatre==\n\n[[Image:Cratere a volute con la liberazione di Andromeda, inv. 19.M325-1.6 - Marta -Mitomania (3).jpg|thumb|right|Apulian volute-krater, close to the [[Sisyphus Painter]], c. 400 BC.

Taplin, ''Pots and Plays'', Getty, 2007. p.181</ref> and is suggestive of the kind of stage props that might have been used.]]\n\nThe substantial changes to the theatre in the late fifth century are conventionally called [[Pericles|Periclean]] since they coincide with the completion of the [[Odeon of Pericles]] immediately adjacent and the wider Periclean building programme. However, there is no strong evidence to say the theatre\u2019s reconstruction was of the same group as the other works or from Pericles\u2019 lifetime. The new plan of the theatre consisted of a slight displacement of the performance area northward, a banking up of the auditorium, the addition of retaining walls to the west, east and north, a long hall south of the ''skene'' and abutting the Older Temple and a New Temple which was said to have contained a [[chryselephantine]] sculpture of Dionysus by [[Alkamenes]].<ref>Pausanias 1.20.3</ref>  The seating during this phase was probably still in the form of ''ikria''  but it may be the case that some stone seating had been installed. Inscribed blocks, displaced but preserved in the retaining walls, with fifth century [[epigraphy]] on them might indicate dedicated or numbered stone seats.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.20. See also O. A. W. Dilke, ''The Greek Theatre Cavea'', The Annual of the British School at Athens, Vol. 43 (1948), pp. 125-192.</ref> The use of [[breccia]] in the foundations of the west wall and the long hall gives a [[terminus ante quem]] of the early fifth century, and a likely date of the last half of that century when its use was becoming common. Also the last recorded statue of Alkamenes was 404 BC, again placing the works in the late 400s.<ref>The dating of the New Temple is rather more problematic than that. See Kenneth D. S. Lapatin, ''Chryselephantine Statuary in the Ancient Mediterranean World'', 2001, pp.98-105.</ref> [[Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge|Pickard-Cambridge]] argues that the reconstruction was piecemeal over the last half of the century into the period of [[Cleophon (politician)|Kleophon]].<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.17</ref>\n\nFrom the evidence of the plays there is a larger corpus to draw upon during this most vital period of Greek drama. [[Sophocles]],  [[Aristophanes]] and [[Euripides]] were all performed at the Theatre of Dionysus. From these we can deduce that stock sets may have been in use to meet the requirements of the plays such that the Periclean reconstruction included post-holes built into the terrace wall to provide sockets for movable scenery.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.69</ref> The ''skene'' itself was likely unchanged from the theatre\u2019s earlier phase, with a wooden structure of at most two floors and a roof.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.23</ref> It is also possible that the stage building would have had three doors, with two in the projecting side-wings or ''paraskenia''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.24</ref>  ''Mechane'' or ''geranos'' were used for the introduction of divine beings or flights through the air as in ''Medea'' or Aristophanes' ''Birds''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.68</ref>\n\nOne point of contention has been the existence or otherwise of the ''prothyron'' or columned portico on a ''skene'' that represents the interior spaces of temples or palaces.<ref>K. Rees, ''The Function of the \u03a0\u03a1\u039f\u03b8\u03a5\u03a1\u039f\u039d in the Production of Greek Plays''  Classical Philoogy, April 1915, Vol. X N.2, pp.117-138</ref> It is a supposition partly supported by the texts, but also from vase painting believed to be depictions of plays. Aeschylus ''Cho\u0113ph\u00f3roi'' 966 and [[Aristophanes]]' ''Wasps'' 800-4 both refer directly to a ''prothyron'', while the parodos-chant in [[Euripides]]\u2019 ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' makes indirect reference to one.<ref>''Ion'' lines 184-236</ref> The mourning [[Niobe]] loutrophoros in Naples<ref>Naples H.3246 inv.82267.

Webster, ''Illustrations of Greek Drama'', Phaidon, 1971, III.4,2.</ref> for example, both depict a ''prothyron''. Pickard-Cambridge questions if this was permanent structure since interior scenes were rare in tragedy.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.99</ref> The evidence from the plays for the use of an ''ekkyklema'' in this period is ambiguous; passages such as ''Acharnians'' 407 ff or ''Hippolytus'' 170-1 suggest but don't require the device. The argument for its use depends largely on reference to the ''ekkyklema'' in later lexographers and scholiasts.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.100 ff</ref>\n\n==Lycurgan Theatre==\n\n[[Image:Acropolis in February 2005 14.jpg|thumb|left|''Prohedria''<ref>The throne has an inscription from early third c. IG II<sup>2</sup> 1 923, see Richter, 1966, p.30</ref> from the Lycurgan theatre.]]\nLycurgus was a leading figure in Athenian politics in the mid- to late-fourth century prior to the [[Lamian War|Macedonian supremacy]], and controller of the state\u2019s finances. In his role as ''epistate'' of the Theatre of Dionysus he was also instrumental in transforming the theatre into the stone-built structure seen today. There is a question of how far up the hill the stone ''theatron'' of this phase went; either all the way up to the rock of the Akropolis (the ''kataome'') or only as far as the [[Peripatos (Akropolis)|peripatos]].<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.138</ref> Since the [[Choragic Monument of Thrasyllos]] of 320/319 BC required the rock face to be cut back such that it is likely that the ''epitheatron'' beyond the peripatos would have reached that point by then. However, a coin of the Hadrianic period<ref>Barclay V. Head, ''A Catalogue of the Greek Coins in the British Museum: Attica, Megaris, Aegina''  p.110; Plate XIX, 8. London, 1888.</ref> crudely suggests a division of the theatre into two sections, but only one ''diazoma'', or horizontal aisle, and not two if the ''epitheatron'' went past the peripatos.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.139</ref> The auditorium was divided by twelve narrow stairways into thirteen wedge-shaped blocks, ''kerkides'',  two additional staircases ran inside the two southern supporting walls. There is a slight slope to each step, the front edge is almost 10cms lower than the back. The seats were 33cms in depth and 33cms in height with a forward projecting lip, with seventy-eight rows in total. The two fronts rows, still partially preserved today, consist of pentalic stone chairs or thrones; these were the ''prohedria'' or seats of honour. Originally sixty-seven in number, the surviving ones each bear the name of the priest or official who occupied it, the inscriptions are all later than the fourth century, albeit with signs of erasure, and from the Hellenistic or Roman periods.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.141</ref> The central throne belonged to the priest of Dionysus, which is tentatively dated to the first century BC.<ref>Richter, 1966, pp.31-32, pls.150-151</ref> Towards the orchestra there is a barrier from the Roman era, then a drainage channel contemporary with the Lycurgan theatre.\n\nThe ''skene'' of this phase was built back-to-back with the earlier long hall or [[stoa]] the breccia foundations of which remain. It is evident that the new ''skene'' building consisted of a long chamber from which projected at either end northward two rectangular ''paraskenia''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.148</ref> Whether there was also a distinct ''proskenion'' in the Lycurgan theatre is a subject of controversy, despite literary testimonia from the period there is no firm agreement where or of what form this took.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.156 ff</ref> This era is that of the new comedy of [[Menander]] and late tragedy of which it is sometimes supposed that the chorus disappeared from productions. It is further hypothesised that the decline in the use of the orchestra would imply, or permit, a raised stage where all the action would take place.<ref>From Aristotle ''Poetics''  xviii, 1456, a 25-30. See Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.161 ff</ref>\n\n==Hellenistic Theatre==\n\n[[File:Reconstruction of the Theatre of Dionysus, Athens.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ernst Robert Fiechter|Fiechter]]'s reconstruction of the Lycurgan theatre.<ref>from E. R. Fiechter, ''Die baugeschichtliche entwicklung des antiken theaters; eine studie'', Munchen, 1914. pl.63.</ref>]]\nAmongst the innovations of the Hellenistic period was the creation of a permanent stone ''proskenion'' and the addition of two flanking ''paraskenia'' in front. The date of this construction is not secure, it belongs to some point between the third and first centuries BC.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.175ff</ref> The ''proskenion'' was fronted with fourteen columns. Immediately above was the ''logeion'',  a roof to the ''proskenion'',  which perhaps functioned as a high stage. On this second storey and set back from the ''logeion'' is conjectured to be the ''episkenion'' whose facade was punctured with several ''thyromata'' or apertures where the ''pinakes'' or painted scenery would have been displayed. The date of this change devolves onto the question of the date at which the action of the drama transferred from the ''orchestra'' to the raised stage, and by analogy with other Greek theatres of the period and the direction of influence between Athens and the other cities. [[Wilamowitz]] argues<ref>G\u00f6ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1906, p.614</ref> that Dithyrambic contest ended with the [[choregia]] in 315,<ref>Lara O\u2019Sullivan, ''The Regime of Demetrius of Phalerum in Athens, 317\u2013307 BCE'', Brill, 2009, p.168. The ag\u00f4nothet\u00eas replaced the choregia.</ref> however, Pickard-Cambridge notes that the last recorded victory was in 100 AD.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.240</ref> Clearly, the chorus was in decline during this period, so would have been the use of the orchestra.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1927, p.79-80</ref> The theatre of [[Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus|Epidaurus]], [[Oropus|Oropos]] and [[Sikyon]] all have ramps up the ''logeion'',  their dates range from late fourth century to c. 250 BC. It remains an open question whether the existence of a ''logeion'' on these theatres implies a change in dramatic form at Athens.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.204</ref>\n\nAnother feature of the Hellenistic stage that might have been used in Athens was the ''[[periaktoi]]'', described by [[Vitruvius]]<ref>De Architectura, Book V, chapter 6, 8.</ref> and [[Julius Pollux|Pollux]],<ref>Onomasticon, 4.126-7, see R. C. Beacham, ''The Roman theatre and Its Audience'', Harvard, 1991, pp.176-178.</ref> these were revolving devices for rapidly changing scenery. Vitruvius places three doors on the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' with a ''periaktos'' are the extreme ends which could be deployed to indicate that the actor coming stage-left or -right was at a given location in the dramatic context.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946. pp.234-239</ref>\n\n==Roman Period to Present Day==\n\n[[Image:Acropolis in February 2005 13.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bema of Phaidros]], from the last phase of the Roman reconstruction.]]\nWith the conquest of Greece by [[Sulla]] and the partial [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87\u201386 BC)|destruction of Athens]] in 86 BC The Theatre of Dionysus entered into a long decline. King [[Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia]] is attributed with the reconstruction of the Odeion and the presence of an honorary inscription to him found embedded in a late wall of the ''skene'' suggest he may have had a hand in the reconstruction of the theatre,<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.247</ref> There appears to have been a general refurbishment during the time of [[Nero]]  whose name was erased from the [[entablature]] of an [[aedicule]] of the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' in antiquity.<ref>IG II<sup>2</sup> 3182, see Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.248</ref> The ''skene'' foundation was underpinned with limestone blocks in this period, the orchestra was reduced in size and refloored in varicoloured marble with a rhombus pattern in the centre. A marble barrier was erected in 61 AD<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.258</ref> or later, enclosing the ''orchestra'' up to the ''parodoi''. The object of this might have been to protect the audience during gladiatorial combats.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.258. See Philostratus VA 4.22</ref> The last phase of restoration was in the [[Hadrian]]ic or [[Antoninus Pius|Antonine]] era with the construction of the [[Bema of Phaidros]], an addition to the Neronian high pulpitum stage.\n\nAfter the late 5th century AD the theatre was abandoned: its orchestra became an enclosed courtyard for a Christian basilica (''aithrion'') which was built into the eastern parados, while its [[cavea]] served as a stone quarry. The basilica was subsequently destroyed and by the mid-eleventh century the [[City walls of Athens|Rizokastro wall]] crossed the bema and the parodos walls.<ref>Travlos, 1971, p.538</ref> Archaeological examination of the site began in earnest in the nineteenth century with the excavation of Rousopoulos in 1861. Subsequent major archaeological campaigns were D\u00f6rpfeld-Reisch,<ref>W.D\u00f6rpfeld, E.Reisch, Das griechische Theatre, Athen, 1896</ref>  Broneer and Travlos.\n\n==Audience==\nEvidence points to the enormous popularity of theatre in ancient Greek society.<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.21</ref> From competition for scarce seating, the expanding number of festivals and performances to theatre lovers touring the Rural Dionysia. It is also clear from fragments of audience reaction that have come down to us that the public were active participants in the dramatic performance, and that there was reciprocal communication between performers and spectators. It is possible, for example, that laws were enacted in the late fifth century to curtail comic outspokenness such was the offence taken by some of the views expressed on the stage.<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.44.</ref> One anecdote that illustrates the fraught nature of this highly partisan audience reaction is that recorded by Plutarch who writes that in 468 BC when Sophocles was competing against Aeschylus there was so much clamour Kimon had to march his generals into the theatre to replace the judges and secure Sophocles\u2019 victory.<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.46</ref> While ancient drama undoubtedly excited passion in contemporary spectators there remains the question of to what degree did they value or appreciate the work before them? <ref>Martin Revermann, ''The Competence of Theatre Audiences in Fifth- and Fourth-Century Athens'', The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 126 (2006), pp. 99-124</ref> Aristotle's ''Poetics''<ref>1451b23-6</ref> remarks \u201c[h]ence there is no need to adhere at all costs to the traditional stories, around which tragedies are constructed. For to try to do this would be ridiculous, since even the well-known materials well-known only to a few, but nevertheless delights all.\u201d This raises the question of how uniform the response to Greek drama was, and whether communicative comprehension and audience competence can be taken for granted.\n\nWhile the plays of the time are addressed to the adult male citizen class of the city it is apparent that metics, foreigners and slaves were also in attendance,<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.119</ref> the cost of tickets was underwritten by the [[Theoric Fund]].<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1988, pp.266-268. The history of the ''theorikon'' is not clear, Pericles might have instituted it but was certainly established by the time of Demosthenes.</ref> Much more controversial is whether women were also present. All arguments on the subject are ''[[Argument from silence|ex silentio]]'' since there is no direct evidence that women attended the Theatre of Dionysus. Jeffrey Henderson argues that since women participated in other rites and festivals they could certainly have attended the theatre.<ref>J. Henderson, ''Women and the Athenian Dramatic Festivals'', Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 121 (1991), pp. 133- 147</ref> In contrast, Simon Goldhill maintains that the City Dionysia was a socio-political event similar to the courts or the assembly which women were excluded from.<ref>Simon Goldhill, ''Representing Democracy: Women at the Great Dionysia'' in ''Ritual, Finance, Politics: Athenian Democratic Accounts Presented to David Lewis'', R. Osborne, S. Hornblower (eds), Oxford, 1994.</ref> No definite answer to the problem has been put forward.<ref>Powers, 2014, p.29 ff summarises the competing views.</ref>\n\n==Acoustics==\n\nDue to the poor state of its preservation the acoustics of the Theatre of Dionysus cannot be reconstructed. However, by analogy with other, similar Greek amphitheatres some idea of the sound quality of the ancient theatre can be gleaned. Long renowned for their excellent acoustics, it is only recently that scientific analysis of this has taken place. The ERATO project in 2003-2006,<ref>Jens Holger Rindel, Martin Lisa Gade, ''The Erato Project and Its Contri\u0307buti\u0307on to Our Understandi\u0307ng of the Acousti\u0307cs of Anci\u0307ent Greek and Roman Theatres'',  2006</ref> Gade and Angelakis in 2006,<ref>A.Gade, K.Angelakis, Acoustics of ancient Greek and Roman theatres in use today, The Journal of Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 20, n.5, 2006, 3148-3156</ref> Psarras et al. in 2013<ref>S. Psarras ''et al'', ''Measurements and Analysis of the Epidaurus Ancient Theatre Acoustics'', Acta Acustica United With Acustica, Vol. 99 (2013) 30\u201339</ref> used omnidirectional source-receivers to make measured maps of strength, reverberation and clarity. The most recent study, Hak et al 2016,<ref>C. Hak ''et al'', ''Project Ancient Acoustics Part 2 of 4: large-scale acoustical measurements in the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and the theatres of Epidaurus and Argos'', ICSV23, Athens (Greece), 10\u201314 July 2016</ref> used a large number of S-R to take the most detailed mapping yet. Their findings were that the speech clarity was best in the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and that there is a greater degree of reverberation at Epidaurus due to reflection from the opposing seats.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Theatre of ancient Greece]]\n*[[List of ancient Greek playwrights]]\n*[[List of ancient Greek theatres]]\n*[[Ancient Greek comedy]]\n*[[Greek tragedy]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{commons category|Theatre of Dionysus}}\n*Arnott, Peter D.

The excavations by [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] identified the foundations of this terrace as a section of polygonal masonry,<ref>Designated SM1 in the archaeological literature, see Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.6</ref> indicating an archaic date. It is probable there was an altar, or ''thymele'',  in the centre of the ''orchestra''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.9</ref> No formally constructed stone seating existed at this point, only ''ikria'' and the natural amphitheatre of the hill served as ''theatron''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.11-14. Recent excavation has revealed post-holes for ikria, see R. Frederiksen et al, ''The Architecture of the Ancient Greek Theatre'', 2015, pp.52-55.</ref>\n\nBesides the archaeological evidence, there is the literary testimonia of the contemporary plays from which there are clues as to the theatre\u2019s construction and [[scenography]]. For this earliest phase of the theatre there is the work of [[Aeschylus]], who flourished in the 480-460s. The dramatic action of the plays does point to the presence of a ''skene'' or background scenery of some description, the strongest evidence of which is from the ''[[Oresteia]]'' that requires a number of entrances and exits from a palace door.<ref>O. Taplin, ''The Stagecraft of Aeschylus'', Oxford, 1977, p.459</ref> Whether this was a temporary or permanent wooden structure or simply a tent remains unclear since there is no physical evidence for a ''skene'' building until the Periclean phase.<ref>C. Papastamati-von Moock, ''The Wooden Theatre of Dionysos Eleuthereus in Athens'', in R. Frederiksen et al, ''The Architecture of the Ancient Greek Theatre'', 2015.</ref> However, the hypothesis of a ''skene'' is not contradicted by the known archaeology of the site. The ''[[Oresteia]]'' also refers to a roof from which a watchman looks out, a step to the palace and an altar.<ref>O. Taplin, ''The Stagecraft of Aeschylus'', Oxford, 1977, Appendix B, for a description of the stage resources.</ref> It is sometimes argued that an ''[[ekkyklema]]'',  a wheeled trolly, was used for the revelation of the bodies by Clytemnestra at line 1372 in ''Agamemnon'' amongst other passages.  If so it was an innovation of Aeschylus' stagecraft. However, [[Oliver Taplin]] questions the seemingly inconsistent use of the device for the dramatic passages claimed for it, and doubts whether the mechanism existed in Aeschylus' lifetime.<ref>O. Taplin, ''The Stagecraft of Aeschylus'', Oxford, 1977, p.443</ref>\n\n==Periclean Theatre==\n\n[[Image:Cratere a volute con la liberazione di Andromeda, inv. 19.M325-1.6 - Marta -Mitomania (3).jpg|thumb|right|Apulian volute-krater, close to the [[Sisyphus Painter]], c. 400 BC.

Taplin, ''Pots and Plays'', Getty, 2007. p.181</ref> and is suggestive of the kind of stage props that might have been used.]]\n\nThe substantial changes to the theatre in the late fifth century are conventionally called [[Pericles|Periclean]] since they coincide with the completion of the [[Odeon of Pericles]] immediately adjacent and the wider Periclean building programme. However, there is no strong evidence to say the theatre\u2019s reconstruction was of the same group as the other works or from Pericles\u2019 lifetime. The new plan of the theatre consisted of a slight displacement of the performance area northward, a banking up of the auditorium, the addition of retaining walls to the west, east and north, a long hall south of the ''skene'' and abutting the Older Temple and a New Temple which was said to have contained a [[chryselephantine]] sculpture of Dionysus by [[Alkamenes]].<ref>Pausanias 1.20.3</ref>  The seating during this phase was probably still in the form of ''ikria''  but it may be the case that some stone seating had been installed. Inscribed blocks, displaced but preserved in the retaining walls, with fifth century [[epigraphy]] on them might indicate dedicated or numbered stone seats.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.20. See also O. A. W. Dilke, ''The Greek Theatre Cavea'', The Annual of the British School at Athens, Vol. 43 (1948), pp. 125-192.</ref> The use of [[breccia]] in the foundations of the west wall and the long hall gives a [[terminus ante quem]] of the early fifth century, and a likely date of the last half of that century when its use was becoming common. Also the last recorded statue of Alkamenes was 404 BC, again placing the works in the late 400s.<ref>The dating of the New Temple is rather more problematic than that. See Kenneth D. S. Lapatin, ''Chryselephantine Statuary in the Ancient Mediterranean World'', 2001, pp.98-105.</ref> [[Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge|Pickard-Cambridge]] argues that the reconstruction was piecemeal over the last half of the century into the period of [[Cleophon (politician)|Kleophon]].<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.17</ref>\n\nFrom the evidence of the plays there is a larger corpus to draw upon during this most vital period of Greek drama. [[Sophocles]],  [[Aristophanes]] and [[Euripides]] were all performed at the Theatre of Dionysus. From these we can deduce that stock sets may have been in use to meet the requirements of the plays such that the Periclean reconstruction included post-holes built into the terrace wall to provide sockets for movable scenery.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.69</ref> The ''skene'' itself was likely unchanged from the theatre\u2019s earlier phase, with a wooden structure of at most two floors and a roof.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.23</ref> It is also possible that the stage building would have had three doors, with two in the projecting side-wings or ''paraskenia''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.24</ref>  ''Mechane'' or ''geranos'' were used for the introduction of divine beings or flights through the air as in ''Medea'' or Aristophanes' ''Birds''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.68</ref>\n\nOne point of contention has been the existence or otherwise of the ''prothyron'' or columned portico on a ''skene'' that represents the interior spaces of temples or palaces.<ref>K. Rees, ''The Function of the \u03a0\u03a1\u039f\u03b8\u03a5\u03a1\u039f\u039d in the Production of Greek Plays''  Classical Philoogy, April 1915, Vol. X N.2, pp.117-138</ref>It is a supposition partly supported by the texts, but also from vase painting believed to be depictions of plays. Aeschylus ''Cho\u0113ph\u00f3roi'' 966 and [[Aristophanes]]' ''Wasps'' 800-4 both refer directly to a ''prothyron'', while the parodos-chant in [[Euripides]]\u2019 ''[[Ion (play)|Ion]]'' makes indirect reference to one.<ref>''Ion'' lines 184-236</ref> The mourning [[Niobe]] loutrophoros in Naples<ref>Naples H.3246 inv.82267.

Webster, ''Illustrations of Greek Drama'', Phaidon, 1971, III.4,2.</ref> for example, both depict a ''prothyron''. Pickard-Cambridge questions if this was permenant structure since interior scenes were rare in tragedy.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.99</ref> The evidence from the plays for the use of an ''ekkyklema'' in this period is ambiguous; passages such as ''Acharnians'' 407 ff or ''Hippolytus'' 170-1 suggest but don't require the device. The argument for its use depends largely on reference to the ''ekkyklema'' in later lexographers and scholiasts.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.100 ff</ref>\n\n==Lycurgan Theatre==\n\n[[Image:Acropolis in February 2005 14.jpg|thumb|left|''Prohedria''<ref>The throne has an inscription from early third c. IG II<sup>2</sup> 1 923, see Richter, 1966, p.30</ref> from the Lycurgan theatre.]]\nLycurgus was a leading figure in Athenian politics in the mid- to late-fourth century prior to the [[Lamian War|Macedonian supremacy]], and controller of the state\u2019s finances. In his role as ''epistate'' of the Theatre of Dionysus he was also instrumental in transforming the theatre into the stone-built structure seen today. There is a question of how far up the hill the stone ''theatron'' of this phase went; either all the way up to the rock of the Akropolis (the ''kataome'') or only as far as the [[Peripatos (Akropolis)|peripatos]].<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.138</ref> Since the [[Choragic Monument of Thrasyllos]] of 320/319 BC required the rock face to be cut back such that it is likely that the ''epitheatron'' beyond the peripatos would have reached that point by then. However, a coin of the Hadrianic period<ref>Barclay V. Head, ''A Catalogue of the Greek Coins in the British Museum: Attica, Megaris, Aegina''  p.110; Plate XIX, 8. London, 1888.</ref> crudely suggests a division of the theatre into two sections, but only one ''diazoma'', or horizontal aisle, and not two if the ''epitheatron'' went past the peripatos.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.139</ref> The auditorium was divided by twelve narrow stairways into thirteen wedge-shaped blocks, ''kerkides'',  two additional staircases ran inside the two southern supporting walls. There is a slight slope to each step, the front edge is almost 10cms lower than the back. The seats were 33cms in depth and 33cms in height with a forward projecting lip, with seventy-eight rows in total. The two fronts rows, still partially preserved today, consist of pentalic stone chairs or thrones; these were the ''prohedria'' or seats of honour. Originally sixty-seven in number, the surviving ones each bear the name of the priest or official who occupied it, the inscriptions are all later than the fourth century, albeit with signs of erasure, and from the Hellenistic or Roman periods.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.141</ref> The central throne belonged to the priest of Dionysus, which is tentatively dated to the first century BC.<ref>Richter, 1966, pp.31-32, pls.150-151</ref> Towards the orchestra there is a barrier from the Roman era, then a drainage channel contemporary with the Lycurgan theatre.\n\nThe ''skene'' of this phase was built back-to-back with the earlier long hall or [[stoa]] the breccia foundations of which remain. It is evident that the new ''skene'' building consisted of a long chamber from which projected at either end northward two rectangular ''paraskenia''.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.148</ref> Whether there was also a distinct ''proskenion'' in the Lycurgan theatre is a subject of controversy, despite literary testimonia from the period there is no firm agreement where or of what form this took.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.156 ff</ref> This era is that of the new comedy of [[Menander]] and late tragedy of which it is sometimes supposed that the chorus disappeared from productions. It is further hypothesised that the decline in the use of the orchestra would imply, or permit, a raised stage where all the action would take place.<ref>From Aristotle ''Poetics''  xviii, 1456, a 25-30. See Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.161 ff</ref>\n\n==Hellenistic Theatre==\n\n[[File:Reconstruction of the Theatre of Dionysus, Athens.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ernst Robert Fiechter|Fiechter]]\u2019s reconstruction of the Lycurgan theatre.<ref>from E. R. Fiechter, ''Die baugeschichtliche entwicklung des antiken theaters; eine studie'', Munchen, 1914. pl.63.</ref>]]\nAmongst the innovations of the Hellenistic period was the creation of a permanent stone ''proskenion'' and the addition of two flanking ''paraskenia'' in front. The date of this construction is not secure, it belongs to some point between the third and first centuries BC.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.175ff</ref> The ''proskenion'' was fronted with fourteen columns. Immediately above was the ''logeion'',  a roof to the ''proskenion'',  which perhaps functioned as a high stage. On this second storey and set back from the ''logeion'' is conjectured to be the ''episkenion'' whose facade was punctured with several ''thyromata'' or apertures where the ''pinakes'' or painted scenery would have been displayed. The date of this change devolves onto the question of the date at which the action of the drama transferred from the ''orchestra'' to the raised stage, and by analogy with other Greek theatres of the period and the direction of influence between Athens and the other cities. [[Wilamowitz]] argues<ref>G\u00f6ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1906, p.614</ref> that Dithyrambic contest ended with the [[choregia]] in 315,<ref>Lara O\u2019Sullivan, ''The Regime of Demetrius of Phalerum in Athens, 317\u2013307 BCE'', Brill, 2009, p.168. The ag\u00f4nothet\u00eas replaced the choregia.</ref> however, Pickard-Cambridge notes that the last recorded victory was in 100 AD.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.240</ref> Clearly, the chorus was in decline during this period, so would have been the use of the orchestra.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1927, p.79-80</ref> The theatre of [[Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus|Epidaurus]], [[Oropus|Oropos]] and [[Sikyon]] all have ramps up the ''logeion'',  their dates range from late fourth century to c. 250 BC. It remains an open question whether the existence of a ''logeion'' on these theatres implies a change in dramatic form at Athens.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.204</ref>\n\nAnother feature of the Hellenistic stage that might have been used in Athens was the ''[[periaktoi]]'', described by [[Vitruvius]]<ref>De Architectura, Book V, chapter 6, 8.</ref> and [[Julius Pollux|Pollux]],<ref>Onomasticon, 4.126-7, see R. C. Beacham, ''The Roman theatre and Its Audience'', Harvard, 1991, pp.176-178.</ref> these were revolving devices for rapidly changing scenery. Vitruvius places three doors on the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' with a ''periaktos'' are the extreme ends which could be deployed to indicate that the actor coming stage-left or -right was at a given location in the dramatic context.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946. pp.234-239</ref>\n\n==Roman Period to Present Day==\n\n[[Image:Acropolis in February 2005 13.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bema of Phaidros]], from the last phase of the Roman reconstruction.]]\nWith the conquest of Greece by [[Sulla]] and the partial [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87\u201386 BC)|destruction of Athens]] in 86 BC The Theatre of Dionysus entered into a long decline. King [[Ariobarzanes II of Cappadocia]] is attributed with the reconstruction of the Odeion and the presence of an honorary inscription to him found embedded in a late wall of the ''skene'' suggest he may have had a hand in the reconstruction of the theatre,<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.247</ref> There appears to have been a general refurbishment during the time of [[Nero]]  whose name was erased from the [[entablature]] of an [[aedicule]] of the ''[[scaenae frons]]'' in antiquity.<ref>IG II<sup>2</sup> 3182, see Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.248</ref> The ''skene'' foundation was underpinned with limestone blocks in this period, the orchestra was reduced in size and refloored in varicoloured marble with a rhombus pattern in the centre. A marble barrier was erected in 61 AD<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.258</ref> or later, enclosing the ''orchestra'' up to the ''parodoi''. The object of this might have been to protect the audience during gladiatorial combats.<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1946, p.258. See Philostratus VA 4.22</ref> The last phase of restoration was in the [[Hadrian|Hadrianic]] or [[Antoninus Pius|Antonine]] era with the construction of the [[Bema of Phaidros]], an addition to the Neronian high pulpitum stage. \n\nAfter the late 5th century AD the theatre was abandoned: its orchestra became an enclosed courtyard for a Christian basilica (''aithrion'') which was built into the eastern parados, while its [[cavea]] served as a stone quarry. The basilica was subsequently destroyed and by the mid-eleventh century the [[City walls of Athens|Rizokastro wall]] crossed the bema and the parodos walls.<ref>Travlos, 1971, p.538</ref> Archaeological examination of the site began in earnest in the nineteenth century with the excavation of Rousopoulos in 1861. Subsequent major archaeological campaigns were D\u00f6rpfeld-Reisch,<ref>W.D\u00f6rpfeld, E.Reisch, Das griechische Theatre, Athen, 1896</ref>  Broneer and Travlos.\n\n==Audience==\nEvidence points to the enormous popularity of theatre in ancient Greek society.<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.21</ref> From competition for scarce seating, the expanding number of festivals and performances to theatre lovers touring the Rural Dionysia. It is also clear from fragments of audience reaction that have come down to us that the public were active participants in the dramatic performance, and that there was reciprocal communication between performers and spectators. It is possible, for example, that laws were enacted in the late fifth century to curtail comic outspokenness such was the offence taken by some of the views expressed on the stage.<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.44.</ref> One anecdote that illustrates the fraught nature of this highly partisan audience reaction is that recorded by Plutarch who writes that in 468 BC when Sophocles was competing against Aeschylus there was so much clamour Kimon had to march his generals into the theatre to replace the judges and secure Sophocles\u2019 victory.<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.46</ref> While ancient drama undoubtedly excited passion in contemporary spectators there remains the question of to what degree did they value or appreciate the work before them? <ref>Martin Revermann, ''The Competence of Theatre Audiences in Fifth- and Fourth-Century Athens'', The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 126 (2006), pp. 99-124</ref> Aristotle's ''Poetics''<ref> 1451b23-6</ref> remarks \u201c[h]ence there is no need to adhere at all costs to the traditional stories, around which tragedies are constructed. For to try to do this would be ridiculous, since even the well-known materials well-known only to a few, but nevertheless delights all.\u201d This raises the question of how uniform the response to Greek drama was, and whether communicative comprehension and audience competence can be taken for granted.\n\nWhile the plays of the time are addressed to the adult male citizen class of the city it is apparent that metics, foreigners and slaves were also in attendance,<ref>Roselli, 2011, p.119</ref> the cost of tickets was underwritten by the [[Theoric Fund]].<ref>Pickard-Cambridge, 1988, pp.266-268. The history of the ''theorikon'' is not clear, Pericles might have instituted it but was certainly established by the time of Demosthenes.</ref> Much more controversial is whether women were also present. All arguments on the subject are ''[[Argument from silence|ex silentio]]'' since there is no direct evidence that women attended the Theatre of Dionysus. Jeffrey Henderson argues that since women participated in other rites and festivals they could certainly have attended the theatre.<ref>J. Henderson, ''Women and the Athenian Dramatic Festivals'', Transactions of the American Philological Association, Vol. 121 (1991), pp. 133- 147</ref> In contrast, Simon Goldhill maintains that the City Dionysia was a socio-political event similar to the courts or the assembly which women were excluded from.<ref>Simon Goldhill, ''Representing Democracy: Women at the Great Dionysia'' in ''Ritual, Finance, Politics: Athenian Democratic Accounts Presented to David Lewis'', R. Osborne, S. Hornblower (eds), Oxford, 1994.</ref> No definite answer to the problem has been put forward.<ref>Powers, 2014, p.29 ff summarises the competing views.</ref>\n\n==Acoustics==\n\nDue to the poor state of its preservation the acoustics of the Theatre of Dionysus cannot be reconstructed. However, by analogy with other, similar Greek amphitheatres some idea of the sound quality of the ancient theatre can be gleaned. Long renowned for their excellent acoustics, it is only recently that scientific analysis of this has taken place. The ERATO project in 2003-2006,<ref>Jens Holger Rindel, Martin Lisa Gade, ''The Erato Project and Its Contri\u0307buti\u0307on to Our Understandi\u0307ng of the Acousti\u0307cs of Anci\u0307ent Greek and Roman Theatres'',  2006</ref> Gade and Angelakis in 2006,<ref>A.Gade, K.Angelakis, Acoustics of ancient Greek and Roman theatres in use today, The Journal of Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 20, n.5, 2006, 3148-3156</ref> Psarras et al. in 2013<ref>S. Psarras ''et al'', ''Measurements and Analysis of the Epidaurus Ancient Theatre Acoustics'', Acta Acustica United With Acustica, Vol. 99 (2013) 30\u201339</ref> used omnidirectional source-receivers to make measured maps of strength, reverberation and clarity. The most recent study, Hak et al 2016,<ref>C.

Their findings were that the speech clarity was best in the Odeon of Herodes Atticus and that there is a greater degree of reverberation at Epidaurus due to reflection from the opposing seats.\n\n==See Also==\n\n*[[Theatre of ancient Greece]]\n\n*[[List of ancient Greek playwrights]]\n\n*[[List of ancient Greek theatres]]\n\n*[[Ancient Greek comedy]]\n\n*[[Greek tragedy]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{commonscat|Theatre of Dionysus}}\n*Arnott, Peter D.

Agricultural output is a component of the GDP of a nation.\n\n;[[Secondary sector of the economy|Industrial (or secondary) sector]]: ''[[Industry]]'' is the segment of economy concerned with production of goods (including [[fuel]]s and [[fertiliser]]s). Industrial output is a component of the GDP of a nation.\n\n;[[Tertiary sector of the economy|Service (or tertiary) sector]]: A ''[[service (economics)|service]]'' is the non-material equivalent of a [[good (accounting)|good]]. Service provision is defined as an economic activity that does not result in [[ownership]], and this is what differentiates it from providing physical goods. It is claimed {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} to be a process that creates benefits by facilitating either a change in [[customer]]s, a change in their physical [[ownership|possessions]], or a change in their intangible [[asset]]s. [[Service (economics)|Service]] output is a component of the GDP of a nation.

Agricultural output is a component of the GDP of a nation.\n\n;[[Secondary sector of the economy|Industrial (or secondary) sector]]: ''[[Industry]]'' is the segment of economy concerned with production of goods (including [[fuel]]s and [[fertiliser]]s).

Service provision is defined as an economic activity that does not result in [[ownership]], and this is what differentiates it from providing physical goods. It is claimed {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} to be a process that creates benefits by facilitating either a change in [[customer]]s, a change in their physical [[ownership|possessions]], or a change in their intangible [[asset]]s.
