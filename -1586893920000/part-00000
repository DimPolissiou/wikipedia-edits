In the game, players take on the role of students of Ravenwood School of Magical Arts in order to save the Spiral, the fictional galaxy in which the game is set, from various threats. Players battle enemies by casting spells using a variety of different weapons in a [[Turn-based game|turn-based combat system]] similar to [[collectible card game|collectible card games]].\n\n''[[Pirate101]]'', a sister MMORPG set in the same universe, was released in 2012.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Screenshot_of_Wizard101_gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of a player in The Commons, Wizard City.]]\nThe fictional universe of the Spiral is divided into many worlds, each of which has multiple areas. Players can unlock these temporarily with \"memberships,\" or unlock each area permanently with the game's premium currency \"''Crowns''.\" A wizard first starting the game must choose a school: Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, or Balance, each complete with their own set of unique spells and playstyles to come along with them.\n\nThe game is based around \"duels\": two teams made up of one to four players on each team or computer enemies who take turns casting spells. Spells can be cast using \"pips.\" A player gains one pip every round, and there is a chance that that pip will be a \"power pip,\" worth two regular pips for spells that are of the player's class. Spells can reduce the health of enemy creatures, increase the health of friends, add shields which reduce damage, add blades which modify the amount of damage, traps and [[Status effect|buffs]] which increase damage, and more. When a player reduces a computer enemy's health to zero, they are defeated; players with a health of zero can be healed by others on their team unless they \"flee\" the duel. When every player or computer on a team has zero health, the other team wins.\n\nAs the player progresses, more worlds become available. There are many main worlds, with a few smaller side ones that are optional. When wizards level up they gain new badge titles and automatic increases of their base statistics: health, mana, and energy. Most equipment also has level restrictions. Hobbies such as training pets, fishing, and gardening require energy; crafting instead requires various resources called \"reagents.\" Players can duel each other in the PvP arena and in some houses. As of November 2018, players can achieve a maximum of Level 130.<ref name=\"empyrea minimum\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/game/community/update-notes/november2017|title=Update Notes: It\u2019s Time to Boldly Explore Empyrea Part One!|date=November 2017|website=wizard101.com|publisher=Wizard101|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121071345/https://www.wizard101.com/game/community/update-notes/november2017|archivedate=21 January 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe game holds a rating of [[ESRB#Ratings|E10+]] from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] for [[Off-color humor|crude humor]] and mild [[Television rating system|fantasy violence]].<ref name=\"ESRB\" /><ref name=\"Shump\" /><ref name=\"Aihoshi\" />\n\n==Payment model==\nThe game offers a choice of either a subscription or a \"Free-to-Play\" option with [[microtransactions]]. Free-to-Play customers can purchase access to different areas of content using in-game currency called ''Crowns''. Such areas only need to be purchased once, but other actions in the game may be necessary before accessing them. Crowns also can be used to buy in-game exclusive items and access PvP tournaments. The fee for PvP tournaments vary, depending on whether the player has an existing Wizard101 membership. Crowns can be purchased by a game card or from the online store, or earned in small amounts through [[SuperRewards]].\n\nSubscriptions unlock all playable worlds, as well as allowing players to compete in ranked PvP matches and ranked Pet Derby races, enter tournaments for gold, store more items in their backpack, and gain the ability to post on the Wizard101 Message Board, along with other minor benefits for the duration of their membership.\n\nIn the European version of Wizard101, players are able to buy Subscriptions or Bundles with Crowns.\n\nAlso, certain areas and dungeons in ''Wizard101'' can be rented for a certain period of time such as the 6-hour rentals for Mount Olympus, Atlantea, and Tartarus in Aquila.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizard101central.com/wiki/Basic:Area_Pricing#axzz5K7BGLEff|title=Basic:Area Pricing - Wizard101 Wiki|website=www.wizard101central.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> Unlimited access to ranked PVP and Pet Derby matches can be rented on a per-match or daily basis.\n\n==Player interaction==\nDue to its young core audience, ''Wizard101'' restricts player interaction when compared to other games in the massively multiplayer online genre. There are three different types of chat: Menu Chat, Text Chat, and Open Chat. Menu Chat only allows the player to choose from a variety of predetermined phrases or sentences and prevents them from typing anything else in chat. In Text Chat, what a player types can be seen by every other wizard in the area either from a word bubble on top of the speaker's head or in the chat box. Private Chat is when a wizard wishes to speak in private, or \"message\" to another wizard. This appears on the screen in a white box to the left. The type of communication is restricted based on the age of the player. When typed, words that appear in white are words that everyone is able to view. Yellow words can only be seen by players who have their account set to \"Open Chat.\" Open Chat is obtained when a player identifies him or herself as 18 years or older by using their credit card. Red words are not allowed and can be seen by no one, not even the player themselves. If an adult chatter types red or yellow words, younger players will see ellipses (...) in place of the word. Also note that when players do not have Open Chat and say a Red word, players with Open Chat will not see that word either, and will see ellipses as well. Red words include not only profanity, but also words that would allow players to share real life information with each other including phone numbers, their ages, or real-world locations.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is the ability for players to fight each other, either in Practice dueling, which is free, or Ranked dueling, which must be purchased with Crowns or a membership. Unlike Practice matches, Ranked matches affect the player's ranking badge or title and grant the victor or victors Arena Tickets, yet another type of in-game premium currency. Duels between players are available only in a special [[player versus player]] arena designated for the purpose.<ref name=\"Athab\" /> The PvP arena can be found upon entry to Unicorn Way from the Commons in Wizard City, in some houses, and within Outer Yard in Avalon.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help|title=PVP - Wizard101 Free Online Game|website=www.wizard101.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122054934/https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help|archivedate=2014-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help4|title=PvP - Wizard101 Free Online Game|website=www.wizard101.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919044307/https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help4|archivedate=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\nRewards for combat or completing a quest are distributed automatically among a group, if players decide to stay together, so players need not argue over spoils.<ref name=\"RPGVault\" /> Players may trade a special type of spell card called a \"treasure card,\" which can be rearranged by clicking the golden card icon in the player's spellbook and then can be used in battle when the player discards cards and then clicks draw. These cards can only be used once, and can be used by any player from any school of Magic. A treasure card is typically stronger than the normal variant of the card. This spell will disappear from the player's spell deck once it is used. So far, the players are currently unable to trade items other than treasure cards between one another. (It is possible, however, to trade most items to one's other wizards on the same account, through the use of a shared bank).<ref name=\"Shump\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/trade-shopping|title=Shopping & Trade - Wizard101 Free Online Game|website=www.wizard101.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919045219/https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/trade-shopping|archivedate=2016-09-19}}</ref>\nThis is cuteeee\n\n==Online safety features==\n===Parental controls===\nWizard101 has various parental controls available that can be managed by a \"Master Account\" through the game's website. Once a setting is changed on the Master Account, it goes into effect on all connected accounts in a family of accounts.<ref name=\"Liang\" /> Parental control options include changing the chat settings to restrict the account from certain chat functions.\n\n===Player chat===\nIf a player is under 13 years of age, they aren't able to see text messages and are restricted to \"menu chat,\" a selection of phrases that can be used to interact with other players (must have made a debt/credit card purchase). However, with a master password, the parent can allow a child under 13 to use text chat. If the player is 13 years or older, they can send and see text messages, but word filters are in place to censor profanity, numbers, and personal information such as emails or names. Filtered words are marked red while typing, and will be sent as three dots once sent.<ref name=\"Davison\" /> If the player is 18 years or older and has verified their account via a credit card, text messages become much less restrictive, allowing them to see and type some words that are usually filtered, though some are still restricted. Filtered words that are usually restricted by 13+ text chat are visible to 18+ chat, and are marked yellow. They can be seen by those with 18+ chat, but not 13+ chat.<ref name=\"PR_Jul2\" />\n\n===Names===\nA player's name must be decided through pre-determined names made up of a first name and a one-part or a two-part surname. The official game forums are also heavily moderated and forum posts must be checked by a moderator before they are made visible.\n\n==Development history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Release date\n!

Company founder Elie Akilian hired [[J. Todd Coleman]], who served as creative director of the game from its launch through 2013.<ref name=\"PR_May22\" /> The game entered open [[beta version|beta]] on August 6, 2008, and it launched successfully on September 2, 2008. On August 25, 2010, it was announced that ''Wizard101'' would be released in foreign territories later that year.\n\n''Wizard101'' launched a European Beta version on December 15, 2010 and then released the game on February 15, 2011, in partnership with [[Gameforge]].<ref name=\"PR_Aug25\" /> This eventually included releases of the game in English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Polish, and Greek.\nIt was announced on August 17, 2011 that [[KingsIsle Entertainment]] and Taomee Holdings Limited had an agreement to launch ''Wizard101'' in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. ''Wizard101'' Taiwan officially launched on April 27, 2012, with the others to follow.\n\nThe Chinese version of Wizard101 had changes made to the game to conform with laws or appeal to the gaming culture in the country. Any references to skeletons or death had to be censored or removed. Quests required more monsters be defeated or more items collected. The game would suggest players to take breaks if playing for long periods of time and after two hours, or the player will enter a \"fatigued\" state, where rewards and stats are cut in half and after five hours, the \"unhealthy\" state would cut all rewards given completely.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1816849/what-wizard101-gave-break-china-exposed-bones-points-gold |title=What \"Wizard101\" Gave Up To Break Into China: Exposed Bones, Points, Gold |last=Ohannessian |first=Kevin |date=February 17, 2012 |website=Fast Company |access-date=August 6, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807022744/https://www.fastcompany.com/1816849/what-wizard101-gave-break-china-exposed-bones-points-gold |archivedate=August 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, KingsIsle Entertainment released ''[[Pirate101]]'', a sister game of Wizard101 also set in the 101 universe. It was described as \"comfortable and familiar\" to Wizard101, but featuring \"entirely new design, setting and gameplay mechanics\".<ref name=\"Pirate\" />\n\nIn July 2013, KingsIsle stopped updating its Chinese servers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In April 2015, ''Wizard101'' Taiwan announced that it would shut down on May 25, 2015, but the date was rescheduled to October 15, 2015.

When the update did appear September 8th, 2018, players were able to get two housing items and a wand (sparkler) to celebrate the 10 years.  In order to get one of the housing items, the players are forced to go on a short quest, in which the company, Kingsisle Entertainment thanks the supporters of its game through the use of well established characters in the game.  This was a limited time event, which ended shortly before November 2018.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 77.50%<ref name=\"Gamerankings\" />\n| rev1 = [[GameShark]]\n| rev1Score = B\n| rev2 = [[About.com]]\n| rev2Score = 4.5/5\n}}\nAccording to KingsIsle Entertainment's press releases, the game has experienced a steady growth in the number of accounts: 2 million in April 2009,<ref name=\"PR_April30\" /> 5 million in September 2009,<ref name=\"PR_September10\" /> 10 million players by June 2010,<ref name=\"PR_June22\" /> 15 million by January 2011, 20 million by July 2011,<ref name=\"PR_July14\" /> and 30 million by July 2013.

ambiance and graphic setting as well as the overall fun nature of ''Wizard101'' in the pro column, while the combat (in particular defeats) and the restrictive (at the time of the review) nature of

Players battle enemies by casting spells using a variety of different weapons in a [[Turn-based game|turn-based combat system]] similar to [[collectible card game|collectible card games]].\n\n''[[Pirate101]]'', a sister MMORPG set in the same universe, was released in 2012.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Screenshot_of_Wizard101_gameplay.jpg|thumb|right|Screenshot of a player in The Commons, Wizard City.]]\nThe fictional universe of the Spiral is divided into many worlds, each of which has multiple areas. Players can unlock these temporarily with \"memberships,\" or unlock each area permanently with the game's premium currency \"''Crowns''.\" A wizard first starting the game must choose a school: Fire, Ice, Storm, Myth, Life, Death, or Balance, each complete with their own set of unique spells and playstyles to come along with them.\n\nThe game is based around \"duels\": two teams made up of one to four players on each team or computer enemies who take turns casting spells. Spells can be cast using \"pips.\" A player gains one pip every round, and there is a chance that that pip will be a \"power pip,\" worth two regular pips for spells that are of the player's class. Spells can reduce the health of enemy creatures, increase the health of friends, add shields which reduce damage, add blades which modify the amount of damage, traps and [[Status effect|buffs]] which increase damage, and more. When a player reduces a computer enemy's health to zero, they are defeated; players with a health of zero can be healed by others on their team unless they \"flee\" the duel. When every player or computer on a team has zero health, the other team wins.\n\nAs the player progresses, more worlds become available. There are many main worlds, with a few smaller side ones that are optional. When wizards level up they gain new badge titles and automatic increases of their base statistics: health, mana, and energy. Most equipment also has level restrictions. Hobbies such as training pets, fishing, and gardening require energy; crafting instead requires various resources called \"reagents.\" Players can duel each other in the PvP arena and in some houses. As of November 2018, players can achieve a maximum of Level 130.<ref name=\"empyrea minimum\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/game/community/update-notes/november2017|title=Update Notes: It\u2019s Time to Boldly Explore Empyrea Part One!|date=November 2017|website=wizard101.com|publisher=Wizard101|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121071345/https://www.wizard101.com/game/community/update-notes/november2017|archivedate=21 January 2018|url-status=live|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe game holds a rating of [[ESRB#Ratings|E10+]] from the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] for [[Off-color humor|crude humor]] and mild [[Television rating system|fantasy violence]].<ref name=\"ESRB\" /><ref name=\"Shump\" /><ref name=\"Aihoshi\" />\n\n==Payment model==\nThe game offers a choice of either a subscription or a \"Free-to-Play\" option with [[microtransactions]]. Free-to-Play customers can purchase access to different areas of content using in-game currency called ''Crowns''. Such areas only need to be purchased once, but other actions in the game may be necessary before accessing them. Crowns also can be used to buy in-game exclusive items and access PvP tournaments. The fee for PvP tournaments vary, depending on whether the player has an existing Wizard101 membership. Crowns can be purchased by a game card or from the online store, or earned in small amounts through [[SuperRewards]].\n\nSubscriptions unlock all playable worlds, as well as allowing players to compete in ranked PvP matches and ranked Pet Derby races, enter tournaments for gold, store more items in their backpack, and gain the ability to post on the Wizard101 Message Board, along with other minor benefits for the duration of their membership.\n\nIn the European version of Wizard101, players are able to buy Subscriptions or Bundles with Crowns.\n\nAlso, certain areas and dungeons in ''Wizard101'' can be rented for a certain period of time such as the 6-hour rentals for Mount Olympus, Atlantea, and Tartarus in Aquila.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizard101central.com/wiki/Basic:Area_Pricing#axzz5K7BGLEff|title=Basic:Area Pricing - Wizard101 Wiki|website=www.wizard101central.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> Unlimited access to ranked PVP and Pet Derby matches can be rented on a per-match or daily basis.\n\n==Player interaction==\nDue to its young core audience, ''Wizard101'' restricts player interaction when compared to other games in the massively multiplayer online genre. There are three different types of chat: Menu Chat, Text Chat, and Open Chat. Menu Chat only allows the player to choose from a variety of predetermined phrases or sentences and prevents them from typing anything else in chat. In Text Chat, what a player types can be seen by every other wizard in the area either from a word bubble on top of the speaker's head or in the chat box. Private Chat is when a wizard wishes to speak in private, or \"message\" to another wizard. This appears on the screen in a white box to the left. The type of communication is restricted based on the age of the player. When typed, words that appear in white are words that everyone is able to view. Yellow words can only be seen by players who have their account set to \"Open Chat.\" Open Chat is obtained when a player identifies him or herself as 18 years or older by using their credit card. Red words are not allowed and can be seen by no one, not even the player themselves. If an adult chatter types red or yellow words, younger players will see ellipses (...) in place of the word. Also note that when players do not have Open Chat and say a Red word, players with Open Chat will not see that word either, and will see ellipses as well. Red words include not only profanity, but also words that would allow players to share real life information with each other including phone numbers, their ages, or real-world locations.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is the ability for players to fight each other, either in Practice dueling, which is free, or Ranked dueling, which must be purchased with Crowns or a membership. Unlike Practice matches, Ranked matches affect the player's ranking badge or title and grant the victor or victors Arena Tickets, yet another type of in-game premium currency. Duels between players are available only in a special [[player versus player]] arena designated for the purpose.<ref name=\"Athab\" /> The PvP arena can be found upon entry to Unicorn Way from the Commons in Wizard City, in some houses, and within Outer Yard in Avalon.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help|title=PVP - Wizard101 Free Online Game|website=www.wizard101.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122054934/https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help|archivedate=2014-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help4|title=PvP - Wizard101 Free Online Game|website=www.wizard101.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919044307/https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/pvp-help4|archivedate=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\nRewards for combat or completing a quest are distributed automatically among a group, if players decide to stay together, so players need not argue over spoils.<ref name=\"RPGVault\" /> Players may trade a special type of spell card called a \"treasure card,\" which can be rearranged by clicking the golden card icon in the player's spellbook and then can be used in battle when the player discards cards and then clicks draw. These cards can only be used once, and can be used by any player from any school of Magic. A treasure card is typically stronger than the normal variant of the card. This spell will disappear from the player's spell deck once it is used. So far, the players are currently unable to trade items other than treasure cards between one another. (It is possible, however, to trade most items to one's other wizards on the same account, through the use of a shared bank).<ref name=\"Shump\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/trade-shopping|title=Shopping & Trade - Wizard101 Free Online Game|website=www.wizard101.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919045219/https://www.wizard101.com/w101playersguide/trade-shopping|archivedate=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Online safety features==\n===Parental controls===\nWizard101 has various parental controls available that can be managed by a \"Master Account\" through the game's website. Once a setting is changed on the Master Account, it goes into effect on all connected accounts in a family of accounts.<ref name=\"Liang\" /> Parental control options include changing the chat settings to restrict the account from certain chat functions.\n\n===Player chat===\nIf a player is under 13 years of age, they aren't able to see text messages and are restricted to \"menu chat,\" a selection of phrases that can be used to interact with other players (must have made a debt/credit card purchase). However, with a master password, the parent can allow a child under 13 to use text chat. If the player is 13 years or older, they can send and see text messages, but word filters are in place to censor profanity, numbers, and personal information such as emails or names. Filtered words are marked red while typing, and will be sent as three dots once sent.<ref name=\"Davison\" /> If the player is 18 years or older and has verified their account via a credit card, text messages become much less restrictive, allowing them to see and type some words that are usually filtered, though some are still restricted. Filtered words that are usually restricted by 13+ text chat are visible to 18+ chat, and are marked yellow. They can be seen by those with 18+ chat, but not 13+ chat.<ref name=\"PR_Jul2\" />\n\n===Names===\nA player's name must be decided through pre-determined names made up of a first name and a one-part or a two-part surname. The official game forums are also heavily moderated and forum posts must be checked by a moderator before they are made visible.\n\n==Development history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Release date\n!

Company founder Elie Akilian hired [[J. Todd Coleman]], who served as creative director of the game from its launch through 2013.<ref name=\"PR_May22\" /> The game entered open [[beta version|beta]] on August 6, 2008, and it launched successfully on September 2, 2008. On August 25, 2010, it was announced that ''Wizard101'' would be released in foreign territories later that year.\n\n''Wizard101'' launched a European Beta version on December 15, 2010 and then released the game on February 15, 2011, in partnership with [[Gameforge]].<ref name=\"PR_Aug25\" /> This eventually included releases of the game in English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Polish, and Greek.\nIt was announced on August 17, 2011 that [[KingsIsle Entertainment]] and Taomee Holdings Limited had an agreement to launch ''Wizard101'' in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. ''Wizard101'' Taiwan officially launched on April 27, 2012, with the others to follow.\n\nThe Chinese version of Wizard101 had changes made to the game to conform with laws or appeal to the gaming culture in the country. Any references to skeletons or death had to be censored or removed. Quests required more monsters be defeated or more items collected. The game would suggest players to take breaks if playing for long periods of time and after two hours, or the player will enter a \"fatigued\" state, where rewards and stats are cut in half and after five hours, the \"unhealthy\" state would cut all rewards given completely.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1816849/what-wizard101-gave-break-china-exposed-bones-points-gold |title=What \"Wizard101\" Gave Up To Break Into China: Exposed Bones, Points, Gold |last=Ohannessian |first=Kevin |date=February 17, 2012 |website=Fast Company |access-date=August 6, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807022744/https://www.fastcompany.com/1816849/what-wizard101-gave-break-china-exposed-bones-points-gold |archivedate=August 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, KingsIsle Entertainment released ''[[Pirate101]]'', a sister game of Wizard101 also set in the 101 universe. It was described as \"comfortable and familiar\" to Wizard101, but featuring \"entirely new design, setting and gameplay mechanics\".<ref name=\"Pirate\" />\n\nIn July 2013, KingsIsle stopped updating its Chinese servers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In April 2015, ''Wizard101'' Taiwan announced that it would shut down on May 25, 2015, but the date was rescheduled to October 15, 2015. ''Wizard101'' China announced its shutdown date as November 1, 2015.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://md101.61.com.tw/news/?mode=detail&key=142889570384438|title=\u3010\u7cfb\u7d71\u516c\u544a\u3011\u9b54\u9b2a\u5b78\u5712101 \u7d50\u675f\u71df\u904b\u516c\u544a|language=Chinese|publisher=[[KingsIsle Entertainment]] and Taomee Entertainment|date=April 10, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}</ref>  On September 2018, to celebrate the game's 10 year anniversary, the game was given a separate re-release on the gaming platform, Steam. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/|title=Welcome to Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> Prior to the update, the graphics for Wizard City, the starting area of the game, were revamped along with the character models and animations.  When the update did appear September 8th, 2018, players were able to get two housing items and a wand (sparkler) to celebrate the 10 years.  In order to get one of the housing items, the players are forced to go on a short quest, in which the company, Kingsisle Entertainment thanks the supporters of its game through the use of well established characters in the game.  This was a limited time event, which ended shortly before November 2018.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 77.50%<ref name=\"Gamerankings\" />\n| rev1 = [[GameShark]]\n| rev1Score = B\n| rev2 = [[About.com]]\n| rev2Score = 4.5/5\n}}\nAccording to KingsIsle Entertainment's press releases, the game has experienced a steady growth in the number of accounts: 2 million in April 2009,<ref name=\"PR_April30\" /> 5 million in September 2009,<ref name=\"PR_September10\" /> 10 million players by June 2010,<ref name=\"PR_June22\" /> 15 million by January 2011, 20 million by July 2011,<ref name=\"PR_July14\" /> and 30 million by July 2013.

ambiance and graphic setting as well as the overall fun nature of ''Wizard101'' in the pro column, while the combat (in particular defeats) and the restrictive (at the time of the review) nature of

[[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], just 70 miles from Hazael's capital of Damascus, would almost certainly have come under its sway. This is borne out by the archaeological evidence: [[Israelites|Israelite]] remains do not appear until the 8th century BCE, and it appears that Dan was already in the orbit of Damascus even before Hazael became king in c. 843 BCE.{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=255\u2013257}}\n\nThe author of the inscription mentions conflict with the kings of Israel and the 'House of David'. The names of the two enemy kings are only partially legible. Biran and Naveh reconstructed them as [[Jehoram of Israel|Joram, son of Ahab]], King of Israel, and [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah, son of Joram]] of the House of David. Scholars seem to be evenly divided on these identifications.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|p=235}} It is dependent on a particular arrangement of the fragments, and not all scholars agree on this.\n\nIn the reconstructed text, the author tells how Israel had invaded his country in his father's day, and how the god [[Hadad]] then made him king and marched with him against Israel. The author then reports that he defeated seventy kings with thousands of chariots and horses. In the very last line there is a suggestion of a siege, possibly of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], the capital of the kings of Israel.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|p=235}} This reading is, however, disputed.{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=259\u2013308}}\n\n==Interpretation and disputes==\n\n===Configuration===\nThe stele was found in three fragments, called A, B1 and B2. There is widespread agreement that all three belong to the same inscription, and that B1 and B2 belong together. There is less agreement over the fit between A and the combined B1/B2: Biran and Naveh placed B1/B2 to the left of A (the photograph at the top of this article). A few scholars have disputed this, [[William Schniedewind]] proposing some minor adjustments to the same fit, [[Gershon Galil]] placing B above A rather than beside it, and George Athas fitting it well below.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\n===Dating ===\nArcheologists and [[epigrapher]]s{{which|date=September 2016}} put the earliest possible date at about 870 BCE, whilst the latest possible date is \"less clear\", although according to Lawrence J. Mykytiuk it could \"hardly have been much later than 750\".{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=115, 117fn.52}} However, some scholars (mainly associated with the [[Copenhagen School (theology)|Copenhagen school]]) \u2013 [[Niels Peter Lemche]], [[Thomas L. Thompson]], and F. H. Cryer \u2013 have proposed still later datings.<ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Hagelia\n| first1 = Hallvard\n| orig-year = 2004\n| editor1-last = Edzard\n| editor1-first = Lutz\n| editor2-last = Rets\u00f6\n| editor2-first = Jan\n| title = Current Issues in the Analysis of Semitic Grammar and Lexicon\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dqnsPDHOY1YC\n| series = Abhandlungen f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, ISSN 0567-4980, volume 56, issue 3\n| volume = 1\n| chapter = Philological Issues in the Tel Dan Inscription\n| location = Wiesbaden\n| publisher = Otto Harrassowitz Verlag\n| publication-date = 2005\n| pages = 233\u2013234\n| isbn = 9783447052689\n| access-date = 2016-09-21\n| quote = Except for some extremely late datings, most scholars date the text to the second half of the 9th century.

From this they concluded that the text was in fact a modern forgery.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bWavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA61 House of David], Lemche, 2004, p. 61.</ref> Most scholars have ignored or rejected these judgments because the artifacts were recovered during controlled excavations.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Authorship===\nThe language of the inscription is a dialect of [[Aramaic]].{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=115,117fn.52}} Most scholars identify [[Hazael]] of Damascus (c. 842 \u2013 806 BCE) as the author, although his name is not mentioned. Other proposals regarding the author have been made: George Athas argues for Hazael's son  [[Ben-Hadad III]], which would date the inscription to around 796 BCE, and J-W Wesselius has argued for [[Jehu]] of Israel (reigned c. 845 \u2013 818 BCE).\n\n===\"House of David\"===\n{{See also|Davidic line}}\n\t\nSince 1993\u20131994, when the first fragment was discovered and published, the Tel Dan stele has been the object of great interest and debate among epigraphers and [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]] along the whole range of views from those who find little of historical value in the biblical version of Israel's ancient past to those who are unconcerned about the biblical version, to those who wish to defend it.\n\nIts significance for the biblical version of Israel's past lies particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a \"king of Israel\" and a \"house of David\". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. However, although the \"king of Israel\" is generally accepted, the rendering of the phrase ''bytdwd'' as \"house of David\" has been disputed by some. This dispute is occasioned in part because it appears without a word divider between the two parts.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86\u201387}} The significance of this fact, if any, is unclear, because others, such as the late [[Anson Rainey|Anson F. Rainey]], have observed that the presence or absence of word-dividers (for example, sometimes a short vertical line between words, other times a dot between words, as in this inscription) is normally inconsequential for interpretation.{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}}\n\nThe majority of scholars argue that the author simply thought of \"House of David\" as a single word \u2013 but some have argued that \"dwd\" (the usual spelling for \"David\") could be a name for a god (\"beloved\"), or could be \"d\u014dd\", meaning \"uncle\" (a word with a rather wider meaning in ancient times than it has today), or, as George Athas has argued, that the whole phrase might be a name for Jerusalem (so that the author might be claiming to have killed the son of the king of Jerusalem rather than the son of the king from the \"house of David\".{{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=43}}{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=225\u2013226}}\n\nOther possible meanings have been suggested: it may be a place-name, or the name of a god, or an epithet.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86\u201387}} Mykytiuk observes that \"dwd\" meaning \"kettle\" (d\u016bd) or \"uncle\" (d\u014dd) do not fit the context. He also weighs the interpretive options that the term ''bytdwd'' might refer to the name of a god, [[Cult image|cultic object]], epithet or a place and concludes that these possibilities have no firm basis. Rather, he finds that the preponderance of the evidence points to the ancient Aramaic and Assyrian word-patterns for geopolitical terms. According to the pattern used, the phrase \"House of David\" refers to a Davidic dynasty or to the land ruled by a Davidic dynasty.{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=121\u2013128}} As an alternative, [[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] remains sceptical about the significance and interpretation of the inscription and claims that it does not necessarily support the assumption that the Bible's David was a historical figure since \"David\" which can also be translated as \"beloved\" could refer to a mythical ancestor.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86\u201387}} In Schmidt's view it is indeed likely{{sfn|Schmidt|2006|p=315}} that the correct translation is \"House of David.\"\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Tel Dan stele}}\n*[[David#History_and_archeology|Historicity of David]]\n*[[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Tel Dan Stele\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n{{refbegin}}\n*Athas, George, \u201cSetting the Record Straight: What Are We Making of the Tel Dan Inscription?\u201d ''[[Journal of Semitic Studies]]'' 51 (2006): 241\u2013256.\n*{{cite book\n| last1             = Athas\n| first1            = George\n| year              = 2003\n| title             = The Tel Dan Inscription: A Reappraisal and a New Interpretation\n| publisher         = Continuum International Publishing Group\n| url               = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPqpzmYBOxgC&printsec=frontcover\n| ref              = harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| last1             = Biran\n| first1            = Avraham\n| last2             = Naveh\n| first2            = Joseph\n| year              = 1993\n| title             = An Aramaic Stele Fragment from Tel Dan, Israel Exploration Journal, Vol. 43, No. 2/3 (1993), pp. 81-98\n| publisher         = Israel Exploration Society\n| jstor               = 27926300\n| ref              = Biran\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last              = Brooks\n|first             = Simcha Shalom\n|title             = Saul and the Monarchy: A New Look\n|year              = 2005\n|publisher         = Ashgate Publishing\n|url               = https://books.google.com/books?id=sNuyhL3TiX8C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&f=false\n|ref               = harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last              = Collins\n|first             = John J.\n|title             = The Bible After Babel\n|year              = 2005\n|publisher         = Eerdmans\n|url               = https://books.google.com/books?id=yqClWOhqso0C&pg=PA27&f=false\n|ref               = \n}}\n*Davies, Philip R., \u201c\u2018House of David\u2019 Built on Sand: The Sins of the Biblical Maximizers.\u201d ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' 20/4 (July/August 1994): 54-55.\n*{{cite book\n|last              = Dever\n|first             = William G.\n|authorlink        = William G.

[[Tribe of Dan|Dan]], just 70 miles from Hazael's capital of Damascus, would almost certainly have come under its sway. This is borne out by the archaeological evidence: [[Israelites|Israelite]] remains do not appear until the 8th century BCE, and it appears that Dan was already in the orbit of Damascus even before Hazael became king in c. 843 BCE.{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=255\u2013257}}\n\nThe author of the inscription mentions conflict with the kings of Israel and the 'House of David'. The names of the two enemy kings are only partially legible. Biran and Naveh reconstructed them as [[Jehoram of Israel|Joram, son of Ahab]], King of Israel, and [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah, son of Joram]] of the House of David. Scholars seem to be evenly divided on these identifications.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|p=235}} It is dependent on a particular arrangement of the fragments, and not all scholars agree on this.\n\nIn the reconstructed text, the author tells how Israel had invaded his country in his father's day, and how the god [[Hadad]] then made him king and marched with him against Israel. The author then reports that he defeated seventy kings with thousands of chariots and horses. In the very last line there is a suggestion of a siege, possibly of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], the capital of the kings of Israel.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|p=235}} This reading is, however, disputed.{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=259\u2013308}}\n\n==Interpretation and disputes==\n\n===Configuration===\nThe stele was found in three fragments, called A, B1 and B2. There is widespread agreement that all three belong to the same inscription, and that B1 and B2 belong together. There is less agreement over the fit between A and the combined B1/B2: Biran and Naveh placed B1/B2 to the left of A (the photograph at the top of this article). A few scholars have disputed this, [[William Schniedewind]] proposing some minor adjustments to the same fit, [[Gershon Galil]] placing B above A rather than beside it, and George Athas fitting it well below.{{sfn|Hagelia|2005|pp=232\u2013233}}\n\n===Dating ===\nArcheologists and [[epigrapher]]s{{which|date=September 2016}} put the earliest possible date at about 870 BCE, whilst the latest possible date is \"less clear\", although according to Lawrence J. Mykytiuk it could \"hardly have been much later than 750\".{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=115, 117fn.52}} However, some scholars (mainly associated with the [[Copenhagen School (theology)|Copenhagen school]]) \u2013 [[Niels Peter Lemche]], [[Thomas L.

Other proposals regarding the author have been made: George Athas argues for Hazael's son  [[Ben-Hadad III]], which would date the inscription to around 796 BCE, and J-W Wesselius has argued for [[Jehu]] of Israel (reigned c. 845 \u2013 818 BCE).\n\n===\"House of David\"===\n{{See also|Davidic line}}\n\t\nSince 1993\u20131994, when the first fragment was discovered and published, the Tel Dan stele has been the object of great interest and debate among epigraphers and [[Biblical studies|biblical scholars]] along the whole range of views from those who find little of historical value in the biblical version of Israel's ancient past to those who are unconcerned about the biblical version, to those who wish to defend it.\n\nIts significance for the biblical version of Israel's past lies particularly in lines 8 and 9, which mention a \"king of Israel\" and a \"house of David\". The latter is generally understood by scholars to refer to the ruling dynasty of Judah. However, although the \"king of Israel\" is generally accepted, the rendering of the phrase ''bytdwd'' as \"house of David\" has been disputed by some. This dispute is occasioned in part because it appears without a word divider between the two parts.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86\u201387}} The significance of this fact, if any, is unclear, because others, such as the late [[Anson Rainey|Anson F. Rainey]], have observed that the presence or absence of word-dividers (for example, sometimes a short vertical line between words, other times a dot between words, as in this inscription) is normally inconsequential for interpretation.{{sfn|Rainey|1994|p=47}}\n\nThe majority of scholars argue that the author simply thought of \"House of David\" as a single word \u2013 but some have argued that \"dwd\" (the usual spelling for \"David\") could be a name for a god (\"beloved\"), or could be \"d\u014dd\", meaning \"uncle\" (a word with a rather wider meaning in ancient times than it has today), or, as George Athas has argued, that the whole phrase might be a name for Jerusalem (so that the author might be claiming to have killed the son of the king of Jerusalem rather than the son of the king from the \"house of David\".{{sfn|Lemche|1998|p=43}}{{sfn|Athas|2003|pp=225\u2013226}}\n\nOther possible meanings have been suggested: it may be a place-name, or the name of a god, or an epithet.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86\u201387}} Mykytiuk observes that \"dwd\" meaning \"kettle\" (d\u016bd) or \"uncle\" (d\u014dd) do not fit the context. He also weighs the interpretive options that the term ''bytdwd'' might refer to the name of a god, [[Cult image|cultic object]], epithet or a place and concludes that these possibilities have no firm basis. Rather, he finds that the preponderance of the evidence points to the ancient Aramaic and Assyrian word-patterns for geopolitical terms. According to the pattern used, the phrase \"House of David\" refers to a Davidic dynasty or to the land ruled by a Davidic dynasty.{{sfn|Mykytiuk|2004|pp=121\u2013128}} As an alternative, [[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] remains sceptical about the significance and interpretation of the inscription and claims that it does not necessarily support the assumption that the Bible's David was a historical figure since \"David\" which can also be translated as \"beloved\" could refer to a mythical ancestor.{{sfn|Stavrakopoulou|2004|pp=86\u201387}} In Schmidt's view it is indeed likely{{sfn|Schmidt|2006|p=315}} that the correct translation is \"House of David.\"\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Tel Dan stele}}\n*[[David#History_and_archeology|Historicity of David]]\n*[[List of artifacts significant to the Bible]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Tel Dan Stele\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n{{refbegin}}\n*Athas, George, \u201cSetting the Record Straight: What Are We Making of the Tel Dan Inscription?\u201d ''[[Journal of Semitic Studies]]'' 51 (2006): 241-256.\n*{{cite book\n| last1             = Athas\n| first1            = George\n| year              = 2003\n| title             = The Tel Dan Inscription: A Reappraisal and a New Interpretation\n| publisher         = Continuum International Publishing Group\n| url               = https://books.google.com/books?id=OPqpzmYBOxgC&printsec=frontcover\n| ref              = harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n| last1             = Biran\n| first1            = Avraham\n| last2             = Naveh\n| first2            = Joseph\n| year              = 1993\n| title             = An Aramaic Stele Fragment from Tel Dan, Israel Exploration Journal, Vol. 43, No. 2/3 (1993), pp. 81-98\n| publisher         = Israel Exploration Society\n| jstor               = 27926300\n| ref              = Biran\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last              = Brooks\n|first             = Simcha Shalom\n|title             = Saul and the Monarchy: A New Look\n|year              = 2005\n|publisher         = Ashgate Publishing\n|url               = https://books.google.com/books?id=sNuyhL3TiX8C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&f=false\n|ref               = harv\n}}\n*{{cite book\n|last              = Collins\n|first             = John J.\n|title             = The Bible After Babel\n|year              = 2005\n|publisher         = Eerdmans\n|url               = https://books.google.com/books?id=yqClWOhqso0C&pg=PA27&f=false\n|ref               = \n}}\n*Davies, Philip R., \u201c\u2018House of David\u2019 Built on Sand: The Sins of the Biblical Maximizers.\u201d ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' 20/4 (July/August 1994): 54-55.\n*{{cite book\n|last              = Dever\n|first             = William G.\n|authorlink        = William G.

The extra capacity was required to serve up to six 4-wheel horseboxes.  The work order noted that the extension should be ready by 15 October 1924 in preparation for use for race traffic on 18 October; work was completed on 4 October.\n\nThe '''Taratahi Dairy Company''' complained in April 1925 that it, and others, had experienced difficulty in delivering cans of cream to the station.  The provision of a cart dock was requested which was duly authorised by the District Engineer.  It was constructed at the south end of the station and the District Engineer was advised that work had been completed on 30 June 1925.\n\n=== Services ===\nServices through Clareville started with two return weekday mixed trains, an arrangement that lasted many decades.  No regular passenger-only workings were provided save for the occasional holiday excursion trains.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Walter Norman |title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas |pages=137\u2013138 |chapter=Chapter 6: Construction and Operation, Featherston to Masterton }}</ref>  As was typically the case for flag stations, trains only stopped to pick up or set down passengers and wagons if required to do so.\n\nThe Wairarapa Line was completed to its northern terminus at Woodville in 1897 and this enabled the Railways Department to introduce the [[Napier Express|Napier Mail]] to the Wairarapa Line.  This train had earlier run as the Napier Express via the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] and the [[Manawatu Gorge]].  This arrangement lasted until 1909 when the Napier Mail once again became the Napier Express and reverted to its original route.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mahoney |first1=J.

The Wairarapa Mail passenger trains continued to run but in 1944 were reduced from their Monday \u2013 Saturday timetable to a thrice weekly service due to a severe coal shortage.  It never recovered from this and was withdrawn completely in 1948.<ref name=\"Kings of the Iron Road: The Wairarapa Mail\"/>  Several years later the [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] was opened, bringing an end to the mixed trains that had been plying the Wairarapa Line and the withdrawal of the Wairarapa-type railcars, and ushering in the era of the [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|twin-set railcars]].

Outward goods consisted primarily of hay and straw, amounting to approximately 12 wagons per year.  It was considered that only minor inconvenience would be caused in closing Clareville to goods traffic and instead handling it at Carterton.  In response to the review the District Engineer stated he had no objection to the lifting of the goods siding at Clareville.  After the possibility of new business at Clareville from '''Airlift (N.Z.)''' was aborted on 11 June 1956, closure of the station to goods traffic was confirmed and a request to lift the goods siding was put in hand on 20 November 1957 with work being completed by 1 March 1958.\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nA narrow escape from a serious accident occurred in 1898 when a buggy containing two ladies was drawn beside the line waiting for the Napier-Wellington express. The horse became frightened at the approach of the train and plunged blindly into the engine. The horse was knocked down but was uninjured. The buggy was left broken however the occupants also escaped unhurt.<ref>''Poverty Bay Herald'', 21 November 1898, \"News Items\"</ref>\n\n== Today ==\nNothing remains at the former site of the Clareville station.  The shelter shed was removed when the station closed in 1970<ref name=\"A Line Of Railway pg243\"/> and all private sidings in the vicinity have also since been closed.\n\nThe station building was persevered at a private home in Masterton, has since been moved in November 2017 to [[Carterton railway station]].\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | year = 1920\u20131958 | date = | publication-date = | contribution = | contribution-url = | editor-last = | editor-first = | editor-link = | editor2-last = | editor2-first = | editor2-link = | title = Clareville - Station yard | edition = | series = | place = | publication-place = Wellington | publisher = Archives New Zealand | volume = | pages = | id = R-W  3   30 10548 | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewFullItem.do?OID=11071551 | ref =}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n<references/>\n\n{{Wairarapa Line stations}}\n\n[[Category:Rail transport in Wellington]]\n[[Category:Defunct railway stations in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the Wairarapa]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1880]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1970]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=August 2015}}\n{{Infobox station \n| name          = Clareville\n| type          = [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Government Railways (NZGR)]]<br/>[[regional rail]]\n| image         = Clareville railway station 01.JPG\n| image_size    = \n| image_caption = \n| address       = 48 Chester Road, Clareville, New Zealand\n| coordinates   = {{coord|41|0|16.51|S|175|32|48.35|E|type:railwaystation_region:NZ|format=dms}}\n| line          = [[Wairarapa Line]]\n| other         = \n| structure     = \n| platform      = Single [[Side platform|side]]\n| depth         = \n| levels        = \n| tracks        = Main (x1)<br/>Loop siding (x1)\n| parking       = \n| bicycle       = \n| baggage_check = \n| opened        = 1 November 1880\n| closed        = 16 September 1956 (freight)<ref name=\"Rail Heritage Trust\">Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand</ref><br/>30 November 1970 (passengers)<ref name=\"Rail Heritage Trust\"/>\n| rebuilt       = \n| electrified   = \n| ADA           = \n| code          = \n| owned         = [[New Zealand Railways Department|Railways Department]]\n| zone          = \n| former        = \n| passengers    = \n| pass_year     = \n| pass_percent  = \n| pass_system   = \n| mpassengers   = \n| services      = \n| map_locator   = \n}}\n{{Routemap\n|title = Clareville yard layout\n|collapsible = no\n|title-bg = \n|map =\n\\CONTg~~to Woodville \n\\BUE~~Chester Road \nexSTR+l\\eABZgr \nexSTR\\STR \nexSTR\\eSTR+BSl~~ ~~platform~~(no longer extant) \nloading bank! !exSTR+BSr\\STR \n(no longer extant)~~ ~~ ! !exSTR+BSr\\STR \nexSTR\\STR \nexSTRl\\eABZg+r \n\\CONTf~~to Wellington \n}}\n\n'''Clareville railway station''' was a [[Request stop|flag station]] serving the small settlement of [[Clareville, New Zealand|Clareville]], north of [[Carterton, New Zealand|Carterton]] in the [[Wairarapa]] region of [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]].

The station opened to all traffic along with the Woodside \u2013 Masterton section of the line on 1 November 1880.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Walter Norman |title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas |year=1976 |publisher=New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society |location=Wellington |isbn=0-908573-00-6 |pages=130\u2013131 |chapter=Chapter 6: Construction and Operation, Featherston to Masterton }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clareville railway station 02.JPG|left|thumb|Former access road to the loading bank.]]\nIn addition to the shelter shed there was also a loop siding with a capacity of 19 wagons and a loading siding that was used by William Booth's timber mill.<ref name=\"A Line Of Railway pg243\">{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Walter Norman |title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas |page=243 |chapter=Chapter 10: The Stations }}</ref>  The mill, which was located between Carterton and Clareville, later established its own private siding in 1885.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Walter Norman |title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas |page=300 |chapter=Chapter 13: Branch Lines and Sidings }}</ref>\n\nThe loading bank was extended to a length of {{convert|100|ft}} in 1924 to enable the loading and discharging of race horses.  The extra capacity was required to serve up to six 4-wheel horseboxes.  The work order noted that the extension should be ready by 15 October 1924 in preparation for use for race traffic on 18 October; work was completed on 4 October.\n\nThe '''Taratahi Dairy Company''' complained in April 1925 that it, and others, had experienced difficulty in delivering cans of cream to the station.  The provision of a cart dock was requested which was duly authorised by the District Engineer.  It was constructed at the south end of the station and the District Engineer was advised that work had been completed on 30 June 1925.\n\n=== Services ===\nServices through Clareville started with two return weekday mixed trains, an arrangement that lasted many decades.  No regular passenger-only workings were provided save for the occasional holiday excursion trains.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron |first1=Walter Norman |title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas |pages=137\u2013138 |chapter=Chapter 6: Construction and Operation, Featherston to Masterton }}</ref>  As was typically the case for flag stations, trains only stopped to pick up or set down passengers and wagons if required to do so.\n\nThe Wairarapa Line was completed to its northern terminus at Woodville in 1897 and this enabled the Railways Department to introduce the [[Napier Express|Napier Mail]] to the Wairarapa Line.  This train had earlier run as the Napier Express via the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] and the [[Manawatu Gorge]].  This arrangement lasted until 1909 when the Napier Mail once again became the Napier Express and reverted to its original route.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mahoney |first1=J.

D. |title=Kings of the Iron Road: Steam Passenger Trains of New Zealand |pages=81\u201386 |chapter=The Wairarapa Mail }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1936 when the [[NZR RM class]] [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa-type railcars]] were introduced passengers from Clareville had a much faster service to points both north and south.  The Wairarapa Mail passenger trains continued to run but in 1944 were reduced from their Monday \u2013 Saturday timetable to a thrice weekly service due to a severe coal shortage.  It never recovered from this and was withdrawn completely in 1948.<ref name=\"Kings of the Iron Road: The Wairarapa Mail\"/>  Several years later the [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] was opened, bringing an end to the mixed trains that had been plying the Wairarapa Line and the withdrawal of the Wairarapa-type railcars, and ushering in the era of the [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|twin-set railcars]].  The 1959 railcar timetable lists Clareville as a \"stops if required\" station for both northbound and southbound services.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Churchman |first1=Geoffrey B. |title=The Golden Era of Fiat Railcars in New Zealand |year=1989 |publisher=I.P.L. Books |location=Wellington |isbn=0-9597832-4-5 |chapter=Timetables }}</ref>\n\nIn a review of sidings at unattended stations in 1953 it was noted of Clareville that inward goods comprised approximately 12 wagons of coal and 6 wagons of shooks for the '''Carrington Dairy Company''', who consigned their outward goods at Carterton.  Outward goods consisted primarily of hay and straw, amounting to approximately 12 wagons per year.  It was considered that only minor inconvenience would be caused in closing Clareville to goods traffic and instead handling it at Carterton.  In response to the review the District Engineer stated he had no objection to the lifting of the goods siding at Clareville.  After the possibility of new business at Clareville from '''Airlift (N.Z.)''' was aborted on 11 June 1956, closure of the station to goods traffic was confirmed and a request to lift the goods siding was put in hand on 20 November 1957 with work being completed by 1 March 1958.\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\nA narrow escape from a serious accident occurred in 1898 when a buggy containing two ladies was drawn beside the line waiting for the Napier-Wellington express. The horse became frightened at the approach of the train and plunged blindly into the engine. The horse was knocked down but was uninjured. The buggy was left broken however the occupants also escaped unhurt.<ref>''Poverty Bay Herald'', 21 November 1898, \"News Items\"</ref>\n\n== Today ==\nNothing remains at the former site of the Clareville station.  The shelter shed was removed when the station closed in 1970<ref name=\"A Line Of Railway pg243\"/> and all private sidings in the vicinity have also since been closed.\n\nThe station building was persevered at a private home in Masterton, has scene been moved in November 2017 to [[Carterton Railway Station]].\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | year = 1920\u20131958 | date = | publication-date = | contribution = | contribution-url = | editor-last = | editor-first = | editor-link = | editor2-last = | editor2-first = | editor2-link = | title = Clareville - Station yard | edition = | series = | place = | publication-place = Wellington | publisher = Archives New Zealand | volume = | pages = | id = R-W  3   30 10548 | isbn = | doi = | oclc = | url = http://archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewFullItem.do?OID=11071551 | ref =}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n<references/>\n\n{{Wairarapa Line stations}}\n\n[[Category:Rail transport in Wellington]]\n[[Category:Defunct railway stations in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the Wairarapa]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1880]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 1970]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromCarterton Railway StationtoCarterton railway stationusingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clareville_railway_station"}
