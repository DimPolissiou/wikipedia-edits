In the article, Taseer stated that \"he was found in this garrison town because he was the guest of the army.\"\n\nOn 16 July 2011, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published a piece its editors provocatively, and somewhat misleadingly, titled \"Why My Father Hated India\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304911104576445862242908294 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Aatish | last=Taseer | title=Why My Father Hated India | date=16 July 2011}}</ref> Although Taseer used his father's distaste for all things Indian as an example, or metaphor, the article attempted to explain a much bigger question \u2013 a question about Pakistan's apparent unhealthy obsession with India and vice versa. It argued that \"to understand the Pakistani obsession with India, to get a sense of its special edge \u2014 its hysteria \u2014 it is necessary to understand the rejection of India, its culture and past, that lies at the heart of the idea of Pakistan\", He continued: \"In the absence of a true national identity, Pakistan defined itself by its opposition to India.\" The article remained the most emailed and commented-on on ''The Wall Street Journal'' website<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/home-page|title=Wall Street Journal home page (search required)| work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> for days and at the end of July it was by far the most emailed of the month.\n\nThe controversy spread when, following an exchange on [[Twitter]] between Pakistani journalist, Ejaz Haider and Indian Member of Parliament and former Indian Union Minister and Under-secretary at the UN, [[Shashi Tharoor]].

His central argument was that India \u2013 with its massive army arrayed along its border with Pakistan \u2013 left Pakistan with no choice but to be deeply concerned with its every move. Tharoor rose to Aatish Taseer's defense; writing in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', in a piece titled \"Delusional liberals\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/columnists/shashi-tharoor/delusional-liberals|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016005035/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/columnists/shashi-tharoor/delusional-liberals|url-status=dead|title=Deccan Chronicle|archivedate=16 October 2011}}</ref> he quoted Taseer's original piece extensively and said in general he \"admired the young man\u2019s writing\", and felt he had made \"his point in language that was both sharp [...] heartfelt and accurate\". He said that in their vitriolic response to Taseer's piece Pakistan's liberals had exposed themselves and took on Haider point-for-point, saying \"that there is not and cannot be an \"Indian threat\" to Pakistan, simply because there is absolutely nothing Pakistan possesses that India wants.\" Ejaz Haider subsequently responded strongly stating \"Like every other state in the world, Pakistan is also a self-interested state and the rest of the world must live with this fact; three, we have no intention of defenestrating our military, even as we would continue to kick them to extract obedience; four, we don\u2019t need advice from across the border, especially because the Indian pundits crawled on their bellies when Mrs Indira Gandhi slapped her two-year emergency rule.

In the article, Taseer stated that \"he was found in this garrison town because he was the guest of the army.\"\n\nOn 16 July 2011, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' published a piece its editors provocatively, and somewhat misleadingly, titled \"Why My Father Hated India\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304911104576445862242908294 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Aatish | last=Taseer | title=Why My Father Hated India | date=16 July 2011}}</ref> Although Taseer used his father's distaste for all things Indian as an example, or metaphor, the article attempted to explain a much bigger question \u2013 a question about Pakistan's apparent unhealthy obsession with India and vice versa. It argued that \"to understand the Pakistani obsession with India, to get a sense of its special edge \u2014 its hysteria \u2014 it is necessary to understand the rejection of India, its culture and past, that lies at the heart of the idea of Pakistan\", He continued: \"In the absence of a true national identity, Pakistan defined itself by its opposition to India.\" The article remained the most emailed and commented-on on ''The Wall Street Journal'' website<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/home-page|title=Wall Street Journal home page (search required)| work=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref> for days and at the end of July it was by far the most emailed of the month.\n\nThe controversy spread when, following an exchange on [[Twitter]] between Pakistani journalist, Ejaz Haider and Indian Member of Parliament and former Indian Union Minister and Under-secretary at the UN, [[Shashi Tharoor]]. Haider wrote a column in ''[[The Express Tribune]]'' titled \"Aatish\u2019s Personal Fire\", Haider stated that Taseer himself seemed to suffer from an identity crisis<ref>Haider, Ejaz (18 July 2011).

His central argument was that India \u2013 with its massive army arrayed along its border with Pakistan \u2013 left Pakistan with no choice but to be deeply concerned with its every move. Tharoor rose to Aatish Taseer's defense; writing in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', in a piece titled \"Delusional liberals\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/columnists/shashi-tharoor/delusional-liberals|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016005035/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/columnists/shashi-tharoor/delusional-liberals|url-status=dead|title=Deccan Chronicle|archivedate=16 October 2011}}</ref> he quoted Taseer's original piece extensively and said in general he \"admired the young man\u2019s writing\", and felt he had made \"his point in language that was both sharp [...] heartfelt and accurate\". He said that in their vitriolic response to Taseer's piece Pakistan's liberals had exposed themselves and took on Haider point-for-point, saying \"that there is not and cannot be an \"Indian threat\" to Pakistan, simply because there is absolutely nothing Pakistan possesses that India wants.\" Ejaz Haider subsequently responded strongly stating \"Like every other state in the world, Pakistan is also a self-interested state and the rest of the world must live with this fact; three, we have no intention of defenestrating our military, even as we would continue to kick them to extract obedience; four, we don\u2019t need advice from across the border, especially because the Indian pundits crawled on their bellies when Mrs Indira Gandhi slapped her two-year emergency rule.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically.

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]].

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams. However, if so desired, a user may still rebuild the toolchain or reinstall the base system software during or after a normal stage3 installation, effectively simulating the old bootstrap process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#Bootstrapping_the_Base_System_.28Optional_but_Recommended.29|title=Sakaki's EFI Install Guide/Building the Gentoo Base System Minus Kernel|publisher=Sakaki|date=2014-07-04|accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gentoo Reference Platform===\nFrom 2003 until 2008, the '''Gentoo Reference Platform''' (GRP) was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html|title=Gentoo Linux Reloaded|author=[[Daniel Robbins (computer programmer)|Daniel Robbins]]|date=2002-10-10|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[O'Reilly Media|LinuxDevCenter.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/6206|title=Gentoo Linux 2004.0 Released|author=Sven Vermeulen|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2018-02-10|work=[[OSNews]]}}</ref> These packages included [[KDE]], [[X Window System]], [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[GNOME]], and [[Mozilla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2018-02-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108142459/https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|archivedate=2014-01-08|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Once the installation was complete, the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP. As of 2011, the GRP is discontinued, the final reference to it appearing in the 2008.0 handbook.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2008.0/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=1|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2011-04-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223084417/http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2008.0/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=1|archivedate=December 23, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Original research inline|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Genkernel===\nGenkernel is a tool for building a general-purpose modular [[Linux kernel]]. Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

Placed under the command of Lieutenant [[Louis M. Goldsborough]], with an annual budget of $330, its primary function was the restoration, repair, and rating of navigational instruments. It was made into a national observatory in 1842 via a federal law and a Congressional appropriation of $25,000.

Maury had the world's first [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[time ball]], created to his specifications by [[Charles Goodyear]] for the U.S. Observatory. It was the first time ball in the United States, being placed into service in 1845, and the 12th in the world. Maury kept accurate time by the stars and planets. The time ball was dropped every day except Sunday precisely at the astronomically defined moment of Mean Solar Noon, enabling all ships and civilians to know the exact time. By the end of the American Civil War, the Observatory's clocks were linked via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] to ring the alarm bells in all of the Washington, D.C. firehouses three times a day, and by the early 1870s the Observatory's daily noon-time signal was being distributed nationwide via the [[Western Union]] Telegraph Company. Time was also \"sold\"{{cn|need citation of this public resource being \u201cprivatized\u201d for sale at this date|date=July 2019}} to the railroads and was used in conjunction with [[railroad chronometer]]s to schedule American rail transport. Early in the 20th century, the Arlington Time Signal broadcast this service to [[wireless]] receivers.\n\nIn 1849 the Nautical Almanac Office (NAO) was established in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] as a separate organization.  It was moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1866, colocating with the U. S. Naval Observatory in 1893.  On September 20, 1894, the NAO became a \"branch\" of USNO, however it remained autonomous for several years after this.<ref name=\"sky_and_ocean\"/>\n\nAn early scientific duty assigned to the Observatory was the U.S. contribution to the definition of the [[Astronomical unit|Astronomical Unit]], or the AU, which defines a standard [[arithmetic mean|mean distance]] between the Sun and the Earth, conducted under the auspices of the Congressionally funded U.S. Transit of Venus Commission. The astronomical measurements taken of the [[transit of Venus]] by a number of countries since 1639 resulted in a progressively more accurate definition of the AU. Relying heavily on photographic methods, the naval observers returned 350 [[photographic plate]]s in 1874, and 1,380 measurable plates in 1882. The results of the surveys conducted simultaneously from several locations around the world (for each of the two transits) produced a final value of the [[parallax|solar parallax]], after adjustments, of 8.809\", with a probable error of 0.0059\", yielding a ''U.S. defined'' Earth-Sun distance of {{convert|92,797,000|mi|km}}, with a probable error of {{convert|59,700|mi|km}}. This calculated distance was a significant improvement over several previous estimates.<!-- Note that the preceding paragraph contains verbatim text produced by a U.S. Government employee, which makes it copyright-free and thus in the public domain. --><ref name=\"NASA-Dick\">Dick, Steven J.

Placed under the command of Lieutenant [[Louis M. Goldsborough]], with an annual budget of $330, its primary function was the restoration, repair, and rating of navigational instruments. It was made into a national observatory in 1842 via a federal law and a Congressional appropriation of $25,000.

Maury had the world's first [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[time ball]], created to his specifications by [[Charles Goodyear]] for the U.S. Observatory. It was the first time ball in the United States, being placed into service in 1845, and the 12th in the world. Maury kept accurate time by the stars and planets. The time ball was dropped every day except Sunday precisely at the astronomically defined moment of Mean Solar Noon, enabling all ships and civilians to know the exact time. By the end of the American Civil War, the Observatory's clocks were linked via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] to ring the alarm bells in all of the Washington, D.C. firehouses three times a day, and by the early 1870s the Observatory's daily noon-time signal was being distributed nationwide via the [[Western Union]] Telegraph Company. Time was also \"sold\"{{cn|need citation of this public resource being \u201cprivatized\u201d for sale at this date|date=July 2019}} to the railroads and was used in conjunction with [[railroad chronometer]]s to schedule American rail transport. Early in the 20th century, the Arlington Time Signal broadcast this service to [[wireless]] receivers.\n\nIn 1849 the Nautical Almanac Office (NAO) was established in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] as a separate organization.  It was moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1866, colocating with the U. S. Naval Observatory in 1893.  On September 20, 1894, the NAO became a \"branch\" of USNO, however it remained autonomous for several years after this.<ref name=\"sky_and_ocean\"/>\n\nAn early scientific duty assigned to the Observatory was the U.S. contribution to the definition of the [[Astronomical unit|Astronomical Unit]], or the AU, which defines a standard [[arithmetic mean|mean distance]] between the Sun and the Earth, conducted under the auspices of the Congressionally funded U.S. Transit of Venus Commission. The astronomical measurements taken of the [[transit of Venus]] by a number of countries since 1639 resulted in a progressively more accurate definition of the AU. Relying heavily on photographic methods, the naval observers returned 350 [[photographic plate]]s in 1874, and 1,380 measurable plates in 1882. The results of the surveys conducted simultaneously from several locations around the world (for each of the two transits) produced a final value of the [[parallax|solar parallax]], after adjustments, of 8.809\", with a probable error of 0.0059\", yielding a ''U.S. defined'' Earth-Sun distance of {{convert|92,797,000|mi|km}}, with a probable error of {{convert|59,700|mi|km}}. This calculated distance was a significant improvement over several previous estimates.<!-- Note that the preceding paragraph contains verbatim text produced by a U.S. Government employee, which makes it copyright-free and thus in the public domain. --><ref name=\"NASA-Dick\">Dick, Steven J.

It is also a key figure with regard to [[hedge fund]]s and [[venture capital fund]]s when calculating the value of the underlying investments in these funds by investors. This may also be the same as the [[book value]] or the [[shareholders' equity|equity]] value of a business.

Fund accounting systems are sophisticated computerized systems used to account for investor [[Financial capital|capital]] flows in and out of a fund, purchases and sales of investments, and related investment income, gains, losses and operating expenses of the fund. The fund's investments and other assets are valued regularly; daily, weekly, or monthly, depending on the fund and associated regulatory or sponsor requirements. There is no universal method or basis of [[valuation (finance)|valuing assets and liabilities]] for the purposes of calculating the net asset value used throughout the world, and the criteria used for the valuation will depend upon the circumstances, the purposes of the valuation, and any regulatory and/or accounting principles that may apply. For example, for U.S.-registered open-ended funds, investments are commonly valued each day the [[New York Stock Exchange]] is open, using closing prices (meant to represent fair value),<ref>AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide - Investment Companies May 1, 2007.</ref> typically 4:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time]]. For U.S.-registered money market funds, investments are often carried or valued at \"amortized cost\" as opposed to market value for expedience and other purposes, provided various requirements are continually met.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Guide To Understanding Mutual Funds |publisher= Investment Company Institute |url=http://www.ici.org/pdf/bro_understanding_mfs_p.pdf }}</ref>\n\nAt the completion of the valuation process and once all other appropriate accounting entries are posted, the accounting books are \"closed\", enabling a variety of information to be calculated and produced including the net asset value per share.\n\n==Open-ended funds==\nNet asset value is commonly used in the context of [[open-end fund]]s. [[Shares]] and [[Partnership|interests]] in such funds are not traded between investors, but are issued by the fund to each new investor and redeemed by the fund when an investor withdraws. A fund will issue and redeem shares and interests at a price calculated by reference to the NAV of the fund, with the intention that new investors receive a fair proportion of the fund and redeeming investors receive a fair proportion of the fund's value in cash.\n\nFor example, if a fund has a NAV of $200 million and 1 million shares in issue on a certain day, the \"NAV per share\"\u2014the price at which shares are issued\u2014is $200. A person investing $40 million on that day will therefore be given 200,000 shares. Immediately following his investment the total NAV of the fund will be $240 million, as the new investor's cash becomes part of the fund and is available for investment by the fund. The investor will then be entitled to 1/6 of whatever the fund's value is when he withdraws his investment, if in the meantime his 1/6 ownership is not altered by any further withdrawals or investments to the fund.\n\nThe valuation of the assets and liabilities of an open-ended fund is therefore very important to investors. If the NAV in the above example had, with the same assets, been calculated as $160 million (and the NAV per share as $160), the investor would have been given 250,000 shares and would become entitled to 1/5 of the fund's value.\n\nIn contrast, [[closed-end fund]]s are traded in the open market between investors and so the price of shares or interests in a closed-end fund will be whatever the parties agree it to be, which may not correspond to the fund's [https://www.indictionary.in/post/myths-indians-have-about-mutual-funds-and-lack-of-investment-knowledge-in-india-%E0%A4%AD-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4-%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%B5-%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%95-%E0%A4%B8-%E0%A4%9A NAV].

The NAV may be below the market price for the following reasons:\n\n* Accounting principles and bases of presentation of amounts in [[financial statement]]s differ worldwide, blurring the comparability of companies in various jurisdictions.  Financial statement values are typically recorded based on their local jurisdiction's related principles of accounting, which affect all the remaining points below.\n* The current value of a company's assets likely differ from the historical cost reflected in the financial statements used in NAV calculations.\n* The NAV describes the company's current asset and liability position. Investors might believe that the company has significant growth prospects, in which case they would be prepared to pay more for the company than its NAV.\n* Certain assets, such as [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] (which broadly represents a company's ability to make future profits), are not necessarily included on a [[balance sheet]] and so will not appear in an NAV calculation.\n\nA company's market value will not always be greater than its NAV. For example, analysts and management estimated that [[Liberty Media Corporation]] was trading for 30-50% below its net asset value (or \"core asset value\") in June 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Where a company's market value is lower than its NAV, it may be considered more profitable to wind the company down and sell off its assets individually rather than continue to run it as a [[going concern]].\n\nIn contrast to fund valuation, the assets of a company will generally be valued for the purpose of a NAV calculation using the [[book value]], the [[historical cost]], or the [[amortization|amortised]] cost of the company's assets, or an appropriate combination of the three.\n\n==Real estate investment trusts==\nNAV is one of the valuation indices of [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs, pronounced \"Reets\"). NAV is normally quoted \"per investment unit\" where the value is divided by the number of total outstanding investment units. In simple terms, NAV is an adjusted net asset value reflecting the market values of real estate properties held by an investment corporation. The degree of premium/discount on individual investment unit prices relative to the per-unit NAV serves as the yardstick for assessment. The NAV index is synonymous to the adjusted [[price-to-book ratio]] in which factors such as unrealized losses/gains of owned properties and brand values are reflected. News companies such as PropertyMall typically report on a REIT's NAV when the company reports it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/24597 |title=Hammerson - General |publisher=Propertymall.com |accessdate=2012-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320162239/http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/24597 |archivedate=2012-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Variable insurance and variable annuity contracts==\n[[Variable universal life insurance]] policies and [[variable annuity]] contracts often are structured somewhat similarly to mutual funds, and they may vary in value as securities and markets fluctuate. Typically, these [[insurance]] or [[annuity]] products issue \"units\" of ownership to policyholders/annuitants in exchange for their investment\u2014similar to shares of a mutual fund. Also similar to a fund, the assets, liabilities, and net assets of these product entities are valued periodically, resulting in an asset unit value or AUV or UAV per share, which is similar to NAV for a fund.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Net assets]]\n* [[Assets under management]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Investment-management}}\n{{Financial markets navigation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Net Asset Value}}\n[[Category:Investment management]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2008}}\n'''Net asset value''' ('''NAV''') is the value of an entity's [[asset]]s minus the value of its [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]], often in relation to [[open-end fund|open-end]] or [[mutual fund|mutual]] funds, since shares of such funds registered with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] are redeemed at their net asset value.

The NAV may be below the market price for the following reasons:\n\n* Accounting principles and bases of presentation of amounts in [[financial statement]]s differ worldwide, blurring the comparability of companies in various jurisdictions.  Financial statement values are typically recorded based on their local jurisdiction's related principles of accounting, which affect all the remaining points below.\n* The current value of a company's assets likely differ from the historical cost reflected in the financial statements used in NAV calculations.\n* The NAV describes the company's current asset and liability position. Investors might believe that the company has significant growth prospects, in which case they would be prepared to pay more for the company than its NAV.\n* Certain assets, such as [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] (which broadly represents a company's ability to make future profits), are not necessarily included on a [[balance sheet]] and so will not appear in an NAV calculation.\n\nA company's market value will not always be greater than its NAV. For example, analysts and management estimated that [[Liberty Media Corporation]] was trading for 30-50% below its net asset value (or \"core asset value\") in June 2007.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Where a company's market value is lower than its NAV, it may be considered more profitable to wind the company down and sell off its assets individually rather than continue to run it as a [[going concern]].\n\nIn contrast to fund valuation, the assets of a company will generally be valued for the purpose of a NAV calculation using the [[book value]], the [[historical cost]], or the [[amortization|amortised]] cost of the company's assets, or an appropriate combination of the three.\n\n==Real estate investment trusts==\nNAV is one of the valuation indices of [[real estate investment trust]]s (REITs, pronounced \"Reets\"). NAV is normally quoted \"per investment unit\" where the value is divided by the number of total outstanding investment units. In simple terms, NAV is an adjusted net asset value reflecting the market values of real estate properties held by an investment corporation. The degree of premium/discount on individual investment unit prices relative to the per-unit NAV serves as the yardstick for assessment. The NAV index is synonymous to the adjusted [[price-to-book ratio]] in which factors such as unrealized losses/gains of owned properties and brand values are reflected. News companies such as PropertyMall typically report on a REIT's NAV when the company reports it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/24597 |title=Hammerson - General |publisher=Propertymall.com |accessdate=2012-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320162239/http://www.propertymall.com/press/article/24597 |archivedate=2012-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n==Variable insurance and variable annuity contracts==\n[[Variable universal life insurance]] policies and [[variable annuity]] contracts often are structured somewhat similarly to mutual funds, and they may vary in value as securities and markets fluctuate. Typically, these [[insurance]] or [[annuity]] products issue \"units\" of ownership to policyholders/annuitants in exchange for their investment\u2014similar to shares of a mutual fund. Also similar to a fund, the assets, liabilities, and net assets of these product entities are valued periodically, resulting in an asset unit value or AUV or UAV per share, which is similar to NAV for a fund.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Net assets]]\n* [[Assets under management]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Investment-management}}\n{{Financial markets navigation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Net Asset Value}}\n[[Category:Investment management]]\n", "name_user": "Aloksant", "label": "safe", "comment": "NAV", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_asset_value"}

Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.\n\nA record nine out of 50 state governorships have been held by women since [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as governor of South Dakota on January 5, 2019. This ties a record previously met on two different occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]], and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]]. The U.S. [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[District of Columbia]], though not states, have also had female chief executives: Governors [[Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]], and Mayors [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]] and [[Muriel Bowser]], respectively. Additionally, [[Lou Leon Guerrero]] has served as the governor of [[Guam]] since January 2019.\n\nAs of 2019, a total of 20 states have never had a female governor.

Arizona was the first state where a woman followed another woman as governor (they were from different parties). Arizona also has had the most female governors with a total of four, and is the first state to have three women in a row serve as governor.\n\nA record nine out of 50 state governorships have been held by women since [[Kristi Noem]] was inaugurated as governor of South Dakota on January 5, 2019. This ties a record previously met on two different occasions: first, between December 4, 2006, when [[Sarah Palin]] was inaugurated as the first female governor of [[Alaska]], and January 14, 2008, when [[Kathleen Blanco]] left office as governor of [[Louisiana]], and second, between January 10, 2009, when [[Beverly Perdue]] was inaugurated as governor of [[North Carolina]], and January 20, 2009, when [[Ruth Ann Minner]] retired as governor of [[Delaware]]. The U.S. [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[District of Columbia]], though not states, have also had female chief executives: Governors [[Sila Mar\u00eda Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]], and Mayors [[Sharon Pratt Kelly]] and [[Muriel Bowser]], respectively. Additionally, [[Lou Leon Guerrero]] has served as the governor of [[Guam]] since January 2019.\n\nAs of 2019, a total of 20 states have never had a female governor. Those states are: [[Arkansas]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Maryland]], [[Minnesota]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[Nevada]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[North Dakota]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wisconsin]].
