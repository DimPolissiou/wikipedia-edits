By 1987, more than a dozen [[non-strict]], purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was [[proprietary software]]. At the conference on [[Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture]] (FPCA '87) in [[Portland, Oregon]], there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an [[open standard]] for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing [[functional languages]] into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}}\n\n=== Haskell 1.0 to 1.4 ===\n<!-- To do: Describe the change-over in I/O, from lazy streams to monads. -->\n\nThe first version of Haskell (\"Haskell 1.0\") was defined in 1990.{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007}} The committee's efforts resulted in a series of language definitions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).\n\n[[File:Base-classes.svg|thumb|right|[[Type class]]es originated in Haskell]]\n\n=== Haskell 98 ===\n\nIn late 1997, the series culminated in ''Haskell 98'', intended to specify a stable, minimal, portable version of the language and an accompanying standard [[library (computer science)|library]] for teaching, and as a base for future extensions. The committee expressly welcomed creating extensions and variants of Haskell 98 via adding and incorporating experimental features.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}}\n\nIn February 1999, the Haskell 98 language standard was originally published as ''The Haskell 98 Report''.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}} In January 2003, a revised version was published as ''Haskell 98 Language and Libraries: The Revised Report''.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003}} The language continues to evolve rapidly, with the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]] (GHC) implementation representing the current ''de facto'' standard.<ref name=HaskellWikiImpl>{{cite web|title=Haskell Wiki: Implementations|url=http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Implementations|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Haskell 2010 ===\n\n[[File:Tagged_union_tree.svg|thumb|Haskell supports both sum types and product types]]\n\nIn early 2006, the process of defining a successor to the Haskell 98 standard, informally named ''Haskell Prime'', began.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prime.haskell.org/|title=Welcome to Haskell'|work=The Haskell' Wiki}}</ref> This was intended to be an ongoing incremental process to revise the language definition, producing a new revision up to once per year.  The first revision, named '''Haskell 2010''', was announced in November 2009<ref name=\"2010ann\"/> and published in July 2010.\n\nHaskell 2010 is an incremental update to the language, mostly incorporating several well-used and uncontroversial features previously enabled via compiler-specific flags.\n* Hierarchical module names. Module names are allowed to consist of dot-separated sequences of capitalised identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a hierarchical manner (e.g., <code>Data.List</code> instead of <code>List</code>), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used.\n* The [[foreign function interface]] (FFI) allows bindings to other programming languages. Only bindings to [[C (programming language)|C]] are specified in the Report, but the design allows for other language bindings. To support this, data type declarations were permitted to contain no constructors, enabling robust nonce types for foreign data that could not be constructed in Haskell. This extension was also previously specified in an Addendum to the Haskell 98 Report and widely used.\n* So-called ''n''+''k'' patterns (definitions of the form <code>fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n</code>) were no longer allowed. This [[syntactic sugar]] had misleading semantics, in which the code looked like it used the <code>(+)</code> operator, but in fact desugared to code using <code>(-)</code> and <code>(>=)</code>.\n* The rules of [[type inference]] were relaxed to allow more programs to type check.\n* Some [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] issues (changes in the formal grammar) were fixed: pattern guards were added, allowing pattern matching within guards; resolution of [[Order of operations|operator fixity]] was specified in a simpler way that reflected actual practice; an edge case in the interaction of the language's [[lexical syntax]] of operators and comments was addressed; and the interaction of do-notation and if-then-else was tweaked to eliminate unexpected syntax errors.\n* The <code>LANGUAGE</code> [[Directive (programming)|pragma]] was specified. By 2010 dozens of extensions to the language were in wide use, and GHC (among other compilers) provided the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma to specify individual extensions with a list of identifiers. Haskell 2010 compilers are required to support the <code>Haskell2010</code> extension, and are encouraged to support several others which correspond to extensions added in Haskell 2010. \n*The most significant language changes represented in the diagram: [https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-history History of Haskell].\n\n== Features ==\n{{Main|Haskell features}}\n{{See also|Glasgow Haskell Compiler#Extensions to Haskell}}\n\n[[File:Black-box-strictness.png|thumb|right|Haskell features lazy evaluation of expressions, that is, 'call by need']]\n\nHaskell features [[lazy evaluation]], lambda expressions, [[pattern matching]], [[list comprehension]], [[type class]]es and [[type polymorphism]]. It is a [[purely functional language]], which means that functions generally have no [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]]. A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, [[Orthogonal#Computer science|orthogonal]] to the type of functions. A pure function can return a side effect that is subsequently executed, modeling the [[Pure function#Impure functions|impure functions]] of other languages.\n\nHaskell has a [[strongly typed programming language|strong]], [[static type#Static typing|static]] type system based on [[Hindley\u2013Milner type inference]]. Its principal innovation in this area is type classes, originally conceived as a principled way to add [[Polymorphism (computer science)|overloading]] to the language,<ref name=\"wadler89\">{{cite journal|last1=Wadler|first1=P.|first2=S. |last2=Blott|year=1989|title=How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad hoc|journal=Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|pages=60\u201376|doi=10.1145/75277.75283|isbn=978-0-89791-294-5}}</ref> but since finding many more uses.<ref name=\"hallgren01\">{{cite journal|last=Hallgren|first=T.|date=January 2001|title=Fun with Functional Dependencies, or Types as Values in Static Computations in Haskell|journal=Proceedings of the Joint CS/CE Winter Meeting|location=Varberg, Sweden|url=http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hallgren/Papers/wm01.html}}</ref>\n\nThe construct that represents side effects is an example of a [[Monad (functional programming)|monad]]. Monads are a general framework that can model different kinds of computation, including error handling, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterminism]], [[parsing]] and [[software transactional memory]]. Monads are defined as ordinary datatypes, but Haskell provides some [[syntactic sugar]] for their use.\n\nHaskell has an open, published specification,{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003}} and [[#Implementations|multiple implementations exist]].

It is implemented using [[attribute grammar]]s and is currently used mostly for research on generated type systems and language extensions.\n\nImplementations no longer actively maintained include:\n* The Haskell User's Gofer System ([[Hugs]]) is a [[bytecode]] interpreter. It was once one of the implementations used most widely, alongside the GHC compiler,{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007|pp=12\u201322}} but has now been mostly replaced by GHCi. It also comes with a graphics library.\n* HBC is an early implementation supporting Haskell 1.4. It was implemented by [[Lennart Augustsson]] in, and based on, [[Lazy ML]]. It has not been actively developed for some time.\n* nhc98 is a bytecode compiler focusing on minimizing memory use.\n** The York Haskell Compiler ([[Yhc]]) was a fork of nhc98, with the goals of being simpler, more portable and efficient, and integrating support for Hat, the Haskell tracer. It also had a [[JavaScript]] backend, allowing users to run Haskell programs in [[web browser]]s.\n\nImplementations not fully Haskell 98 compliant, and using a variant Haskell language, include:\n* Eta and Frege are dialects of Haskell targeting the [[Java virtual machine|Java Virtual Machine]].\n* [[Gofer (software)|Gofer]] was an educational dialect of Haskell, with a feature called ''constructor classes'', developed by Mark Jones. It was supplanted by Hugs (Haskell User's Gofer System).\n* Helium, a newer dialect of Haskell. The focus is on making learning easier via clearer error messages.

By 1987, more than a dozen [[non-strict]], purely functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but it was [[proprietary software]]. At the conference on [[Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture]] (FPCA '87) in [[Portland, Oregon]], there was a strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an [[open standard]] for such languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing [[functional languages]] into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in functional-language design.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}}\n\n=== Haskell 1.0 to 1.4 ===\n<!-- To do: Describe the change-over in I/O, from lazy streams to monads. -->\n\nThe first version of Haskell (\"Haskell 1.0\") was defined in 1990.{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007}} The committee's efforts resulted in a series of language definitions (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4).\n\n[[File:Base-classes.svg|thumb|right|[[Type class]]es originated in Haskell]]\n\n=== Haskell 98 ===\n\nIn late 1997, the series culminated in ''Haskell 98'', intended to specify a stable, minimal, portable version of the language and an accompanying standard [[library (computer science)|library]] for teaching, and as a base for future extensions. The committee expressly welcomed creating extensions and variants of Haskell 98 via adding and incorporating experimental features.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}}\n\nIn February 1999, the Haskell 98 language standard was originally published as ''The Haskell 98 Report''.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003|loc=Preface}} In January 2003, a revised version was published as ''Haskell 98 Language and Libraries: The Revised Report''.{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003}} The language continues to evolve rapidly, with the [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler]] (GHC) implementation representing the current ''de facto'' standard.<ref name=HaskellWikiImpl>{{cite web|title=Haskell Wiki: Implementations|url=http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Implementations|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Haskell 2010 ===\n\n[[File:Tagged_union_tree.svg|thumb|Haskell supports both sum types and product types]]\n\nIn early 2006, the process of defining a successor to the Haskell 98 standard, informally named ''Haskell Prime'', began.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prime.haskell.org/|title=Welcome to Haskell'|work=The Haskell' Wiki}}</ref> This was intended to be an ongoing incremental process to revise the language definition, producing a new revision up to once per year.  The first revision, named '''Haskell 2010''', was announced in November 2009<ref name=\"2010ann\"/> and published in July 2010.\n\nHaskell 2010 is an incremental update to the language, mostly incorporating several well-used and uncontroversial features previously enabled via compiler-specific flags.\n* Hierarchical module names. Module names are allowed to consist of dot-separated sequences of capitalised identifiers, rather than only one such identifier. This lets modules be named in a hierarchical manner (e.g., <code>Data.List</code> instead of <code>List</code>), although technically modules are still in a single monolithic namespace. This extension was specified in an addendum to Haskell 98 and was in practice universally used.\n* The [[foreign function interface]] (FFI) allows bindings to other programming languages. Only bindings to [[C (programming language)|C]] are specified in the Report, but the design allows for other language bindings. To support this, data type declarations were permitted to contain no constructors, enabling robust nonce types for foreign data that could not be constructed in Haskell. This extension was also previously specified in an Addendum to the Haskell 98 Report and widely used.\n* So-called ''n''+''k'' patterns (definitions of the form <code>fact (n+1) = (n+1) * fact n</code>) were no longer allowed. This [[syntactic sugar]] had misleading semantics, in which the code looked like it used the <code>(+)</code> operator, but in fact desugared to code using <code>(-)</code> and <code>(>=)</code>.\n* The rules of [[type inference]] were relaxed to allow more programs to type check.\n* Some [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] issues (changes in the formal grammar) were fixed: pattern guards were added, allowing pattern matching within guards; resolution of [[Order of operations|operator fixity]] was specified in a simpler way that reflected actual practice; an edge case in the interaction of the language's [[lexical syntax]] of operators and comments was addressed; and the interaction of do-notation and if-then-else was tweaked to eliminate unexpected syntax errors.\n* The <code>LANGUAGE</code> [[Directive (programming)|pragma]] was specified. By 2010 dozens of extensions to the language were in wide use, and GHC (among other compilers) provided the <code>LANGUAGE</code> pragma to specify individual extensions with a list of identifiers. Haskell 2010 compilers are required to support the <code>Haskell2010</code> extension, and are encouraged to support several others which correspond to extensions added in Haskell 2010. \n*The most significant language changes represented in the diagram: [https://serokell.io/blog/haskell-history History of Haskell].\n\n== Features ==\n{{Main|Haskell features}}\n{{See also|Glasgow Haskell Compiler#Extensions to Haskell}}\n\n[[File:Black-box-strictness.png|thumb|right|Haskell features lazy evaluation of expressions, that is, 'call by need']]\n\nHaskell features [[lazy evaluation]], lambda expressions, [[pattern matching]], [[list comprehension]], [[type class]]es and [[type polymorphism]]. It is a [[purely functional language]], which means that functions generally have no [[Side effect (computer science)|side effects]]. A distinct construct exists to represent side effects, [[Orthogonal#Computer science|orthogonal]] to the type of functions. A pure function can return a side effect that is subsequently executed, modeling the [[Pure function#Impure functions|impure functions]] of other languages.\n\nHaskell has a [[strongly typed programming language|strong]], [[static type#Static typing|static]] type system based on [[Hindley\u2013Milner type inference]]. Its principal innovation in this area is type classes, originally conceived as a principled way to add [[Polymorphism (computer science)|overloading]] to the language,<ref name=\"wadler89\">{{cite journal|last1=Wadler|first1=P.|first2=S. |last2=Blott|year=1989|title=How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad hoc|journal=Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|pages=60\u201376|doi=10.1145/75277.75283|isbn=978-0-89791-294-5}}</ref> but since finding many more uses.<ref name=\"hallgren01\">{{cite journal|last=Hallgren|first=T.|date=January 2001|title=Fun with Functional Dependencies, or Types as Values in Static Computations in Haskell|journal=Proceedings of the Joint CS/CE Winter Meeting|location=Varberg, Sweden|url=http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hallgren/Papers/wm01.html}}</ref>\n\nThe construct that represents side effects is an example of a [[Monad (functional programming)|monad]]. Monads are a general framework that can model different kinds of computation, including error handling, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|nondeterminism]], [[parsing]] and [[software transactional memory]]. Monads are defined as ordinary datatypes, but Haskell provides some [[syntactic sugar]] for their use.\n\nHaskell has an open, published specification,{{sfn|Peyton Jones|2003}} and [[#Implementations|multiple implementations exist]].

GHC is also distributed with the [[Haskell platform]].\n* Jhc, a Haskell compiler written by John Meacham, emphasizes speed and efficiency of generated programs and exploring new program transformations. \n** Ajhc is a fork of Jhc.\n* LHC is a whole-program optimizing backend for GHC, based on Urban Boquist's compiler intermediate language, GRIN.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boquist |first=Urban |author2=Johnsson, Thomas |title=The GRIN Project: A Highly Optimising Back End for Lazy Functional Languages |journal=LNCS |year=1996 |volume=1268 |pages=58\u201384}}</ref> Older versions of LHC were based on Jhc rather than GHC.\n* The Utrecht Haskell Compiler (UHC) is a Haskell implementation from [[Utrecht University]].<ref>[http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/UHC Utrecht Haskell Compiler]</ref> It supports almost all Haskell 98 features plus many experimental extensions. It is implemented using [[attribute grammar]]s and is currently used mostly for research on generated type systems and language extensions.\n\nImplementations no longer actively maintained include:\n* The Haskell User's Gofer System ([[Hugs]]) is a [[bytecode]] interpreter. It was once one of the implementations used most widely, alongside the GHC compiler,{{sfn|Hudak|Hughes|Peyton Jones|Wadler|2007|pp=12\u201322}} but has now been mostly replaced by GHCi. It also comes with a graphics library.\n* HBC is an early implementation supporting Haskell 1.4. It was implemented by [[Lennart Augustsson]] in, and based on, [[Lazy ML]]. It has not been actively developed for some time.\n* nhc98 is a bytecode compiler focusing on minimizing memory use.\n** The York Haskell Compiler ([[Yhc]]) was a fork of nhc98, with the goals of being simpler, more portable and efficient, and integrating support for Hat, the Haskell tracer. It also had a [[JavaScript]] backend, allowing users to run Haskell programs in [[web browser]]s.\n\nImplementations not fully Haskell 98 compliant, and using a variant Haskell language, include:\n* Eta and Frege are dialects of Haskell targeting the [[Java virtual machine|Java Virtual Machine]].\n* [[Gofer (software)|Gofer]] was an educational dialect of Haskell, with a feature called ''constructor classes'', developed by Mark Jones. It was supplanted by Hugs (Haskell User's Gofer System).\n* Helium, a newer dialect of Haskell. The focus is on making learning easier via clearer error messages.
