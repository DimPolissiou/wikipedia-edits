He was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945, when he led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]], and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], for most of his career he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895, and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo\u2013Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], then as [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], and finally [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Britain's Middle East policy. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he became prime minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Bombing of Dresden]] and his wartime response to the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine]] generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]], and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in Britain and throughout [[Western world|the West]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] from the spread of [[fascism]]. Praised as a social reformer and accomplished writer, among his many awards was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Conversely, his imperialist views and comments on race, as well as his sanctioning of human rights abuses in the suppression of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements seeking independence from the [[British Empire]], have generated considerable controversy.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and schooling: 1874\u20131895===\n[[File:Blenheim Palace from the Water Terraces October 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blenheim Palace]], Churchill's ancestral home and his birthplace]]\nChurchill was born at the family's ancestral home, [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Oxfordshire]], on 30 November 1874,{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=5}} at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power.{{sfn|Best|2001|p=1}} Direct descendants of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]], his family were among the highest levels of the British aristocracy,{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=3, 5}} and thus he was born into the country's governing elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=2|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=2}} His paternal grandfather, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], had been a Member of Parliament (MP) for ten years, a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who served in the government of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]].{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2pp=7\u20138}} His own father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], had been elected Conservative MP for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Best|2y=2001|2p=3|3a1=Jenkins|3y=2001|3p=4|4a1=Robbins|4y=2014|4p=2}} His mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Churchill]] (n\u00e9e Jerome), was from an American family whose substantial wealth derived from finance.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=5\u20136|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=7}} The couple had met in August 1873, and were engaged three days later, marrying at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]] in April 1874.{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1pp=5, 7|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9|3a1=Robbins|3y=2014|3p=2}} The couple lived beyond their income and were frequently in debt;{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=6\u20137}} according to the biographer [[Sebastian Haffner]], the family were \"rich by normal standards but poor by those of the rich\".{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Churchill 1881 ZZZ 7555D.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill, aged six, in 1881{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=4}}]]\nIn 1876 John Spencer-Churchill was appointed [[Viceroy of Ireland]], with Randolph as his private secretary, resulting in the Churchill family's relocation to [[Dublin]], when [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the entirety of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9}} It was here that Jennie's second son, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill|Jack]], was born in 1880;{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=7|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=10}} there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and during this time she had many suitors.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=8}} Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father;{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=10|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=13}} referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that \"I loved her dearly\u2014but at a distance.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=8|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} His relationship with Jack was warm.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} In Dublin, the brothers were cared for primarily by their nanny, [[Elizabeth Everest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=10|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} Churchill nicknamed her \"Woomany\",{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=16, 29}} and later wrote that \"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived.\"{{sfn|Best|2001|p=6}}\n\nAged seven, he began [[boarding school|boarding]] at [[St. George's School, Ascot|St. George's School]] in [[Ascot, Berkshire]];

Churchill later claimed that, on learning of his appointment, the Board of the Admiralty sent a signal to the Fleet: \"Winston is back\".{{sfn|Churchill|1967b|p=7}} Although this story was repeated by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] in a speech at [[Edmonton]] in 1966, [[Richard Langworth]] notes that neither he nor Churchill's official biographer [[Martin Gilbert]] have found contemporary evidence to confirm it, suggesting that it may well be a later invention.{{sfn|Langworth|2008|p=581}}\n\nAs First Lord, Churchill proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called \"[[Phoney War]]\", when the only significant action was at sea and in the [[Russo-Finnish War|USSR's attack on Finland]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} He was concerned about German naval activity in the [[Baltic Sea]] and initially planned to send a naval force there but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed [[Operation Wilfred]], to mine Norwegian waters and stop [[iron ore]] shipments from [[Narvik]] to Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} There were disagreements about mining, both in the war cabinet and with the French government. As a result, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the successful [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]] was launched.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=573\u2013574}}\n\n==Prime Minister: 1940\u20131945==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Winston Churchill]], [[First prime ministership of Winston Churchill]], [[Premiership of Winston Churchill]], [[Prime ministership of Winston Churchill]] -->\n{{for timeline|Timeline of the first premiership of Winston Churchill}}\n{{further|Churchill war ministry}}\n{{See also|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British Empire in World War II}}\n\n===The Norway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation===\nAfter the [[Norwegian campaign|Allies failed to prevent]] the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held an open debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war.

He was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his own prestige.{{sfn|Shakespeare|2017|pp=299\u2013300}} Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=582}}\n\nIn the early hours of 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their [[Battle of France|assault on France]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but Labour declared on the Friday afternoon that they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been decided at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]], the government [[Chief Whip]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Halifax had admitted that he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords and so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became prime minister.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=586}} His first act was to write to Chamberlain and thank him for his support.<ref>{{cite book |last=Self |first=Robert |title=Neville Chamberlain: A Biography |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |page=431 |isbn=978-0-75-465615-9}}</ref>\n\nChurchill later wrote of feeling a profound sense of relief in that he now had authority over the whole scene.

In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=587\u2013588}}{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|pp=26\u201329}} The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed and there were significant additions later in 1940 when it was increased to eight after Churchill, Attlee and Greenwood were joined by [[Ernest Bevin]] as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour and National Service]]; [[Anthony Eden]] as Foreign Secretary \u2013 replacing Halifax, who was sent to Washington D.C. as ambassador to the United States; [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] as [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]; Sir [[Kingsley Wood]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] as Lord President of the Council \u2013 replacing Chamberlain who died in November (Anderson later became Chancellor after Kingsley Wood's death in September 1943). In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}}\n\nChurchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government. Among these were personal friends like Beaverbrook and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who became the government's scientific advisor.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}} Lindemann was one of several outside exports drafted in and these \"technocrats\" fulfilled vital functions, especially on the Home Front.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}} Churchill would proudly proclaim that his government, in the interests of national unity, was the most broadly based in British political history as it spanned far right to far left by including such figures as [[George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd|Lord Lloyd]] on the right and [[Ellen Wilkinson]] on the left.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}}\n\n====Resolve to fight on====\n{{main|War cabinet crisis, May 1940}}\nAt the end of May, with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in retreat to [[Dunkirk]] and the [[Fall of France]] seemingly imminent, Halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using [[Mussolini]] as an intermediary given that Italy was still neutral. There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]]. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over. The essence of Churchill's argument was that, as he said, \"it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out\".<ref name=\"Schneer2015\">{{cite book|last=Schneer|first=Jonathan |title=Ministers at War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT28|date=2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-614-2|pages=28\u201331}}</ref> He therefore concluded that the only option was to fight on though, at times, he personally was pessimistic about the chances of a British victory, as on 12 June 1940 when he told General [[Hastings Ismay]] that \"[y]ou and I will be dead in three months' time\".{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=249, 252\u2013255}} Nonetheless, his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British people for a long war.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=616\u2013646}}\n\n====Importance of Churchill's speeches====\n[[File:Churchill CCathedral H 14250.jpg|thumb|Churchill walks through the ruins of [[Coventry Cathedral]] with [[Alfred Robert Grindlay]], 1941]]\n[[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen from Dunkirk, ended on Tuesday, 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and it gave rise to a popular view that Dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=597}} Churchill himself referred to \"a miracle of deliverance\" in his \"[[We shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech to the Commons that afternoon, though he shortly reminded everyone that: \"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.

His first as prime minister was the famous \"I have nothing to offer but [[blood, toil, tears, and sweat]]\" speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament \"electrifying\". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s \"was now listening, and cheering\".{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=513, 515\u2013517}} Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous speeches, given just before the [[Battle of Britain]].

Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the [[National Government (United Kingdom)#the caretaker government of 1945|National Government]], like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]]. The government contained Conservatives, [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] and a few non-party figures such as [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] and [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]], but not Labour or [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]].

Clementine, who together with their daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate), returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\" he retorted that \"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book ''The Struggle for Survival'') commiserated with him on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which Churchill replied \"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time.\" Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=57, 107\u2013109}} Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=789\u2013794}} Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=113}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 July, Churchill held a farewell Cabinet.

Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over.

These ministerial merits are not as common as might be thought.\"{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Winston churchil statue in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Churchill in Yael's Garden, [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim|Mishkanot Sha'ananim]], Jerusalem.]]\n\nChurchill's belief in the superiority of white Europeans, a widespread view among his contemporaries, has generated accusations of [[racism]].<ref name=\"heyden\">{{cite news|title=The 10 Greatest Controversies of Winston Churchill's Career |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 |date=26 January 2015 |website=BBC News |last1=Heyden |first1=Tom |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> His role in the Bengal Famine has been one source of particular criticism;<ref name=\"Churchill_hero_villain\"/> the historian Walter Reid has stated Churchill was \"very wrong in relation to India, where his conduct fell far below his usual level.\"<ref name=\"Churchill_look_Raj\">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/A-new-look-at-the-Raj/article16932292.ece |title=A New Look at the Raj |website=The Hindu |first=Varma |last=Nikhil |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1966 and 1988, an eight-volume biography of Churchill was published, started by Randolph Churchill but completed largely by [[Martin Gilbert]] after the former's death in 1968.{{sfnm|1a1=Rhodes James|1y=1970|1p=x|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=xv}} Rhodes James suggested that this [[official biography]] was a \"labour of love\" for Randolph Churchill, and that \"what was so admirable in the son, was ... less desirable in the biographer.\"{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|p=x}} By 1980, there was already a very extensive published array of material on Churchill.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=23}}\n\nChurchill's legacy continues to stir intense debate among writers and historians.<ref name=\"Churchill_hero_villain\"/> In 1980, Addison noted that there are many people \"so prejudiced for or against Churchill\" that they had no interest in critically assessing him as a historical figure.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=23}} In 2018, the broadcaster [[Afua Hirsch]] described encounters with two historians who were concerned that researching more controversial elements of Churchill's life would hinder their academic career.<ref name=\"hirsch\">{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/russia-propaganda-skripal-britain-churchill | title= If you talk about Russian propaganda, remember: Britain has myths too | work=The Guardian | date=21 March 2018 | accessdate=15 April 2018 | location=London | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}</ref>\n\nChurchill has been honoured throughout the Commonwealth, particularly in Canada.

He was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945, when he led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]], and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], for most of his career he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895, and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo\u2013Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], then as [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], and finally [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Britain's Middle East policy. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he became prime minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Bombing of Dresden]] and his wartime response to the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine]] generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]], and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in Britain and throughout [[Western world|the West]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] from the spread of [[fascism]]. Praised as a social reformer and accomplished writer, among his many awards was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Conversely, his imperialist views and comments on race, as well as his sanctioning of human rights abuses in the suppression of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements seeking independence from the [[British Empire]], have generated considerable controversy.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and schooling: 1874\u20131895===\n[[File:Blenheim Palace from the Water Terraces October 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blenheim Palace]], Churchill's ancestral home and his birthplace]]\nChurchill was born at the family's ancestral home, [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Oxfordshire]], on 30 November 1874,{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=5}} at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power.{{sfn|Best|2001|p=1}} Direct descendants of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]], his family were among the highest levels of the British aristocracy,{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=3, 5}} and thus he was born into the country's governing elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=2|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=2}} His paternal grandfather, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], had been a Member of Parliament (MP) for ten years, a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who served in the government of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]].{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2pp=7\u20138}} His own father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], had been elected Conservative MP for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Best|2y=2001|2p=3|3a1=Jenkins|3y=2001|3p=4|4a1=Robbins|4y=2014|4p=2}} His mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Churchill]] (n\u00e9e Jerome), was from an American family whose substantial wealth derived from finance.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=5\u20136|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=7}} The couple had met in August 1873, and were engaged three days later, marrying at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]] in April 1874.{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1pp=5, 7|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9|3a1=Robbins|3y=2014|3p=2}} The couple lived beyond their income and were frequently in debt;{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=6\u20137}} according to the biographer [[Sebastian Haffner]], the family were \"rich by normal standards but poor by those of the rich\".{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Churchill 1881 ZZZ 7555D.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill, aged six, in 1881{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=4}}]]\nIn 1876 John Spencer-Churchill was appointed [[Viceroy of Ireland]], with Randolph as his private secretary, resulting in the Churchill family's relocation to [[Dublin]], when [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the entirety of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9}} It was here that Jennie's second son, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill|Jack]], was born in 1880;{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=7|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=10}} there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and during this time she had many suitors.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=8}} Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father;{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=10|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=13}} referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that \"I loved her dearly\u2014but at a distance.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=8|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} His relationship with Jack was warm.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} In Dublin, the brothers were cared for primarily by their nanny, [[Elizabeth Everest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=10|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} Churchill nicknamed her \"Woomany\",{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=16, 29}} and later wrote that \"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived.\"{{sfn|Best|2001|p=6}}\n\nAged seven, he began [[boarding school|boarding]] at [[St. George's School, Ascot|St. George's School]] in [[Ascot, Berkshire]];

In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}}\n\nChurchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government.

There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]]. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over.

Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the [[National Government (United Kingdom)#the caretaker government of 1945|National Government]], like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]]. The government contained Conservatives, [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] and a few non-party figures such as [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] and [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]], but not Labour or [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]]. Although Churchill continued to carry out the functions of Prime Minister, including exchanging messages with the US administration about the upcoming [[Potsdam Conference]], he was not formally reappointed until 28 May.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=22\u201323, 27}}\n\nAlthough polling day was 5 July, the results of the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. Clementine, who together with their daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate), returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\" he retorted that \"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book ''The Struggle for Survival'') commiserated with him on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which Churchill replied \"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time.\" Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=57, 107\u2013109}} Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=789\u2013794}} Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=113}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 July, Churchill held a farewell Cabinet. On the way out of the Cabinet Room he told Eden: \"Thirty years of my life have been passed in this room. I shall never sit in it again. You will, but I shall not\".

Being a strong proponent of Britain as an [[power in international relations|international power]], Churchill would often meet such moments with [[direct action]].

The Truman Administration was supporting the plans for a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), hoping that this would allow controlled West German rearmament and enable American troop reductions. Churchill affected to believe that the proposed EDC would not work, scoffing at the supposed difficulties of language. Churchill asked in vain for a US military commitment to support Britain's position in Egypt and the Middle East (where the Truman Administration had recently pressured Attlee not to intervene against [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mossadeq]] in Iran); this did not meet with American approval\u2014the US expected British support to fight communism in [[Korean War|Korea]], but saw any US commitment to the Middle East as supporting British imperialism, and were unpersuaded that this would help prevent pro-Soviet regimes from coming to power.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|p=255}}\n\nBy early 1953, the Cabinet's foreign policy priority was [[Egypt]] and the nationalist, anti-imperialist [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|Egyptian Revolution]].

Egypt had been a [[History of Egypt under the British|British client state]], under varying degrees of control and military occupation, since 1883. In 1953 Britain, keen to restore friendly relations, agreed to terminate her rule in the Sudan by 1956 in return for Egypt's abandoning of her own claim over the region. In October 1954, Britain and Egypt would conclude an agreement on the phased evacuation of British troops from the Suez base, to the dismay\u2014privately shared by Churchill\u2014of the \"Suez Group\" of Conservative backbenchers.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=261, 277, 285}}\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Churchill, the last of the wartime Big Three, wrote to [[Dwight D.

Eden wrote to his son on 10 April \"W gets daily older & is apt to ... waste a great deal of time ... the outside world has little idea how difficult that becomes. Please make me retire before I am 80!\" However, Eden's serious illness (he nearly died after a series of botched operations on his bile duct) allowed Churchill to take control of foreign affairs from April 1953.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=263\u2013265}}<ref>Gilbert, Martin.

The US Embassy in London noted that this was a rare occasion on which Churchill did not mention Anglo-American solidarity in a speech. Ministers like [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (acting Foreign Secretary) and [[Anthony Nutting|Nutting]] were concerned at the irritation caused to the Americans and the French, although [[Selwyn Lloyd]] supported Churchill's initiative, as did most Conservatives.

Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, and by the end of June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair. He joked that news of his illness had chased the trial of [[John Christie (murderer)|the serial killer John Christie]] off the front pages.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=846\u201357}}{{sfn|Charmley|1995|p=266}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=868\u2013871}}\n\n[[File:Churchill queen Elizabeth 1953.jpg|thumb|Churchill with Queen [[Elizabeth II]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], 10 February 1953.]]\nChurchill was still keen to pursue a meeting with the Soviets and was open to the idea of a reunified Germany. He refused to condemn the Soviet crushing of East Germany, commenting on 10 July 1953 that \"The Russians were surprisingly patient about the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|disturbances in East Germany]]\". He thought this might have been the reason for the removal of [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=863}} Churchill returned to public life in October 1953 to make a speech at the Conservative Party conference at [[Margate]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=868\u2013871}} In December 1953, Churchill met Eisenhower in Bermuda.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=936\u2013937}}\n\nChurchill was annoyed about friction between Eden and Dulles (June 1954). On the trip home from another Anglo-American conference, the diplomat [[Pierson Dixon]] compared [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|US actions in Guatemala]] to Soviet policy in Korea and [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], causing Churchill to retort that Guatemala was a \"bloody place\" he'd \"never heard of\". Churchill was still keen for a trip to Moscow, and threatened to resign, provoking a crisis in the Cabinet when Lord Salisbury threatened to resign if Churchill had his way. In the end the Soviets proposed a five-power conference, which did not meet until after Churchill had retired. By the autumn Churchill was again postponing his resignation.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=1009\u201317}}{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=289\u2013291}}\n\nEden, now partially recovered from his operations, became a major figure on the world stage in 1954, helping to negotiate [[Geneva Conference (1954)|peace]] in [[First Indochina War|Indo-China]], an agreement with Egypt and to broker an agreement between the countries of Western Europe after the French rejection of the EDC.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=298\u2013300}} Aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally, Churchill at last retired as prime minister in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden.

Despite the Conservative landslide, his own majority fell by more than a thousand. It is widely believed that as his mental and physical faculties decayed, he began to lose a battle he had supposedly long fought against depression. However, the nature, incidence and severity of Churchill's depression is uncertain.

We like to have movies that are 1,500-4,000 screens and we are chasing what the studios don't want. They're chasing much bigger. And we're going to take their crumbs and make a gourmet meal.

{"title_page": "Maximum a posteriori estimation", "text_new": "{{Bayesian statistics}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn [[Bayesian statistics]], a '''maximum a posterior probability''' ('''MAP''') '''estimate''' is an estimate of an unknown quantity, that equals the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of the [[posterior distribution]]. The MAP can be used to obtain a [[point estimation|point estimate]] of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data. It is closely related to the method of [[maximum likelihood]] (ML) estimation, but employs an augmented [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization objective]] which incorporates a [[prior distribution]] (that quantifies the additional information available through prior knowledge of a related event) over the quantity one wants to estimate.  MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] of ML estimation.\n\n==Description==\nAssume that we want to estimate an unobserved population parameter <math>\\theta</math> on the basis of observations <math>x</math>. Let <math>f</math> be the [[sampling distribution]] of <math>x</math>, so that <math>f(x\\mid\\theta)</math> is the probability of <math>x</math> when the underlying population parameter is <math>\\theta</math>.  Then the function:\n\n:<math>\\theta \\mapsto f(x \\mid \\theta) \\!</math>\n\nis known as the [[likelihood function]] and the estimate:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{MLE}}(x) = \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ f(x \\mid \\theta) \\!</math>\n\nis the maximum likelihood estimate of <math>\\theta</math>.\n\nNow assume that a [[prior distribution]] <math>g</math> over <math>\\theta</math> exists.  This allows us to treat <math>\\theta</math> as a [[random variable]] as in [[Bayesian statistics]].  We can calculate the [[posterior distribution]] of <math>\\theta</math> using [[Bayes' theorem]]:\n\n:<math>\\theta \\mapsto f(\\theta \\mid x) = \\frac{f(x \\mid \\theta) \\, g(\\theta)}{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Theta} f(x \\mid \\vartheta) \\, g(\\vartheta) \\, d\\vartheta} \\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is density function of <math>\\theta</math>, <math>\\Theta</math> is the domain of <math>g</math>.\n\nThe method of maximum a posteriori estimation then estimates <math>\\theta</math> as the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of the posterior distribution of this random variable:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}(x)\n= \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ f(\\theta \\mid x)\n= \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ \\frac{f(x \\mid \\theta) \\, g(\\theta)}\n  {\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Theta} f(x \\mid \\vartheta) \\, g(\\vartheta) \\, d\\vartheta}\n= \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ f(x \\mid \\theta) \\, g(\\theta).\n\\!</math>\n\nThe denominator of the posterior distribution (so-called [[marginal likelihood]]) is always positive and does not depend on <math>\\theta</math> and therefore plays no role in the optimization. Observe that the MAP estimate of <math>\\theta</math> coincides with the ML estimate when the prior <math>g</math> is uniform (that is, a [[constant function]]).\n\nWhen the [[loss function]] is of the form\n\n:<math>\nL(\\theta, a) = \n\\begin{cases}\n0, & \\text{if } |a-\\theta|<c, \\\\\n1, & \\text{otherwise}, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nas <math>c</math> goes to 0, the [[Bayes estimator]] approaches the MAP estimator, provided that the distribution of <math>\\theta</math> is quasi-concave.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bassett|first=Robert|last2=Deride|first2=Julio|date=2018-01-30|title=Maximum a posteriori estimators as a limit of Bayes estimators|journal=Mathematical Programming|language=en|pages=1\u201316|doi=10.1007/s10107-018-1241-0|issn=0025-5610|arxiv=1611.05917}}</ref> But generally a MAP estimator is not a [[Bayes estimator]] unless <math>\\theta</math> is [[discrete random variable|discrete]].\n\n== Computation ==\nMAP estimates can be computed in several ways:\n# Analytically, when the mode(s) of the posterior distribution can be given in [[closed-form solution|closed form]].  This is the case when [[conjugate prior]]s are used.\n# Via [[numerical analysis|numerical]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] such as the [[conjugate gradient method]] or [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton's method]]. This usually requires first or second [[derivative]]s, which have to be evaluated analytically or numerically.\n# Via a modification of an [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]. This does not require derivatives of the posterior density.\n# Via a [[Monte Carlo method]] using [[simulated annealing]]\n\n==Limitations==\nWhile only mild conditions  are required for MAP estimation to be a limiting case of [[Bayes estimator|Bayes estimation]] (under the 0\u20131 loss function),<ref name=\":0\" /> it is not very representative of Bayesian methods in general.  This is because MAP estimates are point estimates, whereas Bayesian methods are characterized by the use of distributions to summarize data and draw inferences: thus, Bayesian methods tend to report the posterior [[mean]] or [[median]] instead, together with [[credible interval]]s.  This is both because these estimators are optimal under squared-error and linear-error loss respectively - which are more representative of typical [[loss function]]s - and because the posterior distribution may not have a simple analytic form: in this case, the distribution can be simulated using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] techniques, while optimization to find its mode(s) may be difficult or impossible{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.\n\n[[File:Bimodal density.svg|thumb|200px|An example of a density of a [[bimodal distribution]] in which the highest mode is uncharacteristic of the majority of the distribution]]\n\nIn many types of models, such as [[mixture model]]s, the posterior may be [[Bimodal distribution|multi-modal]]. In such a case, the usual recommendation is that one should choose the highest mode: this is not always feasible ([[global optimization]] is a difficult problem), nor in some cases even possible (such as when [[identifiability condition|identifiability]] issues arise). Furthermore, the highest mode may be uncharacteristic of the majority of the posterior.\n\nFinally, unlike ML estimators, the MAP estimate is not [[Parametrization invariance|invariant under reparameterization]]. Switching from one parameterization to another involves introducing a Jacobian that impacts on the location of the maximum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin P.|title=Machine learning : a probabilistic perspective|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0262018029|pages=151\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nAs an example of the difference between Bayes estimators mentioned above (mean and median estimators) and using a MAP estimate, consider the case where there is a  need to classify inputs <math>x</math> as either positive or negative (for example, loans as risky or safe).

The MAP can be used to obtain a [[point estimation|point estimate]] of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data. It is closely related to the method of [[maximum likelihood]] (ML) estimation, but employs an augmented [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization objective]] which incorporates a [[prior distribution]] (that quantifies the additional information available through prior knowledge of a related event) over the quantity one wants to estimate.  MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] of ML estimation.\n\n==Description==\nAssume that we want to estimate an unobserved population parameter <math>\\theta</math> on the basis of observations <math>x</math>. Let <math>f</math> be the [[sampling distribution]] of <math>x</math>, so that <math>f(x\\mid\\theta)</math> is the probability of <math>x</math> when the underlying population parameter is <math>\\theta</math>.  Then the function:\n\n:<math>\\theta \\mapsto f(x \\mid \\theta) \\!</math>\n\nis known as the [[likelihood function]] and the estimate:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{MLE}}(x) = \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ f(x \\mid \\theta) \\!</math>\n\nis the maximum likelihood estimate of <math>\\theta</math>.\n\nNow assume that a [[prior distribution]] <math>g</math> over <math>\\theta</math> exists.  This allows us to treat <math>\\theta</math> as a [[random variable]] as in [[Bayesian statistics]].  We can calculate the [[posterior distribution]] of <math>\\theta</math> using [[Bayes' theorem]]:\n\n:<math>\\theta \\mapsto f(\\theta \\mid x) = \\frac{f(x \\mid \\theta) \\, g(\\theta)}{\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Theta} f(x \\mid \\vartheta) \\, g(\\vartheta) \\, d\\vartheta} \\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is density function of <math>\\theta</math>, <math>\\Theta</math> is the domain of <math>g</math>.\n\nThe method of maximum a posteriori estimation then estimates <math>\\theta</math> as the [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of the posterior distribution of this random variable:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}(x)\n= \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ f(\\theta \\mid x)\n= \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ \\frac{f(x \\mid \\theta) \\, g(\\theta)}\n  {\\displaystyle\\int_{\\Theta} f(x \\mid \\vartheta) \\, g(\\vartheta) \\, d\\vartheta}\n= \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}} \\ f(x \\mid \\theta) \\, g(\\theta).\n\\!</math>\n\nThe denominator of the posterior distribution (so-called [[marginal likelihood]]) is always positive and does not depend on <math>\\theta</math> and therefore plays no role in the optimization. Observe that the MAP estimate of <math>\\theta</math> coincides with the ML estimate when the prior <math>g</math> is uniform (that is, a [[constant function]]).\n\nWhen the [[loss function]] is of the form\n\n:<math>\nL(\\theta, a) = \n\\begin{cases}\n0, & \\text{if } |a-\\theta|<c, \\\\\n1, & \\text{otherwise}, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nas <math>c</math> goes to 0, the [[Bayes estimator]] approaches the MAP estimator, provided that the distribution of <math>\\theta</math> is quasi-concave.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bassett|first=Robert|last2=Deride|first2=Julio|date=2018-01-30|title=Maximum a posteriori estimators as a limit of Bayes estimators|journal=Mathematical Programming|language=en|pages=1\u201316|doi=10.1007/s10107-018-1241-0|issn=0025-5610|arxiv=1611.05917}}</ref> But generally a MAP estimator is not a [[Bayes estimator]] unless <math>\\theta</math> is [[discrete random variable|discrete]].\n\n== Computation ==\nMAP estimates can be computed in several ways:\n# Analytically, when the mode(s) of the posterior distribution can be given in [[closed-form solution|closed form]].  This is the case when [[conjugate prior]]s are used.\n# Via [[numerical analysis|numerical]] [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] such as the [[conjugate gradient method]] or [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton's method]]. This usually requires first or second [[derivative]]s, which have to be evaluated analytically or numerically.\n# Via a modification of an [[expectation-maximization algorithm]]. This does not require derivatives of the posterior density.\n# Via a [[Monte Carlo method]] using [[simulated annealing]]\n\n==Limitations==\nWhile only mild conditions  are required for MAP estimation to be a limiting case of [[Bayes estimator|Bayes estimation]] (under the 0-1 loss function),<ref name=\":0\" /> it is not very representative of Bayesian methods in general.  This is because MAP estimates are point estimates, whereas Bayesian methods are characterized by the use of distributions to summarize data and draw inferences: thus, Bayesian methods tend to report the posterior [[mean]] or [[median]] instead, together with [[credible interval]]s.  This is both because these estimators are optimal under squared-error and linear-error loss respectively - which are more representative of typical [[loss function]]s - and because the posterior distribution may not have a simple analytic form: in this case, the distribution can be simulated using [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] techniques, while optimization to find its mode(s) may be difficult or impossible{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.\n\n[[File:Bimodal density.svg|thumb|200px|An example of a density of a [[bimodal distribution]] in which the highest mode is uncharacteristic of the majority of the distribution]]\n\nIn many types of models, such as [[mixture model]]s, the posterior may be [[Bimodal distribution|multi-modal]]. In such a case, the usual recommendation is that one should choose the highest mode: this is not always feasible ([[global optimization]] is a difficult problem), nor in some cases even possible (such as when [[identifiability condition|identifiability]] issues arise). Furthermore, the highest mode may be uncharacteristic of the majority of the posterior.\n\nFinally, unlike ML estimators, the MAP estimate is not [[Parametrization invariance|invariant under reparameterization]]. Switching from one parameterization to another involves introducing a Jacobian that impacts on the location of the maximum.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Kevin P.|title=Machine learning : a probabilistic perspective|date=2012|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0262018029|pages=151\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nAs an example of the difference between Bayes estimators mentioned above (mean and median estimators) and using a MAP estimate, consider the case where there is a  need to classify inputs <math>x</math> as either positive or negative (for example, loans as risky or safe).

News|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe P40 series is constructed with anodized aluminum for the frame, while the back uses Gorilla Glass on the P40 and P40 Pro or ceramic on the P40 Pro+. The display is flat on the P40 or curved on all sides on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; Huawei calls this a Quad-Curve Overflow Display. The top left corner of the display has a pill-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera and ambient/proximity sensors; it also accommodates the infrared face unlock system on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+. As on the P30 Pro, the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ replace the traditional earpiece speaker with an \"electromagnetic levitation\" speaker that vibrates the top of the phone's screen, and have an IR blaster on the top edge. The 3.5mm audio jack has also been omitted on all models. A rectangular module houses the rear cameras, which protrudes slightly from the back panel. The P40 and P40 Pro will be available in Silver Frost, Blush Gold, Deep Sea Blue, Ice White and Black, while the P40 Pro+ will be available in Ceramic White or Ceramic Black.\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Hardware ===\nThe P40 series is powered by the [[HiSilicon]] Kirin 990 5G processor, meaning that all models will have [[5G]] connectivity standard. Although 5G networks are supported, all models only supports \"sub-6\" 5G, meaning they are not compatible with ultra-fast [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter-wave (mmWave)]] networks. The Kirin 990 5G is assisted by the [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]]-G76 MP16 GPU. The P40's display is carried over from the P30, a 6.1\" (154.94mm) 19.5:9 [[1080p]]  (1080 \u00d7 2340) [[OLED]] with a 60\u00a0Hz [[refresh rate]]. The P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 6.58\" (167.13mm) 19.8:9 OLED with an unorthodox resolution (1200 \u00d7 2640) and a 90Hz refresh rate, as well as support for HDR10 and DCI-P3. The P40 has 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, while the P40 Pro & P40 Pro+ have 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All models have [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0: the P40 has 128 or 256 GB, the P40 Pro has 128, 256 or 512 GB and the P40 Pro+ has 256 or 512 GB. Expansion is supported up to 256 GB via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory card. In addition to the infrared face unlock system, all P40 models have an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor; Huawei claims the sensor is 30% larger and faster than the P30's. The P40 uses a 3800mAh battery, while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 4200mAh battery. Fast charging is supported on all models, however the P40 does not support wireless charging. The P40 can charge wired up to 22.5W while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have a max rate of 40W. Both the P40 and P40 Pro are also capable of reverse wireless charging at 27W, but the P40 Pro+ can charge faster wirelessly at 40W whereas the P40 Pro can only charge wirelessly at 27W. Additionally, the P40 has an [[IP Code|IP]]53 rating while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have an IP68 rating. \n==== Camera ====\nThe P40 series features [[Leica Camera|Leica]] optics, and the wide lens on all models is a new \"Ultra Vision\" 50 MP sensor. Like the P30, the wide lens uses a \"SuperSpectrum\" [[image sensor]], whose [[color filter array]] uses yellow sub-pixels instead of green. Huawei stated that this would allow more light to be captured, and enhanced absorption of red and green colors. The P40's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 16 MP ultrawide lens and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The P40 Pro increases the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 40 MP, replaces the standard telephoto lens with a 12 MP periscope sensor capable of 5x optical zoom, and adds a [[Time-of-flight camera|time-of-flight]] sensor. The P40 Pro+ has two 8 MP telephoto lenses, a standard sensor with 3x optical zoom and a periscope sensor with 10x optical zoom while retaining the time-of-flight sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 32 MP sensor which has autofocus on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; an additional depth sensor allows for the face unlock. For both photo and video, pixel binning is used for improved low-light sensitivity, and video can be captured from the wide-angle and telephoto sensors simultaneously with directional audio computed from three omnidirectional microphones. The cameras benefit from an XD Fusion Image Engine which enables advanced computational photography, as well as an \"Octa\" phase-detection autofocus system for faster autofocus and improved white balance sensors on the P40 Pro+. The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A [[Profoto]] studio light will be available as an accessory as well.\n\n=== Software ===\nThe P40 series ships with [[EMUI|EMUI 10.1]] powered by Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), which is based on [[Android 10]] source code. Due to [[Huawei#U.S. business restrictions|ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei]], international models of the P40 will not ship with or support [[Google Mobile Services]] \u2014 the proprietary software suite (including [[Google Play]]-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android [[trademark]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the P40 series are the first Huawei devices to run EMUI 10.1, they also mark the introduction of Huawei's own voice assistant Celia due to the lack of Google Assistant. Celia includes a \"Hey Celia\" feature which triggers an audio search.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/03/26/huawei-celia-google-assistant-iphone-p40-pro/|title=Huawei\u2019s \u2018Celia\u2019 tries to replace Google Assistant, also wakes nearby iPhones|website=9to5Google|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=26 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nHuawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery [[application store|store]] (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there). Huawei stated that it would make a US$1 billion investment in promoting software development and growth of AppGallery.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |last=Warren |first=Tom |title=Huawei confirms the

News|access-date=2020-03-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe P40 series is constructed with anodized aluminum for the frame, while the back uses Gorilla Glass on the P40 and P40 Pro or ceramic on the P40 Pro+. The display is flat on the P40 or curved on all sides on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; Huawei calls this a Quad-Curve Overflow Display. The top left corner of the display has a pill-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera and ambient/proximity sensors; it also accommodates the infrared face unlock system on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+. As on the P30 Pro, the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ replace the traditional earpiece speaker with an \"electromagnetic levitation\" speaker that vibrates the top of the phone's screen, and have an IR blaster on the top edge. The 3.5mm audio jack has also been omitted on all models. A rectangular module houses the rear cameras, which protrudes slightly from the back panel. The P40 and P40 Pro will be available in Silver Frost, Blush Gold, Deep Sea Blue, Ice White and Black, while the P40 Pro+ will be available in Ceramic White or Ceramic Black.\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Hardware ===\nThe P40 series is powered by the [[HiSilicon]] Kirin 990 5G processor, meaning that all models will have [[5G]] connectivity standard. Although 5G networks are supported, all models only supports \"sub-6\" 5G, meaning they are not compatible with ultra-fast [[Extremely high frequency|millimeter-wave (mmWave)]] networks. The Kirin 990 5G is assisted by the [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]]-G76 MP16 GPU. The P40's display is carried over from the P30, a 6.1\" (154.94mm) 19.5:9 [[1080p]]  (1080 \u00d7 2340) [[OLED]] with a 60[[Hertz|Hz]] [[refresh rate]]. The P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 6.58\" (167.13mm) 19.8:9 OLED with an unorthodox resolution (1200 \u00d7 2640) and a 90Hz refresh rate, as well as support for HDR10 and DCI-P3. The P40 has 6 or 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM, while the P40 Pro & P40 Pro+ have 8 GB of LPDDR4X RAM. All models have [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0: the P40 has 128 or 256 GB, the P40 Pro has 128, 256 or 512 GB and the P40 Pro+ has 256 or 512 GB. Expansion is supported up to 256 GB via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory card. In addition to the infrared face unlock system, all P40 models have an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor; Huawei claims the sensor is 30% larger and faster than the P30's. The P40 uses a 3800mAh battery, while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ use a larger 4200mAh battery. Fast charging is supported on all models, however the P40 does not support wireless charging. The P40 can charge wired up to 22.5W while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have a max rate of 40W. Both the P40 and P40 Pro are also capable of reverse wireless charging at 27W, but the P40 Pro+ can charge faster wirelessly at 40W whereas the P40 Pro can only charge wirelessly at 27W. Additionally, the P40 has an [[IP Code|IP]]53 rating while the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+ have an IP68 rating. \n==== Camera ====\nThe P40 series features [[Leica Camera|Leica]] optics, and the wide lens on all models is a new \"Ultra Vision\" 50 MP sensor. Like the P30, the wide lens uses a \"SuperSpectrum\" [[image sensor]], whose [[color filter array]] uses yellow sub-pixels instead of green. Huawei stated that this would allow more light to be captured, and enhanced absorption of red and green colors. The P40's rear camera array consists of a 50 MP wide lens, a 16 MP ultrawide lens and an 8 MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The P40 Pro increases the resolution of the ultrawide sensor to 40 MP, replaces the standard telephoto lens with a 12 MP periscope sensor capable of 5x optical zoom, and adds a [[Time-of-flight camera|time-of-flight]] sensor. The P40 Pro+ has two 8 MP telephoto lenses, a standard sensor with 3x optical zoom and a periscope sensor with 10x optical zoom while retaining the time-of-flight sensor. The front-facing camera uses a 32 MP sensor which has autofocus on the P40 Pro and P40 Pro+; an additional depth sensor allows for the face unlock. For both photo and video, pixel binning is used for improved low-light sensitivity, and video can be captured from the wide-angle and telephoto sensors simultaneously with directional audio computed from three omnidirectional microphones. The cameras benefit from an XD Fusion Image Engine which enables advanced computational photography, as well as an \"Octa\" phase-detection autofocus system for faster autofocus and improved white balance sensors on the P40 Pro+. The software is also improved with a new Golden Snap feature that takes a burst of HDR+ photos and automatically picks the best shots. A [[Profoto]] studio light will be available as an accessory as well.\n\n=== Software ===\nThe P40 series ships with [[EMUI|EMUI 10.1]] powered by Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), which is based on [[Android 10]] source code. Due to [[Huawei#U.S. business restrictions|ongoing United States sanctions against Huawei]], international models of the P40 will not ship with or support [[Google Mobile Services]] \u2014 the proprietary software suite (including [[Google Play]]-branded software) shipped on certified Android devices, and Huawei is not allowed to market the device using the Android [[trademark]].<ref name=\":0\" /> As the P40 series are the first Huawei devices to run EMUI 10.1, they also mark the introduction of Huawei's own voice assistant Celia due to the lack of Google Assistant. Celia includes a \"Hey Celia\" feature which triggers an audio search.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2020/03/26/huawei-celia-google-assistant-iphone-p40-pro/|title=Huawei\u2019s \u2018Celia\u2019 tries to replace Google Assistant, also wakes nearby iPhones|website=9to5Google|last=Schoon|first=Ben|date=26 March 2020|accessdate=26 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nHuawei is promoting the use of its own in-house platforms as a substitute, including the Huawei AppGallery [[application store|store]] (which is already used on Chinese models of Huawei's devices due to Google not doing business there).

{"title_page": "Pyramid scheme", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of unsustainable business model}}\n{{More citations needed|date =January 2016}}\n[[File:Pyramid scheme.svg|thumb|right|350px|The unsustainable exponential progression of a classic pyramid scheme, assuming that every member is required to recruit 6 new people.]]\n\nA '''pyramid of Pepi '' is a [[business model]] that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale of [[product (business)|products]]. As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.\n\t\nPyramid schemes have existed for at least a century in different guises. Some [[multi-level marketing]] plans have been classified as pyramid schemes.<ref name=\"Smith1984\" />\n\n== Concept and basic models ==\nIn a pyramid scheme, an organization compels individuals who wish to join to make a payment. In exchange, the organization promises its new members a share of the money taken from every additional member that they recruit. The directors of the organization (those at the top of the pyramid) also receive a share of these payments. For the directors, the scheme is potentially lucrative\u2014whether or not they do any work, the organization's membership has a strong incentive to continue recruiting and funneling money to the top of the pyramid.\n\nSuch organizations seldom involve sales of products or services with value. Without creating any goods or services, the only revenue streams for the scheme are recruiting more members or soliciting more money from current members. The behavior of pyramid schemes follows the mathematics concerning [[exponential growth]] quite closely. Each level of the pyramid is much larger than the one before it. For a pyramid scheme to make money for everyone who enrolls in it, it would have to expand indefinitely. This is not possible because the population of Earth is finite. When the scheme inevitably runs out of new recruits, lacking other sources of revenue, it collapses. Since the biggest terms in a geometric sequence are at the end, most people will be in the lower levels of the pyramid; accordingly, the bottom layer of the pyramid contains the most people. The people working for pyramid schemes try to promote the actual company instead of the product they are selling. Eventually, all of the people at the lower levels of the pyramid do not make any money; only the people at the top turn a profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/pyramid-schemes|title=Pyramid Schemes|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nPeople in the upper layers of the pyramid typically profit, while those in the lower layers typically lose money. Since most of the members in the scheme are at the bottom, most participants will not make any money. In particular, when the scheme collapses, most members will be in the bottom layers and thus will not have any opportunity to profit from the scheme; still, they will have already paid to join. Therefore, a pyramid scheme is characterized by a few people (including the creators of the scheme) making large amounts of money, while subsequent members lose money.  For this reason, they are considered scams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/jobs-employment/pyramid-schemes|title=Pyramid schemes|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|last=Commission|date=May 14, 2015|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}</ref>\n\n=== The \"eight ball\" model ===\n[[File:Pyramid8Ball.svg|frame|right|100px|The \"eight-ball\" model contains a total of fifteen members. Note that in an [[arithmetic progression]] 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The pyramid scheme in the picture in contrast is a [[geometric progression]] 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.]]\n\nMany pyramids are more sophisticated than the simple model. These recognize that recruiting a large number of others into a scheme can be difficult, so a seemingly simpler model is used. In this model each person must recruit two others, but the ease of achieving this is offset because the depth required to recoup any money also increases. The scheme requires a person to recruit two others, who must each recruit two others, and so on.\n\nPrior instances of this scheme have been called the \"[[Airplane game|Airplane Game]]\" and the four tiers labelled as \"captain\", \"co-pilot\", \"crew\", and \"passenger\" to denote a person's level. Another instance was called the \"Original Dinner Party\" which labeled the tiers as \"dessert\", \"main course\", \"side salad\", and \"appetizer\". A person on the \"dessert\" course is the one at the top of the tree. Another variant, \"Treasure Traders\", variously used [[gemology]] terms such as \"polishers\", \"stone cutters\", etc.\n\nSuch schemes may try to downplay their pyramid nature by referring to themselves as \"gifting circles\" with money being \"gifted\". Popular schemes such as \"Women Empowering Women\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tracy McVeigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/05/tracymcveigh.theobserver |title=Pyramid selling scam that preys on women to be banned |work=Guardian |date=2001-08-05 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref> do exactly this.\n\nWhichever euphemism is used, there are 15 total people in four tiers (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) in the scheme\u2014with the Airplane Game as the example, the person at the top of this tree is the \"captain\", the two below are \"co-pilots\", the four below are \"crew\", and the bottom eight joiners are the \"passengers\".\n\n[[File:Small Pyramid Schemes Still Lose Money.svg|thumb|At ten levels deep, the \"airplane game\" has an 87% loss rate.]]\n\nThe eight passengers must each pay (or \"gift\") a sum (e.g., $5,000) to join the scheme. This sum (e.g., $40,000) goes to the captain, who leaves, with everyone remaining moving up one tier. There are now two new captains so the group splits in two with each group requiring eight new passengers. A person who joins the scheme as a passenger will not see a return until they advance through the crew and co-pilot tiers and exit the scheme as a captain. Therefore, the participants in the bottom three tiers of the pyramid lose their money if the scheme collapses.\n\nIf a person is using this model as a scam, the confident trickster would take the majority of the money. They would do this by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring they get the first seven payouts, at eight times the buy-in sum, without paying a single penny themselves. So if the buy-in were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme for as long as possible to allow them to skim even more from it before it collapses.\n\nAlthough the \"captain\" is the person at the top of the tree, having received the payment from the eight paying passengers, once they leave the scheme they are able to re-enter the pyramid as a \"passenger\" and hopefully recruit enough to reach captain again, thereby earning a second payout.\n\n=== Matrix schemes ===\n{{Main|Matrix scheme}}\nMatrix schemes use the same fraudulent, unsustainable system as a pyramid; here, the participants pay to join a waiting list for a desirable product, which only a fraction of them can ever receive. Since matrix schemes follow the same laws of geometric progression as pyramids, they are subsequently as doomed to collapse. Such schemes operate as a queue, where the person at head of the queue receives an item such as a television, games console, digital camcorder, etc. when a certain number of new people join the end of the queue. For example, ten joiners may be required for the person at the front to receive their item and leave the queue. Each joiner is required to buy an expensive but potentially worthless item, such as an e-book, for their position in the queue. The scheme organizer profits because the income from joiners far exceeds the cost of sending out the item to the person at the front. Organizers can further profit by starting a scheme with a queue with ''[[shill]]'' names that must be cleared out before genuine people get to the front. The scheme collapses when no more people are willing to join the queue. Schemes may not reveal, or may attempt to exaggerate, a prospective joiner's queue position, a condition that essentially means the scheme is a lottery. Some countries have ruled that matrix schemes are illegal on that basis.\n\n== Relation to Ponzi schemes==\nWhile often confused for each other, pyramid schemes and [[Ponzi scheme]]s are different from each other. They are related in the sense that both pyramid and Ponzi schemes are forms of financial fraud.<ref name=\"zuckoff\">{{cite book|last1=Zuckoff|first1=Mitchell|title=Ponzi's scheme \u2013 the true story of a financial legend|date=10 January 2006|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=0812968360}}</ref> However, pyramid schemes are based on [[network marketing]], where each part of the pyramid takes a piece of the pie / benefits, forwarding the money to the top of the pyramid. They fail simply because there are not sufficient people. Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, are based on the principle of \"Robbing Peter to pay Paul\"\u2014early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors. In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier. Thus, a scheme such as the [[Anubhav Plantations|Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998)]] in [[India]] can be called a Ponzi scheme. Some Ponzi schemes can depend on multi-level marketing for popularizing them, thus forming a combination of the two.<ref name=\"olsson\">{{cite web|title=Book reading by Mitchell Zuckoff at olsson's Books and Records, Washington D.C.|url=http://www.youtube.com|publisher=The Film Archives|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Connection to multi-level marketing ==\n\nMulti-level marketing (MLM) companies operate as pyramid schemes and consumers often confuse legitimate multi-level marketing with pyramid schemes.<ref name=\"Smith1984\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Rodney K.|title=Multilevel Marketing|date=1984|publisher=Baker Publishing Group|isbn=0-8010-8243-9|page=45}}</ref><ref name=\"Keep2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Keep|first1=William W|last2=Vander Nat|first2=Peter J.|title=Multilevel marketing and pyramid schemes in the United States: An historical analysis|journal=Journal of Historical Research in Marketing|date=2014|volume=6|issue=2|pages=188\u2013210|doi=10.1108/JHRM-01-2014-0002|accessdate=26 March 2016|url=http://business.pages.tcnj.edu/files/2014/02/Keep-and-Vander-Nat_MLM-and-Pyramid-Schemes_Final.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Valentine Speech\">{{cite web|last1=Valentine|first1=Debra|title=Pyramid Schemes|date=May 13, 1998|url=https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1998/05/pyramid-schemes|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Edwards | first = Paul | authorlink = | title = Franchising & licensing: two powerful ways to grow your business in any economy | publisher = Tarcher | year = 1997 | page = 356 | isbn = 0-87477-898-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] legitimate MLM, unlike pyramid schemes:\n\n:\"have a real product to sell.\"<ref name=\"PS_USA_1998\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1998/05/pyramid-schemes|title=Pyramid Schemes|date=18 July 2013}}</ref> \"Not all multi-level marketing plans are legitimate.

As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.\n\t\nPyramid schemes have existed for at least a century in different guises. Some [[multi-level marketing]] plans have been classified as pyramid schemes.<ref name=\"Smith1984\" />\n\n== Concept and basic models ==\nIn a pyramid scheme, an organization compels individuals who wish to join to make a payment. In exchange, the organization promises its new members a share of the money taken from every additional member that they recruit. The directors of the organization (those at the top of the pyramid) also receive a share of these payments. For the directors, the scheme is potentially lucrative\u2014whether or not they do any work, the organization's membership has a strong incentive to continue recruiting and funneling money to the top of the pyramid.\n\nSuch organizations seldom involve sales of products or services with value. Without creating any goods or services, the only revenue streams for the scheme are recruiting more members or soliciting more money from current members. The behavior of pyramid schemes follows the mathematics concerning [[exponential growth]] quite closely. Each level of the pyramid is much larger than the one before it. For a pyramid scheme to make money for everyone who enrolls in it, it would have to expand indefinitely. This is not possible because the population of Earth is finite. When the scheme inevitably runs out of new recruits, lacking other sources of revenue, it collapses. Since the biggest terms in a geometric sequence are at the end, most people will be in the lower levels of the pyramid; accordingly, the bottom layer of the pyramid contains the most people. The people working for pyramid schemes try to promote the actual company instead of the product they are selling. Eventually, all of the people at the lower levels of the pyramid do not make any money; only the people at the top turn a profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-fraud-schemes/pyramid-schemes|title=Pyramid Schemes|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\nPeople in the upper layers of the pyramid typically profit, while those in the lower layers typically lose money. Since most of the members in the scheme are at the bottom, most participants will not make any money. In particular, when the scheme collapses, most members will be in the bottom layers and thus will not have any opportunity to profit from the scheme; still, they will have already paid to join. Therefore, a pyramid scheme is characterized by a few people (including the creators of the scheme) making large amounts of money, while subsequent members lose money.  For this reason, they are considered scams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/types-of-scams/jobs-employment/pyramid-schemes|title=Pyramid schemes|first=Australian Competition and Consumer|last=Commission|date=May 14, 2015|website=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission}}</ref>\n\n=== The \"eight ball\" model ===\n[[File:Pyramid8Ball.svg|frame|right|100px|The \"eight-ball\" model contains a total of fifteen members. Note that in an [[arithmetic progression]] 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. The pyramid scheme in the picture in contrast is a [[geometric progression]] 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15.]]\n\nMany pyramids are more sophisticated than the simple model. These recognize that recruiting a large number of others into a scheme can be difficult, so a seemingly simpler model is used. In this model each person must recruit two others, but the ease of achieving this is offset because the depth required to recoup any money also increases. The scheme requires a person to recruit two others, who must each recruit two others, and so on.\n\nPrior instances of this scheme have been called the \"[[Airplane game|Airplane Game]]\" and the four tiers labelled as \"captain\", \"co-pilot\", \"crew\", and \"passenger\" to denote a person's level. Another instance was called the \"Original Dinner Party\" which labeled the tiers as \"dessert\", \"main course\", \"side salad\", and \"appetizer\". A person on the \"dessert\" course is the one at the top of the tree. Another variant, \"Treasure Traders\", variously used [[gemology]] terms such as \"polishers\", \"stone cutters\", etc.\n\nSuch schemes may try to downplay their pyramid nature by referring to themselves as \"gifting circles\" with money being \"gifted\". Popular schemes such as \"Women Empowering Women\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tracy McVeigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/aug/05/tracymcveigh.theobserver |title=Pyramid selling scam that preys on women to be banned |work=Guardian |date=2001-08-05 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}</ref> do exactly this.\n\nWhichever euphemism is used, there are 15 total people in four tiers (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) in the scheme\u2014with the Airplane Game as the example, the person at the top of this tree is the \"captain\", the two below are \"co-pilots\", the four below are \"crew\", and the bottom eight joiners are the \"passengers\".\n\n[[File:Small Pyramid Schemes Still Lose Money.svg|thumb|At ten levels deep, the \"airplane game\" has an 87% loss rate.]]\n\nThe eight passengers must each pay (or \"gift\") a sum (e.g., $5,000) to join the scheme. This sum (e.g., $40,000) goes to the captain, who leaves, with everyone remaining moving up one tier. There are now two new captains so the group splits in two with each group requiring eight new passengers. A person who joins the scheme as a passenger will not see a return until they advance through the crew and co-pilot tiers and exit the scheme as a captain. Therefore, the participants in the bottom three tiers of the pyramid lose their money if the scheme collapses.\n\nIf a person is using this model as a scam, the confident trickster would take the majority of the money. They would do this by filling in the first three tiers (with one, two, and four people) with phony names, ensuring they get the first seven payouts, at eight times the buy-in sum, without paying a single penny themselves. So if the buy-in were $5,000, they would receive $40,000, paid for by the first eight investors. They would continue to buy in underneath the real investors, and promote and prolong the scheme for as long as possible to allow them to skim even more from it before it collapses.\n\nAlthough the \"captain\" is the person at the top of the tree, having received the payment from the eight paying passengers, once they leave the scheme they are able to re-enter the pyramid as a \"passenger\" and hopefully recruit enough to reach captain again, thereby earning a second payout.\n\n=== Matrix schemes ===\n{{Main|Matrix scheme}}\nMatrix schemes use the same fraudulent, unsustainable system as a pyramid; here, the participants pay to join a waiting list for a desirable product, which only a fraction of them can ever receive. Since matrix schemes follow the same laws of geometric progression as pyramids, they are subsequently as doomed to collapse. Such schemes operate as a queue, where the person at head of the queue receives an item such as a television, games console, digital camcorder, etc. when a certain number of new people join the end of the queue. For example, ten joiners may be required for the person at the front to receive their item and leave the queue. Each joiner is required to buy an expensive but potentially worthless item, such as an e-book, for their position in the queue. The scheme organizer profits because the income from joiners far exceeds the cost of sending out the item to the person at the front. Organizers can further profit by starting a scheme with a queue with ''[[shill]]'' names that must be cleared out before genuine people get to the front. The scheme collapses when no more people are willing to join the queue. Schemes may not reveal, or may attempt to exaggerate, a prospective joiner's queue position, a condition that essentially means the scheme is a lottery. Some countries have ruled that matrix schemes are illegal on that basis.\n\n== Relation to Ponzi schemes==\nWhile often confused for each other, pyramid schemes and [[Ponzi scheme]]s are different from each other. They are related in the sense that both pyramid and Ponzi schemes are forms of financial fraud.<ref name=\"zuckoff\">{{cite book|last1=Zuckoff|first1=Mitchell|title=Ponzi's scheme \u2013 the true story of a financial legend|date=10 January 2006|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=0812968360}}</ref> However, pyramid schemes are based on [[network marketing]], where each part of the pyramid takes a piece of the pie / benefits, forwarding the money to the top of the pyramid. They fail simply because there are not sufficient people. Ponzi schemes, on the other hand, are based on the principle of \"Robbing Peter to pay Paul\"\u2014early investors are paid their returns through the proceeds of investments by later investors. In other words, one central person (or entity) in the middle taking money from one person, keeping part of it and giving the rest to others who had invested in the scheme earlier. Thus, a scheme such as the [[Anubhav Plantations|Anubhav teak plantation scheme (teak plantation scam of 1998)]] in [[India]] can be called a Ponzi scheme. Some Ponzi schemes can depend on multi-level marketing for popularizing them, thus forming a combination of the two.<ref name=\"olsson\">{{cite web|title=Book reading by Mitchell Zuckoff at olsson's Books and Records, Washington D.C.|url=http://www.youtube.com|publisher=The Film Archives|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Connection to multi-level marketing ==\n\nMulti-level marketing (MLM) companies operate as pyramid schemes and consumers often confuse legitimate multi-level marketing with pyramid schemes.<ref name=\"Smith1984\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Rodney K.|title=Multilevel Marketing|date=1984|publisher=Baker Publishing Group|isbn=0-8010-8243-9|page=45}}</ref><ref name=\"Keep2014\">{{cite journal|last1=Keep|first1=William W|last2=Vander Nat|first2=Peter J.|title=Multilevel marketing and pyramid schemes in the United States: An historical analysis|journal=Journal of Historical Research in Marketing|date=2014|volume=6|issue=2|pages=188\u2013210|doi=10.1108/JHRM-01-2014-0002|accessdate=26 March 2016|url=http://business.pages.tcnj.edu/files/2014/02/Keep-and-Vander-Nat_MLM-and-Pyramid-Schemes_Final.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Valentine Speech\">{{cite web|last1=Valentine|first1=Debra|title=Pyramid Schemes|date=May 13, 1998|url=https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1998/05/pyramid-schemes|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Edwards | first = Paul | authorlink = | title = Franchising & licensing: two powerful ways to grow your business in any economy | publisher = Tarcher | year = 1997 | page = 356 | isbn = 0-87477-898-0}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] legitimate MLM, unlike pyramid schemes:\n\n:\"have a real product to sell.\"<ref name=\"PS_USA_1998\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/1998/05/pyramid-schemes|title=Pyramid Schemes|date=18 July 2013}}</ref> \"Not all multi-level marketing plans are legitimate.

Morcom scored one and, in the second innings, zero, as Yorke's Peninsula's twenty two scored 13 between them, which at that time was the lowest score against an English side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yorke's Peninsula v WG Grace's XI|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/134/134582.html|work=WG Grace's XI in Australia 1873/74|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nDespite his failure for Yorke's Peninsula, Morcom was picked in the first ever [[South Australian cricket team]], which played WG Grace's XI at Adelaide Oval, starting on 26&nbsp;March 1874.<ref name=sa>{{cite web|title=South Australia v WG Grace's XI|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/134/134583.html|work=WG Grace's XI in Australia 1873/74|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> Morcom scored zero and six.<ref name=sa/>\n\nMorcom continued to represent South Australian sides against interstate or international opponents throughout the 1870s, including matches against [[Victorian cricket team|Victoria]] in 1874 and 1876, [[English cricket team in Australia in 1876\u201377|James Lillywhite's XI]] in 1876 and against a combined Australian side in 1877,<ref name=morc>{{cite web|title=Other matches played by Samuel Morcom|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/16/16453/Other_matches.html|publisher=Cricket Archive|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> without scoring higher than 18.\n\nSuch was Morcom's popularity in Adelaide that he was featured in some of the earliest sports merchandise marketing in South Australia. One enterprising businessman created belts with a photograph of various leading cricketers and the words \"South Australian celebrity\". Morcom was one of seven players featured on the belts, with the ''Register'' of the belief that the belts were likely to be popular.<ref name=belts>\"Cricket Belts\", ''South Australian Register'', 5 July 1878, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMorcom worked as a compositor in the Government Printing Office in Adelaide<ref name=inquiry/> and on 24 February 1876 he married Ellen Bone at St Peter's Collegiate Chapel, Adelaide.<ref>''South Australian Register'', 25 February 1876, p. 7.</ref>\n\nOther members of the Morcom family also gained renown; brother John, under the name [[Vertelli]], became a famous wire walker in the United States, brother James was a champion rifle shot and short-distance pedestrian, William was one of South Australia's top swimmers and Harry was South Australia's top backwards runner at a time when backwards running was a popular competition.<ref name=avm>A.V.M. \"Sporting Families: Morcoms and Goodfellows\". ''The South Australian Register'', 14 December 1923, p. 3.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nAround noon On 7 January 1888, Morcom was crossing [[Rundle Mall|Rundle Street]] in Adelaide when he became giddy and stumbled between the wheels of an oncoming [[Tram|trolley]], landing on his stomach. The trolley driver, a James Rossiter, was unaware of Morcom's situation and drove the trolley, with its five tonne payload, over Morcom, fracturing his left thigh.<ref name=inquiry/> Morcom was taken to [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]], where surgeons thought it unnecessary to amputate his left leg. In hospital, Morcom progressed favourably until early on the morning of 15 January, when his condition deteriorated; he died at 3.00&nbsp;pm that afternoon.<ref name=launceston/>\n\nA coroner's inquiry into the death found that the cause of death was inflammation of the lining membrane of the heart, owing to the absorption of blood from the bruised parts of the thigh. Morcom's brother James testified that Morcom had been unwell recently and had been losing his eyesight.<ref name=inquiry>\"Death of Mr. S. Morcom\", ''The South Australian Register'', 17 January 1888, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==References==\n* Harte, C.

The [[Rhodesian Dollar]] was replaced by the [[Zimbabwean dollar]] at [[par value]]. When Zimbabwe gained its independence, the newly introduced Zimbabwean dollar was initially more valuable than the United States dollar at the official exchange rates.  But this did not reflect reality, as in terms of purchasing power on the open and black markets, it was less valuable, due primarily to the higher inflation in Zimbabwe.<ref name = \"Zimbabwe A worthless Currency\">{{Cite news|title=Zimbabwe: A Worthless Currency | url = https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2008/07/17/a-worthless-currency |date=17 July 2008 | newspaper = The Economist | accessdate = 17 April 2010 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref name = \"The Death of the Zimbabwe Dollar\">{{cite news| title = The Death of the Zimbabwe Dollar | url = https://www.globalfinancialdata.com/gfdblog/?p=3098| publisher = Global Financial Data | accessdate = 17 April 2010|date= 24 January 2018}}</ref> In its early years, Zimbabwe experienced strong growth and development. Wheat production for non-drought years was proportionally higher than in the past. The tobacco industry was thriving as well. Economic indicators for the country were strong.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1996, the Zimbabwean [[ZANU-PF]] government of president [[Robert Mugabe]] embarked on an Economic Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP) that had serious negative effects on [[Economy of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe's economy]]. In the late 1990s, the government instituted [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reforms]] intended to evict white landowners and place their holdings in the hands of black farmers. However, many of these \"farmers\" had no experience or training in farming.<ref>{{cite news| title = Whose land? | url = https://www.economist.com/node/13240812 | newspaper = The Economist |url-access=registration |accessdate = August 5, 2017 |date=March 5, 2009}}</ref>  From 1999 to 2009, the country experienced a sharp drop in food production and in all other sectors.

New York: Asia Publishing House: \"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\"</ref> is that a general increase in the prices of things is less a commentary on the worth of those things than on the worth of the money.  This has objective and subjective components:\n*Objectively, that the money has no firm basis to give it a value.\n*Subjectively, that the people holding the money lack confidence in its ability to retain its value.\n\nCrucial to both components is discipline over the creation of additional money.  However, the Mugabe government was printing money to finance military involvement in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and, in 2000, in the [[Second Congo War]], including higher salaries for army and government officials. Zimbabwe was under-reporting its war spending to the [[International Monetary Fund]] by perhaps $23 million a month.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mugabe's Costly Congo Venture|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/611898.stm|accessdate=19 April 2011|newspaper=BBC Online|date=25 July 2000}}</ref>\n\nAnother motive for excessive [[money creation]] has been self-dealing.

Though this harms the economy, it does not necessarily undermine the value of the currency, but may harm confidence in the future. Widespread poverty and violence, including government violence to stifle political opposition, also undermines confidence in the future.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Economies of Violence|url=https://www.economist.com/node/18558041|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=14 April 2011}}</ref> Land reform lowered agricultural output, especially in tobacco, which accounted for one-third of Zimbabwe's foreign-exchange earnings. Manufacturing and mining also declined.

The [[Rhodesian Dollar]] was replaced by the [[Zimbabwean dollar]] at [[par value]]. When Zimbabwe gained its independence, the newly introduced Zimbabwean dollar was initially more valuable than the United States dollar at the official exchange rates.

In the late 1990s, the government instituted [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reforms]] intended to evict white landowners and place their holdings in the hands of black farmers.

Computers could not handle the amount of zeros such that other forms of money had to be used to act as normal money (bearer\u2019s cheques).

The same was true for businesses as well and all traders.\n\n==Solutions==\nA solution effectively adopted by Zimbabwe was to adopt some foreign currency as official. To facilitate commerce, it is less important which currency is adopted than that the government standardise on a single currency.

Since then Zimbabwe has used a combination of foreign currencies, mostly US dollars.\n\nIn 2014, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe unveiled \"convertible\" coins in denominations of US$0.01 through US$0.50. The Bank said that 80% of Zimbabweans use the U.S. dollar, and said the local lack of coins induces retailers to round prices up to the next higher dollar.

He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />\n\nHe was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S.\n\nActive in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />\n\nHe was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S.\n\nActive in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past.

A lot of middlebrow stuff was dopey--try, if you dare, to watch such earnest, humorless teleplays as 12 Angry Men all the way through. Some of it proved provocative in conception and deadly in execution--the TV host David Susskind once had a weekly show called Open End, in which he would convene a panel of guests and engage them in conversation for several hours, with no set time limit, till everyone got bored and stopped talking.

Michael Kinsley, for example, was a longtime \"Firing Line\" panelist. Buckley loyalists and detractors alike note that, after 34 years, the show had begun to run out of steam. Victor Navasky, Nation editor and natural Buckley adversary, says he wishes he could say, \"'It's about time.'

In the early years, there would often be a panel of questioners. In 1977 the panel was replaced by an \"examiner\" who played a larger part in the proceedings.  Examiners varied, with [[Jeff Greenfield]], [[Michael Kinsley]], [[Harriet Pilpel]], and [[Mark J. Green]] appearing most frequently. When the show was shortened to 30 minutes in 1988, the role of examiner was eliminated, but there was often a moderator, whose role was similar to that of the moderator in a formal debate. The moderator would introduce both host and guest, and then ask the opening question.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6m3nc88c/entire_text/ | title =Register of the Firing Line (Television Program) broadcast records | website =oac.cdlib.org | publisher =Online Archive of California | access-date =December 23, 2018 | quote =Over the years, Buckley and his producer, Warren Steibel, used various methods of bringing an extra perspective to the discussion.

The examiners who appeared most frequently were Jeff Greenfield, Michael Kinsley, Harriet Pilpel, and Mark Green.

Some early programs included a person called a \"chairman,\" who functioned like a moderator.

In 1988, at Buckley's request, the running time of regular program shows was reduced from one hour to a half-hour. Beginning in March 1993, the two-hour formal debates would often be followed by half-hour shows in which most or all of the participants engaged in informal discussion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the debate episodes were frequently broadcast on the Monday evenings after PBS pledge drives concluded.\n\nA recurring episode that Buckley had rebroadcast every Christmas, beginning in 1981, was an interview he did with [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] at his home in Sussex, England. The title of the episode was \"How Does One Find Faith?\" The episode deals with questions that are religious and spiritual in nature.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/buckley-christmas-tradition/ | title =A Buckley Christmas Tradition | last =Fowler | first =Jack | date =December 25, 2015 | website =nationalreview.com | publisher =The National Review | access-date =December 23, 2018 | quote =Bill\u2019s acclaimed program, Firing Line, had a delightful Christmas tradition: to rerun his wonderful 1981 interview with Malcolm Muggeridge on \u201cHow Does One Find Faith?\u201d After you digest your figgy pudding, we recommend you take a few minutes to watch this clip from the program.

Buckley was frequently seen leaning far back in his chair, a pen near his mouth and a clipboard in hand. His flicking tongue, widening eyes, and flashing smile also characterized his style, as did his multi-syllabic vocabulary. Buckley's voice was widely satirized as, for instance, by [[Robin Williams]] in the animated movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.bustle.com/articles/100968-pop-culture-references-in-aladdin-that-are-sooooooo-outdated-now | title =Pop Culture References In 'Aladdin' That Are Sooooooo Outdated Now | last =Matlow | first =Orli | date =July 30, 2015 | website =bustle.com | publisher =Bustle | access-date =December 23, 2018 | quote =The Genie is drawn to be like Buckley twice in the movie.

His pronunciation was likewise British-influenced in its lack of rhoticity\u2014meaning he drops his \u201cr\u201ds. (An American \u201cr\u201d is generally pronounced with a tongue curled about 45 degrees; the Brits leave their tongues flat. Buckley is often somewhere in the middle.) This style of speech was thought to characterize upper-class New Englanders as a whole, perhaps because many of the region\u2019s earliest settlers hailed from (old) England. * (Fewer \u201cr\u201ds were dropped among the more diverse mix of immigrants in New York.) There\u2019s also the yod, which is the \u201cew\u201d sound in music and usual\u2014like our friends across the pond, Buckley keeps the yod for words like news and pursue. He also pronounces the \u201ct\u201d in words like writer.  And for vowels in words like thought and wrong, he rounded his lips, not unlike the English. Meanwhile, he stressed few words when he spoke but would pounce on an important one, every once in a while. (Contrast with John Wayne, who tended to stress every single word, in exactly the same way.)Buckley\u2019s old-fashioned way of speaking wasn\u2019t too far from the British-influenced mid-Atlantic accent, which the Hollywood studios taught to actors in the 1930s and \u201840s. You\u2019ll pick up some of the same pronunciations and cadences from recordings of Franklin D. Roosevelt *, as well as Katharine Hepburn\u2014who was, after all, from a wealthy Connecticut family, like Buckley.The conservative thinker may have shared an accent with some other men of the same age and social class, but his mannerisms and gestures made him entirely unique\u2014and occasionally prone to caricature. He tended to pause for long stretches, wag his tongue, and open his mouth in an exaggerated way. To emphasize a point, he would make a tent with his fingers or grin as he spoke a key word. Toss in his wit, his blue-blooded accent, and his affinity for fancy words, and Buckley had created his own personal language, or idiolect. }}</ref>\n\nAt the same time that guests were treated politely, Buckley might also gently mock them, particularly if he was friendly with them, as with [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] or examiner [[Mark J.

Yesterday conversation was in particularly fine form at the New York Yacht Club, where about 300 of its finest practitioners gathered to celebrate the 15th anniversary of ''Firing Line,'' William F. Buckley Jr.'s weekly colloquy, telecast by the Public Broadcasting Service. For the 13th-longest-running program on public or commercial television, it was a fitting birthday party indeed, a party resonant with passion, intellect and great good humor - the very qualities that have informed the show's conversations between Mr. Buckley and his guests from the beginning. Many of those guests made a return appearance last evening at the party given by Anne Armstrong, Louis S. Auchincloss, Alistair Cooke, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., Henry A. Kissinger, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and William E. Simon - themselves all alumni of ''Firing Line'' too. No doubt Mayor Koch spoke for all of them when he said, ''I've never participated in a show that has been more scintillating or informative for me personally than those conducted by Bill Buckley. Whether I'm on it or someone else is on it, I'm always enthralled.''

A lot of middlebrow stuff was dopey--try, if you dare, to watch such earnest, humorless teleplays as 12 Angry Men all the way through. Some of it proved provocative in conception and deadly in execution--the TV host David Susskind once had a weekly show called Open End, in which he would convene a panel of guests and engage them in conversation for several hours, with no set time limit, till everyone got bored and stopped talking.

Michael Kinsley, for example, was a longtime \"Firing Line\" panelist. Buckley loyalists and detractors alike note that, after 34 years, the show had begun to run out of steam.

In the early years, there would often be a panel of questioners. In 1977 the panel was replaced by an \"examiner\" who played a larger part in the proceedings.  Examiners varied, with [[Jeff Greenfield]], [[Michael Kinsley]], [[Harriet Pilpel]], and [[Mark J. Green]] appearing most frequently. When the show was shortened to 30 minutes in 1988, the role of examiner was eliminated, but there was often a moderator, whose role was similar to that of the moderator in a formal debate. The moderator would introduce both host and guest, and then ask the opening question.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6m3nc88c/entire_text/ | title =Register of the Firing Line (Television Program) broadcast records | website =oac.cdlib.org | publisher =Online Archive of California | access-date =December 23, 2018 | quote =Over the years, Buckley and his producer, Warren Steibel, used various methods of bringing an extra perspective to the discussion.

In 1988, at Buckley's request, the running time of regular program shows was reduced from one hour to a half-hour. Beginning in March 1993, the two-hour formal debates would often be followed by half-hour shows in which most or all of the participants engaged in informal discussion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the debate episodes were frequently broadcast on the Monday evenings after PBS pledge drives concluded.\n\nA recurring episode that Buckley had rebroadcast every Christmas, beginning in 1981, was an interview he did with [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] at his home in Sussex, England. The title of the episode was \"How Does One Find Faith?\" The episode deals with questions that are religious and spiritual in nature.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/buckley-christmas-tradition/ | title =A Buckley Christmas Tradition | last =Fowler | first =Jack | date =December 25, 2015 | website =nationalreview.com | publisher =The National Review | access-date =December 23, 2018 | quote =Bill\u2019s acclaimed program, Firing Line, had a delightful Christmas tradition: to rerun his wonderful 1981 interview with Malcolm Muggeridge on \u201cHow Does One Find Faith?\u201d After you digest your figgy pudding, we recommend you take a few minutes to watch this clip from the program.

Buckley was frequently seen leaning far back in his chair, a pen near his mouth and a clipboard in hand. His flicking tongue, widening eyes, and flashing smile also characterized his style, as did his multi-syllabic vocabulary. Buckley's voice was widely satirized as, for instance, by [[Robin Williams]] in the animated movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.bustle.com/articles/100968-pop-culture-references-in-aladdin-that-are-sooooooo-outdated-now | title =Pop Culture References In 'Aladdin' That Are Sooooooo Outdated Now | last =Matlow | first =Orli | date =July 30, 2015 | website =bustle.com | publisher =Bustle | access-date =December 23, 2018 | quote =The Genie is drawn to be like Buckley twice in the movie.

His pronunciation was likewise British-influenced in its lack of rhoticity\u2014meaning he drops his \u201cr\u201ds. (An American \u201cr\u201d is generally pronounced with a tongue curled about 45 degrees; the Brits leave their tongues flat. Buckley is often somewhere in the middle.) This style of speech was thought to characterize upper-class New Englanders as a whole, perhaps because many of the region\u2019s earliest settlers hailed from (old) England. * (Fewer \u201cr\u201ds were dropped among the more diverse mix of immigrants in New York.) There\u2019s also the yod, which is the \u201cew\u201d sound in music and usual\u2014like our friends across the pond, Buckley keeps the yod for words like news and pursue. He also pronounces the \u201ct\u201d in words like writer.  And for vowels in words like thought and wrong, he rounded his lips, not unlike the English. Meanwhile, he stressed few words when he spoke but would pounce on an important one, every once in a while. (Contrast with John Wayne, who tended to stress every single word, in exactly the same way.)Buckley\u2019s old-fashioned way of speaking wasn\u2019t too far from the British-influenced mid-Atlantic accent, which the Hollywood studios taught to actors in the 1930s and \u201840s. You\u2019ll pick up some of the same pronunciations and cadences from recordings of Franklin D. Roosevelt *, as well as Katharine Hepburn\u2014who was, after all, from a wealthy Connecticut family, like Buckley.The conservative thinker may have shared an accent with some other men of the same age and social class, but his mannerisms and gestures made him entirely unique\u2014and occasionally prone to caricature. He tended to pause for long stretches, wag his tongue, and open his mouth in an exaggerated way. To emphasize a point, he would make a tent with his fingers or grin as he spoke a key word. Toss in his wit, his blue-blooded accent, and his affinity for fancy words, and Buckley had created his own personal language, or idiolect. }}</ref>\n\nAt the same time that guests were treated politely, Buckley might also gently mock them, particularly if he was friendly with them, as with [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] or examiner [[Mark J.

Yesterday conversation was in particularly fine form at the New York Yacht Club, where about 300 of its finest practitioners gathered to celebrate the 15th anniversary of ''Firing Line,'' William F. Buckley Jr.'s weekly colloquy, telecast by the Public Broadcasting Service. For the 13th-longest-running program on public or commercial television, it was a fitting birthday party indeed, a party resonant with passion, intellect and great good humor - the very qualities that have informed the show's conversations between Mr. Buckley and his guests from the beginning. Many of those guests made a return appearance last evening at the party given by Anne Armstrong, Louis S. Auchincloss, Alistair Cooke, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., Henry A. Kissinger, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and William E. Simon - themselves all alumni of ''Firing Line'' too. No doubt Mayor Koch spoke for all of them when he said, ''I've never participated in a show that has been more scintillating or informative for me personally than those conducted by Bill Buckley. Whether I'm on it or someone else is on it, I'm always enthralled.'' President Reagan sent his regards. }}</ref>\n\n===Guests===\nProminent guests on the program included:\n* Politicians and statesmen: [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Henry Kissinger]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Enoch Powell]], [[Ron Paul]], [[George Wallace]], [[Ian Smith]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], [[Barry Goldwater]], [[Clare Boothe Luce]], [[John Kerry]], [[George H.
