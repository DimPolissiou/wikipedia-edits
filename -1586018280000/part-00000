Except for the ice-free Byers Peninsula and some isolated patches, the land surface is covered by an ice cap with ice domes and plateaus in the central and western areas, and a number of valley glaciers formed by the more mountainous relief of eastern Livingston. Certain areas of the ice cap, especially near glacier termini or over steeper slopes, are densely crevassed and almost inaccessible without specialized equipment. Elsewhere, the surface is smooth, hard and comfortable for walking, skiing or snowmobiling. However, the danger of falling into some hidden crevasse masked by a [[snow bridge]] is ever-present, including in frequently visited and supposedly well-known localities. Protracted periods of warmer weather tend to make the snow bridges more unstable and hazardous.<ref name=\"General\"/>\n\nTypical of the island's glaciology are the conspicuous ash layers originating from volcanic activity on neighbouring [[Deception Island]].<ref>J.

This time he was chartered by Captain [[William Shirreff]], British commanding officer in the [[Pacific]] stationed in [[Chile]], and accompanied by Lieutenant [[Edward Bransfield]] who was tasked to survey and map the new lands. On 30 January 1820 they sighted the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], unaware that three days earlier the continent had already been discovered by the Russian Antarctic expedition of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen|Fabian Gottlieb Thaddeus von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev|Mihail Lazarev]].\n[[File:Half-Moon.jpg|thumb|200px|Derelict Norwegian whaling boat on [[Half Moon Island (South Shetland Islands)|Half Moon Island]]]]\nOne year later, the Russians had circumnavigated Antarctica and arrived in the South Shetlands region. On 6 February 1821 they approached Livingston Island and observed eight British and American ships off Byers Peninsula. While sailing between [[Deception Island|Deception]] and Livingston, Bellingshausen met with American sealer [[Nathaniel Palmer]], yet another pioneer of Antarctic exploration who is alleged to have sighted the mainland himself during the previous November.

[[Guillermo Mann Base|Doctor Guillermo Mann Base]] (Chile) and adjoining [[Cape Shirreff Field Station]] (USA) operate on [[Cape Shirreff]] since 1991 and 1996 respectively, while [[C\u00e1mara Base]] (Argentina) on the tiny nearby [[Half Moon Island (South Shetland Islands)|Half Moon Island]] is one of the early bases in the Antarctic Peninsula region established in 1953. These facilities are used also by visiting scientists from various nations; in particular, the Bulgarian base has hosted the first steps in Antarctic research by scientists from countries such as Portugal, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Mongolia and Turkey.\n\nAll four bases are permanent settlements, although inhabited only during the summer season. Their accommodation capacity is ca. 51, 18, 11 and 12 persons respectively, making it a total of 92 persons (80 for Livingston Island proper). The number of people inhabiting the bases in any particular season is actually greater as some of them stay for part of the time and are replaced by others.<ref name=\"General\"/><ref name=\"EFE\">[https://www.efefuturo.com/ciencia/pedro-duque-base-antartida/ Pedro Duque inaugura la remodelaci\u00f3n de una base en la Ant\u00e1rtida.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404130111/https://www.efefuturo.com/ciencia/pedro-duque-base-antartida/ |date=2019-04-04 }} EFE Future website, 4 February 2019</ref>\n[[File:C\u00e1mara-Base.jpg|thumb|200px|[[C\u00e1mara Base]] (Argentina) with Livingston Island in the background]]\n[[File:Cape Shirreff.JPG|290px|thumb|left|[[Doctor Guillermo Mann Base|Guillermo Mann Base]] (Chile, left) and [[Cape Shirreff Field Station]] (USA, right)]]\nOccasional or more permanent field camps support research in remote areas of the island.

Except for the ice-free Byers Peninsula and some isolated patches, the land surface is covered by an ice cap with ice domes and plateaus in the central and western areas, and a number of valley glaciers formed by the more mountainous relief of eastern Livingston. Certain areas of the ice cap, especially near glacier termini or over steeper slopes, are densely crevassed and almost inaccessible without specialized equipment. Elsewhere, the surface is smooth, hard and comfortable for walking, skiing or snowmobiling. However, the danger of falling into some hidden crevasse masked by a [[snow bridge]] is ever-present, including in frequently visited and supposedly well-known localities. Protracted periods of warmer weather tend to make the snow bridges more unstable and hazardous.<ref name=\"General\"/>\n\nTypical of the island's glaciology are the conspicuous ash layers originating from volcanic activity on neighbouring [[Deception Island]].<ref>J.

[[Guillermo Mann Base|Doctor Guillermo Mann Base]] (Chile) and adjoining [[Cape Shirreff Field Station]] (USA) operate on [[Cape Shirreff]] since 1991 and 1996 respectively, while [[C\u00e1mara Base]] (Argentina) on the tiny nearby [[Half Moon Island (South Shetland Islands)|Half Moon Island]] is one of the early bases in the Antarctic Peninsula region established in 1953. These facilities are used also by visiting scientists from various nations; in particular, the Bulgarian base has hosted the first steps in Antarctic research by scientists from countries such as Portugal, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Mongolia and Turkey.\n\nAll four bases are permanent settlements, although inhabited only during the summer season. Their accommodation capacity is ca. 51, 18, 11 and 12 persons respectively, making it a total of 92 persons (80 for Livingston Island proper).

{"title_page": "Christianity in Serbia", "text_new": "{{lead too short|date=January 2012}}\n\n'''[[Christianity]]''' is the predominant religion in '''[[Serbia]]'''. The Constitution of Serbia defines it as a [[secular state]] with guaranteed religious freedom. [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians with 6,079,396 comprise 84.5% of country's population. The [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] is the largest and traditional church of the country, adherents of which are overwhelmingly Serbs. Other Orthodox Christian communities in Serbia include Montenegrins, Romanians, Vlachs, [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] and [[Bulgarians]].\n\n==History==\n===Early Christianity===\n\nSaints [[Florus and Laurus]] are venerated as Christian martyrs, and lived in the 2nd century in [[Ulpiana]] (Lipljan), in modern Serbia. According to traditions, they were twin brothers from Constantinople who were employed to build a pagan temple. They gave their salaries to the poor and are said to have cured the son of Mamertin, the local pagan priest, who then converted to Christianity. The temple was reconstructed into a Church, which prompted local pagans to kill the 300 Christians, including all aforementioned.<ref name=\"ocafs\">{{cite web|url= http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=102324|title=Martyr Florus of Illyria|year=2009|publisher=Orthodox Church in America|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] in 304, [[Sirmium]] became a place of martyrdom for saint [[Irenaeus of Sirmium|Irenaeus,]] [[Anastasia of Sirmium|Anastasia]] and Fausta. Not much before 313 while emperor [[Licinius]] was present in [[Singidunum]], he oversaw trial and murder of deacon Hermylus and Stratonicus whose bodies were thrown in the Danube but resurfaced downriver and were later buried by Christians and venerated as saints. Successor of Irenaeus as bishop of Sirmium was [[Domnus of Pannonia|Domnus]] who attended the [[First Council of Nicaea]]. By the mid 4th century, Christian communities on territory of modern-day Serbia were numerous and influential. Sirmium, Singidunum, [[Naissus (see)|Naissus,]] [[Viminacium]], [[Remesiana]], [[Horreum Margi]], [[Margum Dubravica|Margum]] and [[Ulpiana]] are all mentioned as bishoprics by 343.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zivota Jocic|url=http://archive.org/details/EpiskopijaRemezijanska|title=Episkopija Remezijanska}}</ref> Bishops [[Germinius of Sirmium]] and [[Ursacius of Singidunum]] were influental in then ongoing [[Arian controversy]]. Four ecclestiastical [[Councils of Sirmium]] were important events for whole Christendom. Bishop [[Nicetas of Remesiana]] during his long tenure (366-420) contributed much to the spread of Christianity in the region and earliest mention of monastic communities dates from his time. \n\nAfter the [[Edict of Milan]] (313), [[Kosovo and Metohia]] came under the jurisdiction of the Thessalonian vicariate; indicated in a letter from Pope [[Innocent I]] to the Thessalonian vicar Rufus in 412 that the vicariate included the area of [[Dardani#Roman Dardania|Dardania]]. Bishopric of Sirmium lost much influence once [[Huns]] raided the city in 441/442.

However, the conversion of the south Slavs from paganism to Christianity took place before the [[East\u2013West Schism|Great Schism]], the split between the Greek East and the Latin West. After the Schism, those who lived under the Eastern Orthodox sphere of influence became Orthodox and those who lived under the Catholic sphere of influence became Catholic. Some ethnologists consider that the distinct Serb and Croat identities relate to religion rather than ethnicity. With the arrival of the [[Ottoman Empire]], some [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] converted to [[Islam]]. This was particularly, but not wholly, so in [[Ottoman Bosnia|Bosnia]].

It is organized into [[metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]]es and [[eparchies]] located primarily in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and [[Croatia]], but also in surrounding countries, and all over the world. Since many Serbs have emigrated to foreign countries, there are now Serbian Orthodox communities worldwide.\n\nThe Serbian Orthodox Church is an [[autocephalous]], or [[ecclesiastical]]ly independent, member of the Eastern Orthodox communion. The [[Serbian Patriarch]] serves as first among equals in his church; the current patriarch is [[Serbian Patriarch Irinej|Irinej]]. The Church achieved autocephalous status in 1219 under the leadership of [[St. Sava]], becoming independent [[Archbishopric of \u017di\u010da]].

It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on September 16, 1994 in the United States. It was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two]] on August&nbsp;28,&nbsp;1995. The episode was written by [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]], and directed by [[David Nutter]]. The episode helped explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. \"Little Green Men\" earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 10.3, being watched by 9.8 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics.\n\nThe show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder goes to the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]] to continue his search for proof on [[extraterrestrial life]]. Meanwhile, Scully attempts to aid him after being separated following the [[The Erlenmeyer Flask|closure of the X-Files]].\n\n\"Little Green Men\" was written specifically as a way for Mulder to question his belief in aliens. The episode features the first appearance of an [[Colonist (The X-Files)|extraterrestrial]], because series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] felt it was time to unveil one. In addition, the episode introduces the character of Senator [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Richard Matheson|Richard Matheson]]. Matheson was named after the sci-fi and horror writer [[Richard Matheson]], who wrote many episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the episode's prologue, [[Fox Mulder]] narrates a history of [[NASA]]'s [[Voyager program]] and the now-defunct [[High Resolution Microwave Survey]], which sought to contact [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] life in outer space. At the Survey's abandoned [[Arecibo Observatory|observatory]] in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]], the equipment inside suddenly activates, indicating a response from an alien intelligence.\n\nSince the [[The Erlenmeyer Flask|closure of the X-Files]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has reassigned Mulder to a low-level [[wiretap]] while his former partner, [[Dana Scully]], has returned to teaching at the [[FBI Academy]]. The two have a discreet meeting at the parking lot of the [[Watergate Hotel]], where Mulder admits that he has been doubting his belief in the paranormal since [[List of The X-Files characters#Deep Throat|Deep Throat]]'s assassination. Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister, [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]], was abducted.\n\nMulder is summoned to a meeting with [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Richard Matheson|Richard Matheson]], a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] who is a patron for his work. Matheson directs Mulder to Arecibo, assuring the agent that he will try to hold off a [[United States Air Force Security Forces#Blue Beret|Blue Beret]] UFO retrieval team said to be headed there in twenty-four hours. Mulder arrives at the Survey station, where he finds a frightened Puerto Rican man, Jorge, who draws a picture of an alien that he claims to have seen. Meanwhile, Scully, unaware of Mulder's whereabouts, tries to find him. Reviewing a list of flights from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Scully tracks Mulder down to [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nMulder discovers a signal, possibly originating from an extraterrestrial intelligence. During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright. When Scully goes to an airport to fly to Puerto Rico, she realizes she's being tracked by a couple, but manages to escape from them. Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals\u2014the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a tape reel.\n\nUpon his return to Washington, Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] and the [[Cigarette Smoking Man|Smoking Man]] for his actions. Mulder claims he still had enough evidence with the days missed to prosecute the subject of his assigned wiretap, and that his own phone calls were being monitored. Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the tape reel, Mulder finds it [[Electromagnetic pulse|blank due to a power surge]] during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.<ref name=\"plot\">Lowry, pp. 161\u201363.</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n[[File:The Sounds of Earth - GPN-2000-001976.jpg|The episode contains numerous references to the [[Voyager program]] and, more specifically, the [[Voyager Golden Record]].|thumb|right]]\nThis episode was written by [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] and directed by [[David Nutter]].<ref name=\"BBCdate\"/> Originally, the season two premiere was supposed to be written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]].

It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on September 16, 1994 in the United States. It was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two]] on August&nbsp;28,&nbsp;1995. The episode was written by [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]], and directed by [[David Nutter]]. The episode helped explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. \"Little Green Men\" earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 10.3, being watched by 9.8 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics.\n\nThe show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder goes to the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]] to continue his search for proof on [[extraterrestrial life]]. Meanwhile, Scully attempts to aid him after being separated following the [[The Erlenmeyer Flask|closure of the X-Files]].\n\n\"Little Green Men\" was written specifically as a way for Mulder to question his belief in aliens. The episode features the first appearance of an [[Colonist (The X-Files)|extraterrestrial]], because series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] felt it was time to unveil one. In addition, the episode introduces the character of Senator [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Richard Matheson|Richard Matheson]]. Matheson was named after the sci-fi and horror writer [[Richard Matheson]], who wrote many episodes of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the episode's prologue, [[Fox Mulder]] narrates a history of [[NASA]]'s [[Voyager program]] and the now-defunct [[High Resolution Microwave Survey]], which sought to contact [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] life in outer space. At the Survey's abandoned [[Arecibo Observatory|observatory]] in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]], the equipment inside suddenly activates, indicating a response from an alien intelligence.\n\nSince the [[The Erlenmeyer Flask|closure of the X-Files]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has reassigned Mulder to a low-level [[wiretap]] while his former partner, [[Dana Scully]], has returned to teaching at the [[FBI Academy]]. The two have a discreet meeting at the parking lot of the [[Watergate Hotel]], where Mulder admits that he has been doubting his belief in the paranormal since [[List of The X-Files characters#Deep Throat|Deep Throat]]'s assassination. Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister, [[Samantha Mulder|Samantha]], was abducted.\n\nMulder is summoned to a meeting with [[List of minor The X-Files characters#Richard Matheson|Richard Matheson]], a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] who is a patron for his work. Matheson directs Mulder to Arecibo, assuring the agent that he will try to hold off a [[United States Air Force Security Forces#Blue Beret|Blue Beret]] UFO retrieval team said to be headed there in twenty-four hours. Mulder arrives at the Survey station, where he finds a frightened Puerto Rican man, Jorge, who draws a picture of an alien that he claims to have seen. Meanwhile, Scully, unaware of Mulder's whereabouts, tries to find him. Reviewing a list of flights from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Scully tracks Mulder down to [[Puerto Rico]].\n\nMulder discovers a signal, possibly originating from an extraterrestrial intelligence. During a storm, Jorge gets scared and runs outside. Mulder finds him dead of fright. When Scully goes to an airport to fly to Puerto Rico, she realizes she's being tracked by a couple, but manages to escape from them. Meanwhile, as Mulder investigates Jorge's corpse, the room shakes. The door opens and the shadowy figure of an alien appears. Scully wakes Mulder up the next morning, finding him excited about the readouts and tapes of the signals\u2014the proof of aliens he has sought for so long. However, the Blue Beret team arrives, forcing them to flee with only a tape reel.\n\nUpon his return to Washington, Mulder is admonished by Assistant Director [[Walter Skinner]] and the [[Cigarette Smoking Man|Smoking Man]] for his actions. Mulder claims he still had enough evidence with the days missed to prosecute the subject of his assigned wiretap, and that his own phone calls were being monitored. Skinner then demands that the Smoking Man leave the room, and decides to not discipline Mulder. Investigating the tape reel, Mulder finds it [[Electromagnetic pulse|blank due to a power surge]] during the storm, but vows to continue his work regardless.<ref name=\"plot\">Lowry, pp. 161\u201363.</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n===Writing and casting===\n[[File:The Sounds of Earth - GPN-2000-001976.jpg|The episode contains numerous references to the [[Voyager program]] and, more specifically, the [[Voyager Golden Record]].|thumb|right]]\nThis episode was written by [[Glen Morgan]] and [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] and directed by [[David Nutter]].<ref name=\"BBCdate\"/> Originally, the season two premiere was supposed to be written by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]].
