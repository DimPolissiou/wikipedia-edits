Frankweiler''''' is a 1995 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] based on [[E.L. Konigsburg]]'s [[From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler|novel of the same name]]. The story is about a girl and her brother who run away from home to live in the [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and discover what they think is a lost treasure. The children, Claudia and Jamie, are transfixed with the treasure and won't leave without knowing what its secret is. [[Lauren Bacall]] stars in the title role.\n\nThe book was previously adapted into a [[From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler (1973 film)|1973 feature film]] starring [[Ingrid Bergman]], later released on home video as ''The Hideaways''.\n\n==Plot==\nClaudia is the middle child of a busy family. She is smart and responsible, often required to help her mother around the house. However, weary of the life in suburban Connecticut, she decides to find something grander. Her younger brother Jamie, along with his extensive savings from playing cards, is enlisted as her partner in crime. They run away from home to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.\n\nOnce they arrive, they spend their days in the museum, exploring and eavesdropping on different schools' guided tours. They hide in the bathrooms until after closing time and sleep in antique beds. While there they encounter \"The Angel,\" a marble statue recently auctioned off by the elusive Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. The striking piece is surrounded by mystery. Many experts dispute the artist who created the work, though many suppose it to be none other than [[Michelangelo]] himself. Claudia becomes determined to solve the mystery of \"The Angel.\"  Claudia and Jamie spend most of their time in searching and researching new things about the statue.\n\nThe following day, the two notice a small mark at the base of the piece. After some research, they find that the mark was one that Michelangelo made on numerous works. Claudia disguises herself as an adult in order to make an appointment with a museum worker to inform them of their discovery. Contrary to her hopes, the official informs her that they knew of the mark but are unsure if it is authentic.\n\nJamie, homesick after a week away, catches a cold. Refusing to go home before they solve the mystery, Claudia suggests that they visit the statue's previous owner, Mrs. Frankweiler. She refuses to tell them directly, but does permit them to attempt to discover the answer for themselves. After leading them to a room lined from floor to ceiling with filing cabinets, she informs them that they have one hour to search for the truth. After 54 minutes of fruitless effort, Claudia uncovers the correct file. It contains a sketch of the sculpture from one of Michelangelo's notebooks, proving that he is, indeed, the creator. Finally appeased, the siblings permit Mrs. Frankweiler to drive them home.\n\n==Authenticity==\nThe film lacks the narrative of Mrs. Frankweiler present in the book which causes it to lose much of the book's humor and wisdom.<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler/review/131325]</ref> For the majority of the film, the script stays true to the action in the book. However, Claudia's posing as an adult and Jamie's cold are not present in the novel. ''[[TV Guide]]'' asserts that these changes may differ from the book but bring added drama to the film.\n\n==Critical acclaim==\nTV Guide granted the film three and a half stars out of four. It declared that the film was a \"somewhat dry, but still thoroughly entertaining adaptation of an excellent story.\" They also write that the film \"celebrates the magic and beauty of art, the fun of an adventure, and most of all, a child's need to feel important.\" Their final word on the matter proclaim that \"the performances and production are first rate. The children are variously brilliant, bratty and excitable, and Lauren Bacall is appropriately dignified as Mrs. Frankweiler.\"<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/from-the-mixed-up-files-of-mrs-basil-e-frankweiler/review/131325]</ref>\n\nJ.

He begins most episodes with his signature words, taken from [[Arthur Rimbaud]], \"If memory serves me right...\u300c\u79c1\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u304c\u78ba\u304b\u306a\u3089\u3070\u2026\u300d\"(Jadis) si je me souviens bien...\" and starts the cooking time with the phrase \"Allez Cuisine!\". The show has two regular commentators, [[Kenji Fukui]] who narrates the action on the floor, and [[Yukio Hattori]], a food scholar and founder of the [[Hattori Nutrition College]]. A floor reporter, [[Shinichiro Ohta]], reports to Fukui on what the challengers and Iron Chefs are preparing, their strategy, and their comments, breaking Fukui's train of commentary with a polite \"Fukui-[[Japanese honorifics|san]]?\". One or two guest commentators (who also serve as judges) also make frequent appearances. The commentary covers ingredients, history of contenders, and other background information to give viewers context for what is happening in the kitchen.\n\n===Story===\nThe supposed \"story\" behind ''Iron Chef'' is recounted at the beginning of every episode. A title card, with a quote from famed French food author [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] first appears: \"Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.\" Then, it is said that Kaga \"realized his dream in a form never seen before\" and specially constructed a cooking arena called \"Kitchen Stadium\" in his castle. There, visiting chefs from \"around the world\" would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself is a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire. The English name ''Iron Chef'' comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs at the beginning of the battle.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Iron Chef:The Official Book (Tibetan Edition) |last=Hoketsu |first=Kaoru |author2=Fuji Television |year=2000 |publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-425-18088-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ironchefofficial00hoke/page/4 4] |url=https://archive.org/details/ironchefofficial00hoke/page/4 |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n=== Iron Chefs ===\nFrom the beginning of the show in 1993, there were three Iron Chefs: Iron Chef Japanese [[Rokusaburo Michiba]], Iron Chef Chinese [[Chen Kenichi]], and Iron Chef French [[Yutaka Ishinabe]]. After the first season, Ishinabe decided to step down and become an 'honorary Iron Chef', thus passing the mantle of Iron Chef French to [[Hiroyuki Sakai]] in 1994. Ishinabe would return for two more battles during Season 3. At the beginning of Season 4 in 1996, Michiba announced his retirement and debuted [[Koumei Nakamura]] as the new Iron Chef Japanese. Michiba would return on rare occasions for special Kitchen Stadium battles. In 1997, Chairman Kaga announced a new, additional Iron Chef to the group: Iron Chef Italian [[Masahiko Kobe]]. He was the youngest of the Iron Chefs and would battle sparingly throughout the rest of the show, ascending to the stage separately from the three main Iron Chefs, and surrounded by a chamber string ensemble. In 1998, Nakamura also decided to retire and passed the title of Iron Chef Japanese to [[Masaharu Morimoto]].\n\n===Iron Chef statistics===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Iron Chef\n!Title\n!Wins \n!Losses\n!Draws\n!No Contests\n!Total\n!Win %<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Based on weighted average (.5 victory for a draw).</ref>\n|-\n|{{Color box|gold|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|[[Chen Kenichi]]|\u9673 \u5efa\u4e00|Chin Ken'ichi}}\n|Iron Chef [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]]\n|align=\"center\"|66\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|93\n|align=\"center\"|72.6%\n|-\n|{{Color box|green|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Yutaka|Ishinabe}}|\u77f3\u934b \u88d5|Ishinabe Yutaka}}\n|Iron Chef [[French cuisine|French]] (I)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|align=\"center\"|87.5%\n|-\n|{{Color box|red|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Hiroyuki|Sakai}}|\u5742\u4e95 \u5b8f\u884c|Sakai Hiroyuki}}\n|Iron Chef French (II)\n|align=\"center\"|70\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|86\n|align=\"center\"|82.4%\n|-\n|{{Color box|white|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Masahiko|Kobe}}|\u795e\u6238 \u52dd\u5f66|Kobe Masahiko}}\n|Iron Chef [[Italian cuisine|Italian]]\n|align=\"center\"|16\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|68.8%\n|-\n|{{Color box|blue|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Rokusaburo|Michiba}}|\u9053\u5834 \u516d\u4e09\u90ce|Michiba Rokusabur\u014d}}\n|Iron Chef [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] (I)\n|align=\"center\"|33\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|39\n|align=\"center\"|85.9%\n|-\n|{{Color box|purple|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Koumei|Nakamura}}|\u4e2d\u6751 \u5b5d\u660e|Nakamura K\u014dmei}}\n|Iron Chef Japanese (II)\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|align=\"center\"|11\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|35\n|align=\"center\"|66.2%\n|-\n|{{Color box|silver|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Masaharu|Morimoto}}|\u68ee\u672c \u6b63\u6cbb|Morimoto Masaharu}}\n|Iron Chef Japanese (III)\n|align=\"center\"|17\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|align=\"center\"|67.3%\n|}\n\n<small>{{Refbegin}}\n{{Refend}}</small>\n\n===Show staff===\n* [[Kenji Fukui]], Announcer/Commentator (English voice: [[Bill Bickard]])\n* [[Yukio Hattori]], Commentator (English voice:  Scott Morris)\n* [[Takeshi Kaga]] (''as Chairman Kaga''), Host  (English voice: Duncan Hamilton, Kent Frick)\n* [[Shinichiro Ohta]], Kitchen Reporter (English voice: [[Jeff Manning]])\n* Kyoichi Tanaka, Director\n* Masahiro Ito, Screenwriter\n* [[Kund\u014d Koyama]], Screenwriter\n* Setsuko Yuuki, Food Coordinator\n* [[Dave Spector]] served as translator and commentator for \"New York Special.\"\n\n===Original format===\nOriginally, challengers vied with each other in preliminary \"battles\" to earn the right to face an Iron Chef in a 90-minute competition, and should a challenger win twice against Iron Chefs, the challenger would be given the title of \"Honorary Iron Chef\".  However, this format proved unpopular, the preliminary round was scrapped and the main contest was reduced to the now familiar 60 minutes. The awarding of honorary Iron Chef titles to challengers was also discontinued (although this was largely a moot point as few challengers ever defeated two Iron Chefs in separate contests), but was given as an emeritus title for a retiring Iron Chef.  Once honorary titles were no longer issued, challengers who beat an Iron Chef had to settle for, according to the English version's introduction, \"the people's ovation and fame forever\".\n\nIn each episode, chefs have one hour to cook and improvise a multi-course meal around a theme ingredient that must be present in each dish. Before the actual taping, the chefs are given a short list of possible themes, allowing the producers of the show to get any ingredients that may be needed.  Judges' primary goal was said to be determining which chef was able to \"best express the unique qualities of the theme ingredient\". In rare cases, the format changed\u2014[[angler fish]] battles were typically 75 minutes in length, and [[noodle]] battles had the Iron Chef stop after 50 minutes of cooking, only to resume after the challenger's dishes were tasted so that the noodles could be served right after cooking.\n\n===Theme ingredients===\nFeatured ingredients tend toward the exotic and expensive. Many theme ingredients reflect the Japanese origin of the show\u2014river [[eel]], [[tofu]], [[udon]]\u2014though ingredients more familiar in the West, such as [[bell pepper]]s, summer [[sweetcorn|corn]], and [[peach]]es, are spotlighted as well. In one episode devoted to [[asparagus]], the challenger boasted that he used over $1,000 worth of [[lobster]] (which he then discarded) simply to flavor his asparagus in this battle against Iron Chef [[Masaharu Morimoto]].\n\nInitially, a minimum of three dishes were to be prepared, although some challengers have finished only a single dish; four is the typical number. The record for highest number of dishes prepared for a battle was eight, first set by challenger Kenji Kaji against [[Rokusaburo Michiba|Iron Chef Michiba]] in \"Battle [[Umeboshi]]\".  Five (later six) servings of each dish are prepared: one each for the Chairman and judges, and one for photography and presentation.\n\n===Assistant chefs===\nEach chef is also given two assistants, who are supposedly students of Kaga's \"Gourmet Academy\" (in reality, they are students of  [[Hattori Nutrition College]]).  If the challenger does not speak Japanese, students who can speak in the challenger's native language are sometimes provided. In a notable exception, San Francisco chef [[Ron Siegel]] struggled with his assistants, who did not speak English. One assistant, Kenichi Miyanaga, became a challenger himself, taking on Iron Chef Morimoto in a [[sweetfish]] battle.\n\n===Commentary and judging===\nThroughout the cook-off, running commentary is made in a booth near the cooking area by an announcer, [[Kenji Fukui]]; a commentator, [[Yukio Hattori]], and one or two of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally [[Shinichiro Ohta]]) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show's screenwriters based on the chef's explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four and, later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes the dishes and judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality.  Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with ten given for taste and five each for presentation and originality.  The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef that makes the highest points total.)\n\nChairman Kaga tastes the dishes along with the judges.  While he occasionally makes comments and seeks input from judges during tasting, he generally does not participate in scoring; he did, however, during the ''2000th Dish'' Battle.  During this episode, a team of French cuisine chefs\u2014captain [[Hiroyuki Sakai]], the original Iron Chef French [[Yutaka Ishinabe]], and former challenger and Etsuo Joh\u2014battled a team of Chinese cuisine chefs composed of captain [[Chen Kenichi]], former challenger Sozo Myamoto, and former challenger [[Yuji Wakiya]] (who would later be Iron Chef Chinese on the 2012 revival).  To break the tie, Chairman Kaga asked them to allow him this one instance of selfishness, and he cast his vote for the French team.\n\n===Ties===\nIn the case of a deadlock (as was possible during the era of the four-judge panel), first place is awarded to the chef with the greater number of points. On the rare occasions that the scores were also tied, an immediate \"overtime battle\" was held to determine the winner. In overtime the chefs are given 30 minutes to prepare dishes with a different key ingredient, having to make do with what remains of their pantry or with items that were previously prepared for the main battle. The overtime battles are aired as a separate episode. On one occasion, the overtime battle itself resulted in a tie, prompting Chairman Kaga to declare both the Iron Chef and challenger winners.<ref>This occurred during a challenge between Iron Chef [[Chen Kenichi]] and French challenger Dominique Corby of the [[Tour d'Argent]] in episode #IC1C16, where the main theme was [[foie gras]], and in episode #IC1C17 (overtime), where the theme was [[asparagus]].</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nThe stage setting for the show, {{Nihongo|\"Kitchen Stadium\"|\u30ad\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2\u30e0|Kitchin Sutajiamu}}, the high-quality (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in the cooking battles, and Kaga's extravagant [[costume]]s required the show to have a budget far higher than that of most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of [[foie gras]], 54 [[bream|sea breams]], 827 Ise [[shrimp]], 964 [[matsutake|matsutake mushroom]]s, 4,593 [[egg (food)|eggs]], 1,489 [[truffle]]s, 4,651&nbsp;grams of [[caviar]], and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to [[Yen|\u00a5]]843,354,407<ref>Foreword by Takeshi Kaga, \"''Iron Chef'':The Official Book\" (Kaoru Hoketsu, translator) (Berkley Books, 2001)</ref> (or about [[United States dollar|$]]7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle [[Swiftlet#Culinary use|Swallow's Nest]], which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark's fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.\n\n===Final episode and specials===\nFor the show's grand finale, aired from September 10, 1999 to September 24, 1999, the Iron Chefs faced off against each other in a three-part battle, with the winner to face French chef [[Alain Passard]], owner of Michelin three-star restaurant L\u2019Arpege, with the winner dubbed the \"King of Iron Chefs\".\n\nIn the first round, Iron Chef Chinese Chen defeated Iron Chef Italian Kobe in Battle Pork (Tokyo X). In the second round Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto in Battle Bell Pepper. In the final match, Sakai defeated Chen in Battle Homard Lobster and was dubbed \"King of Iron Chefs\". Prior to that episode, Sakai had never won a lobster battle.\n\nIn the final bonus match in Kitchen Stadium, with all of the current and previous Iron Chefs looking on, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated [[Alain Passard]] in Battle Long-Gang Chicken. Thus, Hiroyuki Sakai was dubbed as both \"King of Iron Chefs\" and \"The No. 1 in the World.\"\n\nThere were two reunion specials produced in 2000.  The first was \"The Millennium Special\"; the second was \"New York Special\", staged in a makeshift Kitchen Stadium at [[Webster Hall]] in New York City, and was the first appearance of Bobby Flay. Another reunion episode of the show (entitled \"Iron Chef: 21st Century Battle\") was produced and broadcast in 2001. A final reunion episode was produced and broadcast in 2002, entitled \"The Japan Cup\".\n\n===United States reception===\nWhile always a success in [[Japan]], ''Iron Chef'' became a surprise cult favorite in the United States when it was picked up by the [[Food Network]] in 1999 and [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |title=Cool Japan: Why Japanese remakes are so popular on American TV, and where we\u2019re getting it wrong |publisher=AsianWeek |accessdate=2008-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915232726/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |archivedate=2008-09-15 }}</ref> Part of the U.S. appeal was due to the dubbing, which gave the show a [[camp (style)|campy]] charm that evoked English-dubbed [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] [[kung fu movies]] of the 1970s. Audiences also found amusing some of the over-the-top culinary concoctions regularly featured on the show, eventually leading to a spoof on [[Saturday Night Live]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/articles/the-history-of-iron-chef.html|title = The History of Iron Chef|date = |accessdate = August 7, 2015|website = Food Network|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===International syndication===\nThe show was presented in the United States and Canada on the [[Food Network]], [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and/or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] into English. It is also actively broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS TV]] in Australia. In the case of SBS this is unusual as the network has a policy favouring in-house subtitling. It may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps by the fact that in most episodes, the flamboyant Chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed. However, episodes aired since February 2009 have seen the Chairman's voice dubbed rather than subtitled as was the case in previous airings, except when he sends the chefs into battle.\n\nThe show was broadcast on the [[Finland|Finnish]] channel [[SubTV]], as well as the [[Sweden|Swedish]] channel TV400 ([[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]). ''Iron Chef'' was also broadcast on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 2003 and 2004, as part of its \"Japanese Christmas Cracker\" and \"Japanorama\" strands.\n\nThe show had again aired in the U.S. on the [[Fine Living Network|Fine Living]] Network from May 5, 2008 until the channel went off the air on May 30, 2010; however, the music from earlier broadcasts, taken from the film ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'', had been replaced due to music licensing issues with [[NBC Universal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The [[Cooking Channel]] picked up the series on June 1, 2010, when it replaced Fine Living.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookingchanneltv.com|title=Cooking Channel - Recipes, Shows and Cooking Videos from Top Global Chefs : Cooking Channel|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>  The stations that have carried the series, Fine Living, Cooking Channel and Food Network, are all owned by [[Scripps Networks Interactive]].\n\n==Notable challengers==\n{{For|a full list of challengers|List of Iron Chef episodes}}\n\nCertain challengers have made repeat appearances, or have been particularly memorable.\n\n(Japanese names are not in the traditional Japanese style [i.e. family name first] but have been written in standard European style [i.e. family name last].)\n*    Jacques Borie: An [[Meilleur_Ouvrier_de_France|MOF]] winner.  He is the only challenger who beat iron chef Yutaka Ishinabe.\n* '''Dominique Corby''': a chef at la Tour d'Argent Tokyo, who fought iron chef Chen Kenichi. He is the only competitor to have tied the Iron Chef twice\u2014once initially and again in the overtime battle; he and Chen were subsequently declared joint winners of that battle.\n* '''[[Alain Passard]]''': Three star French chef and owner of L\u2019Arpege, located in Paris. Ties Iron Chef Koumei Nakamura in the 1997 World Cup championship and was the final challenger in Kitchen Stadium, losing to Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai in the finals of the \"King of Iron Chefs.\"\n* '''Cheng Kazuhiko''': First challenger to defeat an Iron Chef. The theme ingredient was [[Octopus (food)|octopus]].\n* '''Tadamichi \u014cta''': defeated Iron Chef Sakai in an octopus battle, in which Sakai was particularly squeamish about handling the live creatures. Later became the leader of the \"\u014cta Faction\" (\u5927\u7530\u8ecd\u56e3) of traditional Japanese chefs.  The \u014cta Faction regularly challenged Iron Chef Morimoto and his neo-Japanese style, winning one out of five battles. \u014cta Faction was the name used in the translated version shown on Food Network. In the original Japanese version (shown in the U.S. and transcribed by the Iron Chef Reporter in southern California) the group is called ''\u014cta\u2019s Party of Heaven and Earth'' (OPHE; \u5927\u7530\u5929\u5730\u306e\u4f1a). Every time he appeared, Fukui would point out that he was not related to Shinichiro Ohta, the show's floor reporter.\n* '''Kyoko Kagata''': The first female chef to appear on the show, and the youngest chef to be victorious.  Challenged Chen Kenichi.  An interesting side note is that the second female challenger, cooking show host '''Katsuyo Kobayashi''', also faced Chen. Kobayashi indirectly picked Chen because she allowed Kaga to pick for her. Chen lost both battles, and purportedly caught some flak from chef-friends of his. Chen fought another two female challengers in separate battles and won. Later, she appeared again and challenged Chen Kenichi. This time, Chen won the battle with all three of the four judges gave him 20 and gave Kagata 19. Kishi gave Chen 19 and Kagata 17.\n* '''[[Toshiro Kandagawa]]''' (three wins out of six battles): Regular challenger who aligned himself with the \u014cta Faction, a group of hardline traditionalists in Japanese cuisine, and often led his army of fellow chefs and proteg\u00e9s into Kitchen Stadium during challenges.  Kandagawa has taken part in several battles wherein he supported apprentices to battle an Iron Chef (only one out of the ten won). Kandagawa also participated in several \"battle special\" episodes, including the '''21st Century Battle'''.  Rokusaburo Michiba was his main rival until Michiba's retirement as Iron Chef Japanese; he has recorded victories over Chen, Nakamura and Sakai.\n* '''[[Bobby Flay]]''': Flay entered into a bit of a rivalry with Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto during the show's special ''New York Battle''. Flay complained that his side of the kitchen was poorly laid out (it was noted in an Iron Chef America \"Behind the Scenes\" episode that the kitchen was hastily set up in the provided forum).  At one point Flay received an [[electric shock]], transmitted by a wet floor and faulty wiring, when he grabbed a metal pan on the range. When Flay stood on his cutting board at the end of the battle, Morimoto declared that Flay was \"not a chef\" for disregarding the cleanliness of one's cutting board. Morimoto won, but Flay was offered a rematch. He accepted, and got his revenge, in the '''21st Century Battle''' in Japan, where, at battle's end, he tossed the cutting board off the counter before climbing on it, so as not to offend Morimoto again.  Flay is now an Iron Chef alongside Morimoto on [[Iron Chef America]]. This rivalry was revisited for a third time with Morimoto defeating Flay during the Holiday Ice Battle (''Iron Chef America'', November 2009)\n* '''[[Ron Siegel]]''': Of Charles Nob Hill in San Francisco became the first American chef to defeat an Iron Chef (Hiroyuki Sakai).\n* '''Michael Noble''': The first Canadian to appear on the program, challenged Morimoto in Battle Potato in 1999 and lost.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Serie A'''|\u30bb\u30ea\u30a8\uff21|extra=also known as the \"''Big Leaguers''\"}}: A group of Italian chefs which named itself after [[Italy]]'s [[Serie A|top football league]] and frequently challenged Iron Chef Italian Kobe: Mario Frittoli, Constantino Gemmoli, and Franco Canzoniere. No group member ever defeated Kobe, although one member did defeat Morimoto (pasta specialist Marco Paolo Molinari in a porcini mushroom battle).\n* {{Nihongo|'''Club Mistral'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30d6\u30df\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30eb}}: A group of young specialists in French cuisine that targeted Iron Chef French Sakai in a similar fashion, although they took on Iron Chef Chinese Chen and Iron Chef French Ishinabe once each as well. Only one of them managed a win (Kazutaka Okabe versus Sakai, in a lamb battle) despite several attempts.\n* '''[[Heichinrou]]''' (one win out of three battles): The oldest restaurant in [[Yokohama Chinatown]] sent three challengers to challenge Iron Chef Chinese Chen in 1999, losing two battles with Chinese ingredients before winning the final.\n* '''Dr. [[Yukio Hattori]]''': A [[gentlemen's agreement]] went on between the Chairman of Gourmet Academy (Kaga) and the President of Culinary Academy (Hattori) where the Doctor agreed to battle an Iron Chef. If he won, he would be given a spot alongside the Iron Chefs and if he lost he would keep working for Kaga.  As he remained a commentator until the end of the series, one can easily deduce the outcomes of his two battles. [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]] was invited as a guest judge for the event, and Honorary Iron Chef Ishinabe served in a commentary role in Hattori's place for the battle. Hattori also battled and lost against Iron Chef Japanese II [[Koumei Nakamura]] in his final battle.\n*'''Takashi Sait\u014d''' (not to be confused with [[Takashi Saito (baseball)|the baseball player]]): top apprentice of [[Chen Kenmin]], and coach of Chen Kenichi. Chen beat his tutor in a prawn battle. Saito recreated Kenmin's original prawns in chili sauce, while the younger Chen created his father's modern version of the dish (Canap\u00e9 Style with ketchup).  In the ''2000th Dish Special'', Kaga said that Chen's prawns were his favorite dish to that point.\n*'''Kenichi Miyanaga''': a graduate of [[Hattori Nutrition College]], he was an assistant chef for several battles in Kitchen Stadium, and was eventually hired by Iron Chef Michiba after his retirement. He challenged Iron Chef Morimoto in a battle involving sweetfish.\n*'''[[Y\u016bji Wakiya]]''' (one win in three battles): A master of \"neo-Chinese\" cuisine, Wakiya lost to Iron Chef Sakai in Battle [[Sea Urchin]] but defeated Iron Chef Chen with [[papaya]]s. He later became part of Chen's team for the 2000th Dish Special. He was also named the second Iron Chef Chinese in the Millennium Cup and was supposed to take over Chen's place, but he never actually battled under the new title until the first episode of the 2012 revival.\n*'''Kazunari Takeda''': the first challenger defeat Iron Chef Masahiko Kobe in 30 minutes overtime battle with the theme ingredient Pink Prawn. He first tied with Masahiko Kobe during the battle of Cod Soft Roe and finally he made way to the 30 minutes overtime battle and won.\n*'''Liang Shuqing''': Liang Shueng's younger brother became the second challenger to defeat Iron Chef Chen Kenichi in 30 minutes overtime battle with the theme ingredient [[Konnyaku]]. He first tied with Chen Kenichi during the battle of [[Pork belly]] and finally he made way to the 30 minutes overtime battle and won.\n*'''Kentaro''': Katsuyo Kobayashi's son who wants to defeat Iron Chef Chen Kenichi like his mother did before. He first appeared in his mother's cook show at the age of 5 and at age 25 he further his skills in art, music and cooking. During the battle with Iron Chef Chen Kenichi he refused to use the same recipes like his mother. Chen beat Kentaro in the new potatoes battle.\n*'''Shin'ya Tasaki''': A champion wine sommelier and  president of the International Sommeliers Association {{as of|2013|lc=on}}.  He is the only non-professional chef to have defeated an Iron Chef, defeating Masahiko Kobe in the fatty tuna battle.\n*'''Jun'ichi It\u014d''' started French cooking at age 18 and left for France at age 28. He left for Italy three years later and joined [[Enoteca Pinchiorri]]. When he was 35, he opened his restaurant Herle Quin in Tokyo. He chose Chen Kenichi as the opponent, in battle [[yogurt]]. Chen won in a unanimous vote.\n*'''Kensuke Sakai''': An Italian chef, but most notable because his restaurant \"Nigiro\" was (at time of taping in 1998) really a food stand that he brings in by hand to a monastery's yard each night.  At his introduction, Sakai brought the food cart ''into Kitchen Stadium''.\n* Other female challengers include: Fuyuko Kond\u014d, Yoshie Urabe, Yoshiko Takemasa, Katsuko Nanao, Kumiko Kobayashi, and Miyoko Sakai, as well Australian Gillian Hirst, Chinese Cui Yufen, and Korean Lee Myong Suk. Among the women listed above, only Cui won in her battle (coincidentally against Chen).\n\n==Notable judges==\nThe result of a battle may be influenced by the lineup of judges, which changes from show to show.  A list of some of the more notable judges includes:\n\n(These names are not in the traditional [[East Asian]] style [i.e. family name first] but have been written in standard western style [i.e. family name last], as they appeared on the English dub of the show.)\n\n* [[Akebono Taro|Akebono]], [[Yokozuna (sumo)|Yokozuna]]\n* [[Chua Lam]], VP of [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]]\n* [[Jackie Chan]], actor and martial artist\n* [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]], a famous French chef who was titled \"Chef of the Century\" by the guide Gault Millau.\n* [[Julie Dreyfus]], French actress, also fluent in Japanese and English.

Unlike the original ''Ry\u014dri no Tetsujin'', the new show was titled '''''Iron Chef''''' (\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5) in [[katakana]] characters. The Chairman's role was assumed by Japanese actor [[Hiroshi Tamaki]]. Fuji TV commentator Mizuki Sano hosted the program, and the reporters were Yurika Mita and Daisuke Miyagawa. [[Yukio Hattori|Dr. Yukio Hattori]] returned from the original ''Iron Chef'' series to provide commentary. Three new Iron Chefs were chosen; Jun Kurogi as Iron Chef Japanese, [[Y\u016bji Wakiya]] as Iron Chef Chinese, and Y\u014dsuke Suga as Iron Chef French.\n\nThe first battle in the new show was a two-hour special with two battles. The first challenger was former Kitchen Stadium challenger Kenichi Miyanaga, recommended by Iron Chef [[Rokusaburo Michiba]]. Miyanaga is Michiba's top apprentice and battled Iron Chef Suga. The challenger in the second battle was Kentaro Chen, recommended by his father Iron Chef [[Chen Kenichi]], who battled Iron Chef Wakiya.<ref name=\"fujitv.co.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fujitv.co.jp/b_hp/ironchef/index.html|title=\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5 - \u30d5\u30b8\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt was announced, after airing thirteen episodes, that the new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013.

Commentary was provided by [[Michael Burger]] and [[Anthony Dias Blue]], with floor reporting by [[Sissy Biggers]].  The show featured four Iron Chefs: Iron Chef American [[Todd English]] (whose specialty is actually Mediterranean food), Iron Chef French Jean Francois Meteigner, Iron Chef Italian [[Alessandro Stratta]], and Iron Chef Asian [[Roy Yamaguchi]].  In the show's only two battles, English defeated [[Kerry Simon]] in a dungeness crab battle, and Stratta defeated [[Marcus Samuelsson]] in a turkey battle.\n\nThese shows were neither a critical nor popular success, perhaps because the show focused little on cooking&mdash;a major part of the Japanese program. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.\n\n====Iron Chef America====\n{{Main|Iron Chef America}}\n{{see also|The Next Iron Chef}}\n\nIn 2004, Food Network announced that they would show an Iron Chef special, called \"[[Iron Chef America]]: Battle of the Masters\", featuring Sakai and Morimoto dueling with American Iron Chefs [[Bobby Flay]], [[Mario Batali]], and [[Wolfgang Puck]], all Food Network personalities and renowned [[United States|American]] [[celebrity chef]]s. (Morimoto and Flay battled in two previous Iron Chef specials that were made after the original series aired.) The specials featured [[Alton Brown]] as the announcer and [[Mark Dacascos]] playing the role of The Chairman (in the storyline, this Chairman is the nephew of Takeshi Kaga).\n\nThe show received high ratings and rave reviews and in October 2004, Food Network began taping weekly episodes that premiered starting in January 2005.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Some changes were made to the show, most notably replacing Puck with Morimoto as an Iron Chef (a fourth, [[Cat Cora]], was added later), and the location was moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]]. The fifth Iron Chef, [[Michael Symon]], was added for his win in ''[[The Next Iron Chef]]''. In 2009, Chef [[Jose Garces]] became the sixth Iron Chef following his victory in the second season of ''[[The Next Iron Chef]]''. In 2010, Chef Marc Forgione won the third season of [[The Next Iron Chef]], becoming the seventh Iron Chef on Iron Chef America.  Chef [[Geoffrey Zakarian]] won [[The Next Iron Chef]]'s fourth season in 2011, making him the eighth Iron Chef. In 2012, Chef [[Alexandra Guarnaschelli]] became the ninth and most recent Iron Chef after winning the fifth season of ''The Next Iron Chef''.\n\nEven though both [[Todd English]] and [[Kerry Simon]] from ''Iron Chef USA'' have competed on ''Iron Chef America'', the episodes did not mention their IC-USA appearances.\n\n====Iron Chef Gauntlet====\n{{main|Iron Chef Gauntlet}}\n'''Iron Chef Gauntlet''' is a Spring 2017 revival series of ''The Next Iron Chef'' on ''Food Network''.\n\n====Iron Chef Showdown====\n{{main|Iron Chef Showdown}}\n'''Iron Chef Showdown''' is a Fall 2017 revival series of ''Iron Chef'' on ''Food Network''.\n\n===Krav Sakinim===\nIn 2007, Krav Sakinim ({{lang-he|\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e1\u05db\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd}}, Knife Fight), a show based on Iron Chef, began airing on [[Israel]]'s [[Israel 10|Channel 10]]. Each episode features a different prominent Israeli chef, who competes against one of the show's featured foreign chefs. All Israeli winners compete against one another in the finals and the winner competes against a foreign chef for the title of season champion. Season 1 featured only [[France|French]] chef [[St\u00e9phane Froidevaux]], who won the season's finale, while season 2 saw the inclusion of [[Italy|Italian]] chef Alfredo Russo,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/960454.html One dish too many], Haaretz, Retrieved March 19, 2008</ref> meaning both [[Michelin Guide|Michelin star]] holders would have to compete against each other for a spot in the final bout. The show is actively hosted by actor Oded Menashe and the regular commentators are chef Yaron Kastenboim and catering company owner Ran Shmueli. While in season 1, the panel of judges was made up mostly of celebrities from the entertainment industry, season 2 features renowned persons from the culinary industry, such as restaurant critics and chefs. The competitors prepare a three-course meal, with each dish given a score of up to 10 points by each member of the panel and commentators, accumulating up to 150 points per chef (compared to 90 points in season 1, where the commentators had relatively more points to give).\n\n===Iron Chef UK===\n{{Main|Iron Chef UK}}\nIn 2010, UK public television network [[Channel 4]] debuted Iron Chef UK, based on Iron Chef.

Judging occurs in two rounds, with the first round being appetizers, and the second being the main courses. Two challengers prepare the appetizer, producing one appetizer each, while the Iron Chef prepares two. These are judged, and the standing for the team versus the Iron Chef are announced. Then the second half begins: the challenging team and the Iron Chef return to the kitchen to prepare the main course. The two challengers each prepare one dish, while the Iron Chef prepares two. Judging resumes, and the results are announced. Either the Challenging team wins, or the Iron Chef wins in overall score, and the best dish from the challenging team is also announced.

In this version of Iron Chef, there are four Iron Chefs: '''Chumpol Chaengprai''' (Thai cuisine); '''Boontham Pakpo''' (Japanese cuisine); '''Pongtawat \"Ian\" Chareomkittichai''' (Western cuisine); and '''Chaitep \"Mr. Lee\" Pattarapornpaisarn''' (Chinese cuisine). The program is hosted by '''Chakrit Yamnarn''' and the field reporter is '''DJ Pong''' (Nattapong Taengkasem). The format is different, in that in the first half of the program, there are three challengers who compete with each other to find out who is the best chef. The winner will compete against the Iron Chef on the second half of the program. This format was used for only 3 episode.\n\nOn February 22, 2012 the format of Iron Chef Thailand has been changed to: the first 30 minutes of the program is where the Challenger Chef will present his/her '''\"Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient\"''' to the guests. Then followed by the actual '''\"Iron Chef Battle\"''', similar to Iron Chef Japan where the host will ask the Challenger Chef to select the Iron Chef he/she want to challenge. After the Challenger Chef has selected the Iron Chef the Chairman will reveal the '''''\"Secret Ingredient\"''''' and once the Chairman says '''''\"Allez Cuisine\"''''' the battle begins. The battle time is 60 minutes where they will need to complete at least 4 dishes. The order in which Chefs present to the Judges will be determined by a coin toss conducted by the Host. The last 30 minutes of the program is '''\"Cooking with Iron Chef\"'''. Guests learn how to cook from the Iron Chef and win the \"Best Student\" at the end of the program.\n\nOn May 9, 2012 '''Chaitep Pattarapornpaisarn''' resigned from Iron Chef Chinese cuisine and was replaced by '''Hing Chung Lai (Peter Lai)'''.\n\nOn June 27, 2012 '''\"Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient\"''' became '''Signature Dish with Special Tests Challenger by variety choice'''\n\nOn December 5, 2012 Three new Iron Chefs have been appointed.

The series, which premiered on October 10, 1993, is a stylized [[cook-off]] featuring guest chefs challenging one of the show's resident \"Iron Chefs\" in a timed cooking battle built around a specific theme ingredient. The series ended on September 24, 1999, although occasional specials were produced until 2002. The series aired 309 episodes. Repeats are regularly aired on the [[Food Network (Canada)|Food Network]] in Canada, the [[Cooking Channel]] in the United States and on [[Special Broadcasting Service]] in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iron Chef|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/sales/programs/view/id/207/t/Iron-Chef|website=SBS Sales Home|publisher=SBS Australia|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> Fuji TV aired a new version of the show, titled {{nihongo|'''''Iron Chef'''''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5|Aian Shefu}}, starting on October 26, 2012.<ref name=\"newironchef\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fujitv.co.jp/fujitv/news/pub_2012/121016-371.html|script-title=ja:1993\u5e74\u304b\u3089\u7d0410\u5e74\u306b\u308f\u305f\u308a\u3001\u6599\u7406\u306e\u683c\u95d8\u756a\u7d44\u3068\u3057\u3066\u597d\u8a55\u3092\u535a\u3057\u305f\u300e\u6599\u7406\u306e\u9244\u4eba\u300f\u3002\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u300e\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5\u300f\u3068\u3057\u3066\u51f1\u65cb\u4e0a\u9678\u3092\u679c\u305f\u3059\uff01\uff01|author=Fuji Television|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=October 16, 2012|language=Japanese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018002313/http://www.fujitv.co.jp/fujitv/news/pub_2012/121016-371.html|archivedate=October 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe host of the show is the flamboyant [[Takeshi Kaga]], known on the show as {{Nihongo|'''Chairman Kaga'''|\u9e7f\u8cc0\u4e3b\u5bb0|Kaga Shusai}}. He begins most episodes with his signature words, taken from [[Arthur Rimbaud]], \"If memory serves me right...\u300c\u79c1\u306e\u8a18\u61b6\u304c\u78ba\u304b\u306a\u3089\u3070\u2026\u300d\"(Jadis) si je me souviens bien...\" and starts the cooking time with the phrase \"Allez Cuisine!\". The show has two regular commentators, [[Kenji Fukui]] who narrates the action on the floor, and [[Yukio Hattori]], a food scholar and founder of the [[Hattori Nutrition College]]. A floor reporter, [[Shinichiro Ohta]], reports to Fukui on what the challengers and Iron Chefs are preparing, their strategy, and their comments, breaking Fukui's train of commentary with a polite \"Fukui-[[Japanese honorifics|san]]?\". One or two guest commentators (who also serve as judges) also make frequent appearances. The commentary covers ingredients, history of contenders, and other background information to give viewers context for what is happening in the kitchen.\n\n===Story===\nThe supposed \"story\" behind ''Iron Chef'' is recounted at the beginning of every episode. A title card, with a quote from famed French food author [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] first appears: \"Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.\" Then, it is said that Kaga \"realized his dream in a form never seen before\" and specially constructed a cooking arena called \"Kitchen Stadium\" in his castle. There, visiting chefs from \"around the world\" would compete against his Gourmet Academy, led by his three (later four) Iron Chefs. Chairman Kaga himself is a showpiece, dressed in outlandish examples of men's formal attire. The English name ''Iron Chef'' comes from the show itself: Kaga would use this translation of the Japanese title when summoning his chefs at the beginning of the battle.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Iron Chef:The Official Book (Tibetan Edition) |last=Hoketsu |first=Kaoru |author2=Fuji Television |year=2000 |publisher=The Berkley Publishing Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-425-18088-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ironchefofficial00hoke/page/4 4] |url=https://archive.org/details/ironchefofficial00hoke/page/4 |accessdate=February 11, 2009 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n=== Iron Chefs ===\nFrom the beginning of the show in 1993, there were three Iron Chefs: Iron Chef Japanese [[Rokusaburo Michiba]], Iron Chef Chinese [[Chen Kenichi]], and Iron Chef French [[Yutaka Ishinabe]]. After the first season, Ishinabe decided to step down and become an 'honorary Iron Chef', thus passing the mantle of Iron Chef French to [[Hiroyuki Sakai]] in 1994. Ishinabe would return for two more battles during Season 3. At the beginning of Season 4 in 1996, Michiba announced his retirement and debuted [[Koumei Nakamura]] as the new Iron Chef Japanese. Michiba would return on rare occasions for special Kitchen Stadium battles. In 1997, Chairman Kaga announced a new, additional Iron Chef to the group: Iron Chef Italian [[Masahiko Kobe]]. He was the youngest of the Iron Chefs and would battle sparingly throughout the rest of the show, ascending to the stage separately from the three main Iron Chefs, and surrounded by a chamber string ensemble. In 1998, Nakamura also decided to retire and passed the title of Iron Chef Japanese to [[Masaharu Morimoto]].\n\n===Iron Chef statistics===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Iron Chef\n!Title\n!Wins \n!Losses\n!Draws\n!No Contests\n!Total\n!Win %<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Based on weighted average (.5 victory for a draw).</ref>\n|-\n|{{Color box|gold|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|[[Chen Kenichi]]|\u9673 \u5efa\u4e00|Chin Ken'ichi}}\n|Iron Chef [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]]\n|align=\"center\"|66\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|93\n|align=\"center\"|72.6%\n|-\n|{{Color box|green|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Yutaka|Ishinabe}}|\u77f3\u934b \u88d5|Ishinabe Yutaka}}\n|Iron Chef [[French cuisine|French]] (I)\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|align=\"center\"|87.5%\n|-\n|{{Color box|red|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Hiroyuki|Sakai}}|\u5742\u4e95 \u5b8f\u884c|Sakai Hiroyuki}}\n|Iron Chef French (II)\n|align=\"center\"|70\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|86\n|align=\"center\"|82.4%\n|-\n|{{Color box|white|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Masahiko|Kobe}}|\u795e\u6238 \u52dd\u5f66|Kobe Masahiko}}\n|Iron Chef [[Italian cuisine|Italian]]\n|align=\"center\"|16\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|68.8%\n|-\n|{{Color box|blue|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Rokusaburo|Michiba}}|\u9053\u5834 \u516d\u4e09\u90ce|Michiba Rokusabur\u014d}}\n|Iron Chef [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] (I)\n|align=\"center\"|33\n|align=\"center\"|5\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|39\n|align=\"center\"|85.9%\n|-\n|{{Color box|purple|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Koumei|Nakamura}}|\u4e2d\u6751 \u5b5d\u660e|Nakamura K\u014dmei}}\n|Iron Chef Japanese (II)\n|align=\"center\"|22\n|align=\"center\"|11\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|35\n|align=\"center\"|66.2%\n|-\n|{{Color box|silver|border=darkgray}} {{Nihongo|{{sortname|Masaharu|Morimoto}}|\u68ee\u672c \u6b63\u6cbb|Morimoto Masaharu}}\n|Iron Chef Japanese (III)\n|align=\"center\"|17\n|align=\"center\"|8\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|align=\"center\"|0\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|align=\"center\"|67.3%\n|}\n\n<small>{{Refbegin}}\n{{Refend}}</small>\n\n===Show staff===\n* [[Kenji Fukui]], Announcer/Commentator (English voice: [[Bill Bickard]])\n* [[Yukio Hattori]], Commentator (English voice:  Scott Morris)\n* [[Takeshi Kaga]] (''as Chairman Kaga''), Host  (English voice: Duncan Hamilton, Kent Frick)\n* [[Shinichiro Ohta]], Kitchen Reporter (English voice: [[Jeff Manning]])\n* Kyoichi Tanaka, Director\n* Masahiro Ito, Screenwriter\n* [[Kund\u014d Koyama]], Screenwriter\n* Setsuko Yuuki, Food Coordinator\n* [[Dave Spector]] served as translator and commentator for \"New York Special.\"\n\n===Original format===\nOriginally, challengers vied with each other in preliminary \"battles\" to earn the right to face an Iron Chef in a 90-minute competition, and should a challenger win twice against Iron Chefs, the challenger would be given the title of \"Honorary Iron Chef\".  However, this format proved unpopular, the preliminary round was scrapped and the main contest was reduced to the now familiar 60 minutes. The awarding of honorary Iron Chef titles to challengers was also discontinued (although this was largely a moot point as few challengers ever defeated two Iron Chefs in separate contests), but was given as an emeritus title for a retiring Iron Chef.  Once honorary titles were no longer issued, challengers who beat an Iron Chef had to settle for, according to the English version's introduction, \"the people's ovation and fame forever\".\n\nIn each episode, chefs have one hour to cook and improvise a multi-course meal around a theme ingredient that must be present in each dish. Before the actual taping, the chefs are given a short list of possible themes, allowing the producers of the show to get any ingredients that may be needed.  Judges' primary goal was said to be determining which chef was able to \"best express the unique qualities of the theme ingredient\". In rare cases, the format changed\u2014[[angler fish]] battles were typically 75 minutes in length, and [[noodle]] battles had the Iron Chef stop after 50 minutes of cooking, only to resume after the challenger's dishes were tasted so that the noodles could be served right after cooking.\n\n===Theme ingredients===\nFeatured ingredients tend toward the exotic and expensive. Many theme ingredients reflect the Japanese origin of the show\u2014river [[eel]], [[tofu]], [[udon]]\u2014though ingredients more familiar in the West, such as [[bell pepper]]s, summer [[sweetcorn|corn]], and [[peach]]es, are spotlighted as well. In one episode devoted to [[asparagus]], the challenger boasted that he used over $1,000 worth of [[lobster]] (which he then discarded) simply to flavor his asparagus in this battle against Iron Chef [[Masaharu Morimoto]].\n\nInitially, a minimum of three dishes were to be prepared, although some challengers have finished only a single dish; four is the typical number. The record for highest number of dishes prepared for a battle was eight, first set by challenger Kenji Kaji against [[Rokusaburo Michiba|Iron Chef Michiba]] in \"Battle [[Umeboshi]]\".  Five (later six) servings of each dish are prepared: one each for the Chairman and judges, and one for photography and presentation.\n\n===Assistant chefs===\nEach chef is also given two assistants, who are supposedly students of Kaga's \"Gourmet Academy\" (in reality, they are students of  [[Hattori Nutrition College]]).  If the challenger does not speak Japanese, students who can speak in the challenger's native language are sometimes provided. In a notable exception, San Francisco chef [[Ron Siegel]] struggled with his assistants, who did not speak English. One assistant, Kenichi Miyanaga, became a challenger himself, taking on Iron Chef Morimoto in a [[sweetfish]] battle.\n\n===Commentary and judging===\nThroughout the cook-off, running commentary is made in a booth near the cooking area by an announcer, [[Kenji Fukui]]; a commentator, [[Yukio Hattori]], and one or two of the guest judges, with one floor reporter (sometimes two; normally [[Shinichiro Ohta]]) providing details of the action on each side. The commentators and judges discuss the style of cooking, culinary traditions and unusual food preparation. At the end of the hour, after end-of-battle interviews with both competitors, each dish is presented to the camera, with a description of its properties (written by the show's screenwriters based on the chef's explanation) read by the announcer. Then, a panel of three (later expanded to four and, later still, five) judges, of which typically one is a professional critic, tastes the dishes and judges them based on taste, presentation, and originality.  Each chef may be awarded up to 20 points by each judge, with ten given for taste and five each for presentation and originality.  The chef with the greatest score wins the competition. (In earlier four-judge episodes, the win went to the chef who won three of the four judges, or, failing that, the chef that makes the highest points total.)\n\nChairman Kaga tastes the dishes along with the judges.  While he occasionally makes comments and seeks input from judges during tasting, he generally does not participate in scoring; he did, however, during the ''2000th Dish'' Battle.  During this episode, a team of French cuisine chefs\u2014captain [[Hiroyuki Sakai]], the original Iron Chef French [[Yutaka Ishinabe]], and former challenger and Etsuo Joh\u2014battled a team of Chinese cuisine chefs composed of captain [[Chen Kenichi]], former challenger Sozo Myamoto, and former challenger [[Yuji Wakiya]] (who would later be Iron Chef Chinese on the 2012 revival).  To break the tie, Chairman Kaga asked them to allow him this one instance of selfishness, and he cast his vote for the French team.\n\n===Ties===\nIn the case of a deadlock (as was possible during the era of the four-judge panel), first place is awarded to the chef with the greater number of points. On the rare occasions that the scores were also tied, an immediate \"overtime battle\" was held to determine the winner. In overtime the chefs are given 30 minutes to prepare dishes with a different key ingredient, having to make do with what remains of their pantry or with items that were previously prepared for the main battle. The overtime battles are aired as a separate episode. On one occasion, the overtime battle itself resulted in a tie, prompting Chairman Kaga to declare both the Iron Chef and challenger winners.<ref>This occurred during a challenge between Iron Chef [[Chen Kenichi]] and French challenger Dominique Corby of the [[Tour d'Argent]] in episode #IC1C16, where the main theme was [[foie gras]], and in episode #IC1C17 (overtime), where the theme was [[asparagus]].</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history==\nThe stage setting for the show, {{Nihongo|\"Kitchen Stadium\"|\u30ad\u30c3\u30c1\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30a2\u30e0|Kitchin Sutajiamu}}, the high-quality (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in the cooking battles, and Kaga's extravagant [[costume]]s required the show to have a budget far higher than that of most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of [[foie gras]], 54 [[bream|sea breams]], 827 Ise [[shrimp]], 964 [[matsutake|matsutake mushroom]]s, 4,593 [[egg (food)|eggs]], 1,489 [[truffle]]s, 4,651&nbsp;grams of [[caviar]], and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to [[Yen|\u00a5]]843,354,407<ref>Foreword by Takeshi Kaga, \"''Iron Chef'':The Official Book\" (Kaoru Hoketsu, translator) (Berkley Books, 2001)</ref> (or about [[United States dollar|$]]7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle [[Swiftlet#Culinary use|Swallow's Nest]], which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark's fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.\n\n===Final episode and specials===\nFor the show's grand finale, aired from September 10, 1999 to September 24, 1999, the Iron Chefs faced off against each other in a three-part battle, with the winner to face French chef [[Alain Passard]], owner of Michelin three-star restaurant L\u2019Arpege, with the winner dubbed the \"King of Iron Chefs\".\n\nIn the first round, Iron Chef Chinese Chen defeated Iron Chef Italian Kobe in Battle Pork (Tokyo X). In the second round Iron Chef French Sakai defeated Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto in Battle Bell Pepper. In the final match, Sakai defeated Chen in Battle Homard Lobster and was dubbed \"King of Iron Chefs\". Prior to that episode, Sakai had never won a lobster battle.\n\nIn the final bonus match in Kitchen Stadium, with all of the current and previous Iron Chefs looking on, Iron Chef French Sakai defeated [[Alain Passard]] in Battle Long-Gang Chicken. Thus, Hiroyuki Sakai was dubbed as both \"King of Iron Chefs\" and \"The No. 1 in the World.\"\n\nThere were two reunion specials produced in 2000.  The first was \"The Millennium Special\"; the second was \"New York Special\", staged in a makeshift Kitchen Stadium at [[Webster Hall]] in New York City, and was the first appearance of Bobby Flay. Another reunion episode of the show (entitled \"Iron Chef: 21st Century Battle\") was produced and broadcast in 2001. A final reunion episode was produced and broadcast in 2002, entitled \"The Japan Cup\".\n\n===United States reception===\nWhile always a success in [[Japan]], ''Iron Chef'' became a surprise cult favorite in the United States when it was picked up by the [[Food Network]] in 1999 and [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |title=Cool Japan: Why Japanese remakes are so popular on American TV, and where we\u2019re getting it wrong |publisher=AsianWeek |accessdate=2008-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915232726/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/13/cool-japan-why-japanese-remakes-are-so-popular-on-american-tv-and-where-we%E2%80%99re-getting-it-wrong/ |archivedate=2008-09-15 }}</ref> Part of the U.S. appeal was due to the dubbing, which gave the show a [[camp (style)|campy]] charm that evoked English-dubbed [[Cinema of China|Chinese]] [[kung fu movies]] of the 1970s. Audiences also found amusing some of the over-the-top culinary concoctions regularly featured on the show, eventually leading to a spoof on [[Saturday Night Live]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/articles/the-history-of-iron-chef.html|title = The History of Iron Chef|date = |accessdate = August 7, 2015|website = Food Network|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===International syndication===\nThe show was presented in the United States and Canada on the [[Food Network]], [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] and/or [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] into English. It is also actively broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS TV]] in Australia. In the case of SBS this is unusual as the network has a policy favouring in-house subtitling. It may be felt that the tone given to the show by its American dub is essential to its charms, heightened perhaps by the fact that in most episodes, the flamboyant Chairman is subtitled instead of dubbed. However, episodes aired since February 2009 have seen the Chairman's voice dubbed rather than subtitled as was the case in previous airings, except when he sends the chefs into battle.\n\nThe show was broadcast on the [[Finland|Finnish]] channel [[SubTV]], as well as the [[Sweden|Swedish]] channel TV400 ([[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]). ''Iron Chef'' was also broadcast on [[Challenge TV|Challenge]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 2003 and 2004, as part of its \"Japanese Christmas Cracker\" and \"Japanorama\" strands.\n\nThe show had again aired in the U.S. on the [[Fine Living Network|Fine Living]] Network from May 5, 2008 until the channel went off the air on May 30, 2010; however, the music from earlier broadcasts, taken from the film ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'', had been replaced due to music licensing issues with [[NBC Universal]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The [[Cooking Channel]] picked up the series on June 1, 2010, when it replaced Fine Living.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookingchanneltv.com|title=Cooking Channel - Recipes, Shows and Cooking Videos from Top Global Chefs : Cooking Channel|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>  The stations that have carried the series, Fine Living, Cooking Channel and Food Network, are all owned by [[Scripps Networks Interactive]].\n\n==Notable challengers==\n{{For|a full list of challengers|List of Iron Chef episodes}}\n\nCertain challengers have made repeat appearances, or have been particularly memorable.\n\n(Japanese names are not in the traditional Japanese style [i.e. family name first] but have been written in standard European style [i.e. family name last].)\n*    Jacques Borie: An [[Meilleur_Ouvrier_de_France|MOF]] winner.  He is the only challenger who beat iron chef Yutaka Ishinabe.\n* '''Dominique Corby''': a chef at la Tour d'Argent Tokyo, who fought iron chef Chen Kenichi. He is the only competitor to have tied the Iron Chef twice\u2014once initially and again in the overtime battle; he and Chen were subsequently declared joint winners of that battle.\n* '''[[Alain Passard]]''': Three star French chef and owner of L\u2019Arpege, located in Paris. Ties Iron Chef Koumei Nakamura in the 1997 World Cup championship and was the final challenger in Kitchen Stadium, losing to Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai in the finals of the \"King of Iron Chefs.\"\n* '''Cheng Kazuhiko''': First challenger to defeat an Iron Chef. The theme ingredient was [[Octopus (food)|octopus]].\n* '''Tadamichi \u014cta''': defeated Iron Chef Sakai in an octopus battle, in which Sakai was particularly squeamish about handling the live creatures. Later became the leader of the \"\u014cta Faction\" (\u5927\u7530\u8ecd\u56e3) of traditional Japanese chefs.  The \u014cta Faction regularly challenged Iron Chef Morimoto and his neo-Japanese style, winning one out of five battles. \u014cta Faction was the name used in the translated version shown on Food Network. In the original Japanese version (shown in the U.S. and transcribed by the Iron Chef Reporter in southern California) the group is called ''\u014cta\u2019s Party of Heaven and Earth'' (OPHE; \u5927\u7530\u5929\u5730\u306e\u4f1a). Every time he appeared, Fukui would point out that he was not related to Shinichiro Ohta, the show's floor reporter.\n* '''Kyoko Kagata''': The first female chef to appear on the show, and the youngest chef to be victorious.  Challenged Chen Kenichi.  An interesting side note is that the second female challenger, cooking show host '''Katsuyo Kobayashi''', also faced Chen. Kobayashi indirectly picked Chen because she allowed Kaga to pick for her. Chen lost both battles, and purportedly caught some flak from chef-friends of his. Chen fought another two female challengers in separate battles and won. Later, she appeared again and challenged Chen Kenichi. This time, Chen won the battle with all three of the four judges gave him 20 and gave Kagata 19. Kishi gave Chen 19 and Kagata 17.\n* '''[[Toshiro Kandagawa]]''' (three wins out of six battles): Regular challenger who aligned himself with the \u014cta Faction, a group of hardline traditionalists in Japanese cuisine, and often led his army of fellow chefs and proteg\u00e9s into Kitchen Stadium during challenges.  Kandagawa has taken part in several battles wherein he supported apprentices to battle an Iron Chef (only one out of the ten won). Kandagawa also participated in several \"battle special\" episodes, including the '''21st Century Battle'''.  Rokusaburo Michiba was his main rival until Michiba's retirement as Iron Chef Japanese; he has recorded victories over Chen, Nakamura and Sakai.\n* '''[[Bobby Flay]]''': Flay entered into a bit of a rivalry with Iron Chef Japanese Morimoto during the show's special ''New York Battle''. Flay complained that his side of the kitchen was poorly laid out (it was noted in an Iron Chef America \"Behind the Scenes\" episode that the kitchen was hastily set up in the provided forum).  At one point Flay received an [[electric shock]], transmitted by a wet floor and faulty wiring, when he grabbed a metal pan on the range. When Flay stood on his cutting board at the end of the battle, Morimoto declared that Flay was \"not a chef\" for disregarding the cleanliness of one's cutting board. Morimoto won, but Flay was offered a rematch. He accepted, and got his revenge, in the '''21st Century Battle''' in Japan, where, at battle's end, he tossed the cutting board off the counter before climbing on it, so as not to offend Morimoto again.  Flay is now an Iron Chef alongside Morimoto on [[Iron Chef America]]. This rivalry was revisited for a third time with Morimoto defeating Flay during the Holiday Ice Battle (''Iron Chef America'', November 2009)\n* '''[[Ron Siegel]]''': Of Charles Nob Hill in San Francisco became the first American chef to defeat an Iron Chef (Hiroyuki Sakai).\n* '''Michael Noble''': The first Canadian to appear on the program, challenged Morimoto in Battle Potato in 1999 and lost.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Serie A'''|\u30bb\u30ea\u30a8\uff21|extra=also known as the \"''Big Leaguers''\"}}: A group of Italian chefs which named itself after [[Italy]]'s [[Serie A|top football league]] and frequently challenged Iron Chef Italian Kobe: Mario Frittoli, Constantino Gemmoli, and Franco Canzoniere. No group member ever defeated Kobe, although one member did defeat Morimoto (pasta specialist Marco Paolo Molinari in a porcini mushroom battle).\n* {{Nihongo|'''Club Mistral'''|\u30af\u30e9\u30d6\u30df\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30eb}}: A group of young specialists in French cuisine that targeted Iron Chef French Sakai in a similar fashion, although they took on Iron Chef Chinese Chen and Iron Chef French Ishinabe once each as well. Only one of them managed a win (Kazutaka Okabe versus Sakai, in a lamb battle) despite several attempts.\n* '''[[Heichinrou]]''' (one win out of three battles): The oldest restaurant in [[Yokohama Chinatown]] sent three challengers to challenge Iron Chef Chinese Chen in 1999, losing two battles with Chinese ingredients before winning the final.\n* '''Dr. [[Yukio Hattori]]''': A [[gentlemen's agreement]] went on between the Chairman of Gourmet Academy (Kaga) and the President of Culinary Academy (Hattori) where the Doctor agreed to battle an Iron Chef. If he won, he would be given a spot alongside the Iron Chefs and if he lost he would keep working for Kaga.  As he remained a commentator until the end of the series, one can easily deduce the outcomes of his two battles. [[Jo\u00ebl Robuchon]] was invited as a guest judge for the event, and Honorary Iron Chef Ishinabe served in a commentary role in Hattori's place for the battle. Hattori also battled and lost against Iron Chef Japanese II [[Koumei Nakamura]] in his final battle.\n*'''Takashi Sait\u014d''' (not to be confused with [[Takashi Saito (baseball)|the baseball player]]): top apprentice of [[Chen Kenmin]], and coach of Chen Kenichi. Chen beat his tutor in a prawn battle. Saito recreated Kenmin's original prawns in chili sauce, while the younger Chen created his father's modern version of the dish (Canap\u00e9 Style with ketchup).  In the ''2000th Dish Special'', Kaga said that Chen's prawns were his favorite dish to that point.\n*'''Kenichi Miyanaga''': a graduate of [[Hattori Nutrition College]], he was an assistant chef for several battles in Kitchen Stadium, and was eventually hired by Iron Chef Michiba after his retirement. He challenged Iron Chef Morimoto in a battle involving sweetfish.\n*'''[[Y\u016bji Wakiya]]''' (one win in three battles): A master of \"neo-Chinese\" cuisine, Wakiya lost to Iron Chef Sakai in Battle [[Sea Urchin]] but defeated Iron Chef Chen with [[papaya]]s. He later became part of Chen's team for the 2000th Dish Special. He was also named the second Iron Chef Chinese in the Millennium Cup and was supposed to take over Chen's place, but he never actually battled under the new title until the first episode of the 2012 revival.\n*'''Kazunari Takeda''': the first challenger defeat Iron Chef Masahiko Kobe in 30 minutes overtime battle with the theme ingredient Pink Prawn. He first tied with Masahiko Kobe during the battle of Cod Soft Roe and finally he made way to the 30 minutes overtime battle and won.\n*'''Liang Shuqing''': Liang Shueng's younger brother became the second challenger to defeat Iron Chef Chen Kenichi in 30 minutes overtime battle with the theme ingredient [[Konnyaku]]. He first tied with Chen Kenichi during the battle of [[Pork belly]] and finally he made way to the 30 minutes overtime battle and won.\n*'''Kentaro''': Katsuyo Kobayashi's son who wants to defeat Iron Chef Chen Kenichi like his mother did before. He first appeared in his mother's cook show at the age of 5 and at age 25 he further his skills in art, music and cooking. During the battle with Iron Chef Chen Kenichi he refused to use the same recipes like his mother. Chen beat Kentaro in the new potatoes battle.\n*'''Shin'ya Tasaki''': A champion wine sommelier and  president of the International Sommeliers Association {{as of|2013|lc=on}}.  He is the only non-professional chef to have defeated an Iron Chef, defeating Masahiko Kobe in the fatty tuna battle.\n*'''Jun'ichi It\u014d''' started French cooking at age 18 and left for France at age 28. He left for Italy three years later and joined [[Enoteca Pinchiorri]]. When he was 35, he opened his restaurant Herle Quin in Tokyo. He chose Chen Kenichi as the opponent, in battle [[yogurt]]. Chen won in a unanimous vote.\n*'''Kensuke Sakai''': An Italian chef, but most notable because his restaurant \"Nigiro\" was (at time of taping in 1998) really a food stand that he brings in by hand to a monastery's yard each night.  At his introduction, Sakai brought the food cart ''into Kitchen Stadium''.\n* Other female challengers include: Fuyuko Kond\u014d, Yoshie Urabe, Yoshiko Takemasa, Katsuko Nanao, Kumiko Kobayashi, and Miyoko Sakai, as well Australian Gillian Hirst, Chinese Cui Yufen, and Korean Lee Myong Suk. Among the women listed above, only Cui won in her battle (coincidentally against Chen).\n\n==Notable judges==\nThe result of a battle may be influenced by the lineup of judges, which changes from show to show.

Unlike the original ''Ry\u014dri no Tetsujin'', the new show was titled '''''Iron Chef''''' (\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5) in [[katakana]] characters. The Chairman's role was assumed by Japanese actor [[Hiroshi Tamaki]]. Fuji TV commentator Mizuki Sano hosted the program, and the reporters were Yurika Mita and Daisuke Miyagawa. [[Yukio Hattori|Dr. Yukio Hattori]] returned from the original ''Iron Chef'' series to provide commentary. Three new Iron Chefs were chosen; Jun Kurogi as Iron Chef Japanese, [[Y\u016bji Wakiya]] as Iron Chef Chinese, and Y\u014dsuke Suga as Iron Chef French.\n\nThe first battle in the new show was a two-hour special with two battles. The first challenger was former Kitchen Stadium challenger Kenichi Miyanaga, recommended by Iron Chef [[Rokusaburo Michiba]]. Miyanaga is Michiba's top apprentice and battled Iron Chef Suga. The challenger in the second battle was Kentaro Chen, recommended by his father Iron Chef [[Chen Kenichi]], who battled Iron Chef Wakiya.<ref name=\"fujitv.co.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fujitv.co.jp/b_hp/ironchef/index.html|title=\u30a2\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b7\u30a7\u30d5 - \u30d5\u30b8\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt was announced, after airing thirteen episodes, that the new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013.

Commentary was provided by [[Michael Burger]] and [[Anthony Dias Blue]], with floor reporting by [[Sissy Biggers]].  The show featured four Iron Chefs: Iron Chef American [[Todd English]] (whose specialty is actually Mediterranean food), Iron Chef French Jean Francois Meteigner, Iron Chef Italian [[Alessandro Stratta]], and Iron Chef Asian [[Roy Yamaguchi]].  In the show's only two battles, English defeated [[Kerry Simon]] in a dungeness crab battle, and Stratta defeated [[Marcus Samuelsson]] in a turkey battle.\n\nThese shows were neither a critical nor popular success, perhaps because the show focused little on cooking&mdash;a major part of the Japanese program. The show had a small audience section with bleachers, and the audience yelled relentlessly during the show (sounding much like a sports audience). Shatner walked around the kitchen sampling the more expensive items, the chefs refused to say what they were doing, and the cameras rarely showed the food preparation.\n\n====Iron Chef America====\n{{Main|Iron Chef America}}\n{{see also|The Next Iron Chef}}\n\nIn 2004, Food Network announced that they would show an Iron Chef special, called \"[[Iron Chef America]]: Battle of the Masters\", featuring Sakai and Morimoto dueling with American Iron Chefs [[Bobby Flay]], [[Mario Batali]], and [[Wolfgang Puck]], all Food Network personalities and renowned [[United States|American]] [[celebrity chef]]s. (Morimoto and Flay battled in two previous Iron Chef specials that were made after the original series aired.) The specials featured [[Alton Brown]] as the announcer and [[Mark Dacascos]] playing the role of The Chairman (in the storyline, this Chairman is the nephew of Takeshi Kaga).\n\nThe show received high ratings and rave reviews and in October 2004, Food Network began taping weekly episodes that premiered starting in January 2005.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Some changes were made to the show, most notably replacing Puck with Morimoto as an Iron Chef (a fourth, [[Cat Cora]], was added later), and the location was moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]]. The fifth Iron Chef, [[Michael Symon]], was added for his win in ''[[The Next Iron Chef]]''. In 2009, Chef [[Jose Garces]] became the sixth Iron Chef following his victory in the second season of ''[[The Next Iron Chef]]''. In 2010, Chef Marc Forgione won the third season of [[The Next Iron Chef]], becoming the seventh Iron Chef on Iron Chef America.  Chef [[Geoffrey Zakarian]] won [[The Next Iron Chef]]'s fourth season in 2011, making him the eighth Iron Chef. In 2012, Chef [[Alexandra Guarnaschelli]] became the ninth and most recent Iron Chef after winning the fifth season of ''The Next Iron Chef''.\n\nEven though both [[Todd English]] and [[Kerry Simon]] from ''Iron Chef USA'' have competed on ''Iron Chef America'', the episodes did not mention their IC-USA appearances.\n\n====Iron Chef Gauntlet====\n{{main|Iron Chef Gauntlet}}\n'''Iron Chef Gauntlet''' is a Spring 2017 revival series of ''The Next Iron Chef'' on ''Food Network''.\n\n====Iron Chef Showdown====\n{{main|Iron Chef Showdown}}\n'''Iron Chef Showdown''' is a Fall 2017 revival series of ''Iron Chef'' on ''Food Network''.\n\n===Krav Sakinim===\nIn 2007, Krav Sakinim ({{lang-he|\u05e7\u05e8\u05d1 \u05e1\u05db\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd}}, Knife Fight), a show based on Iron Chef, began airing on [[Israel]]'s [[Israel 10|Channel 10]]. Each episode features a different prominent Israeli chef, who competes against one of the show's featured foreign chefs. All Israeli winners compete against one another in the finals and the winner competes against a foreign chef for the title of season champion. Season 1 featured only [[France|French]] chef [[St\u00e9phane Froidevaux]], who won the season's finale, while season 2 saw the inclusion of [[Italy|Italian]] chef Alfredo Russo,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/960454.html One dish too many], Haaretz, Retrieved March 19, 2008</ref> meaning both [[Michelin Guide|Michelin star]] holders would have to compete against each other for a spot in the final bout. The show is actively hosted by actor Oded Menashe and the regular commentators are chef Yaron Kastenboim and catering company owner Ran Shmueli. While in season 1, the panel of judges was made up mostly of celebrities from the entertainment industry, season 2 features renowned persons from the culinary industry, such as restaurant critics and chefs. The competitors prepare a three-course meal, with each dish given a score of up to 10 points by each member of the panel and commentators, accumulating up to 150 points per chef (compared to 90 points in season 1, where the commentators had relatively more points to give).\n\n===Iron Chef UK===\n{{Main|Iron Chef UK}}\nIn 2010, UK public television network [[Channel 4]] debuted Iron Chef UK, based on Iron Chef.

Judging occurs in two rounds, with the first round being appetizers, and the second being the main courses. Two challengers prepare the appetizer, producing one appetizer each, while the Iron Chef prepares two. These are judged, and the standing for the team versus the Iron Chef are announced. Then the second half begins: the challenging team and the Iron Chef return to the kitchen to prepare the main course. The two challengers each prepare one dish, while the Iron Chef prepares two. Judging resumes, and the results are announced. Either the Challenging team wins, or the Iron Chef wins in overall score, and the best dish from the challenging team is also announced.  The challengers with the best dish returns on Friday to compete against the best Iron Chef of the week.\n\n===Iron Chef Australia===\n{{Main|Iron Chef Australia}}\nThe [[Seven Network]] announced in August 2010 that an Australian version was planned, in part to capitalize on the success of the highly popular ''[[MasterChef Australia]]''.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/tv/iron-chef-australia-to-take-on-masterchef/story-e6freqj6-1225907013229|title=Iron Chef Australia to take on MasterChef|newspaper=The Courier-Mail|date=19 August 2010|accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"announce2\">{{Cite news\n |title       = Seven confirms Iron Chef Australia\n |work        = The Spy Report\n |publisher   = Media Spy\n |date        = 19 August 2010\n |url         = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/08/19/seven-confirms-iron-chef-australia/\n |accessdate  = 27 August 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100826185412/http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/08/19/seven-confirms-iron-chef-australia/\n |archivedate = 26 August 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Iron Chefs were [[Neil Perry]], [[Guy Grossi]] and [[Guillaume Brahimi]], while the show features a static judging panel composed of food critics Larissa Dubecki, Simon Thomsen and Leo Schofield.

The chairman is '''Mr. Santi Sawatwimol'''. In this version of Iron Chef, there are four Iron Chefs: '''Chumpol Chaengprai''' (Thai cuisine); '''Boontham Pakpo''' (Japanese cuisine); '''Pongtawat \"Ian\" Chareomkittichai''' (Western cuisine); and '''Chaitep \"Mr. Lee\" Pattarapornpaisarn''' (Chinese cuisine). The program is hosted by '''Chakrit Yamnarn''' and the field reporter is '''DJ Pong''' (Nattapong Taengkasem). The format is different, in that in the first half of the program, there are three challengers who compete with each other to find out who is the best chef. The winner will compete against the Iron Chef on the second half of the program. This format was used for only 3 episode.\n\nOn February 22, 2012 the format of Iron Chef Thailand has been changed to: the first 30 minutes of the program is where the Challenger Chef will present his/her '''\"Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient\"''' to the guests. Then followed by the actual '''\"Iron Chef Battle\"''', similar to Iron Chef Japan where the host will ask the Challenger Chef to select the Iron Chef he/she want to challenge. After the Challenger Chef has selected the Iron Chef the Chairman will reveal the '''''\"Secret Ingredient\"''''' and once the Chairman says '''''\"Allez Cuisine\"''''' the battle begins. The battle time is 60 minutes where they will need to complete at least 4 dishes. The order in which Chefs present to the Judges will be determined by a coin toss conducted by the Host.

British Medical Journal. 1998. Accessed ''6 October 2006.''</ref>\n\nThe embargo forced Cuba to use more of its limited resources on medical imports, both because equipment and drugs from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms or from non-U.S.sources tend to be higher priced and because shipping costs are greater. The Democracy Act of 1992 further exacerbated the problems in Cuba's medical system. It prohibited foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from selling to Cuba, thus further limiting Cuba's access to medicine and equipment, and raising prices. In addition, the act forbid ships that dock in Cuban ports from docking in U.S. ports for six months. This drastically restricted shipping, and increased shipping costs some 30%.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030720011919/http://www.wola.org/publications/cuba_myths_facts.pdf Myths and Facts about the US embargo on medicines and supplies].

The dollar amount of these sales is over $1,600,000. Furthermore, the U.S. government licensed more than $227 million in humanitarian donations of medicines and medical supplies to Cuba between 1993 and 1997.  There are other factors beside the embargo explaining the lack of imports, in particular Cuba's lack of hard currency. Those with dollars can easily buy medicines and food in Cuba from Latin America and Canada. Cuba defaulted on its debt to Western banks in 1986 and lacks access to the international credit system in order to get foreign currency. In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused the loss of several billions of dollars in yearly subsidies and overnight required hard currency for all imports.<ref name=\"unc.edu\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_13/linderman_cuba2.html | title=This Page Has Moved}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 report to the U.N. Secretary-General, Cuba acknowledged the authorization of medicines, though stated that they were subject to severe restrictions and complicated procedures. Cuba is obliged to make payments in cash and in advance, and is precluded from obtaining credit funding, even from private sources. The sale and transportation of the goods require licenses to be obtained for each transaction. Cuba cannot use its own merchant fleet for transporting these goods, but has to make use of vessels from third countries, primarily the [[United States]]. Payments are made through banks in third countries, since direct banking relationships are prohibited. The Cuban delegation concluded that restrictions on importing medical products were \"so extensive that they make such imports virtually impossible\". The World Health organization/PAHO and [[UNFPA]] concurred that it was impossible for Cuba to purchase equipment, medicines and laboratory materials produced by the United States or covered by United States patents, even though those products were purchased through multilateral cooperation. Cuba was not able to purchase the isotope I-125 that is used to treat eye cancer in children. The companies manufacturing reagents and equipment are 70 per cent United States owned, which makes it difficult to purchase necessary medical equipment and other items.<ref>Report of the Secretary-General. 2006.

The most guarded is infant mortality rate. To illustrate this, Hirschfeld describes a case where a doctor said that if the ultrasound examination revealed \"some fetal abnormalities\", the woman \"would have an abortion\", to avoid an increase in the infant mortality rate.<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\" />\n\nHirschfeld referred to well-documented research about the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, showing that \"revolutionary\" efforts \"can also include such practices as deliberate manipulation of health statistics, aggressive political intrusion into health care decision-making, criminalizing dissent, and other forms of authoritarian policing of the health sector designed to insure health changes reflect the (often utopian) predictions of Marxist theory\". But, according to Hirshfeld, \"the true extent of these practices was virtually unknown in the West\", where \"social scientists frequently cited favorable health statistics supplied by [these regimes], without critically looking at the ways these were created and maintained by state power\".<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\"/>\n\nHirschfeld concludes that \"Cuba\u2019s health indicators are at least in some cases obtained by imposing significant costs on the Cuban population \u2013 costs that Cuban citizens are powerless to articulate or protest, and foreign researchers unable to empirically investigate.\"<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\"/>\n\nComplaints have also arisen that foreign \"health tourists\" paying with dollars and senior Communist party officials receive a higher quality of care than Cuban citizens. Former leading Cuban [[neurosurgeon]] and [[dissident]] Dr [[Hilda Molina]] asserts that the central revolutionary objective of free, quality medical care for all has been eroded by Cuba's need for foreign currency. Molina says that following the economic collapse known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]], the Cuban Government established mechanisms designed to turn the medical system into a profit-making enterprise. This creates an enormous disparity in the quality of healthcare services between foreigners and Cubans leading to a form of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]]. In 1998 she said that foreign patients were routinely inadequately or falsely informed about their medical conditions to increase their medical bills or to hide the fact that Cuba often advertises medical services it is unable to provide.<ref>[http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 Cuban Medicine Today by Dr] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060529183606/http://www.cubacenter.org/media/archives/1998/summer/medicine_today.php3 |date=2006-05-29 }} [[Hilda Molina]] Center for a free Cuba \u2013 link fails 16.9.06</ref> Others makes similar claims, also stating that senior Communist party and military officials can access this higher quality system free of charge.<ref name=\"unc.edu\"/><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.canf.org/Issues/medicalapartheid.htm | title=Cuban American National Foundation - CANF}}</ref> In 2005, an account written by Cuban exile and critic of Fidel Castro, [[Carlos Wotzkow]], appeared showing apparent unsanitary and unsafe conditions in the \"Cl\u00ednico Quir\u00fargico\" of Havana; the article claims that health care for Cubans occurs in worse conditions in the rest of the country.<ref>[http://www.gentiuno.com/articulo.asp?articulo=2167 ''El cuento de la Salud en Cuba'' <span class=\"CMY_Response\">404</span>] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812042650/http://www.gentiuno.com/articulo.asp?articulo=2167 |date=2006-08-12 }},  Publicado el 06.03.2005 11:32 Por Carlos Wotzkow, Mar\u00eda Elena Morej\u00f3n y Equipo Informativo de Gentiuno.com</ref>\n\nAn article in Canadian newspaper ''[[National Post]]'', based upon interviews of Cubans, finds that in reality even the most common pharmaceutical items, such as aspirin and antibiotics are conspicuously absent or only available on the black market.

The Democracy Act of 1992 further exacerbated the problems in Cuba's medical system. It prohibited foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from selling to Cuba, thus further limiting Cuba's access to medicine and equipment, and raising prices. In addition, the act forbid ships that dock in Cuban ports from docking in U.S. ports for six months. This drastically restricted shipping, and increased shipping costs some 30%.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030720011919/http://www.wola.org/publications/cuba_myths_facts.pdf Myths and Facts about the US embargo on medicines and supplies].

The dollar amount of these sales is over $1,600,000. Furthermore, the U.S. government licensed more than $227 million in humanitarian donations of medicines and medical supplies to Cuba between 1993 and 1997.  There are other factors beside the embargo explaining the lack of imports, in particular Cuba's lack of hard currency. Those with dollars can easily buy medicines and food in Cuba from Latin America and Canada. Cuba defaulted on its debt to Western banks in 1986 and lacks access to the international credit system in order to get foreign currency. In addition, the collapse of the Soviet Union caused the loss of several billions of dollars in yearly subsidies and overnight required hard currency for all imports.<ref name=\"unc.edu\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_13/linderman_cuba2.html | title=This Page Has Moved}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 report to the U.N. Secretary-General, Cuba acknowledged the authorization of medicines, though stated that they were subject to severe restrictions and complicated procedures. Cuba is obliged to make payments in cash and in advance, and is precluded from obtaining credit funding, even from private sources. The sale and transportation of the goods require licenses to be obtained for each transaction. Cuba cannot use its own merchant fleet for transporting these goods, but has to make use of vessels from third countries, primarily the [[United States]]. Payments are made through banks in third countries, since direct banking relationships are prohibited. The Cuban delegation concluded that restrictions on importing medical products were \"so extensive that they make such imports virtually impossible\". The World Health organization/PAHO and [[UNFPA]] concurred that it was impossible for Cuba to purchase equipment, medicines and laboratory materials produced by the United States or covered by United States patents, even though those products were purchased through multilateral cooperation. Cuba was not able to purchase the isotope I-125 that is used to treat eye cancer in children. The companies manufacturing reagents and equipment are 70 per cent United States owned, which makes it difficult to purchase necessary medical equipment and other items.<ref>Report of the Secretary-General. 2006.

Cuba has been serving health tourists from around the world for more than 20 years. The country operates a special division of hospitals specifically for the treatment of foreigners and diplomats.  Foreign patients travel to Cuba for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], [[cosmetic surgery]], addictions treatment, [[retinitis pigmentosa]] and [[orthopaedics]]. Most patients are from Latin America, Europe and Canada, and a growing number of Americans also are coming. By 1998, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Cuban health sector had risen to occupy around 2 percent of total tourism. Some of these revenues are in turn transferred to health care for ordinary Cubans, although the size and importance of these transfers is both unknown and controversial. At one nationally prominent hospital/research institute, hard currency payments by foreigners have financed the construction of a new bathroom in the splenic surgery wing; anecdotal evidence suggests that this pattern is common in Cuban hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2001/DunningThad.pdf|title=Structural Reform and Medical Commerce: The Political Economy of Cuban Health Care in the Special Period|author=Thad Dunning|date=September 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Medical research==\nThe Cuban Ministry of Health produces a number of [[medical journal]]s including the [[ACIMED]], the [[Cuban Journal of Surgery]] and the [[Cuban Journal of Tropical Medicine]].

Healthcare, however, is a top national priority\" The report stated that life expectancy and infant mortality rates are nearly the same as the USA's. Its doctor-to-patient ratios stand comparison to any country in Western Europe. Its annual total health spend per head, however, comes in at $251; just over a tenth of the UK's.

The study concluded the following.\n*There appeared to be little evidence of a divide between the prevention/proactive response and the disease management/reactive response within Cuban healthcare.\n*By far the biggest difference was the ratio of doctors per person. In Cuba it was one doctor per 175 people, in the UK the figure was one doctor per 600 people.\n*There is a commitment in Cuba to the triple diagnosis (physical/psychological/social) at all levels.\n*Extensive involvement of \"patient\" and the public in decision making at all levels.\n*Integration of hospital/community/primary care via polyclinics.\n*Team-work that works is much more evident both in the community and the hospital sector and the mental-health and care of the elderly sites visited were very well staffed and supported.<ref name=\"uknhs\">[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhealth/30/30ap91.htm CUBAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NHS PLAN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821213607/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmhealth/30/30ap91.htm |date=2013-08-21 }}.

The most guarded is infant mortality rate. To illustrate this, Hirschfeld describes a case where a doctor said that if the ultrasound examination revealed \"some fetal abnormalities\", the woman \"would have an abortion\", to avoid an increase in the infant mortality rate.<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\" />\n\nHirschfeld referred to well-documented research about the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, showing that \"revolutionary\" efforts \"can also include such practices as deliberate manipulation of health statistics, aggressive political intrusion into health care decision-making, criminalizing dissent, and other forms of authoritarian policing of the health sector designed to insure health changes reflect the (often utopian) predictions of Marxist theory\". But, according to Hirshfeld, \"the true extent of these practices was virtually unknown in the West\", where \"social scientists frequently cited favorable health statistics supplied by [these regimes], without critically looking at the ways these were created and maintained by state power\".<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\"/>\n\nHirschfeld concludes that \"Cuba\u2019s health indicators are at least in some cases obtained by imposing significant costs on the Cuban population \u2013 costs that Cuban citizens are powerless to articulate or protest, and foreign researchers unable to empirically investigate.\"<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\"/>\n\nComplaints have also arisen that foreign \"health tourists\" paying with dollars and senior Communist party officials receive a higher quality of care than Cuban citizens. Former leading Cuban [[neurosurgeon]] and [[dissident]] Dr [[Hilda Molina]] asserts that the central revolutionary objective of free, quality medical care for all has been eroded by Cuba's need for foreign currency. Molina says that following the economic collapse known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]], the Cuban Government established mechanisms designed to turn the medical system into a profit-making enterprise. This creates an enormous disparity in the quality of healthcare services between foreigners and Cubans leading to a form of [[tourist segregation|tourist apartheid]].

{"title_page": "Henry Van Asselt", "text_new": "[[File:Henry Van Asselt (1817-1902) in circa 1890.png|thumb|Henry Van Asselt, circa 1902]]\n'''Henry Van Asselt''' (11 April 1817, [[Elspeet]] - 7 December 1902, [[Seattle]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] immigrant to the US, one of the first to settle the area that is now [[Seattle, Washington]]. He came to the area in 1847 and was the longest surviving original settler of [[King County, Washington]], dying at age 85. He married late in life, in December, 1862, to Jane, the daughter of Jacob Maples, and they had four children.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born '''Hendrik van Asselt''' as the eldest child of Helmert van Asselt and Adriana Drost. At the age of 19, Van Asselt was drafted into the army, joining the Dutch Second Battalion of Yagers, and was stationed on the frontier between [[The Netherlands]]  and [[Belgium]]. He served a little over three years, until peace was consummated between the two countries. He then hunted on local noble estates and farmed with his parents up to 1847.\n\n===The Journey West===\nHe sailed for America on the bark Suelhyd, from [[Amsterdam]], and after a passage of forty-nine days landed in New York, on July 17, 1847. He went to [[New Jersey]] and worked nine months for $35, then proceeded from [[Albany, New York]] by canal to [[Buffalo, New York]], and thence by lakes and river to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where he worked five months; then to [[Bloomington, Iowa]], where he remained until the spring of 1850, when he joined a party of eight, including James Thornton and Charles Hendricks, to cross the plains to California, paying $100 for his food and transportation.\n\nAt the fork of California and Oregon roads, they decided to go to Oregon, and arrived at [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] on September 21. Near Oregon City he hired on with a farmer for two months at $75 per month, then began a new job making shingles, which he did until February, 1851, when he joined with Thornton, Hendricks and others and went to the gold mines of northern California.\n\nThey spent about five and a half weeks mining when the water gave out, so they divided their gold, giving each of them about $1,000. But supplies were costly, with flour selling at $1 per pound, and bacon $1.25, so he decided to return to the [[Willamette Valley]]. On the way the party of five fell in with L. M. Collins, who had a claim on the [[Nisqually River]], [[Washington Territory]], and was traveling with Jacob and Samuel Maple. Collins convinced Van Asselt, Thornton, and Hendricks to join them. They spent July 4, 1851, at Oregon City, then proceeded, by the [[Tualatin Plains]], to [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]].\n\nWhile crossing the river from that point Mr. Van Asselt accidentally shot himself in the shoulder and returned to St. Helens for treatment, where he remained for thirty days, then joined his friends on the Nisqually.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[File:Boeing Field Maple marker 02.jpg|thumb|Henry Van Asselt's name on a Boeing Field plaque]]\nWhile staying with Collins he explored the surrounding country for a place to settle, but did not find anything satisfactory, so he decided to return to the Willamette Valley with his friends.  Collins convinced him to look for farmland forty miles down the Sound, where the Indians were still numerous. Van Asselt and Samuel and Jacob Maples agreed to go with him, and on September 12, 1851, they started their journey by canoe to the [[Duwamish River]], then traveling upstream until they reached the junction of the [[White River (Washington)|White]] and [[Black River (Duwamish River)|Black]] rivers, where they found land and staked out claims. Van Asselt's claim is now part of [[Boeing Field]]. The site now occupied by Seattle was inhabited solely by Indians, and there were no settlers within the boundaries of what is now King County.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\nReturning to the Nisqually, Collins sold his claim there, and with a scow purchased at [[Olympia, Washington]] the combined party moved their animals and effects to the new claims, where they built log cabins, becoming the first settlers in the Seattle area.

He came to the area in 1847 and was the longest surviving original settler of [[King County, Washington]], dying at age 85. He married late in life, in December, 1862, to Jane, the daughter of Jacob Maples, and they had four children.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born '''Hendrik van Asselt''' as the eldest child of Helmert van Asselt and Adriana Drost. At the age of 19, Van Asselt was drafted into the army, joining the Dutch Second Battalion of Yagers, and was stationed on the frontier between [[The Netherlands]]  and [[Belgium]]. He served a little over three years, until peace was consummated between the two countries. He then hunted on local noble estates and farmed with his parents up to 1847.\n\n===The Journey West===\nHe sailed for America on the bark Suelhyd, from [[Amsterdam]], and after a passage of forty-nine days landed in New York, on July 17, 1847. He went to [[New Jersey]] and worked nine months for $35, then proceeded from [[Albany, New York]] by canal to [[Buffalo, New York]], and thence by lakes and river to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] where he worked five months; then to [[Bloomington, Iowa]], where he remained until the spring of 1850, when he joined a party of eight, including James Thornton and Charles Hendricks, to cross the plains to California, paying $100 for his food and transportation.\n\nAt the fork of California and Oregon roads, they decided to go to Oregon, and arrived at [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] on September 21. Near Oregon City he hired on with a farmer for two months at $75 per month, then began a new job making shingles, which he did until February, 1851, when he joined with Thornton, Hendricks and others and went to the gold mines of northern California.\n\nThey spent about five and a half weeks mining when the water gave out, so they divided their gold, giving each of them about $1,000. But supplies were costly, with flour selling at $1 per pound, and bacon $1.25, so he decided to return to the [[Willamette Valley]]. On the way the party of five fell in with L. M. Collins, who had a claim on the [[Nisqually River]], [[Washington Territory]], and was traveling with Jacob and Samuel Maple. Collins convinced Van Asselt, Thornton, and Hendricks to join them. They spent July 4, 1851, at Oregon City, then proceeded, by the [[Tualatin Plains]], to [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]].\n\nWhile crossing the river from that point Mr. Van Asselt accidentally shot himself in the shoulder and returned to St. Helens for treatment, where he remained for thirty days, then joined his friends on the Nisqually.\n\n===Settlement===\n[[File:Boeing Field Maple marker 02.jpg|thumb|Henry Van Asselt's name on a Boeing Field plaque]]\nWhile staying with Collins he explored the surrounding country for a place to settle, but did not find anything satisfactory, so he decided to return to the Willamette Valley with his friends.  Collins convinced him to look for farmland forty miles down the Sound, where the Indians were still numerous. Van Asselt and Samuel and Jacob Maples agreed to go with him, and on September 12, 1851, they started their journey by canoe to the [[Duwamish River]], then traveling upstream until they reached the junction of the [[White River (Washington)|White]] and [[Black River (Duwamish River)|Black]] rivers, where they found land and staked out claims. Van Asselt's claim is now part of [[Boeing Field]]. The site now occupied by Seattle was inhabited solely by Indians, and there were no settlers within the boundaries of what is now King County.<ref name=\"seattlepi.com\"/>\n\nReturning to the Nisqually, Collins sold his claim there, and with a scow purchased at [[Olympia, Washington]] the combined party moved their animals and effects to the new claims, where they built log cabins, becoming the first settlers in the Seattle area. They were soon followed by the settlement of the Dennys and Terrys at [[Alki Point, Seattle|Alki Point]], and later by Mr. Yesler, who erected a sawmill, which provided work for the settlers in logging, as well as in farming.

Although offered roles with many important European opera companies, Anderson declined, as she had no training in acting. She preferred to perform in concert and recital only. She did, however, perform [[opera]] arias within her concerts and recitals. She made many recordings that reflected her broad performance repertoire, which ranged from concert literature to [[lied]]er to opera to [[American folk music|traditional American song]]s and [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s.<ref name=\"Grove\" /> Between 1940 and 1965 the German-American pianist [[Franz Rupp]] was her permanent accompanist.{{sfn|Keiler|2000|p={{page needed|date=February 2019}}}}\n\nAnderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]] in Washington, DC. The incident placed Anderson into the spotlight of the international community on a level unusual for a classical musician. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in the capital. She sang before an integrated crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions.\n\nAnderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on January 7, 1955. Her performance as Ulrica in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' at the Met was the only time she sang an opera role on stage.\n\nAnderson worked for several years as a delegate to the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] and as a \"goodwill ambassadress\" for the [[United States Department of State]], giving concerts all over the world. She participated in the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s, singing at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Anderson was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963, the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1977, the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978, the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1986, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1991.\n\n==Early life and career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nMarian Anderson was born on February 27, 1897, in [[Philadelphia]], to John Berkley Anderson (c. 1872\u20131910) and the former Annie Delilah Rucker (1874\u20131964).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keiler|first=Allan|title=Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey|publisher=Scribner|year=2000|isbn=0684807114|location=New York, NY|pages=16\u201317, 22, 312}}</ref> Her father sold ice and coal at the [[Reading Terminal]] in downtown Philadelphia and eventually opened a small liquor business as well. Prior to her marriage, Anderson's mother had briefly attended the [[Virginia University of Lynchburg|Virginia Seminary and College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and had worked as a schoolteacher in Virginia. As she did not obtain a degree, Annie Anderson was unable to teach in Philadelphia under a law that was applied only to black teachers and not white ones.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keiler|first=Allan|title=Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2002|isbn=9780684807119|pages=17}}</ref> She therefore earned an income caring for small children. Marian was the eldest of the three Anderson children. Her two sisters, Alice (1899\u20131965, later spelled Alyse) and Ethel (1902\u20131990), also became singers. Ethel married James DePreist and their late son, [[James DePreist|James Anderson DePreist]] was a noted conductor.<ref>Allan Keiler, [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keiler-anderson.html?_r=2&scp=21&sq=Marian%20Anderson&st=cse ''Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey'' \u2013 Chapter One], ''The New York Times'', 2000 (subscription access)</ref>\n\n[[File:MarianAnderson20.jpg|right|thumb|Anderson in 1920]]\nAnderson's parents were both devout [[Christians]] and the whole family was active in the Union Baptist Church in [[South Philadelphia]]. Marian's aunt Mary, her father's sister, was particularly active in the church's musical life and, noticing her niece's talent, convinced her to join the junior church choir at the age of six. In that role she got to perform solos and duets, often with her aunt Mary. Marian was also taken by her aunt to concerts at local churches, the YMCA, benefit concerts, and other community music events throughout the city. Anderson credited her aunt's influence as the reason she pursued her singing career. Beginning as young as six, her aunt arranged for Marian to sing for local functions where she was often paid 25 or 50 cents for singing a few songs. As she got into her early teens, Marian began to make as much as four or five dollars for singing; a considerable amount of money for the early 20th century. At the age of 10, Marian joined the People's Chorus under the direction of singer [[Emma Azalia Hackley]], where she was often given solos.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Greatest Black Achievers in History|last=Chidi|first=Sylvia Lovina|year=2014|publisher=Lulu Press|isbn=1291909338|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=532|oclc=980490928}}</ref> On March 21, 1919, during a March Festival of Music, she was a lead singer in a concert by the [[Robert Curtis Ogden]] Band and Choral Society at Egyptian Hall in Philadelphia's [[John Wanamaker]] department store.\n\nWhen Anderson was 12, her father was accidentally struck on the head while at work at the Reading Terminal, just a few weeks before Christmas of 1909. He died of heart failure a month later at age 34. Marian and her family moved into the home of her father's parents, Grandpa Benjamin and Grandma Isabella Anderson. Her grandfather had been born a slave and had experienced emancipation in the 1860s. He was the first of the Anderson family to settle in South Philadelphia, and when Anderson moved into his home the two became very close. He died just a year after the family moved in.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnderson attended Stanton Grammar School, graduating in the summer of 1912. Her family, however, could not afford to send her to high school, nor could they pay for any music lessons. Still, Anderson continued to perform wherever she could and learn from anyone who was willing to teach her. Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church's musical activities, now heavily involved in the adult choir. She joined the Baptists' Young People's Union and the [[Camp Fire Girls]] which provided her with some limited musical opportunities. Eventually the directors of the People's Chorus and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend [[South Philadelphia High School]], from which she graduated in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Zanice|date=January 19, 2007|title=Marian Anderson (1897\u20131993)|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/anderson-marian-1897-1993/|website=[[BlackPast.org]]|access-date=26 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter high school, Anderson applied to an all-white music school, the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Music Academy]] (now University of the Arts), but was turned away because she was black. The woman working the admissions counter replied, \"We don't take colored\" when she tried to apply. Undaunted, Anderson pursued studies privately in her native city through the continued support of the Philadelphia black community, first with Agnes Reifsnyder, then [[Giuseppe Boghetti]]. She met Boghetti through the principal of her high school. Anderson auditioned for him singing \"[[Deep River (song)|Deep River]]\" and he was immediately brought to tears. Boghetti scheduled a recital of English, Russian, Italian and German music at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|The Town Hall]] in New York City in April 1924 which took place in an almost empty hall and received poor reviews.{{sfn|Ferris|1994|page=33}} In 1925 Anderson got her first big break when she won first prize in a singing competition sponsored by the [[New York Philharmonic]]. As the winner she got to perform in concert with the orchestra on August&nbsp;26, 1925,<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberjhani|title=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance|year=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=11\u201313|first2=Sandra L.|last2= West}}</ref> a performance that scored immediate success with both audience and music critics. Anderson remained in New York to pursue further studies with [[Frank La Forge]]. During the time [[Arthur Judson]], whom she had met through the New York Philharmonic, became her manager. Over the next several years, she made a number of concert appearances in the United States, but racial prejudice prevented her career from gaining much momentum. In 1928, she sang for the first time at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Eventually she decided to go to Europe where she spent a number of months studying with [[Sara Cahier|Sara Charles-Cahier]] before launching a highly successful European singing tour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=n/a|first=n/a|url=|title=Marian Anderson in recital here this Monday night|date=December 1, 1928|work=New journal and guide|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==European fame==\nIn 1933, Anderson made her European debut in a concert at [[Wigmore Hall]] in London, where she was received enthusiastically. She spent the early 1930s touring throughout Europe where she did not encounter the racial prejudices she had experienced in America. In the summer of 1930, she went to [[Scandinavia]], where she met the Finnish pianist [[Kosti Vehanen]] who became her regular accompanist and her vocal coach for many years. She also met [[Jean Sibelius]] through Vehanen after he had heard her in a concert in [[Helsinki]]. Moved by her performance, Sibelius invited them to his home and asked his wife to bring champagne in place of the traditional coffee. Sibelius commented to Anderson of her performance that he felt that she had been able to penetrate the Nordic soul. The two struck up an immediate friendship, which further blossomed into a professional partnership, and for many years Sibelius altered and composed songs for Anderson to perform. He created a new arrangement of the song \"Solitude\" and dedicated it to Anderson in 1939.

In 1990, the award was re-established and has dispensed $25,000 annually.\n\nIn 1998, the prize was restructured with the Marian Anderson Award going to an established artist, not necessarily a singer, who exhibits leadership in a humanitarian area.<ref>[http://www.marianandersonaward.org/default.aspx?page=aboutthereward About the Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320180535/http://www.marianandersonaward.org/default.aspx?page=aboutthereward |date=2012-03-20 }}, MarianAndersonaward.org</ref>\n\n==Biographical entries==\n* Hamilton, David.

Macy (Accessed February 9, 2009), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]</ref> She performed in concert and recital in major music venues and with famous orchestras throughout the United States and Europe between 1925 and 1965. Although offered roles with many important European opera companies, Anderson declined, as she had no training in acting. She preferred to perform in concert and recital only. She did, however, perform [[opera]] arias within her concerts and recitals. She made many recordings that reflected her broad performance repertoire, which ranged from concert literature to [[lied]]er to opera to [[American folk music|traditional American song]]s and [[Spiritual (music)|spiritual]]s.<ref name=\"Grove\" /> Between 1940 and 1965 the German-American pianist [[Franz Rupp]] was her permanent accompanist.{{sfn|Keiler|2000|p={{page needed|date=February 2019}}}}\n\nAnderson became an important figure in the struggle for black artists to overcome racial prejudice in the United States during the mid-twentieth century. In 1939, the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] (DAR) refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in [[DAR Constitution Hall|Constitution Hall]] in Washington, DC. The incident placed Anderson into the spotlight of the international community on a level unusual for a classical musician. With the aid of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and her husband [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1939, on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] in the capital. She sang before an integrated crowd of more than 75,000 people and a radio audience in the millions.\n\nAnderson continued to break barriers for black artists in the United States, becoming the first black person, American or otherwise, to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City on January 7, 1955. Her performance as Ulrica in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' at the Met was the only time she sang an opera role on stage.\n\nAnderson worked for several years as a delegate to the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] and as a \"goodwill ambassadress\" for the [[United States Department of State]], giving concerts all over the world. She participated in the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s, singing at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Anderson was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1963, the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] in 1977, the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978, the [[National Medal of Arts]] in 1986, and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1991.\n\n==Early life and career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\nMarian Anderson was born on February 27, 1897, in [[Philadelphia]], to John Berkley Anderson (c. 1872\u20131910) and the former Annie Delilah Rucker (1874\u20131964).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keiler|first=Allan|title=Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey|publisher=Scribner|year=2000|isbn=0684807114|location=New York, NY|pages=16-17, 22, 312}}</ref> Her father sold ice and coal at the [[Reading Terminal]] in downtown Philadelphia and eventually opened a small liquor business as well. Prior to her marriage, Anderson's mother had briefly attended the [[Virginia University of Lynchburg|Virginia Seminary and College]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and had worked as a schoolteacher in Virginia. As she did not obtain a degree, Annie Anderson was unable to teach in Philadelphia under a law that was applied only to black teachers and not white ones.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Keiler|first=Allan|title=Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2002|isbn=9780684807119|pages=17}}</ref> She therefore earned an income caring for small children. Marian was the eldest of the three Anderson children. Her two sisters, Alice (1899\u20131965, later spelled Alyse) and Ethel (1902\u20131990), also became singers. Ethel married James DePreist and their late son, [[James DePreist|James Anderson DePreist]] was a noted conductor.<ref>Allan Keiler, [https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/k/keiler-anderson.html?_r=2&scp=21&sq=Marian%20Anderson&st=cse ''Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey'' \u2013 Chapter One], ''The New York Times'', 2000 (subscription access)</ref>\n\n[[File:MarianAnderson20.jpg|right|thumb|Anderson in 1920]]\nAnderson's parents were both devout [[Christians]] and the whole family was active in the Union Baptist Church in [[South Philadelphia]]. Marian's aunt Mary, her father's sister, was particularly active in the church's musical life and, noticing her niece's talent, convinced her to join the junior church choir at the age of six. In that role she got to perform solos and duets, often with her aunt Mary. Marian was also taken by her aunt to concerts at local churches, the YMCA, benefit concerts, and other community music events throughout the city. Anderson credited her aunt's influence as the reason she pursued her singing career. Beginning as young as six, her aunt arranged for Marian to sing for local functions where she was often paid 25 or 50 cents for singing a few songs. As she got into her early teens, Marian began to make as much as four or five dollars for singing; a considerable amount of money for the early 20th century. At the age of 10, Marian joined the People's Chorus under the direction of singer [[Emma Azalia Hackley]], where she was often given solos.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Greatest Black Achievers in History|last=Chidi|first=Sylvia Lovina|year=2014|publisher=Lulu Press|isbn=1291909338|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=532|oclc=980490928}}</ref> On March 21, 1919, during a March Festival of Music, she was a lead singer in a concert by the [[Robert Curtis Ogden]] Band and Choral Society at Egyptian Hall in Philadelphia's [[John Wanamaker]] department store.\n\nWhen Anderson was 12, her father was accidentally struck on the head while at work at the Reading Terminal, just a few weeks before Christmas of 1909. He died of heart failure a month later at age 34. Marian and her family moved into the home of her father's parents, Grandpa Benjamin and Grandma Isabella Anderson. Her grandfather had been born a slave and had experienced emancipation in the 1860s. He was the first of the Anderson family to settle in South Philadelphia, and when Anderson moved into his home the two became very close. He died just a year after the family moved in.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnderson attended Stanton Grammar School, graduating in the summer of 1912. Her family, however, could not afford to send her to high school, nor could they pay for any music lessons. Still, Anderson continued to perform wherever she could and learn from anyone who was willing to teach her. Throughout her teenage years, she remained active in her church's musical activities, now heavily involved in the adult choir. She joined the Baptists' Young People's Union and the [[Camp Fire Girls]] which provided her with some limited musical opportunities. Eventually the directors of the People's Chorus and the pastor of her church, Reverend Wesley Parks, along with other leaders of the black community, raised the money she needed to get singing lessons with Mary Saunders Patterson and to attend [[South Philadelphia High School]], from which she graduated in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bond|first=Zanice|date=January 19, 2007|title=Marian Anderson (1897\u20131993)|url=https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/anderson-marian-1897-1993/|website=[[BlackPast.org]]|access-date=26 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nAfter high school, Anderson applied to an all-white music school, the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Music Academy]] (now University of the Arts), but was turned away because she was black. The woman working the admissions counter replied, \"We don't take colored\" when she tried to apply. Undaunted, Anderson pursued studies privately in her native city through the continued support of the Philadelphia black community, first with Agnes Reifsnyder, then [[Giuseppe Boghetti]]. She met Boghetti through the principal of her high school. Anderson auditioned for him singing \"[[Deep River (song)|Deep River]]\" and he was immediately brought to tears. Boghetti scheduled a recital of English, Russian, Italian and German music at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|The Town Hall]] in New York City in April 1924 which took place in an almost empty hall and received poor reviews.{{sfn|Ferris|1994|page=33}} In 1925 Anderson got her first big break when she won first prize in a singing competition sponsored by the [[New York Philharmonic]]. As the winner she got to perform in concert with the orchestra on August&nbsp;26, 1925,<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberjhani|title=Encyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance|year=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|pages=11\u201313|first2=Sandra L.|last2= West}}</ref> a performance that scored immediate success with both audience and music critics. Anderson remained in New York to pursue further studies with [[Frank La Forge]]. During the time [[Arthur Judson]], whom she had met through the New York Philharmonic, became her manager. Over the next several years, she made a number of concert appearances in the United States, but racial prejudice prevented her career from gaining much momentum. In 1928, she sang for the first time at [[Carnegie Hall]]. Eventually she decided to go to Europe where she spent a number of months studying with [[Sara Cahier|Sara Charles-Cahier]] before launching a highly successful European singing tour.<ref>{{Cite news|last=n/a|first=n/a|url=|title=Marian Anderson in recital here this Monday night|date=December 1, 1928|work=New journal and guide|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==European fame==\nIn 1933, Anderson made her European debut in a concert at [[Wigmore Hall]] in London, where she was received enthusiastically. She spent the early 1930s touring throughout Europe where she did not encounter the racial prejudices she had experienced in America. In the summer of 1930, she went to [[Scandinavia]], where she met the Finnish pianist [[Kosti Vehanen]] who became her regular accompanist and her vocal coach for many years. She also met [[Jean Sibelius]] through Vehanen after he had heard her in a concert in [[Helsinki]]. Moved by her performance, Sibelius invited them to his home and asked his wife to bring champagne in place of the traditional coffee. Sibelius commented to Anderson of her performance that he felt that she had been able to penetrate the Nordic soul. The two struck up an immediate friendship, which further blossomed into a professional partnership, and for many years Sibelius altered and composed songs for Anderson to perform. He created a new arrangement of the song \"Solitude\" and dedicated it to Anderson in 1939.

Anderson used the award money to establish a singing competition to help support young singers. Eventually the prize fund ran out of money and it was disbanded after 1976. In 1990, the award was re-established and has dispensed $25,000 annually.\n\nIn 1998, the prize was restructured with the Marian Anderson Award going to an established artist, not necessarily a singer, who exhibits leadership in a humanitarian area.<ref>[http://www.marianandersonaward.org/default.aspx?page=aboutthereward About the Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320180535/http://www.marianandersonaward.org/default.aspx?page=aboutthereward |date=2012-03-20 }}, MarianAndersonaward.org</ref>\n\n==Biographical entries==\n* Hamilton, David.
