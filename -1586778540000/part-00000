The village has, in recent times, become attractive to day-trippers and tourists, and is one of the most-visited places in Britain.<ref>Dyer (2005); p. 9</ref> [[Treknow]] is the largest of the other settlements in the parish, which also include [[Bossiney]], [[Truas]], [[Trebarwith]], [[Tregatta]], [[Trenale]], [[Trethevy]], [[Treven]], [[Trevillet]], and [[Trewarmett]].\n\n==Toponymy==\n[[File:Around Tintagel, Cornwall (461181) (9458675814).jpg|thumb|left|\"Tintagel\" sign]]\n\n[[Toponymy|Toponymists]] have had difficulty explaining the origin of 'Tintagel': the probability is that it is Norman French, as the Cornish of the 13th century would have lacked the soft 'g' ('i/j' in the earliest forms: see also [[Tintagel Castle]]). If it is Cornish then 'Dun' would mean ''Fort''. [[Oliver Padel]] proposes 'Dun' '-tagell' meaning ''narrow place'' in his book on place names.<ref>[[Padel, O. J.]] (1985) ''Cornish Place-name Elements''. Nottingham: English Place-Name Society {{ISBN|0-904889-11-4}}</ref> There is a possible cognate in the [[Channel Islands]] named ''Tente d'Agel'', but that still leaves the question subject to doubt.<ref>Canner (1982), p. 97.</ref>\n\nThe name first occurs in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136, in Latin) as ''Tintagol'', implying pronunciation with a hard [g] sound as in modern English ''girl''. But in [[Layamon]]'s [[Layamon's Brut|''Brut'']] (MS [[List of manuscripts in the Cotton library#Otho|Cotton Otho]] C.xi, f. 482), in early [[Middle English]], the name is rendered as ''Tintaieol''. The letter ''i'' in this spelling implies a soft consonant like modern English ''j''; the second part of the name would be pronounced approximately as ''-ageul'' would be in modern French.\n\nAn oft-quoted Celtic etymology in the ''Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'',<ref>Mills, A. D. (1998) ''Dictionary of English Place-Names''; 2nd ed. Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-280074-4}}</ref> accepts the view of Padel (1985) that the name is from Cornish *''din'' meaning ''fort'' and *''tagell'' meaning ''neck, throat, constriction, narrow'' ([[Celtic toponymy#Frequent elements|Celtic]] *''d\u016bn'', \"fort\" = Irish ''d\u00fan'', \"fort\", ''cf''. Welsh ''dinas'', \"city\"; *''tagell'' = Welsh ''tagell'', \"gill, wattle\").\n\nThe modern-day village of Tintagel was always known as Trevena ({{lang-kw|Tre war Venydh}}) until the Post Office started using 'Tintagel' as the name in the mid-19th century. Until then, 'Tintagel' had been restricted to the name of the headland and of the parish.\n\n==Area and population==\nThe population of the parish was 1,727 at the 2011 census, down from 1,820 people at the 2001 census, and the area of the parish is {{convert|4281|acre|km2}}.<ref>Thomas (1993); p. 9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/Tintagel/index.html#Population|title=Parish population 2011.

The crew were able to get onto the rock and apart from a youth of 14 were saved by four men (three of these from Tintagel: one of them Charles Hambly received a Vellum testimonial and three medals for bravery afterwards). The story is told in verse in ''Musings on Tintagel and its Heroes'' by Joseph Brown, 1897; the youth was buried in Tintagel Churchyard and the grave is marked by a wooden cross (his name is given in the bureaucratic Italian usage, surname first: Catanese Domenico).<ref>Canner, A.

For the purposes of local government, Tintagel is currently a [[civil parish]] and councillors are elected every four years. The principal local authority in this area is [[Cornwall Council]], but until March 2009 the parish was in the area of [[North Cornwall]] District Council. Parish council minutes can be found on Tintagel Web. From 1894 to 1974, the parish was in the [[Camelford Rural District]].\n\n==Arthurian legends==\n{{main|Tintagel Castle#Arthurian legends}}\n\nIn Geoffrey's ''Historia'', [[Gorlois]], Duke of Cornwall, puts his wife [[Igraine]] in ''Tintagol'' while he is at war (''posuit eam in oppido Tintagol in littore maris'': \"he put her in the ''[[oppidum]]'' Tintagol on the shore of the sea\"). [[Merlin]] disguised [[Uther Pendragon]] as Gorlois so that Uther could enter Tintagel and impregnate Igraine while pretending to be Gorlois. Uther and Igraine's child was [[King Arthur]]. Some events of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend are also set at Tintagel.\n\n==Archaeology and architecture==\nThe [[Ravenna Cosmography]], of around 700, makes reference to Purocoronavis (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium), 'a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii': the location is unidentified, but Tintagel and [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] have both been suggested. (If this is correct then it would have been on the site of Tintagel Castle.)\n\n===Excavations===\n{{main|Tintagel Castle}}\n[[Image:TintagelCastle.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the ruins of [[Tintagel Castle]]. Part of the village of Tintagel (Trevena) can be seen in the distance|alt=]]\n\nMajor excavations beginning with [[Ralegh Radford|C. A. Ralegh Radford]]'s work in the 1930s on and around the site of the 12th-century castle have revealed that Tintagel headland was the site of either a high status [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic monastery]] (according to [[Ralegh Radford]]) or a princely fortress as well as trading settlement dating to the 5th and 6th centuries (according to later excavators), in the period immediately following the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] from Britain.  Finds of Mediterranean oil and wine jars show that [[Sub-Roman Britain]] was not the isolated outpost it was previously considered to be, for an extensive trade in high-value goods was taking place at the time with the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/early/origins/rom_celt/romessay.html |title= Sub-Roman Britain: an introduction}}</ref> Finds from the excavations are preserved at the [[Royal Cornwall Museum]] in Truro. In 1998, excavations discovered the [[Artognou stone]], which has added to Tintagel's Arthurian lore, although historians do not believe the inscription refers to King Arthur. Two seasons of excavation work were undertaken in Tintagel churchyard in the early 1990s.<ref>Nowakowski, Jacqueline A.; Thomas, Charles (1992) ''Grave News From Tintagel: an Account of a Second Season of Archaeological Excavations at Tintagel Churchyard''.

In the [[Iron Age]] there were probably [[Promontory fort|fortifications]] at Willapark and Barras Head, and inland at [[Trenale|Trenale Bury]]. Two of the Roman milestones found in Cornwall are at Tintagel (the earlier of the two is described under Trethevy: the later one was found in the walls of the churchyard in 1889 and is preserved in the church. The inscription can be read as '[I]mp C G Val Lic Licin' which would refer to the [[Emperor Licinius]] (d. 324).<ref>Canner, A. C. (1982) ''The Parish of Tintagel''. Camelford: A. C.

It is named after the [[Earl of Wharncliffe]] who was the largest landowner in the parish until his holdings were sold at the beginning of the 20th century. Opposite the Wharncliffe is the former Tintagel Hotel, once commonly known as Fry's Hotel: this was the terminus for coaches in the days before the railway to [[Camelford Station]] and stands on the site of the medieval chapel of St Denys.

The parish war memorial stands at the western end of the churchyard and a modern churchyard cross (c. 1910) near the south entrance. \n\nThere was a Norman [[castle chapel|chapel]] of St Julitta at the castle, now in ruins, which was excavated in Ralegh Radford's excavations. It is a simple rectangular building and the chancel is of a later date than the nave.\n\nAt Trethevy is the Anglican [[St Piran's Chapel, Trethevy|St Piran's Chapel]]. There was formerly also another Anglican chapel at Treknow. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, there was also a chapel of St Denys at Trevena: the annual fair was therefore celebrated in the week of his feast day (19 Oct). From 1925 until 2008 part of the Vicarage outbuildings were also in use as a chapel (the Fontevrault Chapel). The name commemorates the abbey in France which held the patronage of Tintagel during the Middle Ages (the commune is now known as [[Fontevraud-l'Abbaye]]), founded by [[Robert of Arbrissel]]. \n\n[[File:The Methodist Church, Tintagel - geograph.org.uk - 1384238.jpg|thumb|Trevena's Methodist Church in 2009]]\n\nThe Methodist Church has chapels at Trevena and Bossiney. Formerly there were more chapels of various [[Methodism|Methodist]] sects (Wesleyans, Bible Christians), including at [[Trenale]] and [[Trewarmett]]: the Methodist Cemetery is at Trewarmett. Wesleyan Methodism in Tintagel began in 1807 at Trenale and over the next sixty years gained many adherents though divided among a number of sects (Wesleyan Methodist, Methodist Association, Bible Christian): chapels were built at Trevena in 1838 and Bossiney in 1860. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Camelford Wesleyan Methodist circuit, which included Tintagel, underwent a secession by more than half the members to the [[Wesleyan Association|Wesleyan Methodist Association]].<ref>[[Thomas Shaw (Methodist minister)|Shaw, Thomas]] (1967) ''A History of Cornish Methodism''; chap, 5.

Quarries inland at Trebarwith and [[Trevillet]] continued to be worked until the mid-20th century. Apart from [[Tintagel Castle|the island]] headlands on the coast include Willapark and Start Point.\n\nThe turquoise green water around this coast is caused by the slate/sand around Tintagel which contains elements of copper: strong sunlight turns the water a light turquoise green colour in warm weather. The rocks contain various metal ores in small amounts: a few of these were mined in the Victorian period.<ref>Geological Survey and Museum (1948) ''British Regional Geology: South-west England''; by Henry Dewey. 2nd ed.

National Trust properties include, besides the Old Post Office in Trevena (see above), fine stretches of the cliffs along the coast including Glebe Cliff, Barras Nose and Penhallick Point. The coastal footpaths include part of the [[South West Coast Path]].\n\n===Birds===\n[[File:Cornish coast (28512825001).jpg|thumb|A seabird on the coast]]\n\nThe birds of the coast are well worth observing: in 1935 an anonymous writer mentions Willapark as the scene of spectacular flocks of [[seabird]]s (eight species); inland he describes the crows (including the [[Red-billed chough|Cornish chough]] and the raven) and falcons which frequent the district. B. H. Ryves mentions the [[razorbill]] as numerous at Tintagel (perhaps the largest colony in the county) and summarises reports from earlier in the century.<ref>Ryves, B. H.

Both the Women's Institute and the football and cricket teams are well-supported. Tintagel A.F.C. were champions of Cornwall in 1955/56 and have been in existence over a hundred years; goalkeeper [[Harry Cann]] also played for [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.]]<ref>Dyer, Peter (2005) ''Tintagel: portrait of a parish''; chapter 17: Tintagel AFC.

Cambridge: Cambridge Books; p. 397-402.</ref><ref>[http://www.tintagelmalevoicechoir.org.uk Tintagel Orpheus Male Voice Choir]</ref>\n\n===Literary associations===\nTintagel is used as a locus for the Arthurian mythos by the poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] in the poem ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Tristram of Lyonesse]]'', a literary version of the Tristan and Iseult legend. [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse'', a one-act play which was published in 1923, is another version of the same legend with events set at Tintagel (the book includes an imaginary drawing of Tintagel Castle at the period).<ref>Hardy, Thomas (1923) ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse''. London: Macmillan; two drawings by Hardy reproduced as plates.</ref> Another version is [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse'', a one-act play which was published in 1923. Hardy and his first wife visited Tintagel on various occasions: she drew a sketch of the inside of the church as it was about 1867.<ref>Hardy, Emma (1961) ''Some Recollections''. London: Oxford University Press.</ref> It is very prominent in the books in Fay Sampson's ''[[Daughter of Tintagel]]'' series of Arthurian novels (later retitled ''Morgan le Fay'').\n\nThe novelist [[Dinah Craik]] visited Tintagel in 1883 and published an informative account of her journey through Cornwall the following year. [[William Howitt]]'s visit was quite different: his account is called \"A day-dream at Tintagel\" (in ''Visits to Remarkable Places''). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include [[Anthony Trollope]]'s short story ''Malachi's Cove'' and the [[Charles Norris Williamson|Charles]] and [[Alice Muriel Williamson]]'s epistolary novel ''Set in Silver'' published in 1909. [[Ernest George Henham]] was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in [[Edith Wharton]]'s final, unfinished novel, ''[[The Buccaneers]]'', the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century.\n\n===Musical and film associations===\n[[Arnold Bax]] was inspired to compose his symphonic poem [[Tintagel (Bax)|''Tintagel'']] after a visit to the village.<ref>Caple, Hilda (1963) ''Tintagel in fact and fiction: an anthology'', 2nd ed. St Ives: S. Canynge Caple</ref> [[Edward Elgar]] also composed while on a visit to Tintagel.\n\nThe film ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' had some sequences filmed near Tintagel Castle with local people as extras: this was in 1953 though it was not released until 1954. Some other filming has been carried out in Tintagel, e.g. ''[[Malachi's Cove]]'' at Trebarwith. The exterior of the Camelot Castle Hotel was used to portray Dr. Seward's asylum in the 1979 film ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]''. The Youth Hostel doubled for the coastguard station in the 1981 BBC serial ''[[The Nightmare Man]]''.\n\n==Notable people==\nThe Earls and Dukes of Cornwall (to whom the castle belonged) were never resident at Tintagel though a few of them are known to have visited. From 1552 to 1832, Tintagel was a parliamentary borough (generally known as the Borough of Bossiney) sending two members to the House of Commons; these included Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir [[Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt|Simon Harcourt]] and [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe]]. During the same period, there were also mayors of the borough of whom the best known is William Wade ([[floruit|fl.]] 1756\u20131786). Contemporaries of Mayor Wade were the Rev. Arthur Wade (vicar 1770\u20131810) and Charles Chilcott (d. 1815) (known for his gigantic stature).<ref>Hone's ''Everyday Book''</ref><ref>Taylor, William. ''History of Tintagel''.</ref> The Rev. R. B. Kinsman (vicar 1851\u20131894) was also honorary constable of the castle.<ref>In the hope of raising some money for the family of [[Edward Budge]], the Rev. R. B. Kinsman, the vicar of Tintagel, published, in 1866, a collection of ''Posthumous Gleanings'' from Budge's study and from the essays which he had contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, Tintagel was visited by many writers, including [[Robert Stephen Hawker]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], [[Thomas Hardy]], and the mystic philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]].<ref>Paull, John (2012) [http://orgprints.org/22492/17/22492.pdf  Tintagel: In the footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Bio- Dynamics Tasmania, 107 (Spring):11\u201315.</ref> It was also the occasional residence of John Douglas Cook, founder editor of the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' (d. 1868) who is buried at Tintagel. He bought Trevena House as an occasional residence: it later became the front part of King Arthur's Hall (see [[#Archaeology and architecture]]).\n\nHenry George White, the village schoolmaster for many years was also a prolific amateur painter.<ref>Dyer (2005).</ref> The Very Rev.

The village and nearby [[Tintagel Castle]] are associated with the legends surrounding [[King Arthur]]. The village has, in recent times, become attractive to day-trippers and tourists, and is one of the most-visited places in Britain.<ref>Dyer (2005); p. 9</ref> [[Treknow]] is the largest of the other settlements in the parish, which also include [[Bossiney]], [[Truas]], [[Trebarwith]], [[Tregatta]], [[Trenale]], [[Trethevy]], [[Treven]], [[Trevillet]], and [[Trewarmett]].\n\n==Toponymy==\n[[File:Around Tintagel, Cornwall (461181) (9458675814).jpg|thumb|left|\"Tintagel\" sign]]\n\n[[Toponymy|Toponymists]] have had difficulty explaining the origin of 'Tintagel': the probability is that it is Norman French, as the Cornish of the 13th century would have lacked the soft 'g' ('i/j' in the earliest forms: see also [[Tintagel Castle]]). If it is Cornish then 'Dun' would mean ''Fort''. [[Oliver Padel]] proposes 'Dun' '-tagell' meaning ''narrow place'' in his book on place names.<ref>[[Padel, O. J.]] (1985) ''Cornish Place-name Elements''. Nottingham: English Place-Name Society {{ISBN|0-904889-11-4}}</ref> There is a possible cognate in the [[Channel Islands]] named ''Tente d'Agel'', but that still leaves the question subject to doubt.<ref>Canner (1982), p. 97.</ref>\n\nThe name first occurs in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (c. 1136, in Latin) as ''Tintagol'', implying pronunciation with a hard [g] sound as in modern English ''girl''. But in [[Layamon]]'s [[Layamon's Brut|''Brut'']] (MS [[List of manuscripts in the Cotton library#Otho|Cotton Otho]] C.xi, f. 482), in early [[Middle English]], the name is rendered as ''Tintaieol''. The letter ''i'' in this spelling implies a soft consonant like modern English ''j''; the second part of the name would be pronounced approximately as ''-ageul'' would be in modern French.\n\nAn oft-quoted Celtic etymology in the ''Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'',<ref>Mills, A. D. (1998) ''Dictionary of English Place-Names''; 2nd ed. Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-280074-4}}</ref> accepts the view of Padel (1985) that the name is from Cornish *''din'' meaning ''fort'' and *''tagell'' meaning ''neck, throat, constriction, narrow'' ([[Celtic toponymy#Frequent elements|Celtic]] *''d\u016bn'', \"fort\" = Irish ''d\u00fan'', \"fort\", ''cf''. Welsh ''dinas'', \"city\"; *''tagell'' = Welsh ''tagell'', \"gill, wattle\").\n\nThe modern-day village of Tintagel was always known as Trevena ({{lang-kw|Tre war Venydh}}) until the Post Office started using 'Tintagel' as the name in the mid-19th century. Until then, 'Tintagel' had been restricted to the name of the headland and of the parish.\n\n==Area and population==\nThe population of the parish was 1,727 at the 2011 census, down from 1,820 people at the 2001 census, and the area of the parish is {{convert|4281|acre|km2}}.<ref>Thomas (1993); p. 9.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/Cornwall/Tintagel/index.html#Population|title=Parish population 2011.

In ''[[Domesday Book]]'', there are certainly two manors in this parish (for a probable third see [[Trethevy]]). \n\n[[File:Fields by Downrow - geograph.org.uk - 742006.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Treknow]], Tintagel (Trevena) and [[Bossiney]] from [[Condolden|King's Down]]|alt=]]\n\nBossiney and Trevena were established as a borough in 1253 by [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall]].

The crew were able to get onto the rock and apart from a youth of 14 were saved by four men (three of these from Tintagel: one of them Charles Hambly received a Vellum testimonial and three medals for bravery afterwards). The story is told in verse in ''Musings on Tintagel and its Heroes'' by Joseph Brown, 1897; the youth was buried in Tintagel Churchyard and the grave is marked by a wooden cross (his name is given in the bureaucratic Italian usage, surname first: Catanese Domenico).<ref>Canner, A.

For the purposes of local government, Tintagel is currently a [[civil parish]] and councillors are elected every four years. The principal local authority in this area is [[Cornwall Council]], but until March 2009 the parish was in the area of [[North Cornwall]] District Council. Parish council minutes can be found on Tintagel Web. From 1894 to 1974, the parish was in the [[Camelford Rural District]].\n\n==Arthurian legends==\n{{main|Tintagel Castle#Arthurian legends}}\n\nIn Geoffrey's ''Historia'', [[Gorlois]], Duke of Cornwall, puts his wife [[Igraine]] in ''Tintagol'' while he is at war (''posuit eam in oppido Tintagol in littore maris'': \"he put her in the ''[[oppidum]]'' Tintagol on the shore of the sea\"). [[Merlin]] disguised [[Uther Pendragon]] as Gorlois so that Uther could enter Tintagel and impregnate Igraine while pretending to be Gorlois. Uther and Igraine's child was [[King Arthur]]. Some events of the [[Tristan and Iseult]] legend are also set at Tintagel.\n\n==Archaeology and architecture==\nThe [[Ravenna Cosmography]], of around 700, makes reference to Purocoronavis (almost certainly a corruption of Durocornovium), 'a fort or walled settlement of the Cornovii': the location is unidentified, but Tintagel and [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] have both been suggested. (If this is correct then it would have been on the site of Tintagel Castle.)\n\n===Excavations===\n{{main|Tintagel Castle}}\n[[Image:TintagelCastle.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the ruins of [[Tintagel Castle]]. Part of the village of Tintagel (Trevena) can be seen in the distance|alt=]]\n\nMajor excavations beginning with [[Ralegh Radford|C. A. Ralegh Radford]]'s work in the 1930s on and around the site of the 12th-century castle have revealed that Tintagel headland was the site of either a high status [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic monastery]] (according to [[Ralegh Radford]]) or a princely fortress as well as trading settlement dating to the 5th and 6th centuries (according to later excavators), in the period immediately following the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] from Britain.  Finds of Mediterranean oil and wine jars show that [[Sub-Roman Britain]] was not the isolated outpost it was previously considered to be, for an extensive trade in high-value goods was taking place at the time with the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/early/origins/rom_celt/romessay.html |title= Sub-Roman Britain: an introduction}}</ref> Finds from the excavations are preserved at the [[Royal Cornwall Museum]] in Truro. In 1998, excavations discovered the [[Artognou stone]], which has added to Tintagel's Arthurian lore, although historians do not believe the inscription refers to King Arthur. Two seasons of excavation work were undertaken in Tintagel churchyard in the early 1990s.<ref>Nowakowski, Jacqueline A.; Thomas, Charles (1992) ''Grave News From Tintagel: an Account of a Second Season of Archaeological Excavations at Tintagel Churchyard''. Truro: Cornwall Archaeological Unit</ref>\n\n===Antiquities===\nThe largest of the [[Bronze Age]] barrows is at the highest point in the parish, [[Condolden]], another is at Menadue, and there are a number of others along the cliffs. In the [[Iron Age]] there were probably [[Promontory fort|fortifications]] at Willapark and Barras Head, and inland at [[Trenale|Trenale Bury]]. Two of the Roman milestones found in Cornwall are at Tintagel (the earlier of the two is described under Trethevy: the later one was found in the walls of the churchyard in 1889 and is preserved in the church. The inscription can be read as '[I]mp C G Val Lic Licin' which would refer to the [[Emperor Licinius]] (d. 324).<ref>Canner, A. C. (1982) ''The Parish of Tintagel''. Camelford: A. C.

The front has battered walls, a central entrance tower rising to five storeys and projecting four-storey corner towers; the towers have machicolations and rise above the three storeys of the rest of the building.

The Wharncliffe has now been converted into flats (next to the King Arthur's Hall): the Aelnat Cross (Hiberno-Saxon) stands in the grounds. It is named after the [[Earl of Wharncliffe]] who was the largest landowner in the parish until his holdings were sold at the beginning of the 20th century. Opposite the Wharncliffe is the former Tintagel Hotel, once commonly known as Fry's Hotel: this was the terminus for coaches in the days before the railway to [[Camelford Station]] and stands on the site of the medieval chapel of St Denys. Near Dunderhole Point on Glebe Cliff stands a building from the former slate quarry that has been used as Tintagel Youth Hostel (managed by [[YHA (England and Wales)|YHA]]) for many years.\n\n===Churches and chapels===\n[[File:Tintagel moon (2759996142).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[St Materiana's Church, Tintagel|St Materiana's]] in 2008]]\n\n[[St Materiana's Church, Tintagel|The Church of St Materiana (Tintagel Parish Church)]] has been [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] since the English Reformation.

Truro: Cornwall Archaeological Unit.</ref> There are modern stained glass windows, three modern copies of Old Master paintings, and a Roman milestone (described above under ''Antiquities''). The parish war memorial stands at the western end of the churchyard and a modern churchyard cross (c. 1910) near the south entrance. \n\nThere was a Norman [[castle chapel|chapel]] of St Julitta at the castle, now in ruins, which was excavated in Ralegh Radford's excavations. It is a simple rectangular building and the chancel is of a later date than the nave.\n\nAt Trethevy is the Anglican [[St Piran's Chapel, Trethevy|St Piran's Chapel]]. There was formerly also another Anglican chapel at Treknow. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, there was also a chapel of St Denys at Trevena: the annual fair was therefore celebrated in the week of his feast day (19 Oct). From 1925 until 2008 part of the Vicarage outbuildings were also in use as a chapel (the Fontevrault Chapel). The name commemorates the abbey in France which held the patronage of Tintagel during the Middle Ages (the commune is now known as [[Fontevraud-l'Abbaye]]), founded by [[Robert of Arbrissel]]. \n\n[[File:The Methodist Church, Tintagel - geograph.org.uk - 1384238.jpg|thumb|Trevena's Methodist Church in 2009]]\n\nThe Methodist Church has chapels at Trevena and Bossiney. Formerly there were more chapels of various [[Methodism|Methodist]] sects (Wesleyans, Bible Christians), including at [[Trenale]] and [[Trewarmett]]: the Methodist Cemetery is at Trewarmett. Wesleyan Methodism in Tintagel began in 1807 at Trenale and over the next sixty years gained many adherents though divided among a number of sects (Wesleyan Methodist, Methodist Association, Bible Christian): chapels were built at Trevena in 1838 and Bossiney in 1860. In the 1830s and 1840s, the Camelford Wesleyan Methodist circuit, which included Tintagel, underwent a secession by more than half the members to the [[Wesleyan Association|Wesleyan Methodist Association]].<ref>[[Thomas Shaw (Methodist minister)|Shaw, Thomas]] (1967) ''A History of Cornish Methodism''; chap, 5. Truro: Bradford Barton.</ref> The various Methodist churches were united again by the agreements of 1907 and 1932. Mary Toms, a [[Bible Christian Church|Bible Christian]] from Tintagel, evangelised parts of the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref>Bible Christians were also strong in the Isle of Wight amongst farm labourers, largely due to the inspirational teachings of Mary Toms of Tintagel, Cornwall. The vicar of [[Brighstone]] [[Samuel Wilberforce]] urged that their influence be countered by having their adherents sacked from their jobs and turned out from their cottages, resulting in them sometimes meeting in a chalk pit. There are several chapels in rural areas of the Island which have the title \"Bible Christian Chapel\" over the doorway (e.g. [[Apse Heath]], [[Arreton]]).</ref>\n\n[[St Paul's Church, Tintagel]] has a thirty-thousand piece mosaic of the saint within its walls. Since January 2008, when the church celebrated its 40th anniversary, a modern-day version of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by local artist Nicholas St John Rosse has hung above the main altar in the church. It has made international headlines due to its use of modern clothing and local people as the apostles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7174067.stm |title=National News Item from BBC | date=6 January 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref> People from many other countries also come to Tintagel to view the names of their babies who have been lost due to miscarriage, stillbirth or other cause. The names are recorded in the [[Miscarriage & Infant Loss Memorial Book]] which is kept at the church.\n\n==Geography and nature==\n===Coastline===\n[[File:Tintagel DSC 7889.jpg|thumb|[[Lichen]] at the coast at Tintagel|alt=]]\n\nThe coastline around Tintagel is significant because it is composed of old [[Devonian]] [[slate]]; about a mile southwards from Tintagel towards [[Treknow]] the coastline was quarried extensively for this hard-wearing roofing surface. Quarries inland at Trebarwith and [[Trevillet]] continued to be worked until the mid-20th century. Apart from [[Tintagel Castle|the island]] headlands on the coast include Willapark and Start Point.\n\nThe turquoise green water around this coast is caused by the slate/sand around Tintagel which contains elements of copper: strong sunlight turns the water a light turquoise green colour in warm weather. The rocks contain various metal ores in small amounts: a few of these were mined in the Victorian period.<ref>Geological Survey and Museum (1948) ''British Regional Geology: South-west England''; by Henry Dewey. 2nd ed. H.M.S.O., pp. 23\u201328.</ref>\n\nThough very near the coast the hill of [[Condolden]] (or Kingsdown) is among the very few areas in Cornwall outside Bodmin Moor which exceeds 1000 feet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/741909 |title=Condolden|accessdate=11 April 2009}}</ref> At Trethevy is the waterfall known as [[St Nectan's Kieve]] in a wooded valley. The beach at [[Bossiney Haven]] is close by and [[Trebarwith Strand]], just half an hour's walk south of Tintagel, is one of Cornwall's finer beaches, boasting clear seas, golden sands, and superb surf. There is also a small beach at Tintagel Haven immediately north of the castle, as well as a cave known as [[Merlin's Cave]] under the castle. \n\n[[File:Slatewall trebarwith strand.jpg|thumb|left|Slate at [[Trebarwith Strand]]]]\n\nThe cliffs from Backways Cove, south of Trebarwith Strand to Willapark just to the south of [[Boscastle]] are part of the Tintagel Cliffs SSSI (a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]), designated for both its [[Heath|maritime heaths]] and geological features. There are also four [[Geological Conservation Review]] sites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tintagel Cliffs|url=http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1000544.pdf|publisher=[[Natural England]]|date=10 June 1988|accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nTintagel lies within the [[Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB). National Trust properties include, besides the Old Post Office in Trevena (see above), fine stretches of the cliffs along the coast including Glebe Cliff, Barras Nose and Penhallick Point. The coastal footpaths include part of the [[South West Coast Path]].\n\n===Birds===\n[[File:Cornish coast (28512825001).jpg|thumb|A seabird on the coast]]\n\nThe birds of the coast are well worth observing: in 1935 an anonymous writer mentions Willapark as the scene of spectacular flocks of [[seabird]]s (eight species); inland he describes the crows (including the [[Red-billed chough|Cornish chough]] and the raven) and falcons which frequent the district.

Cambridge: Cambridge Books; p. 397-402.</ref><ref>[http://www.tintagelmalevoicechoir.org.uk Tintagel Orpheus Male Voice Choir]</ref>\n\n===Literary associations===\nTintagel is used as a locus for the Arthurian mythos by the poet [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] in the poem ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''[[Tristram of Lyonesse]]'', a literary version of the Tristan and Iseult legend. [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse'', a one-act play which was published in 1923, is another version of the same legend with events set at Tintagel (the book includes an imaginary drawing of Tintagel Castle at the period).<ref>Hardy, Thomas (1923) ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse''. London: Macmillan; two drawings by Hardy reproduced as plates.</ref> Another version is [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''The Famous Tragedy of the Queen of Cornwall at Tintagel in Lyonnesse'', a one-act play which was published in 1923. Hardy and his first wife visited Tintagel on various occasions: she drew a sketch of the inside of the church as it was about 1867.<ref>Hardy, Emma (1961) ''Some Recollections''. London: Oxford University Press.</ref> It is very prominent in the books in Fay Sampson's ''[[Daughter of Tintagel]]'' series of Arthurian novels (later retitled ''Morgan le Fay'').\n\nThe novelist [[Dinah Craik]] visited Tintagel in 1883 and published an informative account of her journey through Cornwall the following year. [[William Howitt]]'s visit was quite different: his account is called \"A day-dream at Tintagel\" (in ''Visits to Remarkable Places''). Relatively few works of fiction have Tintagel as a setting: these include [[Anthony Trollope]]'s short story ''Malachi's Cove'' and the [[Charles Norris Williamson|Charles]] and [[Alice Muriel Williamson]]'s epistolary novel ''Set in Silver'' published in 1909. [[Ernest George Henham]] was a novelist resident in Devon who used the pseudonym John Trevena for many of his books; it is probable that the surname he chose was derived from the original name for Tintagel, though his writings are concerned mainly with Devon. Tintagel features prominently in [[Edith Wharton]]'s final, unfinished novel, ''[[The Buccaneers]]'', the protagonist of which, Nan St. George, meets her future husband, the Duke of Tintagel, while exploring the ruins of Tintagel Castle. Wharton styled the characters as Duke and Duchess of Tintagel, while Tintagel actually lies within the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]; in the novel, the Duke and Duchess live in a newer, fictional Tintagel Castle, built in approximately the late 18th century.\n\n===Musical and film associations===\n[[Arnold Bax]] was inspired to compose his symphonic poem [[Tintagel (Bax)|''Tintagel'']] after a visit to the village.<ref>Caple, Hilda (1963) ''Tintagel in fact and fiction: an anthology'', 2nd ed. St Ives: S. Canynge Capl.</ref> [[Edward Elgar]] also composed while on a visit to Tintagel.\n\nThe film ''[[Knights of the Round Table (film)|Knights of the Round Table]]'' had some sequences filmed near Tintagel Castle with local people as extras: this was in 1953 though it was not released until 1954. Some other filming has been carried out in Tintagel, e.g. ''[[Malachi's Cove]]'' at Trebarwith. The exterior of the Camelot Castle Hotel was used to portray Dr. Seward's asylum in the 1979 film ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]''. The Youth Hostel doubled for the coastguard station in the 1981 BBC serial ''[[The Nightmare Man]]''.\n\n==Notable people==\nThe Earls and Dukes of Cornwall (to whom the castle belonged) were never resident at Tintagel though a few of them are known to have visited. From 1552 to 1832, Tintagel was a parliamentary borough (generally known as the Borough of Bossiney) sending two members to the House of Commons; these included Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir [[Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt|Simon Harcourt]] and [[James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe]]. During the same period, there were also mayors of the borough of whom the best known is William Wade ([[floruit|fl.]] 1756\u20131786). Contemporaries of Mayor Wade were the Rev. Arthur Wade (vicar 1770\u20131810) and Charles Chilcott (d. 1815) (known for his gigantic stature).<ref>Hone's ''Everyday Book''</ref><ref>Taylor, William. ''History of Tintagel''.</ref> The Rev. R. B. Kinsman (vicar 1851\u20131894) was also honorary constable of the castle.<ref>In the hope of raising some money for the family of [[Edward Budge]], the Rev. R. B. Kinsman, the vicar of Tintagel, published, in 1866, a collection of ''Posthumous Gleanings'' from Budge's study and from the essays which he had contributed to the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]''.</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, Tintagel was visited by many writers, including [[Robert Stephen Hawker]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]], [[Thomas Hardy]], and the mystic philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]].<ref>Paull, John (2012) [http://orgprints.org/22492/17/22492.pdf  Tintagel: In the footsteps of Rudolf Steiner], Journal of Bio- Dynamics Tasmania, 107 (Spring):11\u201315.</ref> It was also the occasional residence of John Douglas Cook, founder editor of the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' (d. 1868) who is buried at Tintagel. He bought Trevena House as an occasional residence: it later became the front part of King Arthur's Hall (see [[#Archaeology and architecture]]).\n\nHenry George White, the village schoolmaster for many years was also a prolific amateur painter.<ref>Dyer (2005).</ref> The Very Rev.

Reverse transcriptases are used by [[retrovirus]]es to replicate their genomes, by  [[retrotransposon]] mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, by [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells to extend the [[telomere]]s at the ends of their [[Chromosome#Eukaryotes|linear chromosomes]], and by some non-retroviruses such as the [[hepatitis B virus]], a member of the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', which are [[dsDNA-RT virus]]es.\n\nRetroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] activity, [[ribonuclease H]] (RNAse H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in [[molecular cloning]], [[RNA sequencing]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), or [[DNA microarray|genome analysis]].\n\n== History ==\nReverse transcriptases were discovered by [[Howard Temin]] at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in [[Rous sarcoma virus|Rous sarcoma]] virions<ref name=\"pmid4316301\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Temin HM, Mizutani S | title = RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in virions of Rous sarcoma virus | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1211\u20133 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 4316301 | doi = 10.1038/2261211a0 }}</ref> and independently isolated by [[David Baltimore]] in 1970 at [[MIT]] from two RNA tumour viruses: [[murine leukemia virus]] and again [[Rous sarcoma virus]].<ref name=\"pmid4316300\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D | title = RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in virions of RNA tumour viruses | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1209\u201311 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 4316300 | doi = 10.1038/2261209a0 }}</ref> For their achievements, they shared the 1975 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] (with [[Renato Dulbecco]]).\n\nWell-studied reverse transcriptases include:\n* HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] type 1 ({{PDB|1HMV}}) has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 [[kilodalton|kDa]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferris AL, Hizi A, Showalter SD, Pichuantes S, Babe L, Craik CS, Hughes SH | title = Immunologic and proteolytic analysis of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase structure | journal = Virology | volume = 175 | issue = 2 | pages = 456\u201364 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 1691562 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6822(90)90430-y | url = http://www.craiklab.ucsf.edu/docs/pub47.pdf }}</ref>\n* M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the [[murine leukemia virus|Moloney murine leukemia virus]] is a single 75 kDa monomer.<ref name=\"Konishi_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Konishi A, Yasukawa K, Inouye K | title = Improving the thermal stability of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase \u03b1-subunit by site-directed mutagenesis | journal = Biotechnology Letters | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1209\u201315 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22426840 | doi = 10.1007/s10529-012-0904-9 | url = http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/157247/1/s10529-012-0904-9.pdf }}</ref>\n* AMV reverse transcriptase from the [[Alpharetrovirus|avian myeloblastosis virus]] also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.<ref name=\"Konishi_2012\"/>\n* [[Telomerase reverse transcriptase]] that maintains the [[telomere]]s of [[eukaryotic]] [[chromosomes]].\n\n== Function in viruses ==\n[[File:HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase with Active Sites.png|thumb|left|Reverse transcriptase is shown with its finger, palm, and thumb regions.

Reverse-transcribing [[RNA virus]]es, such as [[retrovirus]]es, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA [[genome]]s into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing [[DNA virus]]es, such as the [[hepadnavirus]]es, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.\n\n=== Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription===\nReverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.\n\nIn virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded [[DNA polymerase \u03b4]], mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by similar mechanism as in [[Primer (molecular biology)#Primer removal|primer removal]], where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.\n\nThe process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause [[Resistance to antiviral drugs|drug resistance]].\n\n==== Retroviral reverse transcription ====\n[[Image:Reverse transcription.svg|thumb|300px|Mechanism of reverse transcription in HIV. Step numbers will not match up.]]\n[[Retroviruses]], also referred to as class VI [[ssRNA-RT]] viruses, are RNA reverse-transcribing viruses with a DNA intermediate. Their genomes consist of two molecules of [[sense (molecular biology)#RNA sense in viruses|positive-sense]] single-stranded RNA with a [[5' cap]] and [[Polyadenylation|3' polyadenylated tail]]. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) and the human T-lymphotropic virus ([[HTLV]]). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the [[cytosol]]<ref>[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Retrovirus/ Bio-Medicine.org - Retrovirus] Retrieved on 17 Feb, 2009</ref> as a series of these steps:\n#[[lysidine (nucleoside)|Lysyl]] [[tRNA]] acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.\n#Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing [[complementary DNA|DNA complementary]] to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.\n#A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called [[RNAse H]] degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5\u2019 end of the RNA.\n#The tRNA primer then \"jumps\" to the 3\u2019 end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.\n#The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.\n#The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.\n#Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.\n#The tRNA primer leaves and a \"jump\" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.\n#Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme [[integrase]].\n\nCreation of double-stranded DNA also involves ''strand transfer'', in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors = Telesnitsky A, Goff SP | veditors = Skalka MA, Goff SP | title = Reverse transcriptase| edition = 1st | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor| location = New York | year = 1993 | chapter =  Strong-stop strand transfer during reverse transcription | page = 49| quote = | isbn =978-0-87969-382-4 }}</ref>\n\nRetroviral RNA is arranged in 5\u2019 terminus to 3\u2019 terminus.

The RNA 5\u2019end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3\u2019 end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 [[nucleotides]] and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5\u2019 terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3\u2019 end of the primer in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand).

Reverse transcriptases are used by [[retrovirus]]es to replicate their genomes, by  [[retrotransposon]] mobile genetic elements to proliferate within the host genome, by [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells to extend the [[telomere]]s at the ends of their [[Chromosome#Eukaryotes|linear chromosomes]], and by some non-retroviruses such as the [[hepatitis B virus]], a member of the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', which are [[dsDNA-RT virus]]es.\n\nRetroviral RT has three sequential biochemical activities: RNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]] activity, [[ribonuclease H]] (RNAse H), and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Collectively, these activities enable the enzyme to convert single-stranded RNA into double-stranded cDNA. In retroviruses and retrotransposons, this cDNA can then integrate into the host genome, from which new RNA copies can be made via host-cell [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. The same sequence of reactions is widely used in the laboratory to convert RNA to DNA for use in [[molecular cloning]], [[RNA sequencing]], [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), or [[DNA microarray|genome analysis]].\n\n== History ==\nReverse transcriptases were discovered by [[Howard Temin]] at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]] in [[Rous sarcoma virus|Rous sarcoma]] virions<ref name=\"pmid4316301\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Temin HM, Mizutani S | title = RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in virions of Rous sarcoma virus | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1211\u20133 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 4316301 | doi = 10.1038/2261211a0 }}</ref> and independently isolated by [[David Baltimore]] in 1970 at [[MIT]] from two RNA tumour viruses: [[murine leukemia virus]] and again [[Rous sarcoma virus]].<ref name=\"pmid4316300\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baltimore D | title = RNA-dependent DNA polymerase in virions of RNA tumour viruses | journal = Nature | volume = 226 | issue = 5252 | pages = 1209\u201311 | date = June 1970 | pmid = 4316300 | doi = 10.1038/2261209a0 }}</ref> For their achievements, they shared the 1975 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] (with [[Renato Dulbecco]]).\n\nWell-studied reverse transcriptases include:\n* HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] type 1 ({{PDB|1HMV}}) has two subunits, which have respective molecular weights of 66 and 51 [[kilodalton|kDa]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferris AL, Hizi A, Showalter SD, Pichuantes S, Babe L, Craik CS, Hughes SH | title = Immunologic and proteolytic analysis of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase structure | journal = Virology | volume = 175 | issue = 2 | pages = 456\u201364 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 1691562 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6822(90)90430-y | url = http://www.craiklab.ucsf.edu/docs/pub47.pdf }}</ref>\n* M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the [[murine leukemia virus|Moloney murine leukemia virus]] is a single 75 kDa monomer.<ref name=\"Konishi_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Konishi A, Yasukawa K, Inouye K | title = Improving the thermal stability of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase \u03b1-subunit by site-directed mutagenesis | journal = Biotechnology Letters | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1209\u201315 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22426840 | doi = 10.1007/s10529-012-0904-9 | url = http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/157247/1/s10529-012-0904-9.pdf }}</ref>\n* AMV reverse transcriptase from the [[Alpharetrovirus|avian myeloblastosis virus]] also has two subunits, a 63 kDa subunit and a 95 kDa subunit.<ref name=\"Konishi_2012\"/>\n* [[Telomerase reverse transcriptase]] that maintains the [[telomere]]s of [[eukaryotic]] [[chromosomes]].\n\n== Function in viruses ==\n[[File:HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase with Active Sites.png|thumb|left|Reverse transcriptase is shown with its finger, palm, and thumb regions.

Reverse-transcribing [[RNA virus]]es, such as [[retrovirus]]es, use the enzyme to reverse-transcribe their RNA [[genome]]s into DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome and replicated along with it. Reverse-transcribing [[DNA virus]]es, such as the [[hepadnavirus]]es, can allow RNA to serve as a template in assembling and making DNA strands. HIV infects humans with the use of this enzyme. Without reverse transcriptase, the viral genome would not be able to incorporate into the host cell, resulting in failure to replicate.\n\n=== Process of reverse transcription or retrotranscription===\nReverse transcriptase creates double-stranded DNA from an RNA template.\n\nIn virus species with reverse transcriptase lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA can possibly be done by host-encoded [[DNA polymerase \u03b4]], mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by similar mechanism as in [[Primer (molecular biology)#Primer removal|primer removal]], where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.\n\nThe process of reverse transcription, also called retrotranscription or retrotras, is extremely error-prone, and it is during this step that mutations may occur. Such mutations may cause [[Resistance to antiviral drugs|drug resistance]].\n\n==== Retroviral reverse transcription ====\n[[Image:Reverse transcription.svg|thumb|300px|Mechanism of reverse transcription in HIV.

Their genomes consist of two molecules of [[sense (molecular biology)#RNA sense in viruses|positive-sense]] single-stranded RNA with a [[5' cap]] and [[Polyadenylation|3' polyadenylated tail]]. Examples of retroviruses include the human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]) and the human T-lymphotropic virus ([[HTLV]]). Creation of double-stranded DNA occurs in the [[cytosol]]<ref>[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Retrovirus/ Bio-Medicine.org - Retrovirus] Retrieved on 17 Feb, 2009</ref> as a series of these steps:\n#[[lysidine (nucleoside)|Lysyl]] [[tRNA]] acts as a primer and hybridizes to a complementary part of the virus RNA genome called the primer binding site or PBS.\n#Reverse transcriptase then adds DNA nucleotides onto the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing [[complementary DNA|DNA complementary]] to the U5 (non-coding region) and R region (a direct repeat found at both ends of the RNA molecule) of the viral RNA.\n#A domain on the reverse transcriptase enzyme called [[RNAse H]] degrades the U5 and R regions on the 5\u2019 end of the RNA.\n#The tRNA primer then \"jumps\" to the 3\u2019 end of the viral genome, and the newly synthesised DNA strands hybridizes to the complementary R region on the RNA.\n#The complementary DNA (cDNA) added in (2) is further extended.\n#The majority of viral RNA is degraded by RNAse H, leaving only the PP sequence.\n#Synthesis of the second DNA strand begins, using the remaining PP fragment of viral RNA as a primer.\n#The tRNA primer leaves and a \"jump\" happens. The PBS from the second strand hybridizes with the complementary PBS on the first strand.\n#Both strands are extended to form a complete double-stranded DNA copy of the original viral RNA genome, which can then be incorporated into the host's genome by the enzyme [[integrase]].\n\nCreation of double-stranded DNA also involves ''strand transfer'', in which there is a translocation of short DNA product from initial RNA-dependent DNA synthesis to acceptor template regions at the other end of the genome, which are later reached and processed by the reverse transcriptase for its DNA-dependent DNA activity.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors = Telesnitsky A, Goff SP | veditors = Skalka MA, Goff SP | title = Reverse transcriptase| edition = 1st | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor| location = New York | year = 1993 | chapter =  Strong-stop strand transfer during reverse transcription | page = 49| quote = | isbn =978-0-87969-382-4 }}</ref>\n\nRetroviral RNA is arranged in 5\u2019 terminus to 3\u2019 terminus.

The RNA 5\u2019end to the PBS site is called U5, and the RNA 3\u2019 end to the PBS is called the leader. The tRNA primer is unwound between 14 and 22 [[nucleotides]] and forms a base-paired duplex with the viral RNA at PBS. The fact that the PBS is located near the 5\u2019 terminus of viral RNA is unusual because reverse transcriptase synthesize DNA from 3\u2019 end of the primer in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019  direction (with respect to the newly synthesized DNA strand). Therefore, the primer and reverse transcriptase must be relocated to 3\u2019 end of viral RNA.

Reverse transcriptase converted this edited RNA back into DNA so it could be incorporated in the genome.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biology|Viruses}}\n*[[cDNA library]]\n*[[DNA polymerase]]\n*[[msDNA]]\n*[[Reverse transcribing virus (disambiguation)|Reverse transcribing virus]]<!--intentional link to DAB page-->\n*[[RNA polymerase]]\n*[[Telomerase]]\n*[[Retrotransposon marker]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MeshName|RNA+Transcriptase}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517042722/http://www.tibotec.com/bgdisplay.jhtml?itemname=HIV_discovery&product=none&s=2 animation of reverse transcriptase action and three reverse transcriptase inhibitors]\n* [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=education_discussion/molecule_of_the_month/pdb33_1.html Molecule of the month] (September 2002) at the RCSB PDB\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO8MP3wMvqg HIV Replication 3D Medical Animation.
