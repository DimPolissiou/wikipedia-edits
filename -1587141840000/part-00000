Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables.

On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

The most populous cities on the Arabian Peninsula are [[Riyadh]], [[Dubai]], [[Jeddah]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Doha]], [[Kuwait City]], [[Sanaa]], [[Mecca]] and [[Muscat]].\n\nBefore the modern era, it was divided into four distinct regions: [[Hejaz|Red Sea Coast]] ([[Tihamah]]), [[Najd|Central Plateau]] ([[Al-Yamama]]), [[Southern Arabia|Indian Ocean Coast]] ([[Hadhramaut]]) and [[Eastern Arabia|Persian Gulf Coast (Al-Bahrain)]].

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.<ref>See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref><ref name=\"L.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]], and the [[Fatimids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] of Egypt.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia] retrieved 18 January 2011</ref>\n\n[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|See: list of territories]])]]\n===Modern history===\n\nThe provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in [[Syria (region)|Syria]], which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon ([[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate]]).

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.<ref>See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref><ref name=\"L.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.

The film has [[Rahul Bose]], [[Shekhar Kapur]], [[Pooja Kumar]], [[Andrea Jeremiah]] and [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] in supporting roles. Filmed simultaneously in two languages: [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]], the film features a soundtrack composed by [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]], with the Tamil lyrics written by [[Vairamuthu]] and Haasan himself, while [[Javed Akhtar]] translated them for the Hindi version.\n\nDevelopment of the project began after the release of Haasan's ''[[Manmadhan Ambu]]'' (2010) when several of the crew were brought in from the United States to lend their technical expertise. The direction was taken over by [[Kamal Haasan]] from [[Selvaraghavan]] and reports indicating a comparison with several [[English film]]s surfaced during the production. The first teaser was revealed in April 2012 and first theatrical trailer was revealed in June 2012. ''Vishwaroopam'' is the first Indian film to utilise the new [[Auro 3D]] sound technology. The film was also to be the first Indian film to release via [[direct-broadcast satellite]], also known as direct-to-home (DTH), but after [[Controversies related to Vishwaroopam#Direct-to-home release|protests of theatre owners]] this plan was dropped.\n\nThe film released worldwide, excluding [[Tamil Nadu]], on 25 January 2013 while the Hindi version was released on 1 February 2013. Legal controversies, regarding the film's plot of [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian intelligence service]]'s participation in the [[War on Terror]], arose as several Muslim civic organisations protested the film's release in Tamil Nadu, resulting in an official ban being imposed on the film in the state for 15 days by the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The ban resulted in similar decisions in major overseas markets like [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Singapore]] while release was delayed in the [[south India]]n states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]].\n\nDespite the fragmented release, ''Vishwaroopam'' garnered positive reviews and, at the time of its release, was the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films#Tamil (Kollywood)|second highest-grossing Tamil film]] of all time (as of 2018, it ranks seventh). Heeding the requests of Muslim civic organisations, controversial scenes were muted or morphed, allowing the film to be released on 8 February 2013 in Tamil Nadu. The film was honoured with awards for [[National Film Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[National Film Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] at the [[60th National Film Awards]].<ref name=\"60thaward\">{{cite press_release|title=60th National Film Awards Announced|url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2013/mar/d2013031801.pdf|publisher=Press Information Bureau (PIB), India|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> A sequel to the film, ''[[Vishwaroopam II]]'', released on 10 August 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmibeat.com/bollywood/movies/vishwaroop-2.html|title=Vishwaroop 2|publisher=Filmibeat}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in a rundown pigeon shop in New York City where an old man feeds them. He then sends one pigeon away. It flies high and lands in a skyscraper off the office window of a [[psychology|psychologist]] who is conducting a session with her client Nirupama ([[Pooja Kumar]]), a nuclear [[oncology|oncologist]] who begins to confide that hers was a marriage of convenience that provided a safe haven for pursuing her PhD in the US for past three years and that her husband Vishwanath alias Viz ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is a middle-aged [[Kathak]] teacher. She is also put off by Viz's effeminate bearing and is attracted to her boss, Deepankar ([[Samrat Chakrabarti]]). Doubting whether her husband has secrets of his own, she hires a [[private investigator]] to tail him to probe grounds for divorce. She learns from the private investigator that Viz is a [[Muslim]]. In a sudden turn of events, the investigator is killed in a seaside warehouse by Farukh (Mukhtar Khan), a prominent member of the cell led by Omar Qureshi ([[Rahul Bose]]). A diary on him gives away Nirupama and the group led by Farukh nabs the couple. Deepankar is later killed by Farukh's men.\n\nViz surprises Nirupama by having a fight with Farukh's men. He then kills Farukh and his men at the warehouse and escapes with Nirupama. Omar and Viz have a past, one that takes the story back to circa 2002, to the [[Al-Qaeda]] training camps in [[Durand line|Afghanistan-Pakistan border]]. Viz's real name was Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri. He claims to be a Tamil Jihadi in [[Kashmir]], wanted by the Indian Army, with a reward of {{INR}} 500,000 on his head. Omar accepts him into his team and drives him off to Afghanistan. Wisam becomes a trainer to the [[Al-Qaeda]] Jihadi's and also a family friend to Omar. One day, Omar tells Wisam that American prisoners of war are still alive, incarcerated and shifted each fortnight. He orders his deputy Salim ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]) to behead the Captain and capture it on video. The next day, Salim tells Wisam that a new tall guest is expected in the town. Wisam later that night sees [[Osama bin Laden]] ([[Naren Weiss]]) greeting the Al Qaeda chieftains in a cave. Then, a joint US-led air force begins a bombing raid on the town. Omar begins to doubt that there is an informer in the team but mistakenly orders lynching of an innocent man. What follows is a maze of events that go back and forth in time, unravelling a plot where in the [[Sleeper agent|sleeper agents]] are scraping [[cesium]] from oncological equipment to build and trigger a [[dirty bomb]] in New York City.\n\nNirupama is stunned to discover the true identity of Viz, his \"uncle\" Colonel Jagannathan ([[Shekhar Kapur]]), British \"friend\" Dr. Dawkins ([[Miles Anderson]]), and the young \"dancer\" Ashmita ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]). Viz later reveals that he has a lot of emotional baggage and that he had executed many militants, including Nassar ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]), Omar's boss. His mission is to bust the ''sleeper-cell'' of Al Qaeda in the US, which is planning to divert the attention through \"capsules\" capable of emitting mild nuclear radiation tied to pigeons while enabling Abbasi, a Nigerian suicide bomber to detonate the cesium dirty bomb in the city.\n\nTogether, the Wisam team tries to counter Omar's plans. In the ensuing events, Wisam is arrested by the [[FBI]] before being rescued by Jagannath, and Dawkins is murdered by Salim while picking up a video tape from an antique shop. The FBI later releases Wisam after a call from the Indian embassy and [[Prime Minister of India]], where the true identity of Wizam is revealed as an agent of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), India. Wisam along with the FBI, takes down Abbasi and defuses the cesium bomb with the help of Nirupama by using a microwave oven as a [[Faraday cage]] to avoid incoming calls from any mobile phone. Omar and Salim try to escape in a plane. Omar tries to activate a bomb through his phone but fails. He then calls Abbasi, but the call is answered by Wisam, who tells him that Abbasi is not alive. Omar is shocked to hear this but escapes with Salim in his plane. The film ends with Wisam indicating that he would now go after Omar, alluding to [[Vishwaroopam 2|a sequel]] set in India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Vishwanath (Wiz) / Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri\n* [[Rahul Bose]] as Omar Qureshi\n* [[Shekhar Kapur]] as Colonel Jagannathan\n* [[Pooja Kumar]] as Nirupama Wisam aka Nirupama Vishwanath (Voice over by actress [[Abhirami]])\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Ashmita Subramaniam\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Salim\n* [[Samrat Chakrabarti]] as Deepak Chatterjee\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Nassar, Omar's boss\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Miles Anderson]] as Dr. Dawkins\n* [[Naren Weiss]] (as Nareen) as [[Osama bin Laden]]\n* Mukhtar Khan as Farukh\n* James Babson as Tom Black\n* Jude S.

The film has [[Rahul Bose]], [[Shekhar Kapur]], [[Pooja Kumar]], [[Andrea Jeremiah]] and [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] in supporting roles. Filmed simultaneously in two languages: [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]], the film features a soundtrack composed by [[Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy]], with the Tamil lyrics written by [[Vairamuthu]] and Haasan himself, while [[Javed Akhtar]] translated them for the Hindi version.\n\nDevelopment of the project began after the release of Haasan's ''[[Manmadhan Ambu]]'' (2010) when several of the crew were brought in from the United States to lend their technical expertise. The direction was taken over by [[Kamal Haasan]] from [[Selvaraghavan]] and reports indicating a comparison with several [[English film]]s surfaced during the production. The first teaser was revealed in April 2012 and first theatrical trailer was revealed in June 2012. ''Vishwaroopam'' is the first Indian film to utilise the new [[Auro 3D]] sound technology. The film was also to be the first Indian film to release via [[direct-broadcast satellite]], also known as direct-to-home (DTH), but after [[Controversies related to Vishwaroopam#Direct-to-home release|protests of theatre owners]] this plan was dropped.\n\nThe film released worldwide, excluding [[Tamil Nadu]], on 25 January 2013 while the Hindi version was released on 1 February 2013. Legal controversies, regarding the film's plot of [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian intelligence service]]'s participation in the [[War on Terror]], arose as several Muslim civic organisations protested the film's release in Tamil Nadu, resulting in an official ban being imposed on the film in the state for 15 days by the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]]. The ban resulted in similar decisions in major overseas markets like [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Singapore]] while release was delayed in the [[south India]]n states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]].\n\nDespite the fragmented release, ''Vishwaroopam'' garnered positive reviews and, at the time of its release, was the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films#Tamil (Kollywood)|second highest-grossing Tamil film]] of all time (as of 2018, it ranks seventh). Heeding the requests of Muslim civic organisations, controversial scenes were muted or morphed, allowing the film to be released on 8 February 2013 in Tamil Nadu. The film was honoured with awards for [[National Film Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]] and [[National Film Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] at the [[60th National Film Awards]].<ref name=\"60thaward\">{{cite press_release|title=60th National Film Awards Announced|url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2013/mar/d2013031801.pdf|publisher=Press Information Bureau (PIB), India|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> A sequel to the film, ''[[Vishwaroopam II]]'', released on 10 August 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.filmibeat.com/bollywood/movies/vishwaroop-2.html|title=Vishwaroop 2|publisher=Filmibeat}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens in a rundown [[pigeon]] shop in [[New York City]] where an old man feeds them. He then sends one pigeon away. It flies high and lands in a [[skyscraper]] off the office window of a [[psychology|psychologist]] who is conducting a session with her client Nirupama ([[Pooja Kumar]]), a nuclear [[oncology|oncologist]] who begins to confide that hers was a marriage of convenience that provided a safe haven for pursuing her [[PhD]] in the US for past three years and that her husband Vishwanath alias Viz ([[Kamal Haasan]]) is a middle-aged [[Kathak]] teacher. She is also put off by Viz's effeminate bearing and is attracted to her boss, Deepankar ([[Samrat Chakrabarti]]). Doubting whether her husband has secrets of his own, she hires a [[private investigator]] to tail him to probe grounds for [[divorce]]. She learns from the private investigator that Viz is a [[Muslim]]. In a sudden turn of events, the investigator is killed in a seaside [[warehouse]] by Farukh (Mukhtar Khan), a prominent member of the cell led by Omar Qureshi ([[Rahul Bose]]). A diary on him gives away Nirupama and the group led by Farukh nabs the couple. Deepankar is later killed by Farukh's men.\n\nViz surprises Nirupama by having a fight with Farukh's men. He then kills Farukh and his men at the warehouse and escapes with Nirupama. Omar and Viz have a past, one that takes the story back to circa 2002, to the [[Al-Qaeda]] training camps in [[Durand line|Afghanistan-Pakistan border]]. Viz's real name was Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri. He claims to be a Tamil Jihadi in [[Kashmir]], wanted by the [[Indian Army]], with a reward of {{INR}} 500,000 on his head. Omar accepts him into his team and drives him off to Afghanistan. Wisam becomes a trainer to the [[Al-Qaeda]] Jihadi's and also a family friend to Omar. One day, Omar tells Wisam that American [[prisoners of war]] are still alive, incarcerated and shifted each fortnight. He orders his deputy Salim ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]) to behead the Captain and capture it on video. The next day, Salim tells Wisam that a new tall guest is expected in the town. Wisam later that night sees [[Osama bin Laden]] ([[Naren Weiss]]) greeting the Al Qaeda chieftains in a cave. Then, a joint US-led air force begins a [[bombing raid]] on the town. Omar begins to doubt that there is an informer in the team but mistakenly orders lynching of an innocent man. What follows is a maze of events that go back and forth in time, unravelling a plot where in the [[Sleeper agent|sleepers]] are scraping [[cesium]] from oncological equipment to build and trigger a [[dirty bomb]] in [[New York City]].\n\nNirupama is stunned to discover the true identity of Viz, his \"uncle\" [[Colonel]] Jagannathan ([[Shekhar Kapur]]), British \"friend\" Dr. Dawkins ([[Miles Anderson]]), and the young \"dancer\" Ashmita ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]). Viz later reveals that he has a lot of emotional baggage and that he had executed many militants, including Nassar ([[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]), Omar's boss. His mission is to bust the ''sleeper-cell'' of Al Qaeda in the US, which is planning to divert the attention through \"capsules\" capable of emitting mild [[nuclear radiation]] tied to pigeons while enabling Abbasi, a [[Nigeria]]n suicide bomber to detonate the cesium dirty bomb in the city.\n\nTogether, the Wisam team tries to counter Omar's plans. In the ensuing events, Wisam is arrested by the [[FBI]] before being rescued by Jagannath, and Dawkins is murdered by Salim while picking up a video tape from an antique shop. The FBI later releases Wisam after a call from the Indian embassy and [[Prime Minister of India]], where the true identity of Wizam is revealed as an agent of [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), India. Wisam along with the FBI, takes down Abbasi and defuses the cesium bomb with the help of Nirupama by using a microwave oven as a [[Faraday cage]] to avoid incoming calls from any mobile phone. Omar and Salim try to escape in a plane. Omar tries to activate a bomb through his phone but fails. He then calls Abbasi, but the call is answered by Wisam, who tells him that Abbasi is not alive. Omar is shocked to hear this but escapes with Salim in his plane. The film ends with Wisam indicating that he would now go after Omar, alluding to [[Vishwaroopam 2|a sequel]] set in India.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Vishwanath (Wiz) / Wisam Ahmad Kashmiri\n* [[Rahul Bose]] as Omar Qureshi\n* [[Shekhar Kapur]] as Colonel Jagannathan\n* [[Pooja Kumar]] as Nirupama Wisam aka Nirupama Vishwanath (Voice over by actress [[Abhirami]])\n* [[Andrea Jeremiah]] as Ashmita Subramaniam\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Salim\n* [[Samrat Chakrabarti]] as Deepak Chatterjee\n* [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]] as Nassar, Omar's boss\n* [[Zarina Wahab]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Miles Anderson]] as Dr. Dawkins\n* [[Naren Weiss]] (as Nareen) as [[Osama bin Laden]]\n* Mukhtar Khan as Farukh\n* James Babson as Tom Black\n* Jude S.
