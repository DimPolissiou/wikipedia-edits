None the less the default SDR mode at up to 12.5 Mbit/s is a major speed/capacity improvement over I2C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://resources.mipi.org/blog/mipi-alliance-delivers-new-i3c-basic-specification|title=MIPI Alliance Delivers New I3C Basic Specification|last=Group|first=Ken Foust, Chair of the MIPI I3C Working Group and MIPI I3C Basic Ad Hoc Working|website=resources.mipi.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== I3C V1.1 ===\nPublished in December of 2019, this specification is only available to MIPI member.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n=== Signal Pins ===\nI3C uses two signal pins on referred to as '''SCL''' and '''SDA'''.  In legacy and SDR modes, these signals are used in a way very similarly to I2C:\n\n* SCL is a conventional digital [[clock signal]], driven with a [[Push\u2013pull output|push-pull output]] by the bus current master during data transfers.   In transactions involving legacy slave devices, this clock signal generally has a [[duty cycle]], of approximately 50%, but in transactions with known I3C slaves, the bus master may switch to a higher frequency by altering the duty cycle to one where the SCL high period is limited to no more than 40 ns.   \n* SDA is carries the serial data stream, which may be driven by either master or slave, but is driven at a rate determined by the master's SCL signal.   For compatibility with the I2C protocol, SDA is initially driven with [[Open collector|open-drain outputs]], which limits the transmission speed.  For transactions involving a I3C slave, the SDA driver mode switches to push-pull after receiving some of the first bits in a packet, allowing substantial speed improvements.   This medium-speed feature is called standard data rate (SDR) mode\n\n=== Framing ===\nAll communications in I2C and I3C requires [[Frame (networking)|framing]] for synchronization.   Within a frame, changes on the SDA line should always occur while SCL is in the low state, so that SDA can be considered stable on the low-to-high transition of SCL.   Violations of this general rule are used for framing (at least in legacy and standard data rate modes.\n\nBetween data frames, the bus master holds SCL high, in effect stopping the clock, and SDA drivers are in a high-impedance state, permitting a pull-up resister to float it to high.   A high-to-low transition of SDA, while SCL his high, is known as a START symbol, and signals the beginning a new data frame.   A low-to-high transition on SDA, while SCL is high, is the STOP symbol, ending a data frame.\n\nIn I2C, the START symbol is usually generated by a bus master, but in I3C, even slave devices can pull SDA low to indicate they want to start a frame.   This is used to implement some advanced I3C features, such as in-band interrupts, and hot-joins.    After the start, the bus master restarts the clock by driving SCL, and begins the bus arbitration process.\n\n=== Bus Arbitration ===\nAt the start of a frame, several devices may contend for use of the bus, and the bus arbitration process serves to to select what device to service next.   In both I2C and I3C, bus arbitration is done based on the device's address, where devices with the lowest address have higher priority.    It is done with the SDA line in open-drain mode, which allows devices transmitting a binary 0 (low) to override devices signaling a binary 1.  Contending devices monitor the SDA line while driving it in open-drain mode.  If they detect a situation where SDA is low at a time their address required it to be high, they know they have lost the bus arbitration, and must cease their contention until the next frame begins.\n\n== Device classes ==\nOn an I3C bus in its default (SDR) mode, four different classes of devices can be supported:\n* I3C Main Master\n* I3C Secondary Master\n* I3C Slave\n* I2C Slave (legacy devices)\n\n== High Data Rate (HDR) options ==\nI3C Buses always initialize in SDR mode. To enter HDR mode, the I3C master issues an \"Enter HDR\" CCC Broadcast command which tells all I3C slaves that \nthe bus is in HDR mode. I3C slaves which do not support HDR have told that to the master and can ignore that command.\nI3C slaves which do not support HDR need to have an \"HDR exit\" detector which informs when it is time to listen to the bus again.\n\nHDR modes operate in either Double Data Rate (DDR) or Ternary Symbol modes.  These modes can only be on buses under one of two limited configurations:\n* A Pure I3C Bus \u2013 no I2C devices on the bus\n* A Mixed Fast Bus \u2013 Where I2C devices on the bus are equipped with a 50&nbsp;ns Spike Filter\n\nThere are three possible HDR modes:\n* HDR-DDR Double Data Rate \u2013 Data transfers on both clock edges, permitting throughput up to 20 Mbit/s (25 Mbit/s raw bit rate) \n* HDR-TSP Ternary Symbol for Pure Bus \u2013 Increases throughput by using both SDA and SCL wires for data.  Not allowed on mixed I2C\u2013I3C bus.\n* HDR-TSL Ternary Symbol for Legacy Bus \u2013 Permits buses including I2C devices (with a spike filter) to operate at higher speeds.\n\n== I2C features not supported in I3C ==\n* Pull-up resistors are provided by the I3C master. External pull-up resistor are no longer needed.\n* Clock Stretching \u2013 devices are expected to be fast enough to operate at bus speed. The I3C master is the sole clock source.\n* I2C Extended (10-bit) Addresses.  All devices on an I3C bus are addressed by a 7-bit address.  Native I3C devices have a unique 48-bit address which is used only during dynamic address assignments.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mipi.org/specifications/i3c%E2%84%A0-sensor-specification MIPI I3C]\n\n{{Computer-bus|collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I2c}}\n[[Category:Serial buses]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox connector <!-- NOTE: Not a perfect template match, but good enough for now -->\n|name               = I3C\n|type               = [[Bus (computing)|Bus]]\n|URL                = \n|image              =\n|logo               = [[File:I3C.png|frameless|Venn Diagram of I3C Heritage]]\n|caption            = \n|designer           = [[MIPI Alliance]]<br/>Sensor Working Group\n|design_date        = {{Start date and age|2016}}\n|manufacturer       = multiple\n|key_people         = Ken Foust, Intel Corporation; Satwant Singh, Lattice Semiconductor\n|production_date    =  \n|preceded_by        = [[I\u00b2C]]\n|superseded         = \n|superseded_by      =\n|superseded_by_date =\n|external           = \n|hotplug            = true\n|length             = \n|width              = \n|height             = \n|electrical         = [[CMOS]]\n|ground             = \n|maximum_voltage    = \n|maximum_current    = \n|data_signal        = [[Open drain|Open-drain or Push/Pull]]\n|data_bit_width     = 2 wires [data + clock]\n|data_bandwidth     = 12.5&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(SDR, standard),\n25&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(DDR),\n33&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(ternary),\n<br/>'''legacy I\u00b2C rates'''<br/>\n400&nbsp;[[Kilobit|Kbits/s]]&nbsp;(FM),\n1&nbsp;[[Megabit|Mbit/s]]&nbsp;(FM+)\n|data_devices       = \n|data_style         = [[Serial communication|Serial]], [[half-duplex]]\n|cable              = \n|physical_connector = \n|num_pins           = \n|pinout_col1_name   =\n|pinout_col2_name   =\n|pinout_image       = \n|pinout_caption     = \n|pinout_notes       =\n}}\n\n'''I3C''' (also known as '''SenseWire''') is a [[specifications|specification]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mipi.org/specifications/i3c-sensor-specification|title=MIPI I3C and I3C Basic|website=mipi.org}}</ref> to enable communication between [[Integrated_circuit|computer chips]] by defining the electrical connection between the chips and signaling patterns to be used.

None the less the default SDR mode at up to 12.5 Mbit/s is a major speed/capacity improvement over I2C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://resources.mipi.org/blog/mipi-alliance-delivers-new-i3c-basic-specification|title=MIPI Alliance Delivers New I3C Basic Specification|last=Group|first=Ken Foust, Chair of the MIPI I3C Working Group and MIPI I3C Basic Ad Hoc Working|website=resources.mipi.org|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== I3C V1.1 ===\nPublished in December of 2019, this specification is only available to MIPI member.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n=== Signal Pins ===\nI3C uses two signal pins on referred to as '''SCL''' and '''SDA'''.  In legacy and SDR modes, these signals are used in a way very similarly to I2C:\n\n* SCL is a conventional digital [[clock signal]], driven with a [[Push\u2013pull output|push-pull output]] by the bus current master during data transfers.   In transactions involving legacy slave devices, this clock signal generally has a [[duty cycle]], of approximately 50%, but in transactions with known I3C slaves, the bus master may switch to a higher frequency by altering the duty cycle to one where the SCL high period is limited to no more than 40 ns.   \n* SDA is carries the serial data stream, which may be driven by either master or slave, but is driven at a rate determined by the master's SCL signal.   For compatibility with the I2C protocol, SDA is initially driven with [[Open collector|open-drain outputs]], which limits the transmission speed.  For transactions involving a I3C slave, the SDA driver mode switches to push-pull after receiving some of the first bits in a packet, allowing substantial speed improvements.   This medium-speed feature is called standard data rate (SDR) mode\n\n=== Framing ===\nAll communications in I2C and I3C requires [[Frame (networking)|framing]] for synchronization.   Within a frame, changes on the SDA line should always occur while SCL is in the low state, so that SDA can be considered stable on the low-to-high transition of SCL.   Violations of this general rule are used for framing (at least in legacy and standard data rate modes.\n\nBetween data frames, the bus master holds SCL high, in effect stopping the clock, and SDA drivers are in a high-impedance state, permitting a pull-up resister to float it to high.   A high-to-low transition of SDA, while SCL his high, is known as a START symbol, and signals the beginning a new data frame.   A low-to-high transition on SDA, while SCL is high, is the STOP symbol, ending a data frame.\n\nIn I2C, the START symbol is usually generated by a bus master, but in I3C, even slave devices can pull SDA low to indicate they want to start a frame.   This is used to implement some advanced I3C features, such as in-band interrupts, and hot-joins.    After the start, the bus master restarts the clock by driving SCL, and begins the bus arbitration process.\n\n=== Bus Arbitration ===\nAt the start of a frame, several devices may contend for use of the bus, and the bus arbitration process serves to to select what device to service next.   In both I2C and I3C, bus arbitration is done based on the device's address, where devices with the lowest address have higher priority.    It is done with the SDA line in open-drain mode, which allows devices transmitting a binary 0 (low) to override devices signaling a binary 1.  Contending devices monitor the SDA line while driving it in open-drain mode.  If they detect a situation where SDA is low at a time their address required it to be high, they know they have lost the bus arbitration, and must cease their contention until the next frame begins.\n\n== Device classes ==\nOn an I3C bus in its default (SDR) mode, four different classes of devices can be supported:\n* I3C Main Master\n* I3C Secondary Master\n* I3C Slave\n* I2C Slave (legacy devices)\n\n== High Data Rate (HDR) options ==\nI3C Buses always initialize in SDR mode. To enter HDR mode, the I3C master issues an \"Enter HDR\" CCC Broadcast command which tells all I3C slaves that \nthe bus is in HDR mode. I3C slaves which do not support HDR have told that to the master and can ignore that command.\nI3C slaves which do not support HDR need to have an \"HDR exit\" detector which informs when it is time to listen to the bus again.\n\nHDR modes operate in either Double Data Rate (DDR) or Ternary Symbol modes.  These modes can only be on buses under one of two limited configurations:\n* A Pure I3C Bus \u2013 no I2C devices on the bus\n* A Mixed Fast Bus \u2013 Where I2C devices on the bus are equipped with a 50&nbsp;ns Spike Filter\n\nThere are three possible HDR modes:\n* HDR-DDR Double Data Rate \u2013 Data transfers on both clock edges, permitting throughput up to 20 Mbit/s (25 Mbit/s raw bit rate) \n* HDR-TSP Ternary Symbol for Pure Bus \u2013 Increases throughput by using both SDA and SCL wires for data.  Not allowed on mixed I2C\u2013I3C bus.\n* HDR-TSL Ternary Symbol for Legacy Bus \u2013 Permits buses including I2C devices (with a spike filter) to operate at higher speeds.\n\n== I2C features not supported in I3C ==\n* Pull-up resistors are provided by the I3C master. External pull-up resistor are no longer needed.\n* Clock Stretching \u2013 devices are expected to be fast enough to operate at bus speed. The I3C master is the sole clock source.\n* I2C Extended (10-bit) Addresses.  All devices on an I3C bus are addressed by a 7-bit address.  Native I3C devices have a unique 48-bit address which is used only during dynamic address assignments.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mipi.org/specifications/i3c%E2%84%A0-sensor-specification MIPI I3C]\n\n{{Computer-bus|collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I2c}}\n[[Category:Serial buses]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I3C_(bus)"}

The cooking of [[Istanbul]], [[Bursa]], [[Izmir]], and rest of the [[Asia Minor]] region inherits many elements of [[Ottoman court]] [[cuisine]], with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over [[bulgur]], [[kofte]]s and a wider availability of vegetable stews (''t\u00fcrl\u00fc''), [[eggplant]], stuffed [[dolma]]s and fish. The cuisine of the [[Black Sea Region]] uses fish extensively, especially the [[European anchovy|Black Sea anchovy]] (''hamsi'') and includes [[maize]] dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. [[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]], and [[Adana]]) is famous for its variety of [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''[[\u015f\u00f6biyet]]'', ''[[Kanafeh|kaday\u0131f]]'', and ''[[k\u00fcnefe]]''.\n\nEspecially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref name=\"multiple\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |title=Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones |access-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429005226/http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. [[Central Anatolia]] has many famous specialties, such as ''[[ke\u015fkek]]'', ''[[mant\u0131]]'' (especially from [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[g\u00f6zleme]]''. Food names directly cognate with ''mant\u0131'' are found also in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (''[[mantou]]'' or steamed bun) and [[Korean cuisine]] (''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]''). In fact, origin of Turkish mant\u0131 comes from Chinese mantou\n\nA specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between ''Urfa kebap'' and ''[[Adana kebap]]'' is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. ''Urfa kebap'' is less spicy and thicker than ''Adana kebap''. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are the mainstay in Turkish cuisine as presented in foreign countries, native Turkish meals largely center around [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[bread]].\n\n== Culinary customs ==\n\n=== Breakfast ===\n[[File:Simit-2x.JPG|thumb|right|[[Simit]], a circular bread with sesame seeds, is a common breakfast item in Turkey.]]\n\nTurks usually prefer a rich breakfast. A typical Turkish [[breakfast]] consists of cheese (''[[beyaz peynir]]'', ''[[ka\u015far]]'' etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and [[kaymak]], [[Sujuk|sucuk]] (a spicy Turkish food similar to sausages), ''[[past\u0131rma]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'', ''[[simit]]'', ''[[po\u011fa\u00e7a]]'' and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called [[Menemen (food)|menemen]], which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion,  olive oil and eggs. Invariably, [[Turkish tea]] is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, ''kahvalt\u0131'', means \"before coffee\".\n\n=== Homemade food ===\nHomemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out; Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables (olive oil or with grounded meat), meat or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or [[Mincing|minced]] meat), often with or before rice, pasta or [[bulgur]] [[pilav]] accompanied by a salad or [[cac\u0131k]] (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (''[[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131]] yemekler'') instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n[[File:Akcaabatkofte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ak\u00e7aabat meatballs]].]]\nAlthough fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey, Turkish people still rely primarily on the rich and extensive dishes of Turkish cuisine. In addition, some traditional Turkish foods, especially ''[[Kofta|k\u00f6fte]]'', ''[[Doner kebab|d\u00f6ner]]'', ''[[kokore\u00e7]]'', ''[[kumpir]]'' ''midye tava'' ''b\u00f6rek'' and ''g\u00f6zleme'', are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whiting | first=Dominic |year=2000 |title=Turkey Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Cz4zG73sHgC&pg=PA56&dq=lokanta |publisher=Footprint Handbooks |page=56 |isbn=978-1-900949-85-9 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> ''Esnaf lokantas\u0131'' (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.\n\n=== Summer cuisine ===\nIn the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as eggplant (aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] and [[\u00e7\u0131lb\u0131r]] are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer ''summer helva'', which is lighter and less sweet than the regular one.\n\n=== Key ingredients ===\nFrequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include: lamb, beef, rice, fish, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper|green peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[zucchini]]s and [[tomato]]es. Nuts, especially [[pistachio]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[walnut]]s, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. [[Semolina]] flour is used to make a cake called [[Basbousa|''revani'']] and [[Halva|''irmik helvasi'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+Commonly used spices and flavorings:\n!Name\n!Turkish\n!Used in\n!References\n|-\n|[[Allspice]]\n|''Yenibahar'' or ''Dolma bahar''\n|[[Dolma]], vegetables, pilav, fish, k\u00f6fte\n|<ref name=akin>{{Cite book| publisher = Abrams| isbn = 978-1-61312-871-8| last = Akin| first = Engin| title = Essential Turkish Cuisine| date = 2015-10-06}}</ref><ref name=basan>{{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-15617-6| last = Basan| first = Ghillie| title = Classic Turkish Cooking| date = 1997-04-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Anise]]\n|''Anason''\n|[[Peksimet]], [[rak\u0131]], used to season nut and dried fruit mixtures in both sweet and savory dishes\n|<ref name=akin /><ref name=basan />\n|-\n|[[Black pepper]]\n|''Kara biber''\n|egg dishes, meat dishes, [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]]\n|<ref name=akin />\n|-\n|[[Cardamom]]\n|''Kakule''\n|Rarely used, mostly in coffee.

[[Beyaz peynir]] and [[yo\u011furt]] are part of many dishes including [[b\u00f6rek]], [[manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[kebab]] and [[cac\u0131k]].\n\n=== Oils and fats ===\n[[Butter]] or [[margarine]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[canola oil]], and [[corn oil]] are widely used for cooking. [[Sesame]], [[hazelnut]], [[peanut]] and [[walnut]] oils are used as well. ''Kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131'' ([[tail fat]] of [[sheep]]) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe rich and diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman Cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. [[Plum]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s, along with many kinds of [[citrus]] are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, ''[[compote|komposto]]'' (compote) or ''[[ho\u015faf]]'' (from Persian ''khosh \u00e2b'', literally meaning \"nice water\") are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. ''[[Dolma]]'' and pilaf usually contain currants or raisins. ''Etli yaprak sarma'' (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.\n\n[[Image:\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131 with b\u00f6rek.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131]] with Borek]]\nEggplant ({{lang-tr|patl\u0131can}}) has a special place in the Turkish cuisine.\n\n=== Meats ===\n\nIn some regions, meat, which was mostly eaten only at wedding ceremonies or during the ''Kurban Bayram\u0131'' (''[[Eid ul-Adha]]'') as ''etli pilav'' ([[pilav]] with meat), has become part of the daily diet since the introduction of industrial production. [[Veal]], formerly shunned, is now widely consumed.\n\nThe main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and [[vegetable]], with names such as ''[[k\u0131ymal\u0131]] fasulye'' (beans with ground meat) or ''k\u0131ymal\u0131 \u0131spanak'' (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with [[yo\u011furt]]).\n\nAlternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as ''sardalya'' (sardines) or ''hamsi'' (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed [[Domestic sheep|lambs]], once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. ''Kuzu \u00e7evirme'', cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.\n\n== Dishes and foods ==\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n[[File:Fresh ayran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Fresh Ayran with a head of foam]]\n\n[[Yo\u011furt]] is an important element in Turkish cuisine.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word ''yo\u011furt''. Yo\u011furt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, k\u00f6fte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat etc.), ''meze'' and a specialty called ''mant\u0131'' (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yo\u011furt is regularly eaten with [[pilav]] or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, ''s\u00fczme yo\u011furt'' or \"strained yogurt\", is made by straining the yo\u011furt curds from the [[whey]]. One of the most common Turkish drinks, ''[[ayran]]'', is made from yo\u011furt. Also, yo\u011furt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries.\n\n==== Cheeses ====\n[[File:Kaschkawal Kashkaval \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b Balkank\u00e4se Sofia IMG 7650.JPG|thumb|''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' cheese]]\n[[File:Otlu tulum peyniri.jpg|thumb|Varieties of ''[[Tulum cheese|tulum]]'': center \"Otlu tulum peyniri\", or Tulum with herbs, in [[Ankara]]]]\n\nTurkey produces many varieties of [[cheese]], mostly from [[domestic sheep|sheep]]'s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. There are 193 different cheeses in Turkey, but only 8 of these cheeses have geographical indication.<ref>https://www.goturkeytourism.com/things-to-do/10-awesome-turkish-cheeses-you-have-to-taste.html</ref>\n\n* ''[[Beyaz peynir]]'' is a salty [[brined cheese]] taking its name from its white color (\"white cheese\"). It is similar to ''[[feta]]'' but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region ([[Ezine, \u00c7anakkale|Ezine]] or [[Turkish Thrace|Thrace]]) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as ''[[Menemen (food)|menemen]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'' and ''[[Pita|pide]]''.\n* ''[[\u00c7erkez peyniri]]'', means \"[[Circassians|Circassian]] cheese\". It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.\n* ''[[\u00c7\u00f6kelek]]'' is dried [[cottage cheese]]. There are many regional varieties of ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek''. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun. \n* ''[[Kurut]]'' and ''ke\u015f'' are regional names for dried bricks of yogurt made from low-fat milk or from ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek'' made from buttermilk.<ref name=KCheese>{{Cite web| url=http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115070211/http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2013| title=Turkish Cheeses| accessdate=2007-12-07| date=2 June 2005}}</ref>\n* ''[[Kars gravyer cheese|Gravyer]]'' is produced in Turkey as well. Among others, [[Kars]] is famous for this type of cheese.\n* ''[[Hellim]]'' is a salty, firm-textured goat cheese, generally with some mint added, made in [[Northern Cyprus]]. In Turkey, it is common to fry ''hellim'' in a pan in some olive oil.\n* ''[[Ka\u015far]]'' is Turkey's other ubiquitous cheese, a moderately fatty sheep's cheese similar to the Greek ''[[kasseri]]'', sometimes marketed as \"Turkish cheddar\", being closer in consistency and taste to mild [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar-style cheese]] than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured ''ka\u015far'', called fresh ''ka\u015far'', is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular [[Kars]] and Thrace.\n* ''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep's cheese, similar to fresh ''ka\u015far''. The name comes from Romanian word ''ca\u0219caval'', which bears the Italian structure of ''caciocavallo''. \n* ''[[Lor (food)|Lor]]'' is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from ''ka\u015far'' or ''strained yogurt'' manufacture. ''Lor'' is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like \"ek\u015fimik\" and ''h\u00f6\u015fmerim''\n* ''[[Mihali\u00e7 Peyniri|Mihali\u00e7 peyniri]]'' or ''Kelle peyniri'' is a hard sheep's cheese that can be grated, like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihali\u00e7 during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pastorized milk and processed by salt.\n* ''[[Braided cheese|\u00d6rg\u00fc peyniri]]'', \"[[braided cheese]]\", is a specialty from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].\n* ''[[Van herbed cheese|Otlu peynir]]''[[Van herbed cheese]] (\"herbed cheese\") is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep's or goat's milk is used, but more recently cow's milk ''otlu peynir'' has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van [[Ramsons|wild garlic]] is traditional; Bitlis ''otlu peynir'' contains a damp-loving herb known as ''sof otu''. In other areas horse mint (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and ''[[Pimpinella rhodentha]]'' are used.<ref name=KCheese/>\n* ''[[Tulum (cheese)|Tulum]]'' is a mostly sheep's curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum. There are regional varieties of ''tulum peynir'' in such areas as \u0130zmir, \u00d6demi\u015f and Erzincan.<ref name=KCheese/> And each of tulum cheese have very different characteristics.\n\n=== Soups ===\nA Turkish meal usually starts with a thin [[soup]] (''\u00e7orba''). Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being; mercimek ([[lentil]]) \u00e7orbas\u0131, yogurt, or [[wheat]] (often mashed) called [[tarhana]] \u00e7orbas\u0131. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as [[\u0130\u015fkembe soup]] and [[pa\u00e7a]] \u00e7orbas\u0131, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal.

[[Su b\u00f6re\u011fi]], made with boiled [[yufka]]/[[phyllo]] layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. [[Cheburek|\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek]] (also known as ''Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi'') is fried and stuffed with minced meat.

[[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is a sweet type of b\u00f6rek, widespread in the [[Black Sea region]].\n\n[[Po\u011fa\u00e7a]] is the label name for dough based salty pastries.

The combination of meat-filled dough with yogurt differentiates it from other dumplings such as tortellini, ravioli, and Chinese wonton. Mant\u0131 is usually eaten as a main dish.

A large variety of vegetables are used, such as [[spinach]], [[leek]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[cabbage]], [[celery]], [[eggplant]], green and red [[bell pepper]]s, [[Green bean|string bean]] and [[jerusalem artichoke]]. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots saut\u00e9ed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or [[tomato paste]]. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish ''sulu yemek'' (literally \"a dish with juice\"). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil ''([[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131lar]])'' are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.\n\n[[Dolma]] is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (''biber dolmas\u0131''), eggplants, tomatoes, or [[zucchini]]/courgettes (''kabak dolmas\u0131''), vine leaves (''yaprak dolmas\u0131''). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or pilav mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (''[[enginar dolmas\u0131]]'') is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, pilav with spices or minced meat.\n\n[[Mercimek k\u00f6fte]], although being named k\u00f6fte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.\n\n[[Imam bayildi]] is a version of [[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]] with no minced meat inside. It can be served as a meze as well.\n\nFried eggplant and pepper is a common summer dish in Turkey. It is served with yo\u011furt or tomato sauce and garlic.\n\n[[M\u00fccver]] is prepared with grated squash/courgette or potatoes, egg, onion, dill or cheese and flour. It can be either fried or cooked in the oven.\n\n[[Pilav]] can be served either as a side dish or main dish but ''bulgur pilav\u0131'' (pilav made of boiled and pounded wheat - ''bulgur'') is also widely eaten. The dishes made with ''kuru fasulye'' ([[Common bean#White beans|white beans]]), ''nohut'' ([[chickpea]]s), ''mercimek'' ([[lentil]]s), ''b\u00f6r\u00fclce'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s), etc., combined with onion, vegetables, minced meat, tomato paste and rice, have always been common due to being economical and nutritious.\n\n[[Tur\u015fu]] is pickle made with brine, usually with the addition of garlic. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer. It is made with a large variety of vegetables, from cucumber to courgette. In the towns on the Aegean coast, the water of [[tur\u015fu]] is consumed as a drink. It comes from the Persian \"Torshi\", which refers to pickled \"Torsh\" (sour) vegetables.\n\n=== Egg dishes ===\n[[File:MenemenIstanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] (left) as part of a Turkish breakfast]]\n* [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] consists of scrambled eggs cooked in tomato, green pepper, and can be onion and garlic.\n* [[\u00c7\u0131lb\u0131r]] is another traditional Turkish food made with poached eggs, yogurt and oil.\n* ''Ispanakl\u0131 yumurta'' consists of eggs with spinach and onion.\n* Kaygana can be described as something of a cross between the pancake and the omelet in Ottoman cuisine. It used to be served with cheese, honey, crushed nuts, or eggplant. However, it is almost forgotten in the big cities of Turkey.\n\n=== Meze and salads ===\n[[File:Turkish Meze Plate.jpg|thumb|200px|A plate of Turkish meze]]\n[[Image:Cacik.jpg|thumb|200px|A bowl of [[Cac\u0131k]], the original form of seasoned, diluted [[yogurt]] with chopped cucumber, eaten throughout the former Ottoman world, under different names, like the [[tarator]] and [[tzatziki]] of the [[Balkans]].]]\n[[Image:Piyaz 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of piyaz]]\n[[Image:Kisir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of [[k\u0131s\u0131r]] decorated with green [[olive]] and [[cucumber]] pieces]]\n[[Image:Bira ve \u00e7oban salata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[\u00c7oban salatas\u0131]]]]\n\n[[Meze]] is a selection of food served as the appetizer course with or without drinks.

Dolma and sarma has a special place in Turkish Cuisine. It can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. It can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, it is usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is only vegan recipe it should only have olive oil rice or bulgur and some nuts and raisins inside especially blackcurrant.\n\n[[Zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 yaprak sarmas\u0131]] (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as ''[[sarma (food)|sarma]]'', which means \"wrapping\" in Turkish. [[Dried fruit]] such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten ''zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 dolma'' in Ottoman Cuisine. [[Vine leaves]] (''yaprak'') could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, ''[[etli yaprak sarma]]'', in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word ''sarma'' is also used for some types of desserts, such as [[f\u0131st\u0131k sarma]] (wrapped pistachio).\n\n[[Melon]] dolma along with [[quince]] or [[apple]] dolma was one of the palace's specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared. Although it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of dolma recipes, [[courgette]] (\"kabak\"), [[aubergine]] (\"patl\u0131can\"), [[tomato]] (\"domates\"), [[pumpkin]] (\"balkaba\u011f\u0131\"), [[Capsicum|pepper]] (\"biber\"), [[cabbage]] (\"lahana\") (black or white cabbage), [[chard]] (\"paz\u0131\") and [[mussel]] (\"midye\") dolma constitute the most common types. Instead of dried cherries in the Palace Cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil. A different type of dolma is [[mumbar]] dolmas\u0131, for which the membrane of intestines of sheep is filled up with a spicy rice pilav-nut mixture.\n\n=== Meat dishes ===\n[[Image:Karn\u0131yar\u0131k.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Karn\u0131yar\u0131k]]]]\n[[Image:Kokore\u00e7.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Kokore\u00e7]] cooking on a spit]]\n[[Image:Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in Espoo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A plate of Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in [[Tapiola]], [[Espoo]], Finland.]]\n* Consisted of chicken or lean veal, D\u00f6ner kebap is a common Turkish fast food.\n* Tantuni (similar to ''d\u00fcr\u00fcm'', meat cut in very small pieces, served with lavash, a specialty from the [[Mersin]] province of Turkey)\n* Kuzu g\u00fcve\u00e7 (lamb cooked in earthenware casserole)\n* Past\u0131rmal\u0131 [[kuru fasulye]] (white kidney bean stew with [[past\u0131rma]])\n* [[Kuzu kapama]] (spring lamb stewed)\n* Ha\u015flama (boiled lamb with vegetables and lemon juice)\n* [[Kavurma]] which means frying, roasting or parching in Turkish, is generally used for roasted lamb or a variety of fried meat dishes. \u00c7oban kavurma is a variety of it, prepared with diced lamb with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers and herbs.

[[Kad\u0131nbudu k\u00f6fte]] is another traditional speciality; minced meat is mixed with cooked rice and fried. [[I\u00e7li k\u00f6fte]] can be described as a shell of \"bulgur\" filled with onion, minced meat and nuts. [[\u00c7i\u011f k\u00f6fte]] is a meze from south-eastern Turkey meaning raw meatballs, prepared with \"bulgur\" and raw minced meat.

Instead of classical sausages (''sosis''), sucuk is the most used ingredient for snacks and fast-food style toasts and sandwiches in Turkey.\n* [[Past\u0131rma]] is another famous beef delicacy. Both past\u0131rma and sucuk can be put in [[kuru fasulye]] (dry beans) to enrich the aroma. Both can be served as a meze as well.

Fish are grilled, fried or cooked slowly by the ''bu\u011fulama'' (poaching) method. ''Bu\u011fulama'' is fish with lemon and parsley, covered while cooking so that it will be cooked with steam. The term ''pil\u00e2ki'' is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (\u00e7iroz), canned, salted or pickled (l\u00e2kerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey. Paz\u0131da Levrek is a seafood speciality which consists of [[European seabass|sea bass]] cooked in [[chard]] leaves. In fish restaurants, it is possible to find other fancy fish varieties like ''bal\u0131k dolma'' (stuffed fish), ''bal\u0131k iskender'' (inspired by [[\u0130skender kebap]]), fishballs or fish en papillote. [[Fish soup]] prepared with vegetables, onion and flour is common in coastal towns and cities. In [[Istanbul]]'s [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and other coastal districts, grilled fish served in bread with tomatoes, herbs and onion is a popular fast food. In the inner parts of Turkey, [[trout]] ''alabal\u0131k''  is common as it is the main type of freshwater fish. Popular seafood mezes at coastlines include stuffed mussels, fried [[mussel]] and fried ''kalamar'' ([[Squid (food)|squid]]) with [[tarator]] sauce.\n\nPopular sea fish in Turkey include:<ref>English names for fish from [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Penguin, 1972. {{ISBN|0-14-046174-4}}</ref> \n[[Image:Trachurus trachurus fish 7218 Nevit.JPG|thumb|Istavrit on display at a fish market]]\n* [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]] ''hamsi''\n* [[Sardine (food)|sardine]] ''sardalya''\n* [[bonito]] ''palamut''\n* [[gilt-head bream]] ''\u00e7upra'' or ''\u00e7ipura''\n* [[red mullet]] ''barbun(ya)''\n* [[sea bass]] ''levrek''\n* [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]] or ''bakalyaro''\n* [[haddock]] ''mezgit''\n* [[swordfish]] ''k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 bal\u0131g\u0131''\n* [[turbot]] ''kalkan''\n* [[Pagellus bellottii|red pandora]] ''mercan'' \n* [[Trachurus|Jack mackerel]] 'istavrit'\n* [[Epinephelus|white grouper]] ''lagos''\n* [[bluefish]] ''l\u00fcfer''\n\n=== Desserts ===\n{{see also|List of Turkish desserts}}\n[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|right|230px|[[Baklava]] is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes.]]\n[[Image:Firinda s\u00fctla\u00e7.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''S\u00fctla\u00e7'', or Turkish [[rice pudding]].]]\n[[File:T Honey.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Turkish delight]].]]\n[[File:Kazandibi.JPG|thumb|right|230px|\n[[Kazandibi]], means the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface.]]\n[[File:Wasserweltfest 2012 - T\u00fcrkische Mehlspeise.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[\u015eekerpare]].]]\nOne of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is [[baklava]]. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include [[\u015f\u00f6biyet]], [[b\u00fclb\u00fcl yuvas\u0131]], [[saray sarmas\u0131]], [[S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye|s\u00fctl\u00fc nuriye]], and [[sar\u0131 burma]].\n\n[[Kadaif]] ('Kaday\u0131f') is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of [[kadaif]]: tel (wire) or [[Burma (dessert)|Burma]] (wring) kaday\u0131f, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.\n\nAlthough carrying the label \"kaday\u0131f\", [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] is totally different from \"tel kaday\u0131f\". [[K\u00fcnefe]] and [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with [[kaymak]] (clotted/scrambled butter). K\u00fcnefe contains wire kaday\u0131f with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.\n\nAmong milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are [[muhallebi]], [[su muhallebisi]], [[s\u00fctla\u00e7]] (rice pudding), [[ke\u015fk\u00fcl]], [[kazandibi]] (meaning the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface), and [[tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc]] (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is [[haytal\u0131]], which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.\n\n[[Halva|Helva]] (halva): [[un helvas\u0131]] (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), [[irmik helvas\u0131]] (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), [[yaz helvas\u0131]] (made from walnut or almond<ref>Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131 - Sufi cuisine</ref>), [[tahin helvas\u0131]] (crushed sesame seeds), [[kos helva]], [[pi\u015fmaniye]] (floss halva).\n\nOther popular desserts include; [[Revani]] (with semolina and starch), [[\u015fekerpare]], [[kalburabasma]], [[dilber duda\u011f\u0131]], [[vezir parma\u011f\u0131]], [[han\u0131m g\u00f6be\u011fi]], [[Kemal Pasha dessert|kemalpa\u015fa]], [[tulumba]], [[zerde]], [[h\u00f6\u015fmerim]], [[paluze]], [[irmik tatl\u0131s\u0131/peltesi]], [[lokma]].\n\n[[G\u00fclla\u00e7]] is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with \"prayers\", as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.\n\n[[Ashure|A\u015fure]] can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on [[Noah's Ark]] and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking a\u015fure especially during the month of Muharrem.\n\nSome traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: ''ayva tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[quince]]), ''incir tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[Common fig|fig]]), ''kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''elma tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[apple]]) and ''armut tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pear]]). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and [[kaymak]].\n\nHomemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called [[kurabiye]] in Turkish. The most common types are [[ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi]] (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), [[un kurabiyesi]] (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is [[ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi]].\n\n[[Tahin-pekmez]] is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is [[tahini|sesame paste]] and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.\n\n[[Lokum]] ([[Turkish delight]]), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called \"rahat hulkum\" in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.\n\n[[Cezerye]], [[cevizli (walnut) sucuk]] (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as [[Churchkhela]] in Circassian region) and [[pestil]] (fruit pestils) are among other common sweets.\n\n[[Marzipan]] ''badem ezmesi'' or ''f\u0131st\u0131k ezmesi'' (made of ground pistachios) is another common confection in Turkey.\n\nAnother jelly like Turkish sweet is [[macun]]. [[Mesir macunu]] of [[Manisa]]/[[\u0130zmir]] (which was also called \"nevruziye\" as this macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that \"mesir macunu\" is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, [[nane macunu]] (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkap\u0131 under the control of the chief doctor \"hekimba\u015f\u0131\" and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of [[macun]] and [[Sharbat|sherbet]].<ref>Marianna Yerasimos, Ottoman cuisine</ref>\n\nThere are also several types of ice creams based on [[salep]] powder or [[Cornstarch]] with [[Rose water]] such as [[Dondurma]] (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.\n\nDried fruit, used in dolma, pilav, meat dishes and other desserts is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Figs, grapes, apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.\n\n''Kaymak'' (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.\n\n[[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee]], with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.\n\n=== Street food ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Mara\u015f dondurmas\u0131 in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Dondurma]]\n[[File:Macun in Turkey.jpg|thumb|Macun]]\n* [[Dondurma]]\n* fried mussels, stuffed mussels ''midye''\n* fresh walnuts ''taze ceviz''\n* g\u00f6zleme a very thin stuffed flat bred similar to [[paratha]], fillings can include any combination of spiced potato, feta, spinach and ground meat \n* kokore\u00e7\n* kumpir a baked potato served with ''ka\u015far'' cheese and many other toppings\n* [[lokma]]\n* roasted corn ''k\u00f6zde m\u0131s\u0131r''\n* roasted chesnuts ''kestane''\n* simit\n* [[Macun]]\n\n== Beverages ==\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey}}\n[[File:Turkish wine regions map.png|thumb|300px|Wine-producing regions in Turkey.]]\nAlthough the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are as widely available as anywhere. However, some Turks abstain from drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Rak\u0131]] (pronounced [\u027ea\u02c8k\u026f]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey. It is considered as the national alcoholic beverage of Turkey. There are a few local brands of [[lager]] such as Bomonti, Marmara34 and [[Efes Beverage Group|Efes Pilsen]] and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, [[Beck's]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg Brewery|Tuborg]].\n\nThere are a variety of local [[wine]]s produced by Turkish brands such as [[Sevilen group|Sevilen]], [[Kavakl\u0131dere (wine)|Kavakl\u0131dere]], Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, [[Pinot noir]], [[Adakaras\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Semillion]], [[Kuntra]], [[Gamay]], [[Cinsault]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Carignane]], [[\u00c7alkaras\u0131]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Alicante Bouschet]]; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, [[\u00d6k\u00fczg\u00f6z\u00fc]], [[Bo\u011fazkere]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Kalecik Karas\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]; in the Mediterranean Region, [[Sergi Karas\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Semillion]], [[Beylerce]], [[Yap\u0131ncak]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] and [[semillion]]; in the Black Sea Region, [[Narince (grape)|Narince]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Emir (grape)|Emir]], [[Hasandede]] (for further info http://www.hayyam.com/uzumler/index.php{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}). In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different \"home made\" wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/[[Cappadocia]] region - [[Nev\u015fehir]]), the Aegean coast ([[Sel\u00e7uk]] and [[Bozcaada]] (an island in the Aegean Sea)).\n\n=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===\n[[Image:Rize tea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Turkish tea]]]]\n[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Turkish coffee]]]]\nAt breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink [[black tea]] (''\u00e7ay''). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. [[Turkish coffee]] (''kahve'') is usually served after meals or with dessert.\n\n[[Ayran]] (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It's a mix of yogurt and water, similar to [[lassi]]. It may be served with salt, according to taste.\n\n[[\u015ealgam suyu]] (mild or spicy fermented red carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with [[rak\u0131]].\n\n[[Boza]] is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with [[leblebi]]).\n\n[[Sahlep]] is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.\n\n''Limonata'' (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called ''\u00e7\u0131lekl\u0131 l\u0131monata''.\n\n[[Sherbet (Middle Eastern drink)|Sherbet]] (Turkish ''\u015ferbet,'' pronounced {{IPA-tr|\u0283e\u027e\u02c8bet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, [[cornelian cherry]], pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices.  Sherbet is drunk diluted with cold water.\n\nIn classical Turkish cuisine, [[ho\u015faf]] (from the Persian \"Khosh-ab\", meaning \"fresh water\") alternatively accompanies meat dishes and ''pilav'' ([[pilaf]]).\n\n=== Related cuisines ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Greek cuisine]]\n* [[Albanian cuisine]]\n* [[Balkan cuisine]]\n* [[Central Asian cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]\n* [[Mongolian cuisine]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Caucasian cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food|Turkey}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baklava]]\n* [[Doner kebap]]\n* [[\u0130skender kebap]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* [[Kadaif]]\n* [[Kumpir]]\n* [[Mangal (barbecue)|Mangal]]\n* [[Manti (dumpling)|Mant\u0131]]\n* [[Meze]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]]\n* [[Turkish coffee]]\n* [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|Turkish rak\u0131]]\n* [[Turkish tea]]\n* [[List of stuffed dishes#Turkish stuffed dishes|Turkish stuffed dishes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Budak, S\u00fcheyl, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184656/http://www.nadirkitap.com/antakya-mutfagi-suheyl-budak-kitap3618320.html ''Antakya Mutfa\u011f\u0131''], Hatay 2008, {{oclc|705454123}} (1996 edition)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145106/http://blog.kitchenguerilla.com/2011/03/antakya-cuisine-with-suheyl-budak-and-75-ladies/?lang=en Antakya-cuisine with S\u00fcheyl Budak and 75 ladies]\n* G\u00fcrsoy, Deniz, ''Turkish Cuisine in Historical Perspective'', Istanbul, 2006, {{ISBN|975-329-564-2}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Konya Yemek K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc ve Konya Yemekleri'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-6021-16-0}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Sufi Cuisine'', Saqi 2005.\n* Lambraki, Mirsini & Ak\u0131n, Engin, ''Ayn\u0131 Sofrada \u0130ki \u00dclke, T\u00fcrk ve Yunan Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-458-484-2}}.\n* [[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''A New Book of Middle Eastern Food'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-046588-X}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Halk Mutfa\u011f\u0131m\u0131z Geleneksel Tatlar\u0131m\u0131zdan Se\u00e7meler'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-98180-2-7}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Turkish Cuisine'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-285-114-2}}\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & S\u00fct, Uyuyunca, ''T\u00fcrkiye Peynirleri'', Istanbul, {{ISBN|975-363-755-1}}.\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & Silivrim, Kaymak, ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin Yo\u011furtlar\u0131'', Istanbul 2007, {{ISBN|978-975-08-1276-7}}.\n* Yerasimos, Marianna, ''Osmanl\u0131 Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2002;

The cooking of [[Istanbul]], [[Bursa]], [[Izmir]], and rest of the [[Asia Minor]] region inherits many elements of [[Ottoman court]] [[cuisine]], with a lighter use of spices, a preference for rice over [[bulgur]], [[kofte]]s and a wider availability of vegetable stews (''t\u00fcrl\u00fc''), [[eggplant]], stuffed [[dolma]]s and fish. The cuisine of the [[Black Sea Region]] uses fish extensively, especially the [[European anchovy|Black Sea anchovy]] (''hamsi'') and includes [[maize]] dishes. The cuisine of the southeast (e.g. [[Urfa]], [[Gaziantep]], and [[Adana]]) is famous for its variety of [[kebab]]s, ''[[meze]]s'' and dough-based desserts such as ''[[baklava]]'', ''[[\u015f\u00f6biyet]]'', ''[[Kanafeh|kaday\u0131f]]'', and ''[[k\u00fcnefe]]''.\n\nEspecially in the western parts of Turkey, where olive trees grow abundantly, [[olive oil]] is the major type of oil used for cooking.<ref name=\"multiple\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |title=Ethnic Cuisine - Turkey by Terrie Wright Chrones |access-date=2007-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429005226/http://www.bpe.com/food/ethnic_cusine/turkey.htm |archive-date=2007-04-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The cuisines of the [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean]], [[Marmara Region, Turkey|Marmara]] and [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean]] regions are rich in vegetables, herbs, and fish. [[Central Anatolia]] has many famous specialties, such as ''[[ke\u015fkek]]'', ''[[mant\u0131]]'' (especially from [[Kayseri]]) and ''[[g\u00f6zleme]]''. Food names directly cognate with ''mant\u0131'' are found also in [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] (''[[mantou]]'' or steamed bun) and [[Korean cuisine]] (''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]''). In fact, origin of Turkish mant\u0131 comes from Chinese mantou\n\nA specialty's name sometimes includes that of a city or region, either in or outside of Turkey, and may refer to the specific technique or ingredients used in that area. For example, the difference between ''Urfa kebap'' and ''[[Adana kebap]]'' is the thickness of the skewer and the amount of hot pepper that the kebab contains. ''Urfa kebap'' is less spicy and thicker than ''Adana kebap''. Although meat-based foods such as kebabs are the mainstay in Turkish cuisine as presented in foreign countries, native Turkish meals largely center around [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and [[bread]].\n\n== Culinary customs ==\n\n=== Breakfast ===\n[[File:Simit-2x.JPG|thumb|right|[[Simit]], a circular bread with sesame seeds, is a common breakfast item in Turkey.]]\n\nTurks usually prefer a rich breakfast. A typical Turkish [[breakfast]] consists of cheese (''[[beyaz peynir]]'', ''[[ka\u015far]]'' etc.), butter, olives, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, jam, honey, and [[kaymak]], [[Sujuk|sucuk]] (a spicy Turkish food similar to sausages), ''[[past\u0131rma]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'', ''[[simit]]'', ''[[po\u011fa\u00e7a]]'' and soups are eaten as a morning meal in Turkey. A specialty for breakfast is called [[Menemen (food)|menemen]], which is prepared with tomatoes, green peppers, onion,  olive oil and eggs. Invariably, [[Turkish tea]] is served at breakfast. The Turkish word for breakfast, ''kahvalt\u0131'', means \"before coffee\".\n\n=== Homemade food ===\nHomemade food is still preferred by Turkish people. Although the newly introduced way of life pushes the new generation to eat out; Turkish people generally prefer to eat at home. A typical meal starts with soup (especially in wintertime), followed by a dish made of vegetables (olive oil or with grounded meat), meat or legumes boiled in a pot (typically with meat or [[Mincing|minced]] meat), often with or before rice, pasta or [[bulgur]] [[pilav]] accompanied by a salad or [[cac\u0131k]] (diluted cold yogurt dish with garlic, salt, and cucumber slices). In summertime many people prefer to eat a cold dish of vegetables cooked with olive oil (''[[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131]] yemekler'') instead of the soup, either before or after the main course, which can also be a chicken, meat or fish plate.\n\n=== Restaurants ===\n[[File:Akcaabatkofte.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ak\u00e7aabat meatballs]].]]\nAlthough fast food is gaining popularity and many major foreign fast food chains have opened all over Turkey, Turkish people still rely primarily on the rich and extensive dishes of Turkish cuisine. In addition, some traditional Turkish foods, especially ''[[Kofta|k\u00f6fte]]'', ''[[Doner kebab|d\u00f6ner]]'', ''[[kokore\u00e7]]'', ''[[kumpir]]'' ''midye tava'' ''b\u00f6rek'' and ''g\u00f6zleme'', are often served as fast food in Turkey. Eating out has always been common in large commercial cities.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whiting | first=Dominic |year=2000 |title=Turkey Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Cz4zG73sHgC&pg=PA56&dq=lokanta |publisher=Footprint Handbooks |page=56 |isbn=978-1-900949-85-9 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}</ref> ''Esnaf lokantas\u0131'' (meaning restaurants for shopkeepers and tradesmen) are widespread, serving traditional Turkish home cooking at affordable prices.\n\n=== Summer cuisine ===\nIn the hot Turkish summer, a meal often consists of fried vegetables such as eggplant (aubergine) and peppers or potatoes served with yogurt or tomato sauce. [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] and [[\u00e7\u0131lb\u0131r]] are typical summer dishes, based on eggs. Sheep cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelons and melons also make a light summer meal. Those who like helva for dessert prefer ''summer helva'', which is lighter and less sweet than the regular one.\n\n=== Key ingredients ===\nFrequently used ingredients in Turkish specialties include: lamb, beef, rice, fish, [[eggplant]]s, [[bell pepper|green peppers]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lentil]]s, [[bean]]s, [[zucchini]]s and [[tomato]]es. Nuts, especially [[pistachio]]s, [[chestnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[walnut]]s, together with spices, have a special place in Turkish cuisine, and are used extensively in desserts or eaten separately. [[Semolina]] flour is used to make a cake called [[Basbousa|''revani'']] and [[Halva|''irmik helvasi'']].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|+Commonly used spices and flavorings:\n!Name\n!Turkish\n!Used in\n!References\n|-\n|[[Allspice]]\n|''Yenibahar'' or ''Dolma bahar''\n|[[Dolma]], vegetables, pilav, fish, k\u00f6fte\n|<ref name=akin>{{Cite book| publisher = Abrams| isbn = 978-1-61312-871-8| last = Akin| first = Engin| title = Essential Turkish Cuisine| date = 2015-10-06}}</ref><ref name=basan>{{Cite book| publisher = Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-15617-6| last = Basan| first = Ghillie| title = Classic Turkish Cooking| date = 1997-04-15}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Anise]]\n|''Anason''\n|[[Peksimet]], [[rak\u0131]], used to season nut and dried fruit mixtures in both sweet and savory dishes\n|<ref name=akin /><ref name=basan />\n|-\n|[[Black pepper]]\n|''Kara biber''\n|egg dishes, meat dishes, [[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]]\n|<ref name=akin />\n|-\n|[[Cardamom]]\n|''Kakule''\n|Rarely used, mostly in coffee.

[[Beyaz peynir]] and [[yo\u011furt]] are part of many dishes including [[b\u00f6rek]], [[manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[kebab]] and [[cac\u0131k]].\n\n=== Oils and fats ===\n[[Butter]] or [[margarine]], [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], [[canola oil]], and [[corn oil]] are widely used for cooking. [[Sesame]], [[hazelnut]], [[peanut]] and [[walnut]] oils are used as well. ''Kuyruk ya\u011f\u0131'' ([[tail fat]] of [[sheep]]) is sometimes used in kebabs and meat dishes.\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe rich and diverse flora of Turkey means that fruit is varied, abundant and cheap. In Ottoman Cuisine, fruit frequently accompanied meat as a side dish. [[Plum]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[pomegranate]]s, [[pear]]s, [[apple]]s, [[grape]]s, and [[ficus|fig]]s, along with many kinds of [[citrus]] are the most frequently used fruit, either fresh or dried, in Turkish cuisine. For example, ''[[compote|komposto]]'' (compote) or ''[[ho\u015faf]]'' (from Persian ''khosh \u00e2b'', literally meaning \"nice water\") are among the main side dishes to meat or pilav. ''[[Dolma]]'' and pilaf usually contain currants or raisins. ''Etli yaprak sarma'' (vine leaves stuffed with meat and rice) used to be cooked with sour plums in Ottoman cuisine. Turkish desserts do not normally contain fresh fruit, but may contain dried varieties.\n\n[[Image:\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131 with b\u00f6rek.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|[[\u0130mam bay\u0131ld\u0131]] with Borek]]\nEggplant ({{lang-tr|patl\u0131can}}) has a special place in the Turkish cuisine.\n\n=== Meats ===\n\nIn some regions, meat, which was mostly eaten only at wedding ceremonies or during the ''Kurban Bayram\u0131'' (''[[Eid ul-Adha]]'') as ''etli pilav'' ([[pilav]] with meat), has become part of the daily diet since the introduction of industrial production. [[Veal]], formerly shunned, is now widely consumed.\n\nThe main use of meat in cooking remains the combination of ground meat and [[vegetable]], with names such as ''[[k\u0131ymal\u0131]] fasulye'' (beans with ground meat) or ''k\u0131ymal\u0131 \u0131spanak'' (spinach with ground meat, which is sometimes served with [[yo\u011furt]]).\n\nAlternatively, in coastal towns cheap fish such as ''sardalya'' (sardines) or ''hamsi'' (anchovies) are widely available, as well as many others with seasonal availability. Poultry consumption, almost exclusively of chicken and eggs, is common. Milk-fed [[Domestic sheep|lambs]], once the most popular source of meat in Turkey, comprise a small part of contemporary consumption. ''Kuzu \u00e7evirme'', cooking milk-fed lamb on a spit, once an important ceremony, is rarely seen.\n\n== Dishes and foods ==\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n[[File:Fresh ayran.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Fresh Ayran with a head of foam]]\n\n[[Yo\u011furt]] is an important element in Turkish cuisine.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> In fact, the English word yogurt or yoghurt derives from the Turkish word ''yo\u011furt''. Yo\u011furt can accompany almost all meat dishes (kebabs, k\u00f6fte), vegetable dishes (especially fried eggplant, courgette, spinach with minced meat etc.), ''meze'' and a specialty called ''mant\u0131'' (folded triangles of dough containing minced meat). In villages, yo\u011furt is regularly eaten with [[pilav]] or bread. A thicker, higher-fat variety, ''s\u00fczme yo\u011furt'' or \"strained yogurt\", is made by straining the yo\u011furt curds from the [[whey]]. One of the most common Turkish drinks, ''[[ayran]]'', is made from yo\u011furt. Also, yo\u011furt is often used in the preparation of cakes, some soups and pastries.\n\n==== Cheeses ====\n[[File:Kaschkawal Kashkaval \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b Balkank\u00e4se Sofia IMG 7650.JPG|thumb|''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' cheese]]\n[[File:Otlu tulum peyniri.jpg|thumb|Varieties of ''[[Tulum cheese|tulum]]'': center \"Otlu tulum peyniri\", or Tulum with herbs, in [[Ankara]]]]\n\nTurkey produces many varieties of [[cheese]], mostly from [[domestic sheep|sheep]]'s milk. In general, these cheeses are not long matured, with a comparatively low fat content. The production of many kinds of cheese is local to particular regions. There are 193 different cheeses in Turkey, but only 8 of these cheeses have geographical indication.<ref>https://www.goturkeytourism.com/things-to-do/10-awesome-turkish-cheeses-you-have-to-taste.html</ref>\n\n* ''[[Beyaz peynir]]'' is a salty [[brined cheese]] taking its name from its white color (\"white cheese\"). It is similar to ''[[feta]]'' but not as strong. This is produced in styles ranging from unmatured cheese curds to a quite strong mature version. It has many varieties due to source of milk, region ([[Ezine, \u00c7anakkale|Ezine]] or [[Turkish Thrace|Thrace]]) and production methods (classic or cultured). It is eaten plain (e.g. as part of the traditional Turkish breakfast), used in salads, and incorporated into cooked foods such as ''[[Menemen (food)|menemen]]'', ''[[b\u00f6rek]]'' and ''[[Pita|pide]]''.\n* ''[[\u00c7erkez peyniri]]'', means \"[[Circassians|Circassian]] cheese\". It has two variations, smoked or non-smoked.\n* ''[[\u00c7\u00f6kelek]]'' is dried [[cottage cheese]]. There are many regional varieties of ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek''. Some are eaten fresh while others are preserved, either by storage in goatskin bags or pottery jars, or by drying in the sun. \n* ''[[Kurut]]'' and ''ke\u015f'' are regional names for dried bricks of yogurt made from low-fat milk or from ''\u00e7\u00f6kelek'' made from buttermilk.<ref name=KCheese>{{Cite web| url=http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115070211/http://forum.kusadasi.biz/thread1919.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=15 January 2013| title=Turkish Cheeses| accessdate=2007-12-07| date=2 June 2005}}</ref>\n* ''[[Kars gravyer cheese|Gravyer]]'' is produced in Turkey as well. Among others, [[Kars]] is famous for this type of cheese.\n* ''[[Hellim]]'' is a salty, firm-textured goat cheese, generally with some mint added, made in [[Northern Cyprus]]. In Turkey, it is common to fry ''hellim'' in a pan in some olive oil.\n* ''[[Ka\u015far]]'' is Turkey's other ubiquitous cheese, a moderately fatty sheep's cheese similar to the Greek ''[[kasseri]]'', sometimes marketed as \"Turkish cheddar\", being closer in consistency and taste to mild [[Cheddar cheese|cheddar-style cheese]] than other Turkish cheeses. Less matured ''ka\u015far'', called fresh ''ka\u015far'', is widely consumed as well. Two varieties are popular [[Kars]] and Thrace.\n* ''[[Ka\u015fkaval]]'' is a wheel-shaped yellow sheep's cheese, similar to fresh ''ka\u015far''. The name comes from Romanian word ''ca\u0219caval'', which bears the Italian structure of ''caciocavallo''. \n* ''[[Lor (food)|Lor]]'' is the other type of unsalted whey cheese, similarly made from the whey left over from ''ka\u015far'' or ''strained yogurt'' manufacture. ''Lor'' is used in traditional foods and desserts made from unsalted cheese like \"ek\u015fimik\" and ''h\u00f6\u015fmerim''\n* ''[[Mihali\u00e7 Peyniri|Mihali\u00e7 peyniri]]'' or ''Kelle peyniri'' is a hard sheep's cheese that can be grated, like [[Parmesan cheese]]. Sometimes goat or cow milk is used. It is a specialty from Karacabey, a town in Bursa province which was called Mihali\u00e7 during Byzantine and Ottoman period. Mostly it is produced from non-pastorized milk and processed by salt.\n* ''[[Braided cheese|\u00d6rg\u00fc peyniri]]'', \"[[braided cheese]]\", is a specialty from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].\n* ''[[Van herbed cheese|Otlu peynir]]''[[Van herbed cheese]] (\"herbed cheese\") is produced in many areas, chiefly in East Anatolia. Traditionally sheep's or goat's milk is used, but more recently cow's milk ''otlu peynir'' has been produced. The type of herb used varies by region: in Van [[Ramsons|wild garlic]] is traditional; Bitlis ''otlu peynir'' contains a damp-loving herb known as ''sof otu''. In other areas horse mint (''[[Mentha longifolia]]'') and ''[[Pimpinella rhodentha]]'' are used.<ref name=KCheese/>\n* ''[[Tulum (cheese)|Tulum]]'' is a mostly sheep's curd molded in an animal skin bag called as tulum. There are regional varieties of ''tulum peynir'' in such areas as \u0130zmir, \u00d6demi\u015f and Erzincan.<ref name=KCheese/> And each of tulum cheese have very different characteristics.\n\n=== Soups ===\nA Turkish meal usually starts with a thin [[soup]] (''\u00e7orba''). Soups are usually named after their main ingredient, the most common types being; mercimek ([[lentil]]) \u00e7orbas\u0131, yogurt, or [[wheat]] (often mashed) called [[tarhana]] \u00e7orbas\u0131. Delicacy soups are the ones that are usually not the part of the daily diet, such as [[\u0130\u015fkembe soup]] and [[pa\u00e7a]] \u00e7orbas\u0131, although the latter also used to be consumed as a nutritious winter meal. Before the popularisation of the typical Turkish breakfast, soup was the default morning meal for some people.\nThe most common soups in Turkish cuisine are:\n[[File:Tuzlama.jpg|thumb|''Tuzlama'', a [[tripe soup]] from Turkey.]]\n[[File:Sulu k\u00f6fte.jpg|thumb|[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]]]\n[[File:Ezogelin soup, bread, and water.jpg|thumb|[[Ezogelin soup]]]]\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Anal\u0131 k\u0131zl\u0131 soup]]''\n* ''[[Yayla \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Ash reshteh|Eri\u015fte a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Bu\u011fday a\u015f\u0131]]''/''[[Ayran soup|Ayran \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' (which is served cold)\n* ''[[Chorba|Corba]]''\n* ''Domates \u00e7orbas\u0131 '' ([[tomato soup]])\n* ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn \u00e7orbas\u0131'' (wedding soup)\n* ''[[Ek\u015fi A\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Ezogelin soup|Ezogelin \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u0130\u015fkembe \u00e7orbas\u0131]]'' \n* ''[[Keledo\u015f]]''\n* ''Lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[cabbage]] soup)\n* ''[[Mahluta]]''\n* ''Mercimek \u00e7orbas\u0131'' ([[lentil soup]])\n* ''[[Pa\u00e7a]]''\n* ''[[Paz\u0131]]''\n* ''[[\u015eehriye]]''\n* [[Sheep's sorrel soup]]\n* ''[[Sulu k\u00f6fte]]''\n* ''[[Sumak a\u015f\u0131]]''\n* ''[[Tarhana \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n* ''Tavuk'' ([[chicken soup]], with almond becomes \"Bademli Tavuk\")\n* [[Toyga soup]]\n* ''Trabzon [[Fish soup|Bal\u0131k]] \u00e7orbas\u0131''\n* ''[[Tutma\u00e7]]'' (lentil dish with noodles)\n* ''[[Y\u00fcks\u00fck \u00e7orbas\u0131]]''\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Bread ===\n* [[Bazlama]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* ''M\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi'' ([[corn bread]])\n* [[Lavash|Lava\u015f]]\n* [[Poga\u010da|Po\u011fa\u00e7a]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]] (a broad, round and flat bread made of wheat flour)\n* [[Simit]] (known as \"''gevrek''\" in Izmir, another type of ring-shaped bread covered with sesame seeds.

[[Su b\u00f6re\u011fi]], made with boiled [[yufka]]/[[phyllo]] layers, cheese and parsley, is the most frequently eaten. [[Cheburek|\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek]] (also known as ''Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi'') is fried and stuffed with minced meat. [[Kol b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is another well-known type of b\u00f6rek that takes its name from its shape, as do [[fincan]] (coffee cup), [[muska (pastry)|muska]] (talisman), [[G\u00fcl b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (rose) or [[Sigara b\u00f6re\u011fi]] (cigarette).

[[Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi]] is a sweet type of b\u00f6rek, widespread in the [[Black Sea region]].\n\n[[Po\u011fa\u00e7a]] is the label name for dough based salty pastries. Likewise [[\u00e7\u00f6rek]] is another label name used for both sweet and salty pastries.\n\n[[G\u00f6zleme]] is a food typical in rural areas, made of [[lavash]] bread or phyllo dough folded around a variety of fillings such as spinach, cheese and parsley, minced meat or potatoes and cooked on a large griddle (traditionally [[sa\u010d]]).\n\n[[Katmer]] is another traditional rolled out dough. It can be salty or sweet according to the filling. Katmer with [[pistachio]] and [[kaymak]] is a sweet food and one of the most popular breakfast items in [[Gaziantep]].\n\n[[Lahmacun]] (meaning dough with meat in Arabic) is a thin flatbread covered with a layer of spiced minced meat, tomato, pepper, onion or garlic.\n\n[[Pita|Pide]], which can be made with minced meat (together with onion, chopped tomatoes, parsley and spices), [[kasseri|kashar]] cheese, spinach, white cheese, pieces of meat, braised meat ([[kavurma]]), sucuk, past\u0131rma or/and eggs put on rolled-out dough, is one of the most common traditional stone-baked Turkish specialities.\n\n[[A\u00e7ma]] is a soft bread found in most parts of Turkey.

The combination of meat-filled dough with yogurt differentiates it from other dumplings such as tortellini, ravioli, and Chinese wonton. Mant\u0131 is usually eaten as a main dish.

A large variety of vegetables are used, such as [[spinach]], [[leek]], [[cauliflower]], [[artichoke]], [[cabbage]], [[celery]], [[eggplant]], green and red [[bell pepper]]s, [[Green bean|string bean]] and [[jerusalem artichoke]]. A typical vegetable dish is prepared with a base of chopped onions, carrots saut\u00e9ed first in olive oil and later with tomatoes or [[tomato paste]]. The vegetables and hot water will then be added. Quite frequently a spoon of rice and lemon juice is also added. Vegetable dishes usually tend to be served with its own water (the cooking water) thus often called in colloquial Turkish ''sulu yemek'' (literally \"a dish with juice\"). Minced meat can also be added to a vegetable dish but vegetable dishes that are cooked with olive oil ''([[zeytinya\u011fl\u0131lar]])'' are often served cold and do not contain meat. Spinach, leek, string bean and artichoke with olive oil are among the most widespread dishes in Turkey.\n\n[[Dolma]] is the name used for stuffed vegetables. Like the vegetables cooked with olive oil as described above dolma with olive oil does not contain meat. Many vegetables are stuffed, most typically green peppers (''biber dolmas\u0131''), eggplants, tomatoes, or [[zucchini]]/courgettes (''kabak dolmas\u0131''), vine leaves (''yaprak dolmas\u0131''). If vine leaves are used, they are first pickled in brine. However, dolma is not limited to these common types; many other vegetables and fruits are stuffed with a meat or pilav mixture. For example, artichoke dolma (''[[enginar dolmas\u0131]]'') is an Aegean region specialty. Fillings used in dolma may consist of parts of the vegetable carved out for preparation, pilav with spices or minced meat.\n\n[[Mercimek k\u00f6fte]], although being named k\u00f6fte, does not contain any meat. Instead, red lentil is used as the major ingredient together with spring onion, tomato paste etc.\n\n[[Imam bayildi]] is a version of [[karn\u0131yar\u0131k]] with no minced meat inside. It can be served as a meze as well.\n\nFried eggplant and pepper is a common summer dish in Turkey. It is served with yo\u011furt or tomato sauce and garlic.\n\n[[M\u00fccver]] is prepared with grated squash/courgette or potatoes, egg, onion, dill or cheese and flour. It can be either fried or cooked in the oven.\n\n[[Pilav]] can be served either as a side dish or main dish but ''bulgur pilav\u0131'' (pilav made of boiled and pounded wheat - ''bulgur'') is also widely eaten. The dishes made with ''kuru fasulye'' ([[Common bean#White beans|white beans]]), ''nohut'' ([[chickpea]]s), ''mercimek'' ([[lentil]]s), ''b\u00f6r\u00fclce'' ([[black-eyed pea]]s), etc., combined with onion, vegetables, minced meat, tomato paste and rice, have always been common due to being economical and nutritious.\n\n[[Tur\u015fu]] is pickle made with brine, usually with the addition of garlic. It is often enjoyed as an appetizer. It is made with a large variety of vegetables, from cucumber to courgette. In the towns on the Aegean coast, the water of [[tur\u015fu]] is consumed as a drink. It comes from the Persian \"Torshi\", which refers to pickled \"Torsh\" (sour) vegetables.\n\n=== Egg dishes ===\n[[File:MenemenIstanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] (left) as part of a Turkish breakfast]]\n* [[Menemen (food)|Menemen]] consists of scrambled eggs cooked in tomato, green pepper, and can be onion and garlic.\n* [[\u00c7\u0131lb\u0131r]] is another traditional Turkish food made with poached eggs, yogurt and oil.\n* ''Ispanakl\u0131 yumurta'' consists of eggs with spinach and onion.\n* Kaygana can be described as something of a cross between the pancake and the omelet in Ottoman cuisine. It used to be served with cheese, honey, crushed nuts, or eggplant. However, it is almost forgotten in the big cities of Turkey.\n\n=== Meze and salads ===\n[[File:Turkish Meze Plate.jpg|thumb|200px|A plate of Turkish meze]]\n[[Image:Cacik.jpg|thumb|200px|A bowl of [[Cac\u0131k]], the original form of seasoned, diluted [[yogurt]] with chopped cucumber, eaten throughout the former Ottoman world, under different names, like the [[tarator]] and [[tzatziki]] of the [[Balkans]].]]\n[[Image:Piyaz 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of piyaz]]\n[[Image:Kisir.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of [[k\u0131s\u0131r]] decorated with green [[olive]] and [[cucumber]] pieces]]\n[[Image:Bira ve \u00e7oban salata.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[\u00c7oban salatas\u0131]]]]\n\n[[Meze]] is a selection of food served as the appetizer course with or without drinks.

Dolma and sarma has a special place in Turkish cuisine. It can be eaten either as a meze or a main dish. It can be cooked either as a vegetable dish or meat dish. If a meat mixture is put in, it is usually served hot with yogurt and spices such as oregano and red pepper powder with oil. If the mixture is only vegan recipe it should only have olive oil rice or bulgur and some nuts and raisins inside especially blackcurrant.\n\n[[Zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 yaprak sarmas\u0131]] (stuffed leaves with olive oil) is the sarma made with vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma does not contain meat, is served cold and also referred to as ''[[sarma (food)|sarma]]'', which means \"wrapping\" in Turkish. [[Dried fruit]] such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten ''zeytinya\u011fl\u0131 dolma'' in Ottoman cuisine. [[Vine leaves]] (''yaprak'') could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, ''[[etli yaprak sarma]]'', in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word ''sarma'' is also used for some types of desserts, such as [[f\u0131st\u0131k sarma]] (wrapped pistachio).\n\n[[Melon]] dolma along with [[quince]] or [[apple]] dolma was one of the palace's specialties (raw melon stuffed with minced meat, onion, rice, almonds, cooked in an oven). In contemporary Turkey, a wide variety of dolma is prepared. Although it is not possible to give an exhaustive list of dolma recipes, [[courgette]] (\"kabak\"), [[aubergine]] (\"patl\u0131can\"), [[tomato]] (\"domates\"), [[pumpkin]] (\"balkaba\u011f\u0131\"), [[Capsicum|pepper]] (\"biber\"), [[cabbage]] (\"lahana\") (black or white cabbage), [[chard]] (\"paz\u0131\") and [[mussel]] (\"midye\") dolma constitute the most common types. Instead of dried cherries in the palace cuisine, currants are usually added to the filling of dolma cooked in olive oil. A different type of dolma is [[mumbar]] dolmas\u0131, for which the membrane of intestines of sheep is filled up with a spicy rice-nut mixture.\n\n=== Meat dishes ===\n[[Image:Karn\u0131yar\u0131k.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Karn\u0131yar\u0131k]]]]\n[[Image:Kokore\u00e7.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Kokore\u00e7]] cooking on a spit]]\n[[Image:Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in Espoo.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A plate of Kuzu G\u00fcve\u00e7 in [[Tapiola]], [[Espoo]], Finland.]]\n* Consisted of chicken or lean veal, D\u00f6ner kebap is a common Turkish fast food.\n* Tantuni (similar to ''d\u00fcr\u00fcm'', meat cut in very small pieces, served with lavash, a specialty from the [[Mersin]] province of Turkey)\n* Kuzu g\u00fcve\u00e7 (lamb cooked in earthenware casserole)\n* Past\u0131rmal\u0131 [[kuru fasulye]] (white kidney bean stew with [[past\u0131rma]])\n* [[Kuzu kapama]] (spring lamb stewed)\n* Ha\u015flama (boiled lamb with vegetables and lemon juice)\n* [[Kavurma]] which means frying, roasting or parching in Turkish, is generally used for roasted lamb or a variety of fried meat dishes. \u00c7oban kavurma is a variety of it, prepared with diced lamb with tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, peppers and herbs.

[[Kad\u0131nbudu k\u00f6fte]] is another traditional speciality; minced meat is mixed with cooked rice and fried. [[I\u00e7li k\u00f6fte]] can be described as a shell of \"bulgur\" filled with onion, minced meat and nuts. [[\u00c7i\u011f k\u00f6fte]] is a meze from south-eastern Turkey meaning raw meatballs, prepared with \"bulgur\" and raw minced meat.

Instead of classical sausages (''sosis''), sucuk is the most used ingredient for snacks and fast-food style toasts and sandwiches in Turkey.\n* [[Past\u0131rma]] is another famous beef delicacy. Both past\u0131rma and sucuk can be put in [[kuru fasulye]] (dry beans) to enrich the aroma. Both can be served as a meze as well.

Fish are grilled, fried or cooked slowly by the ''bu\u011fulama'' (poaching) method. ''Bu\u011fulama'' is fish with lemon and parsley, covered while cooking so that it will be cooked with steam. The term ''pil\u00e2ki'' is also used for fish cooked with various vegetables, including onion in the oven. In the Black Sea region, fish are usually fried with thick corn flour. Fish are also eaten cold; as smoked (isleme) or dried (\u00e7iroz), canned, salted or pickled (l\u00e2kerda). Fish is also cooked in salt or in dough in Turkey. Paz\u0131da Levrek is a seafood speciality which consists of [[European seabass|sea bass]] cooked in [[chard]] leaves. In fish restaurants, it is possible to find other fancy fish varieties like ''bal\u0131k dolma'' (stuffed fish), ''bal\u0131k iskender'' (inspired by [[\u0130skender kebap]]), fishballs or fish en papillote. [[Fish soup]] prepared with vegetables, onion and flour is common in coastal towns and cities. In [[Istanbul]]'s [[Emin\u00f6n\u00fc]] and other coastal districts, grilled fish served in bread with tomatoes, herbs and onion is a popular fast food. In the inner parts of Turkey, [[trout]] ''alabal\u0131k''  is common as it is the main type of freshwater fish. Popular seafood mezes at coastlines include stuffed mussels, fried [[mussel]] and fried ''kalamar'' ([[Squid (food)|squid]]) with [[tarator]] sauce.\n\nPopular sea fish in Turkey include:<ref>English names for fish from [[Alan Davidson (food writer)|Alan Davidson]], ''Mediterranean Seafood'', Penguin, 1972. {{ISBN|0-14-046174-4}}</ref> \n[[Image:Trachurus trachurus fish 7218 Nevit.JPG|thumb|Istavrit on display at a fish market]]\n* [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]] ''hamsi''\n* [[Sardine (food)|sardine]] ''sardalya''\n* [[bonito]] ''palamut''\n* [[gilt-head bream]] ''\u00e7upra'' or ''\u00e7ipura''\n* [[red mullet]] ''barbun(ya)''\n* [[sea bass]] ''levrek''\n* [[Merlangius merlangus|whiting]] or ''bakalyaro''\n* [[haddock]] ''mezgit''\n* [[swordfish]] ''k\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 bal\u0131g\u0131''\n* [[turbot]] ''kalkan''\n* [[Pagellus bellottii|red pandora]] ''mercan'' \n* [[Trachurus|Jack mackerel]] 'istavrit'\n* [[Epinephelus|white grouper]] ''lagos''\n* [[bluefish]] ''l\u00fcfer''\n\n=== Desserts ===\n{{see also|List of Turkish desserts}}\n[[File:Baklava - Turkish special, 80-ply.JPEG|thumb|right|230px|[[Baklava]] is prepared on large trays and cut into a variety of shapes.]]\n[[Image:Firinda s\u00fctla\u00e7.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''S\u00fctla\u00e7'', or Turkish [[rice pudding]].]]\n[[File:T Honey.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Turkish delight]].]]\n[[File:Kazandibi.JPG|thumb|right|230px|\n[[Kazandibi]], means the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface.]]\n[[File:Wasserweltfest 2012 - T\u00fcrkische Mehlspeise.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[\u015eekerpare]].]]\nOne of the world-renowned desserts of Turkish cuisine is [[baklava]]. Baklava is made either with pistachios or walnuts. Turkish cuisine has a range of baklava-like desserts which include [[\u015f\u00f6biyet]], [[b\u00fclb\u00fcl yuvas\u0131]], [[saray sarmas\u0131]], [[S\u00fctl\u00fc Nuriye|s\u00fctl\u00fc nuriye]], and [[sar\u0131 burma]].\n\n[[Kadaif]] ('Kaday\u0131f') is a common Turkish dessert that employs shredded yufka. There are different types of [[kadaif]]: tel (wire) or [[Burma (dessert)|Burma]] (wring) kaday\u0131f, both of which can be prepared with either walnuts or pistachios.\n\nAlthough carrying the label \"kaday\u0131f\", [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] is totally different from \"tel kaday\u0131f\". [[K\u00fcnefe]] and [[ekmek kaday\u0131f\u0131]] are rich in syrup and butter, and are usually served with [[kaymak]] (clotted/scrambled butter). K\u00fcnefe contains wire kaday\u0131f with a layer of melted cheese in between and it is served hot with pistachios or walnuts.\n\nAmong milk-based desserts, the most popular ones are [[muhallebi]], [[su muhallebisi]], [[s\u00fctla\u00e7]] (rice pudding), [[ke\u015fk\u00fcl]], [[kazandibi]] (meaning the bottom of \"kazan\" because of its burnt surface), and [[tavuk g\u00f6\u011fs\u00fc]] (a sweet, gelatinous, milk pudding dessert quite similar to kazandibi, to which very thinly peeled chicken breast is added to give a chewy texture). A speciality from the Mediterranean region is [[haytal\u0131]], which consists of pieces of starch pudding and ice cream (or crushed ice) put in rose water sweetened with syrup.\n\n[[Halva|Helva]] (halva): [[un helvas\u0131]] (flour helva is usually cooked after someone has died), [[irmik helvas\u0131]] (cooked with semolina and pine nuts), [[yaz helvas\u0131]] (made from walnut or almond<ref>Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131 - Sufi cuisine</ref>), [[tahin helvas\u0131]] (crushed sesame seeds), [[kos helva]], [[pi\u015fmaniye]] (floss halva).\n\nOther popular desserts include; [[Revani]] (with semolina and starch), [[\u015fekerpare]], [[kalburabasma]], [[dilber duda\u011f\u0131]], [[vezir parma\u011f\u0131]], [[han\u0131m g\u00f6be\u011fi]], [[Kemal Pasha dessert|kemalpa\u015fa]], [[tulumba]], [[zerde]], [[h\u00f6\u015fmerim]], [[paluze]], [[irmik tatl\u0131s\u0131/peltesi]], [[lokma]].\n\n[[G\u00fclla\u00e7]] is a dessert typically served at Ramadan, which consists of very thin, large dough layers put in milk and rose water, served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts. A story is told that in the kitchens of the Palace, those extra thin dough layers were prepared with \"prayers\", as it was believed that if one did not pray while opening phyllo dough, it would never be possible to obtain such thin layers.\n\n[[Ashure|A\u015fure]] can be described as a sweet soup containing boiled beans, wheat and dried fruits. Sometimes cinnamon and rose water is added when being served. According to legend, it was first cooked on [[Noah's Ark]] and contained seven different ingredients in one dish. All the Anatolian peoples have cooked and are still cooking a\u015fure especially during the month of Muharrem.\n\nSome traditional Turkish desserts are fruit-based: ''ayva tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[quince]]), ''incir tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[Common fig|fig]]), ''kabak tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pumpkin]]), ''elma tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[apple]]) and ''armut tatl\u0131s\u0131'' ([[pear]]). Fruits are cooked in a pot or in an oven with sugar, carnations and cinnamon (without adding water). After being chilled, they are served with walnuts or pistachios and [[kaymak]].\n\nHomemade cookies/biscuits are commonly called [[kurabiye]] in Turkish. The most common types are [[ac\u0131badem kurabiyesi]] (prepared only with eggs, sugar and almonds), [[un kurabiyesi]] (flour kurabiye) and cevizli kurabiye (kurabiye with walnuts). Another dough based dessert is [[ay \u00e7\u00f6re\u011fi]].\n\n[[Tahin-pekmez]] is a traditional combination especially in rural areas. Tahin is [[tahini|sesame paste]] and pekmez is grape syrup. These are sold separately and mixed before consumption.\n\n[[Lokum]] ([[Turkish delight]]), which was eaten for digestion after meals and called \"rahat hulkum\" in the Ottoman era, is another well-known sweet/candy with a range of varieties.\n\n[[Cezerye]], [[cevizli (walnut) sucuk]] (named after its sucuk/sujuk like shape, also known as [[Churchkhela]] in Circassian region) and [[pestil]] (fruit pestils) are among other common sweets.\n\n[[Marzipan]] ''badem ezmesi'' or ''f\u0131st\u0131k ezmesi'' (made of ground pistachios) is another common confection in Turkey.\n\nAnother jelly like Turkish sweet is [[macun]]. [[Mesir macunu]] of [[Manisa]]/[[\u0130zmir]] (which was also called \"nevruziye\" as this macun was distributed on the first day of spring in the Ottoman Palace) contains 41 different spices. It is still believed that \"mesir macunu\" is good for health and has healing effects. As with lokum, [[nane macunu]] (prepared with mint) used to be eaten as a digestive after heavy meals. Herbs and flowers having curative effects were grown in the gardens of Topkap\u0131 under the control of the chief doctor \"hekimba\u015f\u0131\" and pharmacists of the Palace who used those herbs for preparing special types of [[macun]] and [[Sharbat|sherbet]].<ref>Marianna Yerasimos, Ottoman cuisine</ref>\n\nThere are also several types of ice creams based on [[salep]] powder or [[Cornstarch]] with [[Rose water]] such as [[Dondurma]] (Turkish gum ice cream), dried fruit ice cream, ice cream rose petals.\n\nDried fruit, used in dolma, pilav, meat dishes and other desserts is also eaten with almonds or walnuts as a dessert. Figs, grapes, apricots are the most widespread dried fruits.\n\n''Kaymak'' (clotted cream-butter) is often served with desserts to cut through their sweetness.\n\n[[Turkish tea]] or [[Turkish coffee]], with or without sugar, is usually served after dinner or more rarely together with desserts.\n\n=== Street food ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Mara\u015f dondurmas\u0131 in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|Dondurma]]\n[[File:Macun in Turkey.jpg|thumb|Macun]]\n* [[Dondurma]]\n* fried mussels, stuffed mussels ''midye''\n* fresh walnuts ''taze ceviz''\n* g\u00f6zleme a very thin stuffed flat bred similar to [[paratha]], fillings can include any combination of spiced potato, feta, spinach and ground meat \n* kokore\u00e7\n* kumpir a baked potato served with ''ka\u015far'' cheese and many other toppings\n* [[lokma]]\n* roasted corn ''k\u00f6zde m\u0131s\u0131r''\n* roasted chesnuts ''kestane''\n* simit\n* [[Macun]]\n\n== Beverages ==\n\n=== Alcoholic beverages ===\n{{See also|Turkish wine|Alcohol laws of Turkey}}\n[[File:Turkish wine regions map.png|thumb|300px|Wine-producing regions in Turkey.]]\nAlthough the majority of Turks profess the Islamic religion, [[alcoholic beverage]]s are as widely available as anywhere. However, some Turks abstain from drinking [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] during the holy month of [[Ramadan]]. [[Rak\u0131]] (pronounced [\u027ea\u02c8k\u026f]) is the most popular alcoholic drink in Turkey. It is considered as the national alcoholic beverage of Turkey. There are a few local brands of [[lager]] such as Bomonti, Marmara34 and [[Efes Beverage Group|Efes Pilsen]] and a small selection of international beers that are produced in Turkey such as Skol, [[Beck's]], [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]], [[Foster's Lager|Foster's]], [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg Brewery|Tuborg]].\n\nThere are a variety of local [[wine]]s produced by Turkish brands such as [[Sevilen group|Sevilen]], [[Kavakl\u0131dere (wine)|Kavakl\u0131dere]], Doluca, Corvus, Kayra, Pamukkale and Diren which are getting more popular with the change of climatic conditions that affect the production of wine. A range of grape varieties are grown in Turkey. For the production of red wine, the following types of grapes are mainly used; in the Marmara Region, [[Pinot noir]], [[Adakaras\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Semillion]], [[Kuntra]], [[Gamay]], [[Cinsault]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Carignane]], [[\u00c7alkaras\u0131]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Alicante Bouschet]]; in the Black Sea Region and the eastern part of the country, [[\u00d6k\u00fczg\u00f6z\u00fc]], [[Bo\u011fazkere]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Kalecik Karas\u0131]], [[Papazkaras\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]; in the Mediterranean Region, [[Sergi Karas\u0131]], [[Dimrit]]. As for white wine, the grapes can be listed as follows; in the Marmara Region, [[Chardonnay]], [[Riesling]], [[Semillion]], [[Beylerce]], [[Yap\u0131ncak]]; in the Aegean Region, [[Muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] and [[semillion]]; in the Black Sea Region, [[Narince (grape)|Narince]]; in Central Anatolia, [[Emir (grape)|Emir]], [[Hasandede]] (for further info http://www.hayyam.com/uzumler/index.php{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}). In addition to mass production, it is quite popular to produce wines in private farms and sell them in the locality. Visitors can find different \"home made\" wines in Central Anatolia (Kapadokya/[[Cappadocia]] region - [[Nev\u015fehir]]), the Aegean coast ([[Sel\u00e7uk]] and [[Bozcaada]] (an island in the Aegean Sea)).\n\n=== Non-alcoholic beverages ===\n[[Image:Rize tea.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Turkish tea]]]]\n[[File:Turkishcoffee.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Turkish coffee]]]]\nAt breakfast and all day long Turkish people drink [[black tea]] (''\u00e7ay''). Tea is made with two teapots in Turkey. Strong bitter tea made in the upper pot is diluted by adding boiling water from the lower. [[Turkish coffee]] (''kahve'') is usually served after meals or with dessert.\n\n[[Ayran]] (yogurt drink) is the most common cold beverage, which may accompany almost all dishes in Turkey, except those with fish and other seafood. It's a mix of yogurt and water, similar to [[lassi]]. It may be served with salt, according to taste.\n\n[[\u015ealgam suyu]] (mild or spicy fermented red carrot juice) is another important non-alcoholic beverage that is usually combined with kebabs or served together with [[rak\u0131]].\n\n[[Boza]] is a traditional winter drink, which is also known as millet wine (served cold with cinnamon and sometimes with [[leblebi]]).\n\n[[Sahlep]] is another favorite in winter (served hot with cinnamon). Sahlep is extracted from the roots of wild orchids and may be used in Turkish ice cream as well. This was a popular drink in western Europe before coffee was brought from Africa and came to be widely known.\n\n''Limonata'' (lemonade) is very popular. It is traditionally served with baklava and other sweets. Sometimes lemonade is served with strawberry flavoring. This is called ''\u00e7\u0131lekl\u0131 l\u0131monata''.\n\n[[Sherbet (Middle Eastern drink)|Sherbet]] (Turkish ''\u015ferbet,'' pronounced {{IPA-tr|\u0283e\u027e\u02c8bet|}}) is a syrup which can be made from any of a wide variety of ingredients, especially fruits, flowers, or herbs. Examples include pears, quinces, strawberries, apples, [[cornelian cherry]], pomegranates, oranges, rose petals, rose hips, or licorice and spices.  Sherbet is drunk diluted with cold water.\n\nIn classical Turkish cuisine, [[ho\u015faf]] (from the Persian \"Khosh-ab\", meaning \"fresh water\") alternatively accompanies meat dishes and ''pilav'' ([[pilaf]]).\n\n=== Related cuisines ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Greek cuisine]]\n* [[Albanian cuisine]]\n* [[Balkan cuisine]]\n* [[Central Asian cuisine]]\n* [[Levantine cuisine]]\n* [[Middle Eastern cuisine]]\n* [[Mongolian cuisine]]\n* [[Ottoman cuisine]]\n* [[Caucasian cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food|Turkey}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baklava]]\n* [[Doner kebap]]\n* [[\u0130skender kebap]]\n* [[G\u00f6zleme]]\n* [[Kadaif]]\n* [[Kumpir]]\n* [[Mangal (barbecue)|Mangal]]\n* [[Manti (dumpling)|Mant\u0131]]\n* [[Meze]]\n* [[Pita|Pide]]\n* [[Turkish coffee]]\n* [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|Turkish rak\u0131]]\n* [[Turkish tea]]\n* [[List of stuffed dishes#Turkish stuffed dishes|Turkish stuffed dishes]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Budak, S\u00fcheyl, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184656/http://www.nadirkitap.com/antakya-mutfagi-suheyl-budak-kitap3618320.html ''Antakya Mutfa\u011f\u0131''], Hatay 2008, {{oclc|705454123}} (1996 edition)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130927145106/http://blog.kitchenguerilla.com/2011/03/antakya-cuisine-with-suheyl-budak-and-75-ladies/?lang=en Antakya-cuisine with S\u00fcheyl Budak and 75 ladies]\n* G\u00fcrsoy, Deniz, ''Turkish Cuisine in Historical Perspective'', Istanbul, 2006, {{ISBN|975-329-564-2}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Konya Yemek K\u00fclt\u00fcr\u00fc ve Konya Yemekleri'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-6021-16-0}}.\n* Hal\u0131c\u0131, Nevin, ''Sufi Cuisine'', Saqi 2005.\n* Lambraki, Mirsini & Ak\u0131n, Engin, ''Ayn\u0131 Sofrada \u0130ki \u00dclke, T\u00fcrk ve Yunan Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-458-484-2}}.\n* [[Claudia Roden|Roden, Claudia]], ''A New Book of Middle Eastern Food'', 2000, {{ISBN|0-14-046588-X}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Halk Mutfa\u011f\u0131m\u0131z Geleneksel Tatlar\u0131m\u0131zdan Se\u00e7meler'', Istanbul 2005, {{ISBN|975-98180-2-7}}.\n* \u015eavkay, Turgut, ''Turkish Cuisine'', Istanbul 2003, {{ISBN|975-285-114-2}}\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & S\u00fct, Uyuyunca, ''T\u00fcrkiye Peynirleri'', Istanbul, {{ISBN|975-363-755-1}}.\n* \u00dcnsal, Artun & Silivrim, Kaymak, ''T\u00fcrkiye'nin Yo\u011furtlar\u0131'', Istanbul 2007, {{ISBN|978-975-08-1276-7}}.\n* Yerasimos, Marianna, ''Osmanl\u0131 Mutfa\u011f\u0131'', Istanbul 2002; published in English as ''500 Years of Ottoman Cuisine''.\n* Zubaida, Sami & Tapper, Richard, ''A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East'', London and New York, 1994 and 2000, {{ISBN|1-86064-603-4}}.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{cookbook}}\n{{Cookbook|Turkish Cooking}}\n* Turkish Cultural Foundation - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090301190825/http://www.turkish-cuisine.org/english/index.php Turkish Cuisine Portal]\n* [[Cornucopia (magazine)|Cornucopia]] recipe index - [https://web.archive.org/web/20090412033714/http://www.cornucopia.net/cookerylisting.html Cookery Listing]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131224173614/http://www.studyinturkey.org/en/discover-turkey/experience-turkey/turkish-cousine/ \"Turkish Cousine\" (Study In Turkey)]\n\n{{Turkey topics}}\n{{Cuisine of Turkey}}\n{{European topic|| cuisine}}\n{{Mediterranean cuisine}}\n{{Middle Eastern cuisine}}\n{{cuisines}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turkish Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Turkish cuisine| ]]\n", "name_user": "Samilc87", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDolma and sarma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine"}

The term Hispanic has in recent years in the United States been given racial value with the perception of a racial Hispanic look being that of Native American race or of the Mixed races usually [[Mestizo]] or [[Mulatto]] as the majority of the people who immigrate from Spanish-speaking countries to the United States are of that racial origin. Due to this racial perception of Hispanics even among Hispanic Americans themselves, [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]], [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|black U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]], and [[Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans|Asian U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]] are often overlooked in the U.S. mass media and in general American social perceptions.

After 70 years of being in the United States and having been bestowed white status by the U.S. government this was the first time the United States began to show true racist attitudes towards Mexicans in America something that usually came quickly to people of other races.

They settled in the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]]. One of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] of America, [[John_Morton_(American_politician)|John Morton]], who signed the Declaration of Independence, was Finnish. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], the 32nd President of the United States, descended from one of these 17th century Finnish colonists in New Sweden. <ref>http://www.oocities.org/vienna/8921/colonial.html</ref> <ref>John Powell, \"Encyclopedia of North American immigration\", p. 98</ref> More recent Finns were on several occasions \"racially\" discriminated against<ref>Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio, \"History of the Finns in Michigan\", p. 17 | She had barely reached the front porch when the friend's mother realized that her daughter's playmate was a Finn. Helmi was turned away immediately, and the daughter of the house was forbidden to associate with \"that Mongolian\". John Wargelin, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and a former president of Suomi College, also tells how, when he was a child in Crystal Falls some years earlier, he and his friends were ridiculed and stoned on their way to school. \"Because of our strange language,\" he says, \"we were considered an alien race who had no right to settle in this country.\"</ref> and not seen as white, but \"Asian\". The reasons for this were the arguments and theories about the Finns originally being of [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] instead of native [[Caucasoid|European]] origin due to the Finnish language belonging to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and not the Indo-European language family.<ref>Eric Dregni, \"Vikings in the attic: In search of Nordic America\", p. 176</ref>\n\nMinnesota, home to a strong mining industry at the turn of the 20th century, was the stage of several politically-motivated conflicts between laborers and anti-union leaders. In 1907, a group of between 10,000 and 16,000 immigrants \u2013 the majority of whom were Finnish \u2013 staged a large strike against [[Oliver Iron Mining Company]]. In response, the company began screening its immigrant-based workforce by their country of origin. Finns regularly comprised the most numerous and vocal groups of protestors, feeding into beliefs that the Finnish ethnic group was less capable of assimilating well into the American workforce. Oliver refused to hire more Finns.\n\nOne year after the major strike, the company's superintendent stated:\n\n<blockquote>Their people [the Finns] are good laborers but trouble breeders.\u2026 They are a race that tries to take advantage of the companies at every opportunity and are not to be trusted.</blockquote><ref>content.sciendo.com/view/journals/njmr/4/4/article-p168.xml</ref>\n\nAcrimony towards Finnish social radicals in Minnesota's political milieu reached a head in the case of John Svan and 15 associates. On January 4, 1908, a trial was held regarding whether John Svan, an outspoken socialist, and several other Finnish immigrants would become [[United States citizenship#Naturalized citizenship|naturalized United States citizens]] or not, as the process only was for \"whites\" and \"blacks\" in general and district prosecutor John Sweet maintained that Finnish immigrants were Mongols. Sweet linked the \"socialistic ideology\" of Finnish radicals with other collectivist East Asian philosophies to underscore his position that Finns were of an Asiatic frame of mind that was out of harmony with American thought. The judge, [[William Alexander Cant|William A. Cant]], later concluded that the Finnish people may have been Mongolian from the beginning, but that the climate they lived in for a long time, and historical Finnish immigration and assimilation of Germanic tribes ([[Teutons]])\u2014which he considered modern \"pure Finns\" indistinguishable from\u2014had made the Finnish population one of the whitest people in Europe. If the Finns had Mongol ancestry, it was distant and diluted. John Svan and the others were made naturalized U.S. citizens, and from that day on, the law forbade treating Finnish immigrants and Americans of Finnish descent as not white.<ref>content.sciendo.com/view/journals/njmr/4/4/article-p168.xml</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historymuseumeot.com/mfahs/htm/part8_0026.htm|title=Recognized HTML document|website=Historymuseumeot.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref>Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio, \"History of the Finns in Michigan\", p. 23</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, there was a lot resentment from the local American population towards the Finnish settlers because they were seen as having very different customs, and were slow in learning English. Another reason was that many of them had come from the [[Finnish Civil War|\"red\" side of Finland]], and thus held [[Socialism|socialist]] political views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethnicity.lib.mtu.edu/groups_Finns.html|title=An Interior Ellis Island|date=8 March 2007|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308124318/http://ethnicity.lib.mtu.edu/groups_Finns.html|archive-date=2007-03-08}}</ref>\n\n====German Americans====\n\n{{main|German Americans}}\n\nLarge numbers of Germans migrated to North America between the 1680s and 1760s. Many settled in the English colony of [[Pennsylvania]]. In the 18th century, many persons of English descent harbored resentment towards the increasing number of German settlers. [[Benjamin Franklin]] in \"[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.]]\", complained about the increasing influx of German Americans, stating that they had a negative influence on the early United States. The only exception were Germans of [[Saxon people|Saxon]] descent'' \"who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased\"''.\n\nUnlike most European immigrant groups, whose acceptance as white came gradually over the course of the late 19th century (that is, in U.S. colloquial definitions, since all Europeans were white by legal U.S. definition), German immigrants quickly became accepted as white.<ref>See David R. Roediger, ''The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class'' (London: Verso, 1991) p. 32 for their earlier status. See op. cit. p. 142 for [[Stephen O. Douglas]]'s acceptance, in his debates against [[Abraham Lincoln]], that Germans are a \"branch of the Caucasian race.\" See op. cit. p. 155 for anti-abolitionist tracts of 1864 accusing abolitionist German-Americans of having \"broken their ties with the white race\" by opposing slavery. See Leon F. Litwack, ''North of Slavery: the Negro in the Free States, 1790-1860'' (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1961) p. 75 for the legislated disfranchisement of Pennsylvanians of African ancestry by the first state legislature controlled by German-Americans.</ref> \n\n====Irish Americans====\n\n{{main|Irish Americans}}\n\nBeginning in the 1840s, negative assessments of the \"Irish character\" became more and more racialized.

The trial of nineteen Italian immigrants for the murder of New Orleans police chief [[David Hennessy]] in 1890, which ended in [[March 14, 1891, lynchings|the lynching of eleven of them]] by a white vigilante group, sparked debate in the press over Italians supposed racial characteristics.

The term Hispanic has in recent years in the United States been given racial value with the perception of a racial Hispanic look being that of Native American race or of the Mixed races usually [[Mestizo]] or [[Mulatto]] as the majority of the people who immigrate from Spanish-speaking countries to the United States are of that racial origin. Due to this racial perception of Hispanics even among Hispanic Americans themselves, [[White Hispanic and Latino Americans|white U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]], [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|black U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]], and [[Asian Hispanic and Latino Americans|Asian U.S. Hispanics and Latinos]] are often overlooked in the U.S. mass media and in general American social perceptions.

They settled in the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]]. One of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] of America, [[John_Morton_(American_politician)|John Morton]], who signed the Declaration of Independence, was Finnish. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], the 32nd President of the United States, descended from one of these 17th century Finnish colonists in New Sweden. <ref>http://www.oocities.org/vienna/8921/colonial.html</ref> <ref>John Powell, \"Encyclopedia of North American immigration\", p. 98</ref> More recent Finns were on several occasions \"racially\" discriminated against<ref>Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio, \"History of the Finns in Michigan\", p. 17 | She had barely reached the front porch when the friend's mother realized that her daughter's playmate was a Finn. Helmi was turned away immediately, and the daughter of the house was forbidden to associate with \"that Mongolian\". John Wargelin, a pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church and a former president of Suomi College, also tells how, when he was a child in Crystal Falls some years earlier, he and his friends were ridiculed and stoned on their way to school. \"Because of our strange language,\" he says, \"we were considered an alien race who had no right to settle in this country.\"</ref> and not seen as white, but \"Asian\". The reasons for this were the arguments and theories about the Finns originally being of [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] instead of native [[Caucasoid|European]] origin due to the Finnish language belonging to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and not the Indo-European language family.<ref>Eric Dregni, \"Vikings in the attic: In search of Nordic America\", p. 176</ref>\n\nMinnesota, home to a strong mining industry at the turn of the 20th century, was the stage of several politically-motivated conflicts between laborers and anti-union leaders. In 1907, a group of between 10,000 and 16,000 immigrants \u2013 the majority of whom were Finnish \u2013 staged a large strike against [[Oliver Iron Mining Company]]. In response, the company began screening its immigrant-based workforce by their country of origin. Finns regularly comprised the most numerous and vocal groups of protestors, feeding into beliefs that the the Finnish ethnic group was less capable of assimilating well into the American workforce. Oliver refused to hire more Finns.\n\nOne year after the major strike, the company's superintendent stated:\n\n<blockquote>Their people [the Finns] are good laborers but trouble breeders.\u2026 They are a race that tries to take advantage of the companies at every opportunity and are not to be trusted.</blockquote><ref>content.sciendo.com/view/journals/njmr/4/4/article-p168.xml</ref>\n\nAcrimony towards Finnish social radicals in Minnesota's political milieu reached a head in the case of John Svan and 15 associates. On January 4, 1908, a trial was held regarding whether John Svan, an outspoken socialist, and several other Finnish immigrants would become [[United States citizenship#Naturalized citizenship|naturalized United States citizens]] or not, as the process only was for \"whites\" and \"blacks\" in general and district prosecutor John Sweet maintained that Finnish immigrants were Mongols. Sweet linked the \"socialistic ideology\" of Finnish radicals with other collectivist East Asian philosophies to underscore his position that Finns were of an Asiatic frame of mind that was out of harmony with American thought. The judge, [[William Alexander Cant|William A. Cant]], later concluded that the Finnish people may have been Mongolian from the beginning, but that the climate they lived in for a long time, and historical Finnish immigration and assimilation of Germanic tribes ([[Teutons]])\u2014which he considered modern \"pure Finns\" indistinguishable from\u2014had made the Finnish population one of the whitest people in Europe. If the Finns had Mongol ancestry, it was distant and diluted. John Svan and the others were made naturalized U.S. citizens, and from that day on, the law forbade treating Finnish immigrants and Americans of Finnish descent as not white.<ref>content.sciendo.com/view/journals/njmr/4/4/article-p168.xml</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historymuseumeot.com/mfahs/htm/part8_0026.htm|title=Recognized HTML document|website=Historymuseumeot.com|accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref><ref>Armas Kustaa Ensio Holmio, \"History of the Finns in Michigan\", p. 23</ref>\n\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, there was a lot resentment from the local American population towards the Finnish settlers because they were seen as having very different customs, and were slow in learning English. Another reason was that many of them had come from the [[Finnish Civil War|\"red\" side of Finland]], and thus held [[Socialism|socialist]] political views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethnicity.lib.mtu.edu/groups_Finns.html|title=An Interior Ellis Island|date=8 March 2007|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308124318/http://ethnicity.lib.mtu.edu/groups_Finns.html|archive-date=2007-03-08}}</ref>\n\n====German Americans====\n\n{{main|German Americans}}\n\nLarge numbers of Germans migrated to North America between the 1680s and 1760s. Many settled in the English colony of [[Pennsylvania]]. In the 18th century, many persons of English descent harbored resentment towards the increasing number of German settlers. [[Benjamin Franklin]] in \"[[Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.]]\", complained about the increasing influx of German Americans, stating that they had a negative influence on the early United States. The only exception were Germans of [[Saxon people|Saxon]] descent'' \"who with the English, make the principal Body of White People on the Face of the Earth. I could wish their Numbers were increased\"''.\n\nUnlike most European immigrant groups, whose acceptance as white came gradually over the course of the late 19th century (that is, in U.S. colloquial definitions, since all Europeans were white by legal U.S. definition), German immigrants quickly became accepted as white.<ref>See David R. Roediger, ''The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class'' (London: Verso, 1991) p. 32 for their earlier status. See op. cit. p. 142 for [[Stephen O. Douglas]]'s acceptance, in his debates against [[Abraham Lincoln]], that Germans are a \"branch of the Caucasian race.\" See op. cit. p. 155 for anti-abolitionist tracts of 1864 accusing abolitionist German-Americans of having \"broken their ties with the white race\" by opposing slavery. See Leon F. Litwack, ''North of Slavery: the Negro in the Free States, 1790-1860'' (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1961) p. 75 for the legislated disfranchisement of Pennsylvanians of African ancestry by the first state legislature controlled by German-Americans.</ref> \n\n====Irish Americans====\n\n{{main|Irish Americans}}\n\nBeginning in the 1840s, negative assessments of the \"Irish character\" became more and more racialized. Irish people were considered brutish and (like blacks) were often compared to simians. The \"Celtic physiognomy\" was described as being marked by an \"upturned nose [and] the black tint of the skin.\"<ref name=\"Jacobson\">{{cite book|title=Whiteness of a different color European immigrants and the alchemy of race|last1=Jacobson|first1=Matthew Frye|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674951914|edition= 1st Harvard University Press paperback|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}</ref>{{rp|48}}\n\n====Italian Americans====\n\n{{main|Italian Americans}}\n\nIn certain parts of the South during the [[Jim Crow]] era, Italians \"occupied a racial middle ground within the otherwise unforgiving, binary caste system of white-over-black.\" Though Italians were viewed as white for purposes of naturalization and voting, their social standing was that they represented a \"problem at best.\" Their racial status was impacted by their appearance and that they did not \"act\" white, engaging in manual labor ordinarily reserved for blacks. The trial of nineteen Italian immigrants for the murder of New Orleans police chief [[David Hennessy]] in 1890, which ended in [[March 14, 1891, lynchings|the lynching of eleven of them]] by a white vigilante group, sparked debate in the press over Italians supposed racial characteristics.

The 10th Infantry Brigade was commanded by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[William Slim]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (later [[field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] the Viscount Slim). On 6 November, Slim launched an attack on the fort of [[Gallabat]], with the assault spearheaded by the [[18th Royal Garhwal Rifles|3rd Royal Garhwal Rifles]], under Lieutenant-Colonel S.E. Taylor. Gallabat was captured, but an enemy counterattack forced the [[brigade]] to withdraw. The Sappers were tasked with obstructing the enemy to prevent them from following too closely. At one stage, two broken-down tanks were filled with explosives and placed on a culvert to collapse it and halt the enemy. The charges were detonated, but one tank failed to explode, and the culvert did not collapse.

During the pursuit of the enemy following the capture of [[Metemma]] on the night 31&nbsp;January &ndash; 1&nbsp;February 1941, Second-Lieutenant Bhagat was in command of a section of a Field Company, Sappers and Miners, detailed to accompany the leading mobile troops ([[Bren Carrier]]s) to clear the road and adjacent areas of mines. For a period of four days and over a distance of 55 miles this officer in the leading carrier led the Column. During this period, he himself detected and personally supervised the clearing of no less than 15 minefields of varying dimensions. Speed being essential, he worked at high pressure from dawn to dusk each day. On two occasions when his carrier was blown up with casualties to others, and on a third occasion when ambushed and under close enemy fire he himself carried straight on with his task. He refused relief when worn out with strain and fatigue and with one eardrum punctured by an explosion, on the grounds that he was now better qualified to continue his task to the end.\n\nHis coolness, persistence over a period of 96 hours, and gallantry, not only in battle, but throughout the long period when the safety of the Column and the speed at which it could advance were dependent on his personal efforts, were of the highest order. &mdash; London Gazette: 10 June 1941<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35186 |supp=y |page=3307 |date= 10 June 1941 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_vc.htm#1b Royal Engineers Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200907/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_vc.htm |date=18 December 2006 }} Sappers VCs</ref>}}\n\n==Dates of rank==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white\"\n!

The 10th Infantry Brigade was commanded by [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|Brigadier]] [[William Slim]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (later [[field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] the Viscount Slim). On 6 November, Slim launched an attack on the fort of [[Gallabat]], with the assault spearheaded by the [[18th Royal Garhwal Rifles|3rd Royal Garhwal Rifles]], under Lieutenant-Colonel S.E. Taylor. Gallabat was captured, but an enemy counterattack forced the [[brigade]] to withdraw. The Sappers were tasked with obstructing the enemy to prevent them from following too closely. At one stage, two broken-down tanks were filled with explosives and placed on a culvert to collapse it and halt the enemy. The charges were detonated, but one tank failed to explode, and the culvert did not collapse.

Bhagat's [[Bren carrier]] passed through a heavily-mined stretch of road and detonated two mines, the second of which destroyed the carrier and killed the driver and a sapper. Bhagat then continued in another carrier and defused mines by hand as the column moved down the road.

[[Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners]] during the [[Second World War]] when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:\n\n{{Quotation|<center>''War Office, 10th June, 1941''</center>\n\nHis Majesty The KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned officer: \u2014\n \nSecond-Lieutenant Premindra Singh Bhagat, Corps of Indian Engineers (serving with Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners).\n\nFor most conspicuous gallantry on active service in the Middle East. During the pursuit of the enemy following the capture of [[Metemma]] on the night 31&nbsp;January &ndash; 1&nbsp;February 1941, Second-Lieutenant Bhagat was in command of a section of a Field Company, Sappers and Miners, detailed to accompany the leading mobile troops ([[Bren Carrier]]s) to clear the road and adjacent areas of mines. For a period of four days and over a distance of 55 miles this officer in the leading carrier led the Column. During this period, he himself detected and personally supervised the clearing of no less than 15 minefields of varying dimensions. Speed being essential, he worked at high pressure from dawn to dusk each day. On two occasions when his carrier was blown up with casualties to others, and on a third occasion when ambushed and under close enemy fire he himself carried straight on with his task. He refused relief when worn out with strain and fatigue and with one eardrum punctured by an explosion, on the grounds that he was now better qualified to continue his task to the end.\n\nHis coolness, persistence over a period of 96 hours, and gallantry, not only in battle, but throughout the long period when the safety of the Column and the speed at which it could advance were dependent on his personal efforts, were of the highest order. &mdash; London Gazette: 10 June 1941<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35186 |supp=y |page=3307 |date= 10 June 1941 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_vc.htm#1b Royal Engineers Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218200907/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/rem_his_vc.htm |date=18 December 2006 }} Sappers VCs</ref>}}\n\n==Dates of rank==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white\"\n!
