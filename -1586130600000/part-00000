Jonathan Siegel has written that Vermeule's approach to the interpretation of law\n{{quote|eschews, and attempts to transcend, the main elements of the long-standing debates over methods that courts should use to interpret statutes and the Constitution&nbsp;... he sees no need to resolve apparently burning questions such as whether courts are bound by what legislatures ''write'', or by what legislatures ''intend''&nbsp;... For Vermeule, everything comes down to a simple but withering cost\u2013benefit analysis.<ref>Siegel, Jonathan R. (January 2008) [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/jsiegel/publications/crucible.pdf \"Judicial Interpretation in the Cost-Benefit Crucible\"] ''Minnesota Law Review'', v.92, pp.387-88</ref>}}\n\nVermeule believes that legal change can only came about through cultural improvements.  In an interview in 2016 after his conversion to Catholicism, Vermeule said, \"I put little stock or faith in the law. It is a tool that may be put to good uses or bad. In the long run it will be no better than the polity and culture in which it is embedded. If that culture sours and curdles; so will the law; indeed that process is well underway and its tempo is accelerating. Our hope lies elsewhere.\"<ref name=middleway />\n\n==Political views==\nIn 2007, Vermeule said about the [[United States Supreme Court]] that it should stay away from controversial political matters, such as [[abortion law]]s and [[sodomy law|anti-sodomy statutes]] and defer to Congress, as the elected representatives of the people, except in extremely obvious cases. This would require both liberals and conservative to step back and realize that the benefits of such a court would outweigh the drawbacks for both. Vermeule was thus suggesting \"a kind of arms-control agreement, a tacit deal.\"<ref>Shea, Christopher (October 7, 2007) [http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/10/07/supreme_downsizing/ \"Supreme downsizing\"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]''</ref>\n\nA convert to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]], Vermeule has become an advocate of [[Integralism#Catholic integralism|integralism]], a form of modern political thought originating in historically Catholic-dominant societies and opposed to the liberal ideal of division between [[church and state]]. Integralism in practice gives rise to state order (identifiable as [[theocracy|theocratic]]) in which a religiously-conceived \"Highest Good\" has precedence over individual autonomy, the value prioritized by liberal democracy. Rather than electoral politics, the path to confessional political order in integralist theory is \u201cstrategic ''raillement,''\u201d or transformation within institutions and bureaucracies, that lays the groundwork for a realized integralist regime to succeed a liberal democratic order it assumes to be dying. The new state would \"exercise coercion over baptized citizens in a manner different from non-baptized citizens\".<ref>Peters, Nathaniel (April 11, 2018) [https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/04/21306/ \"The Ultimate Catholic Showdown?

Vermeule describes this as being essential to \"the eventual formation of the Empire of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and ultimately the world government required by natural law\".<ref>Vermeule, Adrian (July 20, 2019) [https://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2019/07/a-principle-of-immigration-priority-.html \"A Principle of Immigration Priority\"] ''Mirror of Justice''</ref>\n\nIn an article which appeared in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in March 2020, Vermeule suggests that [[originalism]] &ndash; the idea that the meaning of the [[Constitution of the United States|American Constitution]] was fixed at the time of its enactment, which has been the principle legal theory of conservative judges and legal scholars for the past 50 years, but which Vermeule now characterizes as merely \"a useful rhetorical and political expedient\" &ndash; has outlived its usefullness and needs to be replaced by what he calls \"common-good constitutionalism\".  Under this theory of jurisprudence, the moral values of the [[religious conservatism|religious right]]<ref name=Levitz /> would be imposed on the American people whether they, as a whole, believe in them or not.<ref name=beyond />  \n\nVermeule's concept of common-good constitutionalism is \n\n<blockquote>based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate. ... This approach should take as its starting point substantive moral principles that conduce to the common good, principles that officials (including, but by no means limited to, judges) should read into the majestic generalities and ambiguities of the written Constitution. These principles include respect for the authority of rule and of rulers; respect for the hierarchies needed for society to function; solidarity within and among families, social groups, and workers\u2019 unions, trade associations, and professions; appropriate subsidiarity, or respect for the legitimate roles of public bodies and associations at all levels of government and society; and a candid willingness to \"legislate morality &ndash;indeed, a recognition that all legislation is necessarily founded on some substantive conception of morality, and that the promotion of morality is a core and legitimate function of authority. Such principles promote the common good and make for a just and well-ordered society.<ref name=beyond>Vermeule, Adrian (March 31, 2020) [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/common-good-constitutionalism/609037/ \"Beyond Originalism\"] ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nVermeule specified that common-good constitutionalism is \"not tethered to particular written instruments of civil law or the will of the legislators who created them\", so the stated purpose of the legislation is irrelevant to him.  Yet he also says that \"officials (including, but by no means limited to, judges)\" will need \"a candid willingness to 'legislate morality'\" in order to create a \"just and well-ordered society.\"<ref name=beyond /> \n\nThe main aim of common-good constitutionalism\n\n<blockquote>is certainly not to maximize individual autonomy or to minimize the abuse of power (an incoherent goal in any event), but instead to ensure that the ruler has the power needed to rule well ... Just authority in rulers can be exercised for the good of subjects, if necessary even against the subjects\u2019 own perceptions of what is best for them \u2014 perceptions that may change over time anyway, as the law teaches, habituates, and re-forms them. Subjects will come to thank the ruler whose legal strictures, possibly experienced at first as coercive, encourage subjects to form more authentic desires for the individual and common goods, better habits, and beliefs that better track and promote communal well-being.<ref name=beyond /></blockquote> \n\nThe values which Vermeule considers should be upheld for the good of the \"subjects\" of the \"ruler\" include traditional family values, traditional sexual and gender roles, and outlawing abortion. According to Eric Levitz, the values Vermeule promotes are those of [[Catholicism]] and the [[Christian right]].<ref name=Levitz />  Law professor Randy E. Barnett characterizes Vermeule's essay as \"an argument for the temporal power ''of the state'' to be subordinated to the spiritual power ''of the Church''.\"<ref>Barnett, Randy E. (April 3, 2020) [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/dangers-any-non-originalist-approach-constitution/609382/ \"Common-Good Constitutionalism Reveals the Dangers of Any Non-originalist Approach to the Constitution\"] ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''</ref> \n\nConstitutional law professor [[Garrett Epps]] characterizes Vermeule as \"an authentic Christian nationalist to whom the Constitution is only an obstacle\". Vermeule's common-good constitutionalism argument is, according to Epps, really \"authoritarian extremism\" which \"has absolutely nothing to do with the actual United States Constitution, and in many ways flatly contradicts it. ... In fact, the Constitution as such is not a binding text to Vermeule\" since it must be, in Vermeule's words, \"read into\" in order to arrive at the results he prefers. In the end, Epps criticizes Vermeule's concept as a \"banal\" anti-constitutional theory akin to [[Falangism]].<ref>[[Garrett Epps|Epps, Garrett]] (April 3, 2020) [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/common-good-constitutionalism-dangerous-idea/609385/ \"Common-Good Constitutionalism Is an Idea as Dangerous as They Come\"] ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''</ref>\n\nLevitz notes that Vermeule received little support from conservatives for his arguments, although some did object to characterizing him as \"authoritarian\".<ref name=beyond /><ref name=Levitz>Levitz, Eric (April 2020) [https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/vermeule-catholic-integralism-theocracy-progressives-conservatives-constitution.html \"No, Theocracy and Progressivism Aren\u2019t Equally Authoritarian\"] ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nElliot Kaufman, writing in the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]]'', has described Vermeule as a \"reactionary\" and an \"illiberal\" following in the footsteps of German [[Nazism|Nazi]] thinker [[Carl Schmitt]].

In an interview in 2016 after his conversion to Catholicism, Vermeule said, \"I put little stock or faith in the law. It is a tool that may be put to good uses or bad. In the long run it will be no better than the polity and culture in which it is embedded. If that culture sours and curdles; so will the law; indeed that process is well underway and its tempo is accelerating. Our hope lies elsewhere.\"<ref name=middleway />\n\n==Political views==\nIn 2007, Vermeule said about the [[United States Supreme Court]] that it should stay away from controversial political matters, such as [[abortion law]]s and [[sodomy law|anti-sodomy statutes]] and defer to Congress, as the elected representatives of the people, except in extremely obvious cases. This would require both liberals and conservative to step back and realize that the benefits of such a court would outweigh the drawbacks for both. Vermeule was thus suggesting \"a kind of arms-control agreement, a tacit deal.\"<ref>Shea, Christopher (October 7, 2007) [http://archive.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/10/07/supreme_downsizing/ \"Supreme downsizing\"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]''</ref>\n\nA convert to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]], Vermeule has become an advocate of [[Integralism#Catholic integralism|integralism]], a form of modern political thought originating in historically Catholic-dominant societies and opposed to the liberal ideal of division between [[church and state]]. Integralism in practice gives rise to state order (identifiable as [[theocracy|theocratic]]) in which a religiously-conceived \"Highest Good\" has precedence over individual autonomy, the value prioritized by liberal democracy. Rather than electoral politics, the path to confessional political order in integralist theory is \u201cstrategic ''raillement,''\u201d or transformation within institutions and bureaucracies, that lays the groundwork for a realized integralist regime to succeed a liberal democratic order it assumes to be dying. The new state would \"exercise coercion over baptized citizens in a manner different from non-baptized citizens\".<ref>Peters, Nathaniel (April 11, 2018) [https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/04/21306/ \"The Ultimate Catholic Showdown?

Vermeule describes this as being essential to \"the eventual formation of the Empire of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and ultimately the world government required by natural law\".<ref>Vermeule, Adrian (July 20, 2019) [https://mirrorofjustice.blogs.com/mirrorofjustice/2019/07/a-principle-of-immigration-priority-.html \"A Principle of Immigration Priority\"] ''Mirror of Justice''</ref>\n\nIn an article which appeared in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in March 2020, Vermeule suggests that [[originalism]] &ndash; the idea that the meaning of the [[Constitution of the United States|American Constitution]] was fixed at the time of its enactment, which has been the principle legal theory of conservative judges and legal scholars for the past 50 years, but which Vermeule now characterizes as merely \"a useful rhetorical and political expedient\" &ndash; has outlived its usefullness and needs to be replaced by what he calls \"common-good constitutionalism\".  Under this theory of jurisprudence, the moral values of the [[religious conservatism|religious right]]<ref name=Levitz /> would be imposed on the American people whether they, as a whole, believe in them or not.<ref name=beyond />  \n\nVermeule's concept of common-good constitutionalism is \n\n<blockquote>based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good, and that strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good is entirely legitimate. ... This approach should take as its starting point substantive moral principles that conduce to the common good, principles that officials (including, but by no means limited to, judges) should read into the majestic generalities and ambiguities of the written Constitution. These principles include respect for the authority of rule and of rulers; respect for the hierarchies needed for society to function; solidarity within and among families, social groups, and workers\u2019 unions, trade associations, and professions; appropriate subsidiarity, or respect for the legitimate roles of public bodies and associations at all levels of government and society; and a candid willingness to \"legislate morality &ndash;indeed, a recognition that all legislation is necessarily founded on some substantive conception of morality, and that the promotion of morality is a core and legitimate function of authority. Such principles promote the common good and make for a just and well-ordered society.<ref name=beyond>Vermeule, Adrian (March 31, 2020) [https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/common-good-constitutionalism/609037/ \"Beyond Originalism\"] ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\nVermeule specified that common-good constitutionalism is \"not tethered to particular written instruments of civil law or the will of the legislators who created them\", so the stated purpose of the legislation is irrelevant to him.  Yet he also says that \"officials (including, but by no means limited to, judges)\" will need \"a candid willingness to 'legislate morality'\" in order to create a \"just and well-ordered society.\"<ref name=beyond /> \n\nThe main aim of common-good constitutionalism\n\n<blockquote>is certainly not to maximize individual autonomy or to minimize the abuse of power (an incoherent goal in any event), but instead to ensure that the ruler has the power needed to rule well ... Just authority in rulers can be exercised for the good of subjects, if necessary even against the subjects\u2019 own perceptions of what is best for them \u2014 perceptions that may change over time anyway, as the law teaches, habituates, and re-forms them. Subjects will come to thank the ruler whose legal strictures, possibly experienced at first as coercive, encourage subjects to form more authentic desires for the individual and common goods, better habits, and beliefs that better track and promote communal well-being.<ref name=beyond /></blockquote> \n\nThe values which Vermeule considers should be upheld for the good of the \"subjects\" of the \"ruler\" include traditional family values, traditional sexual and gender roles, and outlawing abortion. According to Eric Levitz, the values Vermeule promotes are those of [[Catholicism]] and the [[Christian right]].<ref name=Levitz />  Law professor Randy E.

Vermeule's common-good constitutionalism argument is, according to Epps, really \"authoritarian extremism\" which \"has absolutely nothing to do with the actual United States Constitution, and in many ways flatly contradicts it. ... In fact, the Constitution as such is not a binding text to Vermeule\" since it must be, in Vermeule's words, \"read into\" in order to arrive at the results he prefers.

''Berberosaurus'' might be the oldest known ceratosaur, and is based on partial [[postcrania]]l remains.\n\n==Classification==\nRonan Allain and colleagues, who described ''Berberosaurus'', performed a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]] and found their new genus to be the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] known [[abelisaur]]oid, more derived than ''[[Elaphrosaurus]]'', ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', and ''[[Spinostropheus]]'', but less so than ''[[Xenotarsosaurus]]'' and [[abelisauria]]ns. ''Berberosaurus'' is distinguished from other theropods by anatomical details found in its [[vertebra]]e, [[metacarpus|metacarpals]], and hindlimb bones. Its assignment as an abelisauroid pushes back the record of this group and shows that it had diversified by the Early Jurassic.<ref name=RAetal07>{{cite journal |last=Allain |first=Ronan |author2=Tykoski, Ronald |author3=Aquesbi, Najat |author4=Jalil, Nour-Eddine |author5=Monbaron, Michel |author6=Russell, Dale |author7= Taquet, Philippe | authorlink7=Philippe Taquet |year=2007 |title=A basal abelisauroid from the late Early Jurassic of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, and the radiation of ceratosaurs |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=610\u2013624 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2007)27[610:AADTFT]2.0.CO;2 |url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/8145/files/monbaron_adt.pdf }}</ref> However, Carrano and Sampson (2008) found it to be a basal ceratosaur outside [[Neoceratosauria]] instead.<ref name = CyS08>Carrano & Sampson, 2008.

This was the lead single from the album ''[[Main Course]]'' (as well as a song on the 1977 ''[[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|Saturday Night Fever]]'' soundtrack)  and hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; it also reached the top-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the middle of 1975. Largely recognised as the group's \"comeback\" song, it was their first US top-10 hit since \"[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]\" (1971).\n\n==Origins and recording==\nThe song was originally called \"Drive Talking\" in its early stage. The song's rhythm was modelled after the sound their car made crossing the [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]] each day from [[Biscayne Bay]] to [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami]]. The stutter of 'ji-ji-ji-jive' came from how Barry sang the word drive in a moving car.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The Bee Gees \u2013 35 Years of Music |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 24 March 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WxQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA32&dq=%22jive+talkin%22+%22julia+tuttle%22 |volume= 113 |page= 22 |issue= 12 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nRecording for \"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} took place on 30 January and 2 February 1975. The scratchy guitar intro was done by Barry and the funky bass line by Maurice. The pulsing synthesiser bass line, which featured in the final recording, was (along with the pioneering work of [[Stevie Wonder]]) one of the earliest uses of \"synth bass\" on a pop recording.  It was overdubbed by keyboardist [[Blue Weaver]] using a then state-of-the-art [[ARP 2600]], which producer [[Arif Mardin]] had brought in for the recording of the ''Main Course'' album.<ref>{{cite web|first= Mehmet |last= Dede |title= Jive Talkin' with Arif MARDIN |url= http://www.lightmillennium.org/summer_fall_01/mdede_arifmardin.html |publisher= The Light Millennium |year= 2001 |accessdate= 25 October 2014}}</ref> Weaver stated, \"Usually Maurice would play bass guitar, but he was away from the studio that night. And when Maurice came back, we let him hear it and suggested he re-record the bass line on his bass guitar\". \"I really liked the synth bass lines\", Maurice said. \"I overdubbed certain sections to add bass extra emphasis\".\n\n\"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} was also influenced by \"You're the One\" (written by [[Sly Stone]]) by [[Little Sister (band)|Little Sister]].<ref name=\"bass\">{{cite book|first= David N. |last= Meyer |title= The Bee Gees: The Biography |year= 2013 |publisher= Da Capo Press |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OvYUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT138&dq=%22bee+gees%22+%22mr+natural%22}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maurice, while hearing this rhythmic sound, \"Barry didn't notice that he's going 'Ji-Ji Jive Talkin'{{thinsp}}', thinking of the dance, 'You dance with your eyes'...that's all he had...exactly 35 mph...that's what we got.\" He goes on to say, \"We played it to [producer] Arif [Mardin], and he went 'Do you know what \"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} means?' And we said 'Well yeah, it's, ya know, you're dancing.' He says 'NO...it's a black expression for bullshitting.' And we went 'Oh, Really?!? Jive talkin', you're telling me lies...' and changed it.\" Maurice goes on to describe how Arif gave them \"the groove, the tempo, everything.\" [[Robin Gibb]] then goes on to mention that, because they were English, they were less self-conscious about going into the \"no-go areas\", referring to musical styles that were more black in styles, etc. He then said, \"We didn't think that there was any 'no go' areas, it's music!\" Barry's guitar strumming has a smoother version of [[Kool and the Gang]]'s signature chicka-chicka and funky Nassau version of [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]'s Caribbean strumming. The song's rhythm riff perhaps from \"[[Shirley & Company]]'s \"[[Shame, Shame, Shame (Shirley & Company song)|Shame, Shame, Shame]]\", with a prominent use of the [[Bo Diddley beat]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 2004 |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003 |publisher= Record Research |page= 232}}</ref>\n\n\"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} is a [[stuttering]] song like [[Bachman Turner Overdrive]]\u2019s \u201c[[You Ain\u2019t Seen Nothing Yet]]\u201d, [[The Who]]'s \"[[My Generation]]\", [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", [[Elton John]]'s \"[[Bennie and the Jets]]\" and [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Katmandu (song)|Katmandu]]\".<ref name=\"bass\"/>\n\nAfter hearing \"Jive Talkin{{'\"}}, [[Lindsey Buckingham]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], and co-producer [[Richard Dashut]] built up the song \"Second Hand News\" (released on the band's ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' in 1977) with four audio tracks of electric guitar and the use of chair percussion to evoke [[Celtic rock]].<ref>{{cite video|people= [[Fleetwood Mac]] |title= Making of Rumours |medium= DVD-Audio (''Rumours'') |publisher= [[Warner Bros.

The [[Disc jockey|DJs]] would only find out what the song was and who played it when it was placed on the turntable; [[RSO Records|RSO]] did provide the song with a label on the record itself. It was the second time in the band's career that this strategy had been employed to get airplay for their music, after a similar tactic had popularised their debut US single \"[[New York Mining Disaster 1941]]\" in 1967. The song approximates the synthesised propulsion of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\".<ref name=\"bass\"/>\n\nThe original studio version was included on the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack, as it was used in a scene that was cut from the final film. Later pressings of the album used the live version of \"Jive Talkin' \" from the Bee Gees 1977 album, ''Here at Last... Bee Gees... Live'', due to contractual distribution changes.

This was the lead single from the album ''[[Main Course]]'' (as well as a song on the 1977 ''[[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|Saturday Night Fever]]'' soundtrack)  and hit number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; it also reached the top-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the middle of 1975. Largely recognised as the group's \"comeback\" song, it was their first US top-10 hit since \"[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]\" (1971).\n\n==Origins and recording==\nThe song was originally called \"Drive Talking\" in its early stage. The song's rhythm was modelled after the sound their car made crossing the [[Julia Tuttle Causeway]] each day from [[Biscayne Bay]] to [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami]]. The stutter of ji-ji-ji-jive came from how Barry sang the word drive in a moving car.<ref>{{cite journal|title= The Bee Gees \u2013 35 Years of Music |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 24 March 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WxQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA32&dq=%22jive+talkin%22+%22julia+tuttle%22 |volume= 113 |page= 22 |issue= 12 |issn= 0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nRecording for \"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} took place on 30 January and 2 February 1975. The scratchy guitar intro was done by Barry and the funky bass line by Maurice. The pulsing synthesiser bass line, which featured in the final recording, was (along with the pioneering work of [[Stevie Wonder]]) one of the earliest uses of \"synth bass\" on a pop recording.  It was overdubbed by keyboardist [[Blue Weaver]] using a then state-of-the-art [[ARP 2600]], which producer [[Arif Mardin]] had brought in for the recording of the ''Main Course'' album.<ref>{{cite web|first= Mehmet |last= Dede |title= Jive Talkin' with Arif MARDIN |url= http://www.lightmillennium.org/summer_fall_01/mdede_arifmardin.html |publisher= The Light Millennium |year= 2001 |accessdate= 25 October 2014}}</ref> Weaver stated, \"Usually Maurice would play bass guitar, but he was away from the studio that night. And when Maurice came back, we let him hear it and suggested he re-record the bass line on his bass guitar\". \"I really liked the synth bass lines\", Maurice said. \"I overdubbed certain sections to add bass extra emphasis\".\n\n\"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} was also influenced by \"You're the One\" (written by [[Sly Stone]]) by [[Little Sister (band)|Little Sister]].<ref name=\"bass\">{{cite book|first= David N. |last= Meyer |title= The Bee Gees: The Biography |year= 2013 |publisher= Da Capo Press |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OvYUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT138&dq=%22bee+gees%22+%22mr+natural%22}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Maurice, while hearing this rhythmic sound, \"Barry didn't notice that he's going 'Ji-Ji Jive Talkin'{{thinsp}}', thinking of the dance, 'You dance with your eyes'...that's all he had...exactly 35 mph...that's what we got.\" He goes on to say, \"We played it to [producer] Arif [Mardin], and he went 'Do you know what \"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} means?' And we said 'Well yeah, it's, ya know, you're dancing.' He says 'NO...it's a black expression for bullshitting.' And we went 'Oh, Really?!? Jive talkin', you're telling me lies...' and changed it.\" Maurice goes on to describe how Arif gave them \"the groove, the tempo, everything.\" [[Robin Gibb]] then goes on to mention that, because they were English, they were less self-conscious about going into the \"no-go areas\", referring to musical styles that were more black in styles, etc. He then said, \"We didn't think that there was any 'no go' areas, it's music!\" Barry's guitar strumming has a smoother version of [[Kool and the Gang]]'s signature chicka-chicka and funky Nassau version of [[KC and the Sunshine Band]]'s Caribbean strumming. The song's rhythm riff perhaps from \"[[Shirley & Company]]'s \"[[Shame, Shame, Shame (Shirley & Company song)|Shame, Shame, Shame]]\", with a prominent use of the [[Bo Diddley beat]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 2004 |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003 |publisher= Record Research |page= 232}}</ref>\n\n\"Jive Talkin{{'\"}} is a [[stuttering]] song like [[Bachman Turner Overdrive]]\u2019s \u201c[[You Ain\u2019t Seen Nothing Yet]]\u201d, [[The Who]]'s \"[[My Generation]]\", [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", [[Elton John]]'s \"[[Bennie and the Jets]]\" and [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Katmandu (song)|Katmandu]]\".<ref name=\"bass\"/>\n\nAfter hearing \"Jive Talkin{{'\"}}, [[Lindsey Buckingham]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], and co-producer [[Richard Dashut]] built up the song \"Second Hand News\" (released on the band's ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' in 1977) with four audio tracks of electric guitar and the use of chair percussion to evoke [[Celtic rock]].<ref>{{cite video|people= [[Fleetwood Mac]] |title= Making of Rumours |medium= DVD-Audio (''Rumours'') |publisher= [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] |year= 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nUpon its release to [[Radio broadcasting|radio stations]], the single was delivered in a plain [[White label|white cover]], with no immediate indication of what the song's name was or who sang it. The [[Disc jockey|DJs]] would only find out what the song was and who played it when it was placed on the turntable; [[RSO Records|RSO]] did provide the song with a label on the record itself. It was the second time in the band's career that this strategy had been employed to get airplay for their music, after a similar tactic had popularised their debut US single \"[[New York Mining Disaster 1941]]\" in 1967. The song approximates the synthesised propulsion of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]\".<ref name=\"bass\"/>\n\nThe original studio version was included on the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack, as it was used in a scene that was cut from the final film. Later pressings of the album used the live version of \"Jive Talkin' \" from the Bee Gees 1977 album, ''Here at Last... Bee Gees... Live'', due to contractual distribution changes. The CD version restores the use of the studio version.\n\n==Personnel==\nCredits adapted from the album ''[[Main Course]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title= Main Course |others= Bee Gees |year= 1975 |url= https://www.discogs.com/release/4278865-Main-Course/images |accessdate= 3 March 2016 |type= liner notes |publisher= [[RSO Records|RSO]]}}</ref>\n*[[Barry Gibb]] \u2013 [[Singing|vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Robin Gibb]] \u2013 vocals\n*[[Maurice Gibb]] \u2013 rhythm and [[electric guitar]]s, [[Bass guitar|bass]], vocals\n*[[Alan Kendall]] \u2013 [[electric guitar]]s, [[steel guitar]]\n*[[Blue Weaver]] \u2013 [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[synthesizer]]\n*[[Dennis Bryon]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]]\n\n==Chart performance==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1975)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])<ref>{{cite web|url= http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=21533&pages= |title= Forum \u2013 ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts \u2013 CHART POSITIONS PRE 1989 |publisher= Australian-charts.com.
