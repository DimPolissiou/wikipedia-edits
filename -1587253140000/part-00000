The second ruler of the [[Macedonian dynasty]] (although his parentage is unclear), he was very well-read, leading to his epithet. During his reign, the renaissance of letters, begun by his predecessor [[Basil I]], continued; but the Empire also saw several military defeats in the Balkans against [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and against the Arabs in [[Sicily]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. His reign also witnessed the formal discontinuation of several ancient Roman institutions, such as the [[Roman consul]] and [[Roman Senate|Senate]] (in this period also known as the [[Byzantine Senate]]), which continued to exist in name only and lost much of their original functions and powers.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Basil&leo.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Leo VI (right) and Basil I, from the 11th-century manuscript by [[John Skylitzes]]]]\nBorn on 19 September 866 to the empress [[Eudokia Ingerina]],<ref>Tougher, p.

Basil married Zoe off to an insignificant official, and later almost had Leo blinded when he was accused of conspiring against him.<ref>Norwich, pg. 99</ref><ref>Treadgold, pg. 460</ref> On 29 August 886, Basil died in a hunting accident, though he claimed on his deathbed that there was an [[assassination]] attempt in which Leo was possibly involved.<ref name=\"Treadgold, pg. 461\">Treadgold, pg. 461</ref>\n\n==Domestic policy==\nOne of the first actions of Leo VI after his succession was the reburial, with great ceremony, of the remains of Michael III in the imperial mausoleum within the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Constantinople]].<ref>Finlay, pg. 307</ref> This contributed to the suspicion that Leo was (or at least believed himself to be) in truth Michael's son.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 225\" /> Seeking political reconciliation, the new Emperor secured the support of the officials in the capital, and surrounded himself with bureaucrats like [[Stylianos Zaoutzes]] (the father of his mistress, Zoe Zaoutzaina)<ref name=\"Treadgold, pg. 461\">Treadgold, pg. 461</ref> and the eunuch [[Samonas]], an Arab defector whom Leo raised to the rank of ''[[patrikios]]'' and who stood in as [[Godparent|godfather]] to Leo\u2019s son, [[Constantine VII]].<ref name=\"Finlay, pg. 308\">Finlay, pg. 308</ref> His attempts to control the great aristocratic families (e.g., the [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokadai]] and the [[Doukai]]) occasionally led to serious conflicts,<ref name=\"Kazhdan, pg. 1211\">Kazhdan, pg. 1211</ref> the most significant being the revolt of [[Andronikos Doukas (general under Leo VI)|Andronikos Doukas]] in 906.<ref name=\"Treadgold, pg. 468\">Treadgold, pg. 468</ref>\n\nLeo also attempted to involve himself in the church through his arbitrary interference with the patriarchate.<ref>Finlay, pg. 310</ref> Using Pope John VIII's excommunication of Photius, he dismissed the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]],<ref>Norwich, pg. 104</ref> who had been his tutor, and replaced him with his own 19-year-old brother [[Patriarch Stephen I of Constantinople|Stephen]] in December 886.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 225\" /> On Stephen's death in 893, Leo replaced him with Zaoutzes' nominee, [[Antony II Kauleas]], who died in 901.<ref name=\"Kazhdan, pg. 1211\">Kazhdan, pg. 1211</ref> Leo then promoted his own Imperial secretary (''[[mystikos]]'') [[Nicholas Mystikos|Nicholas]], but suspicions that he was involved in the failed assassination attempt against Leo in 903<ref>Treadgold, pg. 467</ref> as well as his opposition to Leo\u2019s fourth marriage saw Nicholas replaced with Leo\u2019s spiritual father [[Euthymius I of Constantinople|Euthymios]] in 907.<ref name=\"Treadgold, pg. 468\" />\n\nThe magnificent [[Church of Ayios Lazaros, Larnaca|Church of Ayios Lazaros]] in [[Larnaca]] was constructed during the rule of Leo VI in the late 9th century,<ref>Michaelides, M.G., ''Saint Lazarus, The Friend Of Christ And First Bishop Of Kition'', (1984) {{cite web|url=http://www.serfes.org/lives/stlazarus.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922225302/http://www.serfes.org/lives/stlazarus.htm |archivedate=22 September 2009 }}</ref> and it was built after the relics of St. Lazaros were transported from Crete to Constantinople.<ref>Shepard, ''The Cambridge History of the Byzantine Empire'' (2008), pg. 493\u2013496</ref> The church is one of the best examples of [[Byzantine architecture]].  Leo also completed work on the ''[[Basilika]]'', the [[Greek language|Greek]] translation and update of the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|law code]] issued by [[Justinian I]], which had been started during the reign of Basil.<ref>Norwich, pg. 105</ref>\n\nBishop [[Liutprand of Cremona]] gives an account similar to those about Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]], to the effect that Leo would sometimes disguise himself and go about Constantinople looking for injustice or corruption.

Called \"Novels\", or \"New Laws\", these were codes that dealt with current problems and issues, such as the prohibition on fourth marriages. Both the ''Basilika'' and the Novels were concerned with ecclesiastical law ([[canon law]]) as well as secular law.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 227\"/> Most importantly, from a historical perspective, they finally did away with much of the remaining legal and constitutional architecture that the Byzantine Empire had inherited from the Roman Empire, and even from the days of the [[Roman Republic]].<ref name=\"Finlay, pg. 308\">Finlay, pg. 308</ref>  Obsolete institutions such as the [[Curiae]], the [[Byzantine Senate|Roman Senate]], even the [[Roman consul|Consulate]], were finally removed from a legal perspective, even though these still continued in a lesser, decorative form.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 227\"/>\n\n[[File:Leo - Tactica, sive De instruendis aciebus, 1586 - 1435950 F.jpeg|thumb|''Tactica'']]\nThe supposed ''[[Book of the Eparch]]'' and the [[Kletorologion of Philotheos|''Kletorologion'' of Philotheos]] were also issued under Leo's name and testify to his government\u2019s interest in organization and the maintenance of public order.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 227\" /> The ''Book of the Eparch'' described the rules and regulations for trade and trade organizations in Constantinople, while the ''Kletorologion'' was an attempt to standardize officials and ranks at the Byzantine court.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 227\" /> Leo is also the author, or at least sponsor, of the [[Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise|''Tactica'']], a notable treatise on military operations.<ref name=\"Kazhdan, pg. 1211\">Kazhdan, pg. 1211</ref>\n\nSucceeding generations saw Leo as a prophet and a magician, and soon a collection of oracular poems and some short divinatory texts, the so-called ''[[Oracles of Leo the Wise]]'', at least in part based on earlier Greek sources, were attached to the Emperor's name in later centuries and were believed to foretell the future of the world.<ref name=\"Gregory, pg. 226\"/>\n\nFinally, Leo is credited with [[translation (relics)|translating]] the [[relics]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|St. Lazarus]] to Constantinople in the year 890.

In the context of traditional Chinese tea production terminology, fermentation refers to [[microbial fermentation]] (called 'piling'), and is typically applied after the tea leaves have been sufficiently dried and rolled.<ref name=\"Chen438\">{{harvp |Chen ZM|1991|p=438|loc=chpt. \"Manufacturing pu'er [\u666e\u6d31\u8336\u7684\u5236\u9020]\"}}</ref> As the tea undergoes controlled microbial fermentation, it also continues to [[oxidize]], which is also controlled, until the desired flavors are reached. This process produces tea known as \u9ed1\u8336 ''h\u0113ich\u00e1'' (lit. 'black tea') (which is different from 'western' ''[[black tea]]'' that is called \u7ea2\u8336 ''h\u00f3ngch\u00e1'' (lit. 'red tea') in China). Pu'er falls under a larger category of fermented teas commonly translated as ''dark teas''. \n\nTwo main styles of pu'er production exist: a traditional, longer production process known as ''sh\u0113ng'' (''raw'') pu'er and a modern, accelerated production process known as ''shou'' (''ripe'') pu'er. Pu'er traditionally begins with a raw product called \"rough\" (''m\u00e1o'') ''ch\u00e1'' (\u6bdb\u8336, lit. fuzzy/furry tea) and can be sold in this form or pressed into a number of shapes and sold as \"''sh\u0113ng ch\u00e1'' (\u751f\u8336, lit. raw tea). Both of these forms then undergo the complex process of gradual fermentation and maturation with time.

All types of pu'er can be stored to mature (in non-airtight containers) before consumption, which is why it is standard to label them, moreso than most other types of tea, with the year and region of production.\n\nThe flavour and health benefits of Pu\u2019er tea are related in part to its content of polyphenolic anti-oxidant molecules.

All types of pu'er tea are created from ''m\u00e1och\u00e1'' ([[wikt:\u6bdb|\u6bdb]][[wikt:\u8336|\u8336]]), a mostly [[Oxidation|unoxidized]] [[green tea]] processed from [[Camellia sinensis var. assamica|''Camellia sinensis'' var. ''assamica'']], which is the large leaf type of Chinese tea found in the mountains of southern and western Yunnan (in contrast to the small leaf type of tea used for typical green, oolong, black, and yellow teas found in the other parts of China).\n\nMaocha can be sold directly to market as loose leaf tea, compressed to produce \"raw\" ''sh\u0113ngch\u00e1'', naturally aged and matured for several years before being compressed to also produce \"raw\" ''sh\u0113ngch\u00e1'' or undergo Wo Dui ripening for several months prior to being compressed to produce \"ripe\" ''sh\u00f3uch\u00e1''. While unaged and unprocessed, M\u00e1och\u00e1 p\u01d4'\u011br is similar to green tea. Two subtle differences worth noting are that p\u01d4'\u011br is not produced from the small-leaf Chinese varietal but the broad-leaf varietal mostly found in the southern Chinese provinces and India. The second is that p\u01d4'\u011br leaves are picked as one bud and 3-4 leaves whilst [http://www.zaysan.com/evidence-based-benefits-of-green-tea/ green tea] is picked as one bud and 1-2 leaves. This means that older leaves contribute to the qualities of p\u01d4'\u011br tea.\n\nRipened or aged raw p\u01d4'\u011br has occasionally been mistakenly categorized as a subcategory of [[black tea]] due to the dark red color of its leaves and liquor. However, p\u01d4'\u011br in both its ripened and aged forms has undergone secondary oxidization and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] caused both by organisms growing in the tea and [[free-radical]] oxidation, thus making it a unique type of tea. This divergence in production style not only makes the flavor and texture of pu'er tea different but also results in a rather different chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor.\n\nThe fermented dark tea, h\u0113ich\u00e1 (\u9ed1\u8336), is one of the six classes of tea in China, and ''p\u01d4'\u011br'' is classified as a dark tea (defined as fermented), something which is resented by some who argue for a separate category for ''p\u01d4'\u011br'' tea.<ref>Cf. {{cite journal |author=S\u016b F\u0101nghu\u00e1 [\u82cf\u82b3\u534e] |trans-title=Discussion and analysis on whether Pu'er is a type of fermented (black) tea |title=Pu'er ch\u00e1 bu shu heich\u00e1 de pingxi |script-title=zh:\u666e\u6d31\u8336\u4e0d\u5c5e\u9ed1\u8336\u7684\u8bc4\u6790 |journal=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ch\u00e1y\u00e8 \u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6 [Chinese Tea] |year=2005 |issue=1 |pages=38\u201339}} For a rebuttal, see {{cite journal |author=Xi\u00e0 Ch\u00e9ngp\u00e9ng [\u590f\u6210\u9e4f] |trans-title= Pu'er tea is a type of fermented (black) tea |title=Pu'er ch\u00e1 jishu heich\u00e1 |script-title=zh:\u666e\u6d31\u8336\u5373\u5c5e\u9ed1\u8336 |journal=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ch\u00e1y\u00e8 \u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6 [Chinese Tea] |year=2005 |issue=4 |pages=45\u201346}}</ref> As of 2008, only the large-leaf variety from Yunnan can be called a ''p\u01d4'\u011br''.\n\n==Processing==\n\nPu'er is typically made through two steps. First, all leaves must be roughly processed into ''maocha'' to stop oxidation. From there it may be further processed by fermentation, or directly packaged.

It involves minimal processing and there is no fermentation involved.\n\nThe first step in making raw or ripened pu'er is picking appropriate tender leaves. Plucked leaves are handled gingerly to prevent bruising and unwanted oxidation. It is optional to wilt/wither the leaves after picking and it depends on the tea processor, as drying occurs at various stages of processing.<ref name=zhang2013app1/> If so, the leaves would be spread out in the sun, weather permitting, or a ventilated space to wilt and remove some of the water content.<ref name=\"chan2006\">{{cite book|title=First Step to Chinese Puerh Tea|author=Chan Kam Pong|date=November 2006|publisher=WuShing Books [\u4e94\u884c\u5716\u66f8\u51fa\u7248\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8]|location=[[Taipei, Taiwan|Taipei]]|language=English}} <!-- original editor incorrectly used isbn for The Art Of Tea (\u666e\u6d31\u58fa\u85dd) magazine, released concurrently by Wushing: 978-957-8964-33-4 --> <!-- www.amazon.com/First-Step-Chinese-Puerh-Tea/dp/9789578962 --> <!-- title in zh:\u7c21\u6613\u4e2d\u570b\u666e\u6d31\u8336 --></ref> On overcast or rainy days, the leaves will be wilted by light heating, a slight difference in processing that will affect the quality of the resulting ''maocha'' and pu'er.\n\n[[File:Pu-erh tea (detail).jpg|upright=0.68|thumb|Relatively young raw pu'er; note the grey and dark green tones]]\nThe leaves are then dry-roasted using a large [[wok]] in a process called \"killing the green\" ([[wikt:\u6bba|\u6bba]][[wikt:\u9752|\u9752]]; [[pinyin]]: ''sh\u0101 q\u012bng''), which arrests most [[enzyme activity]] in the leaf and prevents full oxidation.<ref name=\"zhang2013app1\"/>{{rp|207}} After pan-roasting, the leaves are rolled, rubbed, and shaped into strands through several steps to lightly bruise the tea and then left to dry in the sun. Unlike green tea produced in China which is dried with hot air after the pan-frying stage to completely kill enzyme activity, leaves used in the production of pu'er are not air-dried after pan-roasting, which leaves a small amount of enzymes which contribute a minor amount of oxidation to the leaves during sun-drying. The bruising of the tea is also important in helping this minimal oxidation to occur, and both of these steps are significant in contributing to the unique characteristics of pu'er tea.\n\nOnce dry, ''maocha'' can be sent directly to the factory to be pressed into raw pu'er, or to undergo further processing to make fermented or ripened pu'er.<ref name=\"zhang2013app1\"/>{{rp|208}}<!-- Ref removed - bad link and I searched the archived topspace and could not find anything on maocha: {{cite web |title=Making Mao Cha |work=TaoOfTea.com |author=Jonathan Sielaff |url=http://www.taooftea.com/display.php3?id=&num=33 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709170824/http://www.taooftea.com/display.php3?id=&num=33 |archivedate=2014-07-09}} --> Sometimes ''Mao Cha'' is sold directly as loose-leaf \"raw\" Sheng Cha or it can be matured in loose-leaf form, requiring only two to three years due to the faster rate of natural fermentation in an uncompressed state.

The bacterial and fungal cultures found in the fermenting piles were found to vary widely from factory to factory throughout Yunnan, consisting of multiple strains of ''[[Aspergillus]]'' spp., ''[[Penicillium]]'' spp., [[yeast]]s, and a wide range of other microflora.

First, a specific quantity of dry ''m\u00e1och\u00e1'' or ripened tea leaves pertaining to the final weight of the ''bingcha'' is weighed out. The dry tea is then lightly steamed in perforated cans to soften and make it more tacky. This will allow it to hold together and not crumble during compression. A ticket, called a \"''n\u00e8i f\u0113i''\" ([[wiktionary:\u5185|\u5185]][[wiktionary:\u98de|\u98de]]) or additional adornments, such as colored ribbons, are placed on or in the midst of the leaves and inverted into a cloth bag or wrapped in cloth. The pouch of tea is gathered inside the cloth bag and wrung into a ball, with the extra cloth tied or coiled around itself. This coil or knot is what produces the [[dimple]]d indentation at the reverse side of a tea cake when pressed. Depending on the shape of the pu'er being produced, a cotton bag may or may not be used. For instance, brick or square teas often are not compressed using bags.<ref name=\"ynttc\">{{cite web |trans-title=Authentic Yunnan Pu'er\u2013 Making Dry Pu'er Tea |script-title=zh:\u7eaf\u6b63\u7684\u4e91\u5357\u666e\u6d31\u8336/\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5e72\u4ed3\u666e\u6d31\u8336 |author=Y\u00e8 W\u011bi [\u53f6\u4f1f] |work=ynttc.com |url=http://www.ynttc.com/puerwenzhang/yunchamade.html  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301113618/http://www.ynttc.com/puerwenzhang/yunchamade.html |archivedate=2009-03-01}}</ref>{{better source |date=March 2018 |reason= ynttc.com is a commercial tea company}}\n\nPressing can be done by:\n* A press. In the past, hand lever presses were used, but were largely superseded by [[hydraulic press]]es. The press forces the tea into a metal form that is occasionally decorated with a motif in [[sunken-relief]]. Due to its efficiency, this method is used to make almost all forms of pressed pu'er. Tea can be pressed either with or without it being bagged, with the latter done by using a metal mould. Tightly compressed ''b\u01d0ng'', formed directly into a mold without bags using this method are known as ''ti\u00e9 b\u01d0ng'' ([[wiktionary:\u9435|\u9435]][[wiktionary:\u9905|\u9905]], literally \"iron cake/[[Hockey puck|puck]]\") due to its density and hardness. The taste of densely compressed raw pu'er is believed to benefit from careful aging for up to several decades.\n* A large heavy stone, carved into the shape of a short cylinder with a handle, simply weighs down a bag of tea on a wooden board. The tension from the bag and the weight of the stone together give the tea its rounded and sometimes non-uniform edge. This method of pressing is often referred to as: \"hand\" or \"stone-pressing\", and is how many [[artisanal]] ''pu'er b\u01d0ng'' are still manufactured.\n\nPressed pu'er is removed from the cloth bag and placed on latticed shelves, where they are allowed to air dry, which may take several weeks or months, depending on the wetness of the pressed cakes.<ref name=chan2006 /> The pu'er cakes are then individually wrapped by hand, and packed.\n\n===Fermentation===\nPu'er is a microbially fermented tea obtained through the action of molds, bacteria and yeasts on the harvested leaves of the tea plant. It is thus truly a fermented tea, whereas teas known in the west as black teas (known in China as Red teas) have only undergone large-scale oxidation through naturally occurring tea plant enzymes. Mislabelling the oxidation process as fermentation and thus naming black teas, such as Assam, Darjeeling or Keemun, as fermented teas has created endless confusion. Only tea such as pu'er, that has undergone microbial processing, can correctly be called a fermented tea.<ref name=\"moetal2008\">{{cite journal |last1=Mo|first1=Haizhen |last2=Zhu|first2=Yang |last3=Chen|first3= Zongmao |title=Microbial fermented tea \u2013 a potential source of natural food preservatives |journal=[[Trends in Food Science and Technology]] |year=2008 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=124\u2013130 |doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2007.10.001}}</ref>\n\nPu'er undergoes what is known as a solid-state fermentation where water activity is low to negligible.

Typically black tea is termed \"fully fermented\", which is incorrect as the process used to create black tea is oxidation and does not involve microbial activity. Black teas are fully oxidized, green teas are unoxidized, and Oolong teas are partially oxidized to varying degrees.\n\nAll pu'er teas undergo some oxidation during sun drying and then become either:\n#Fully fermented with microbes during a processing phase which is largely anaerobic, i.e. without the presence of oxygen. This phase is similar to composting and results in Shu (ripened) pu'er\n#Partly fermented by microbial action, and partly oxidized during the natural aging process resulting in Sheng (raw) pu'er. The aging process depends on how the sheng pu'er is stored, which determines the degree of fermentation and oxidization achieved.\n\nAccording to the production process, four main types of pu'er are commonly available on the market:\n*''Maocha'', green pu'er leaves sold in loose form as the raw material for making pressed pu'er. Badly processed ''maocha'' will produce an inferior pu'er.\n*Green/raw pu'er, pressed ''maocha'' that has not undergone additional processing; high quality green pu'er is highly sought by collectors.\n*Ripened/cooked pu'er, ''maocha'' that has undergone an accelerated fermentation process lasting 45 to 60 days on average.

Pu'er tea can come from three different cultivation methods:\n*Plantation bushes (''gu\u00e0nm\u00f9'', [[wiktionary:\u704c|\u704c]][[wiktionary:\u6728|\u6728]]; ''ta\u00edd\u00ec'', [[wiktionary:\u53f0|\u53f0]][[wiktionary:\u5730|\u5730]]): Cultivated tea bushes, from the seeds or cuttings of wild tea trees and planted in relatively low altitudes and flatter terrain. The tea produced from these plants are considered inferior due to the use of pesticides and [[Fertilizer|chemical fertilizer]] in cultivation, and the lack of pleasant flavors, and the presence of harsh bitterness and astringency from the tea.\n*\"Wild arbor\" trees (''y\u011bf\u00e0ng'', [[wiktionary:\u91ce|\u91ce]][[wiktionary:\u653e|\u653e]]): Most producers claim that their pu'er is from wild trees, but most use leaves from older plantations that were cultivated in previous generations that have gone feral due to the lack of care. These trees produce teas of better flavor due to the higher levels of [[secondary metabolite]]s produced in the tea tree. As well, the trees are typically cared for using organic practices, which includes the scheduled [[pruning]] of the trees in a manner similar to [[pollarding]]. Despite the good quality of their produced teas, \"wild arbor\" trees are not as prized as the truly wild trees.\n*''Wild trees'' (g\u016dsh\u00f9, [[wiktionary:\u53e4|\u53e4]][[wiktionary:\u6811|\u6811]]; literally \"old tree\"): Teas from old wild trees, grown without human intervention, are the highest valued pu'er teas. Such teas are valued for having deeper and more complex flavors, often with camphor or \"mint\" notes, said to be imparted by the many camphor trees that grow in the same environment as the wild tea trees. Young raw pu'er teas produced from the leaf tips of these trees also lack overwhelming astringency and bitterness often attributed to young pu'er. Pu'er made from the distinct but closely related so-called ''wild'' species ''[[Camellia taliensis]]'' can command a much higher price than pu'er made from the more common ''[[Camellia sinensis]].''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu|first1=Yang |last2=Yang|first2=Shi-xiong |last3=Ji|first3=Peng-zhang |last4=Gao|first4=Li-zhi |title=Phylogeography of ''Camellia taliensis'' (Theaceae) inferred from chloroplast and nuclear DNA: insights into evolutionary history and conservation |date=2012-06-21 |journal=[[BMC Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=92 |pages= 92|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-92|pmid=22716114 |pmc=3495649 }}</ref>\n\nDetermining whether or not a tea is wild is a challenging task, made more difficult through the inconsistent and unclear terminology and labeling in Chinese. Terms like ''y\u011bsh\u0113ng'' ([[wiktionary:\u91ce|\u91ce]][[wiktionary:\u751f|\u751f]]; literally \"wild\" or \"uncultivated\"), ''qi\u00e1om\u00f9'' ([[wiktionary:\u4e54|\u4e54]][[wiktionary:\u6728|\u6728]]; literally \"tall tree\"), ''y\u011bsh\u0113ng qi\u00e1om\u00f9'' ([[wiktionary:\u91ce|\u91ce]][[wiktionary:\u751f|\u751f]][[wiktionary:\u4e54|\u4e54]][[wiktionary:\u6728|\u6728]]; literally \"uncultivated trees\"), and ''g\u01d4sh\u00f9'' are found on the labels of cakes of both wild and \"wild arbor\" variety, and on blended cakes, which contain leaves from tea plants of various cultivations. These inconsistent and often misleading labels can easily confuse uninitiated tea buyers regardless of their grasp of the [[Chinese language]]. As well, the lack of specific information about tea leaf sources in the printed wrappers and identifiers that come with the pu'er cake makes identification of the tea a difficult task. Pu'er journals and similar annual guides such as ''The Profound World of Chi Tse'', ''Pu-erh Yearbook'', and ''Pu-erh Teapot Magazine'' contain credible sources for leaf information. Tea factories are generally honest about their leaf sources, but someone without access to tea factory or other information is often at the mercy of the middlemen or an unscrupulous vendor. Many pu'er aficionados seek out and maintain relationships with vendors who they feel they can trust to help mitigate the issue of finding the \"truth\" of the leaves.\n\nSadly, even in the best of circumstances, when a journal, factory information, and trustworthy vendor all align to assure a tea's genuinely wild leaf, fakes fill the market and make the issue even more complicated. Because collectors often doubt the reliability of written information, some believe certain physical aspects of the leaf can point to its cultivation. For example, drinkers cite the evidence of a truly wild old tree in a [[menthol]] effect (\"[[camphor]]\" in tea specialist terminology) supposedly caused by the [[Cinnamomum camphora|Camphor laurel]] trees that grow amongst wild tea trees in Yunnan's tea forests. As well, the presence of thick veins and sawtooth-edged on the leaves along with [[camphor]] flavor elements and taken as signifiers of wild tea.{{citation needed |date=March 2018 |reason=The shop houdeasianart.com was previously cited without specifying any article within}}\n\n===Grade===\nPu'er can be sorted into ten or more grades. Generally, grades are determined by leaf size and quality, with higher numbered grades meaning older/larger, broken, or less tender leaves. Grading is rarely consistent between factories, and first grade tea leaves may not necessarily produce first grade cakes. Different grades have different flavors; many bricks blend several grades chosen to balance flavors and strength.\n\n===Season===\nHarvest season also plays an important role in the flavor of pu'er. Spring tea is the most highly valued, followed by fall tea, and finally summer tea. Only rarely is pu'er produced in winter months, and often this is what is called \"early spring\" tea, as harvest and production follows the weather pattern rather than strict monthly guidelines.\n\n==Tea factories==\n[[Image:Menghai 2006 7742-protection ticket.jpg|thumb|upright=0.68|A Menghai microprinted ticket, first appearing in 2006]]\nFactories are generally responsible for the production of pu'er teas. While some individuals oversee small-scale production of high-quality tea, such as the Xizihao and Yanqinghao brands,{{citation needed |date=March 2018 |reason=The shop houdeasianart.com was previously cited without specifying any article within}} the majority of tea on the market is compressed by factories or tea groups. Until recently factories were all state-owned and under the supervision of the ''China National Native Produce & Animal Byproducts Import & Export Corporation'' (CNNP), Yunnan Tea Branch. Kunming Tea Factory, Menghai Tea Factory, Pu'er Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory are the most notable of these state-owned factories. While CNNP still operates today, few factories are [[Public ownership|state-owned]], and CNNP contracts out much production to privately owned factories.\n\nDifferent tea factories have earned good reputations. Menghai Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory, which date from the 1940s, have enjoyed good reputations, but in the twentyfirst century face competition from many of the newly emerging private factories. For example, [[Haiwan Tea Factory]], founded by former Menghai Factory owner Zhou Bing Liang in 1999,<ref name=Leseine>{{cite web |title=2005 Haiwan Lao Tong Zhi Label |year=2005 |author=Jing Tea Shop |url= http://www.jingteashop.com/pd_beeng_cha_lao.cfm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061018054159/http://www.jingteashop.com/pd_beeng_cha_lao.cfm |archivedate=2006-10-18}} <!--orig editor names author of jingteashop page as Sebastien Leseine, but no such name appears on the site--></ref> has a good reputation, as do [[Changtai Tea Group]], [[Mengku Tea Company]], and other new tea makers formed in the 1990s. However, due to production inconsistencies and variations in manufacturing techniques, the reputation of a tea company or factory can vary depending on the year or the specific cakes produced during a year.\n\nThe producing factory is often the first or second item listed when referencing a pu'er cake, the other being the year of production.\n\n==Recipes==\nTea factories, particularly formerly government-owned factories, produce many cakes using recipes for [[Tea blending and additives|tea blends]], indicated by a four-digit ''recipe number''. The first two digits of recipe numbers represent the year the recipe was first produced, the third digit represents the grade of leaves used in the recipe, and the last digit represents the factory. The number 7542, for example, would denote a recipe from 19''75'' using ''fourth''-grade tea leaf made by Menghai Tea Factory (represented by ''2'').\n*'''Factory numbers (fourth digit in recipe):'''\n*# Kunming Tea Factory\n*# Menghai Tea Factory aka Dayi\n*#  Xiaguan\n*# Lan Cang Tea Factory or Feng Qing Tea Factory\n*# Pu-erh Tea Factory (now Pu-erh Tea group Co.Ltd )\n*# Six Famous Tea Mountain Factory\n*# unknown / not specified\n*# Haiwan Tea Factory and Long Sheng Tea Factory\nTea of all shapes can be made by numbered recipe. Not all recipes are numbered, and not all cakes are made by recipe. The term \"recipe,\" it should be added, does not always indicate consistency, as the quality of some recipes change from year-to-year, as do the contents of the cake. Perhaps only the factories producing the recipes really know what makes them consistent enough to label by these numbers.\n\nOccasionally, a three digit code is attached to the recipe number by hyphenation. The first digit of this code represents the year the cake was produced, and the other two numbers indicate the production number within that year. For instance, the seven digit sequence ''8653-602'', would indicate the ''second'' production in 200''6'' of factory recipe 8653. Some productions of cakes are valued over others because production numbers can indicate if a tea was produced earlier or later in a season/year. This information allows one to be able to single out tea cakes produced using a better batch of ''m\u00e1och\u00e1''.\n\n==Tea packaging==\nPu'er tea is specially packaged for trade, identification, and storage. These attributes are used by tea drinkers and collectors to determine the authenticity of the pu'er tea.\n\n===Individual cakes===\n[[Image:Cake dissection.jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|Typical contents of a wrapped ''B\u012dngch\u00e1'']]\nPu'er tea cakes, or ''b\u012dngch\u00e1'', are almost always sold with a:<ref name=\"houdeinfo\">{{cite web |title=Pu-erh Information |year=2012 |work=Hou De Asian Art & Fine Tea <!--likely author=Guang Lee, who writes most posts on houdeblog.com, but he is not explicitly named here--> |url=http://www.houdeasianart.com/index.php?main_page=puerhinfo |accessdate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n* ''Wrapper'': Made usually from thin cotton cloth or cotton paper and shows the tea company/factory, the year of production, the region/mountain of harvest, the plant type, and the recipe number. The wrapper can also contain decals, logos and artwork. Occasionally, more than one wrapper will be used to wrap a pu'er cake.\n* ''N\u00e8i f\u0113i'' ([[wiktionary:\u5185|\u5185]][[wiktionary:\u98de|\u98de]] or [[wiktionary:\u5167|\u5167]][[wiktionary:\u98db|\u98db]]): A small ticket originally stuck on the tea cake but now usually embedded into the cake during pressing. It is usually used as proof, or a possible sign, to the authenticity of the tea. Some higher end pu'er cakes have more than one n\u00e8i f\u0113i embedded in the cake. The ticket usually indicates the tea factory and brand.\n* ''N\u00e8i pi\u00e0o'' ([[wiktionary:\u5185|\u5185]][[wiktionary:\u7968|\u7968]]): A larger description ticket or flyer packaged loose under the wrapper. Both aid in assuring the identity of the cake. It usually indicates factory and brand. As well, many ''n\u00e8i pi\u00e0o'' contain a summary of the tea factories' history and any additional laudatory statements concerning the tea, from its taste and rarity, to its ability to cure [[disease]]s and effect [[weight loss]].\n* ''B\u012dng'': The tea cake itself. Tea cakes or other compressed pu'er can be made up of two or more grades of tea, typically with higher grade leaves on the outside of the cake and lower grades or broken leaves in the center. This is done to improve the appearance of the tea cake and improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.\n\n[[File:Tong of pu'er tea (2006 7742 recipe by Menghai Tea Factory).jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|A ''t\u01d2ng'' of recipe 7742 tea cakes wrapped in bamboo shoot husks]]\nRecently, ''n\u00e8i f\u0113i'' have become more important in identifying and preventing [[counterfeit]]s. Menghai Tea Factory in particular has begun [[microprinting]] and [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]] their tickets in an effort to curb the growth of counterfeit teas found in the marketplace in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some ''n\u00e8i f\u0113i'' also include vintage year and are production-specific to help identify the cake and prevent counterfeiting through a surfeit of different brand labels.\n\nCounterfeit pu'er is common. The practices include claiming the tea is older than it actually is, misidentifying the origin of the leaf as Yunnan instead of a non-Yunnan region, labeling terrace tea as forest tea, and selling green tea instead of raw pu'er. The interpretation of the packing of pu'er is usually dependent on the consumer's knowledge and negotiation between the consumer and trader.\n\n===Wholesale===\nWhen bought in large quantities, pu'er tea is generally sold in stacks, referred to as a ''t\u01d2ng'' ([[wiktionary:\u7b52|\u7b52]]), which are wrapped in [[bamboo]] [[bamboo shoot|shoot]] husks, bamboo stem husks, or coarse paper. Some tongs of vintage pu'er will contain a ''t\u01d2ng pi\u00e0o'' ([[wiktionary:\u7b52|\u7b52]][[wiktionary:\u7968|\u7968]]), or tong ticket, but it is less common to find them in productions past the year 2000.<ref name= chan2006 /> The number of ''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1'' in a ''t\u01d2ng'' varies depending on the weight of individual ''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1''. For instance one ''t\u01d2ng'' can contain:\n* Seven 357\u2013500g ''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1'''',\n* Five 250g mini-''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1''''\n* Ten 100g mini-''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1''''\n\nTwelve ''t\u01d2ng'' are referred to as being one ''ji\u00e0n'' ([[wiktionary:\u4ef6|\u4ef6]]), although some producers/factories vary how many ''t\u01d2ng'' equal one ''ji\u00e0n''. A ''ji\u00e0n'' of tea, which is bound together in a loose bamboo basket, will usually have a large ''batch ticket'' ([[wiktionary:\u5927|\u5927]][[wiktionary:\u7968|\u7968]]; pinyin: ''d\u00e0pi\u00e0o'') affixed to its side that will indicate information such as the batch number of the tea in a season, the production quantities, tea type, and the factory where it was produced.<ref name=chan2006 />\n\n==Aging and storage==\nPu'er teas of all varieties, shapes, and cultivation can be aged to improve their flavor, but the tea's physical properties will affect the speed of aging as well as its quality. These properties include:\n* ''Leaf quality'': The most important factor, arguably, is leaf quality. ''Maocha'' that has been improperly processed will not age to the level of finesse as properly processed ''maocha''. The grade and cultivation of the leaf also greatly affect its quality, and thus its aging.\n* ''Compression'': The tighter a tea is compressed, the slower it will age. In this respect, looser hand- and stone-pressed pu'er teas will age more quickly than denser hydraulic-pressed pu'er.\n* ''Shape and size'' : The more surface area, the faster the tea will age. ''B\u01d0ngch\u00e1'' and ''zhuancha'' thus age more quickly than ''golden melon'', ''tuocha'', or ''jincha''. Larger ''bingcha'' age slower than smaller ''''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1'''''', and so forth.\n\nJust as important as the tea's properties, [[environmental factor]]s for the tea's storage also affect how quickly and successfully a tea ages. They include:\n* ''Air flow'': Regulates the oxygen content surrounding the tea and removes odors from the aging tea. Dank, stagnant air will lead to dank, stale smelling aged tea. Wrapping a tea in plastic will eventually arrest the aging process.\n* ''Odors'': Tea stored in the presence of strong odors will acquire them, sometimes for the duration of their \"lifetime.\" Airing out pu'er teas can reduce these odors, though often not completely.\n* ''Humidity'' : The higher the humidity, the faster the tea will age. Liquid water accumulating on tea may accelerate the aging process but can also cause the growth of mold or make the flavor of the tea less desirable. 60\u201385% humidity is recommended.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to store your pu-erh tea |year=2007 |author=Jing Tea Shop |url= http://www.jingteashop.com/puerh_storage.cfm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518224846/http://www.jingteashop.com/puerh_storage.cfm |archivedate=2007-05-18}} Jing Tea Shop(2005)</ref> It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating humidity levels.\n* ''Sunlight'': Tea that is exposed to sunlight dries out prematurely, and often becomes bitter.\n* ''Temperature'': Teas should not be subjected to high heat since undesirable flavors will develop. However at low temperatures, the aging of pu'er tea will slow down drastically. It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating temperature.\n\nWhen preserved as part of a ''tong'', the material of the ''tong'' wrapper, whether it is made of bamboo shoot husks, bamboo leaves, or thick paper, can also affect the quality of the aging process. The packaging methods change the environmental factors and may even contribute to the taste of the tea itself.\n\nFurther to what has been mentioned it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing methods used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each tea will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they have peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.\n\n===Raw pu'er===\nOver time, raw pu'er acquires an earthy flavor due to slow oxidation and other, possibly microbial processes. However, this oxidation is not analogous to the oxidation that results in green, [[oolong]], or black tea, because the process is not catalyzed by the plant's own enzymes but rather by fungal, bacterial, or autooxidation influences. Pu'er flavors can change dramatically over the course of the aging process, resulting in a brew tasting strongly earthy but clean and smooth, reminiscent of the smell of rich garden soil or an autumn leaf pile, sometimes with roasted or sweet undertones. Because of its ability to age without losing \"quality\", well aged good pu'er gains value over time in the same way that aged roasted oolong does.<ref name=\"lee2006\">{{cite magazine|author=Guang Chung Lee|year=2006|title=The Varieties of Formosa Oolong|url=http://www.the-art-of-tea.com/viewissue.php?url=aXNzdWVfbm89MQ==|magazine=The Art of Tea <!--\u666e\u6d31\u58fa\u85dd isbn=9789578964334-->|language=English|location=[[Taipei, Taiwan|Taipei]]|publisher=WuShing Books [\u4e94\u884c\u5716\u66f8\u51fa\u7248\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8]|issue=1|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071007011806/http://www.the-art-of-tea.com/viewissue.php?url=aXNzdWVfbm89MQ==|archivedate=2007-10-07}} <!--orig accessdate=2006-12-12--></ref>\n\nRaw pu'er can undergo \"wet storage\" (''sh\u012bc\u0101ng'', [[wiktionary:\u6e7f|\u6e7f]][[wiktionary:\u4ed3|\u4ed3]]) and \"dry storage\" (''g\u0101nc\u0101ng'' [[wiktionary:\u5e72|\u5e72]][[wiktionary:\u4ed3|\u4ed3]]), with teas that have undergone the latter ageing more slowly, but thought to show more complexity. Dry storage involves keeping the tea in \"comfortable\" temperature and humidity, thus allowing the tea to age slowly. Wet or \"humid\" storage refers to the storage of pu'er tea in humid environments, such as those found naturally in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan.\n\nThe practice of \"Pen Shui\" [[wiktionary:\u55b7|\u55b7]][[wiktionary:\u6c34|\u6c34]] involves spraying the tea with water and allowing it dry off in a humid environment. This process speeds up oxidation and microbial conversion, which only loosely mimics the quality of natural dry storage aged pu'er. \"Pen Shui\" [[wiktionary:\u55b7|\u55b7]][[wiktionary:\u6c34|\u6c34]] pu'er not only does not acquire the nuances of slow aging, it can also be hazardous to drink because of mold, yeast, and bacteria cultures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nPu'er properly stored in different environments can develop different tastes at different rates due to environmental differences in ambient humidity, temperature, and odors.<ref name=chan2006 /> For instance, similar batches of pu'er stored in the different environments of [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] are known to age very differently. Because the process of aging pu'er is lengthy, and teas may change owners several times, a batch of pu'er may undergo different aging conditions, even swapping wet and dry storage conditions, which can drastically alter its flavor. Raw pu'er can be ruined by storage at very high temperatures, or exposure to direct contact with sunlight, heavy air flow, liquid water, or unpleasant smells.\n\nAlthough low to moderate air flow is important for producing a good-quality aged raw pu'er, it is generally agreed by most collectors and connoisseurs that raw pu'er tea cakes older than 30 years should not be further exposed to \"open\" air since it would result in the loss of flavors or degradation in mouthfeel. The tea should instead be preserved by wrapping or [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealing]] it in plastic wrapping or ideally glass.\n\n===Ripe pu'er===\nSince the ripening process was developed to imitate aged raw pu'er, many arguments surround the idea of whether aging ripened pu'er is desirable. Mostly, the issue rests on whether aging ripened pu'er will, better or worse, alter the flavor of the tea.\n\nIt is often recommended to age ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping ripened pu'er longer than 10 to 15 years makes little sense, stating that the tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu'er indeed does take on nuances through aging,<ref name=\"houdeinfo\"/> and point to side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages. Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.\n\n===Vintaging===\nThe common misconception is that all types of pu'er tea will improve in taste\u2014and therefore gain in value\u2014as they get older. There are many requisite variables for a pu'er tea to age beautifully. Further, the ripe (shu) pu'er will not evolve as dramatically as the raw (sheng) type will over time due to secondary oxidation and fermentation.\n\nAs with [[aging wine]], only finely made and properly stored teas will improve and increase in value. Similarly, only a small percentage of teas will improve over a long period of time.\n\nFrom 2008 Pu'er prices dropped dramatically. Investment-grade Pu'er did not drop as much as the more common varieties. Many producers made large losses, and some decided to leave the industry altogether.<ref name=jacobs2009>{{cite news |title=A County In China Sees Its Fortunes In Tea Leaves Until a Bubble Bursts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-01-16 |last=Jacobs|first=Andrew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/world/asia/17tea.html |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\nPreparation of ''pu'erh'' involves first separating a well-sized<!--what does \"well-sized\" mean?--> portion of the compressed tea for brewing. This can be done by flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration.<ref name=\"houdeinfo\"/> A ''pu'erh knife'', which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid [[letter opener]], is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as ''tuocha'' or mushroom ''pu'erh'' are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling of the cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.\n\n''Pu'erh'' is generally expected to be served [[Gongfu tea ceremony|Gongfu]] style, generally in ''[[Yixing clay|Yixing]] [[teaware]]'' or in a type of Chinese [[teacup]] called a ''[[gaiwan]]''. Optimum temperatures are generally regarded to be around 95&nbsp;\u00b0C for lower quality ''pu'erh''s and 85\u201389&nbsp;\u00b0C for good ripened and aged raw ''pu'erh''. The tea is steeped for 12 to 30 seconds in the first few infusions, increasing to 2 to 10 minutes in the last infusions. The prolonged steeping sometimes used in the west can produce dark, bitter, and unpleasant brews. Quality aged ''pu'erh'' can yield many more infusions, with different flavor nuances when brewed in the traditional Gong-Fu method.\n\nBecause of the prolonged fermentation in ripened ''pu'erh'' and slow oxidization of aged raw ''pu'erh'', these teas often lack the bitter, astringent properties of other teas, and can be brewed much stronger and repeatedly, with some claiming 20 or more infusions of tea from one pot of leaves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} On the other hand, young raw ''pu'erh'' is known and expected to be strong and aromatic, yet very bitter and somewhat astringent when brewed, since these characteristics are believed to produce better aged raw ''pu'erh''.\n\n===Judging quality===\n[[Image:Wetstored-ripe.jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|Spent leaves of badly stored shu pu'er. Note the crumbling leaf faces that are barely held together by leaf veins]]\nQuality of the tea can be determined through inspecting the dried leaves, the tea liquor, or the spent tea leaves. The \"true\" quality of a specific batch of ''pu'erh'' can ultimately only be revealed when the tea is brewed and tasted. Although not concrete and sometimes dependent on preference, there are several general indicators of quality:\n* ''Dried tea'': There should be a lack of twigs, extraneous matter and white or dark mold spots on the surface of the compressed ''pu'erh''. The leaves should ideally be whole, visually distinct, and not appear muddy. The leaves may be dry and fragile, but not powdery. Good tea should be quite fragrant, even when dry. Good pressed pu'er cakes often have a matte sheen on the surface, though this is not necessarily a sole indicator of quality.\n* ''Liquor'': The tea liquor of both raw and ripe ''pu'erh'' should never appear cloudy. Well-aged raw ''pu'erh'' and well-crafted ripe ''pu'erh'' tea may produce a dark reddish liquor, reminiscent of a dried [[jujube]], but in either case the liquor should not be opaque, \"muddy,\" or black in color. The flavors of ''pu'erh'' liquors should persist and be revealed throughout separate or subsequent infusions, and never abruptly disappear, since this could be the sign of added flavorants.\n**''Young raw pu'erh'': The ideal liquors should be aromatic with a light but distinct odors of [[camphor]], rich herbal notes like [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]], fragrance floral notes, hints of [[dried fruit]] aromas such as preserved [[plum]]s, and should exhibit only some grassy notes to the likes of fresh [[sencha]]. Young raw pu'er may sometimes be quite bitter and astringent, but should also exhibit a pleasant mouthfeel and \"sweet\" aftertaste, referred to as ''g\u0101n'' (\u7518) and ''h\u00faig\u0101n'' (\u56de\u7518).\n**''Aged raw pu'erh'': Aged pu'er should never smell moldy, musty, or strongly fungal, though some ''pu'erh'' drinkers consider these smells to be unoffensive or even enjoyable. The smell of aged ''pu'erh'' may vary, with an \"aged\" but not \"stuffy\" odor. The taste of aged raw ''pu'erh'' or ripe ''pu'erh'' should be smooth, with slight hints of bitterness, and lack a biting astringency or any off-sour tastes. The element of taste is an important indicator of aged ''pu'erh'' quality, the texture should be rich and thick and should have very distinct ''g\u0101n'' (\u7518) and ''h\u00faig\u0101n'' (\u56de\u7518) on the tongue and cheeks, which together induces salivation and leaves a \"feeling\" in the back of the throat.\n* ''Spent tea'': Whole leaves and leaf bud systems should be easily seen and picked out of the wet spent tea, with a limited amount of broken fragments. Twigs and the fruits of the tea plant should not be found in the spent tea leaves; however, animal (and human) hair, strings, [[rice]] grains and chaff may occasionally be included in the tea.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The leaves should not crumble when rubbed, and with ripened ''pu'erh'', it should not resemble compost. Aged raw ''pu'erh'' should have leaves that unfurl when brewed while leaves of most ripened ''pu'erh'' will generally remain closed.\n\n===Practices===\nIn [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] culture, ''pu'erh'' is known as ''po-lay'' (or ''bo-lay'') tea ({{zh|cy=bou2 nei2}}). Among the Cantonese long settled in California, it is called ''bo-nay'' or ''po-nay'' tea.<!--Can it please be explained how \"bo-nay\" came from \"bo-lay\" and is this also in Guangdong/Hongkong/Taishan or only in California?--> It is often drunk during [[dim sum]] meals, as it is believed to help with digestion. It is not uncommon to add dried [[sweet osmanthus|osmanthus]] flowers, [[pomelo]] rinds, or [[chrysanthemum]] flowers into brewing pu'er tea in order to add a light, fresh fragrance to the tea liquor. Pu'er with chrysanthemum is the most common pairing, and referred as ''guk pou'' or ''guk bou'' ([[wiktionary:\u83ca|\u83ca]][[wiktionary:\u666e|\u666e]]; {{zh|cy=guk1 pou2}}; pinyin: j\u00fa p\u01d4).\n\nSometimes [[wolfberry|wolfberries]] are brewed with the tea, plumping in the process.\n\n==Health==\n{{See also|Potential effects of tea on health}}\nPu'er tea is widely sold, by itself or in blends, with unsubstantiated claims that it promotes loss of [[body weight]] in humans.\nUnlike pu'er, some Bianxiao brick tea has been found to contain very high levels of [[fluorine]].

This process produces tea known as \u9ed1\u8336 ''h\u0113ich\u00e1'' (lit. 'black tea') (which is different from 'western' ''[[black tea]]'' that is called \u7ea2\u8336 ''h\u00f3ngch\u00e1'' (lit.

All types of pu'er tea are created from ''m\u00e1och\u00e1'' ([[wikt:\u6bdb|\u6bdb]][[wikt:\u8336|\u8336]]), a mostly [[Oxidation|unoxidized]] [[green tea]] processed from [[Camellia sinensis var. assamica|''Camellia sinensis'' var. ''assamica'']], which is the large leaf type of Chinese tea found in the mountains of southern and western Yunnan (in contrast to the small leaf type of tea used for typical green, oolong, black, and yellow teas found in the other parts of China).\n\nMaocha can be sold directly to market as loose leaf tea, compressed to produce \"raw\" ''sh\u0113ngch\u00e1'', naturally aged and matured for several years before being compressed to also produce \"raw\" ''sh\u0113ngch\u00e1'' or undergo Wo Dui ripening for several months prior to being compressed to produce \"ripe\" ''sh\u00f3uch\u00e1''. While unaged and unprocessed, M\u00e1och\u00e1 p\u01d4'\u011br is similar to green tea. Two subtle differences worth noting are that p\u01d4'\u011br is not produced from the small-leaf Chinese varietal but the broad-leaf varietal mostly found in the southern Chinese provinces and India. The second is that p\u01d4'\u011br leaves are picked as one bud and 3-4 leaves whilst green tea is picked as one bud and 1-2 leaves. This means that older leaves contribute to the qualities of p\u01d4'\u011br tea.\n\nRipened or aged raw p\u01d4'\u011br has occasionally been mistakenly categorized as a subcategory of [[black tea]] due to the dark red color of its leaves and liquor. However, p\u01d4'\u011br in both its ripened and aged forms has undergone secondary oxidization and [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] caused both by organisms growing in the tea and [[free-radical]] oxidation, thus making it a unique type of tea. This divergence in production style not only makes the flavor and texture of pu'er tea different but also results in a rather different chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor.\n\nThe fermented dark tea, h\u0113ich\u00e1 (\u9ed1\u8336), is one of the six classes of tea in China, and ''p\u01d4'\u011br'' is classified as a dark tea (defined as fermented), something which is resented by some who argue for a separate category for ''p\u01d4'\u011br'' tea.<ref>Cf. {{cite journal |author=S\u016b F\u0101nghu\u00e1 [\u82cf\u82b3\u534e] |trans-title=Discussion and analysis on whether Pu'er is a type of fermented (black) tea |title=Pu'er ch\u00e1 bu shu heich\u00e1 de pingxi |script-title=zh:\u666e\u6d31\u8336\u4e0d\u5c5e\u9ed1\u8336\u7684\u8bc4\u6790 |journal=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ch\u00e1y\u00e8 \u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6 [Chinese Tea] |year=2005 |issue=1 |pages=38\u201339}} For a rebuttal, see {{cite journal |author=Xi\u00e0 Ch\u00e9ngp\u00e9ng [\u590f\u6210\u9e4f] |trans-title= Pu'er tea is a type of fermented (black) tea |title=Pu'er ch\u00e1 jishu heich\u00e1 |script-title=zh:\u666e\u6d31\u8336\u5373\u5c5e\u9ed1\u8336 |journal=Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 ch\u00e1y\u00e8 \u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6 [Chinese Tea] |year=2005 |issue=4 |pages=45\u201346}}</ref> As of 2008, only the large-leaf variety from Yunnan can be called a ''p\u01d4'\u011br''.\n\n==Processing==\n\nPu'er is typically made through two steps. First, all leaves must be roughly processed into ''maocha'' to stop oxidation. From there it may be further processed by fermentation, or directly packaged.

It involves minimal processing and there is no fermentation involved.\n\nThe first step in making raw or ripened pu'er is picking appropriate tender leaves. Plucked leaves are handled gingerly to prevent bruising and unwanted oxidation. It is optional to wilt/wither the leaves after picking and it depends on the tea processor, as drying occurs at various stages of processing.<ref name=zhang2013app1/> If so, the leaves would be spread out in the sun, weather permitting, or a ventilated space to wilt and remove some of the water content.<ref name=\"chan2006\">{{cite book|title=First Step to Chinese Puerh Tea|author=Chan Kam Pong|date=November 2006|publisher=WuShing Books [\u4e94\u884c\u5716\u66f8\u51fa\u7248\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8]|location=[[Taipei, Taiwan|Taipei]]|language=English}} <!-- original editor incorrectly used isbn for The Art Of Tea (\u666e\u6d31\u58fa\u85dd) magazine, released concurrently by Wushing: 978-957-8964-33-4 --> <!-- www.amazon.com/First-Step-Chinese-Puerh-Tea/dp/9789578962 --> <!-- title in zh:\u7c21\u6613\u4e2d\u570b\u666e\u6d31\u8336 --></ref> On overcast or rainy days, the leaves will be wilted by light heating, a slight difference in processing that will affect the quality of the resulting ''maocha'' and pu'er.\n\n[[File:Pu-erh tea (detail).jpg|upright=0.68|thumb|Relatively young raw pu'er; note the grey and dark green tones]]\nThe leaves are then dry-roasted using a large [[wok]] in a process called \"killing the green\" ([[wikt:\u6bba|\u6bba]][[wikt:\u9752|\u9752]]; [[pinyin]]: ''sh\u0101 q\u012bng''), which arrests most [[enzyme activity]] in the leaf and prevents full oxidation.<ref name=\"zhang2013app1\"/>{{rp|207}} After pan-roasting, the leaves are rolled, rubbed, and shaped into strands through several steps to lightly bruise the tea and then left to dry in the sun. Unlike green tea produced in China which is dried with hot air after the pan-frying stage to completely kill enzyme activity, leaves used in the production of pu'er are not air-dried after pan-roasting, which leaves a small amount of enzymes which contribute a minor amount of oxidation to the leaves during sun-drying. The bruising of the tea is also important in helping this minimal oxidation to occur, and both of these steps are significant in contributing to the unique characteristics of pu'er tea.\n\nOnce dry, ''maocha'' can be sent directly to the factory to be pressed into raw pu'er, or to undergo further processing to make fermented or ripened pu'er.<ref name=\"zhang2013app1\"/>{{rp|208}}<!-- Ref removed - bad link and I searched the archived topspace and could not find anything on maocha: {{cite web |title=Making Mao Cha |work=TaoOfTea.com |author=Jonathan Sielaff |url=http://www.taooftea.com/display.php3?id=&num=33 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709170824/http://www.taooftea.com/display.php3?id=&num=33 |archivedate=2014-07-09}} --> Sometimes ''Mao Cha'' is sold directly as loose-leaf \"raw\" Sheng Cha or it can be matured in loose-leaf form, requiring only two to three years due to the faster rate of natural fermentation in an uncompressed state. This tea is then pressed into numerous shapes and sold as a more matured \"raw\" Sheng Cha.\n\n===Ripe pu'er===\n\"Ripened\" Shu Cha (\u719f\u8336) tea is pressed ''maocha'' that has been specially processed to imitate aged \"raw\" Sheng Cha tea. Although it is also known in English as cooked pu'er, the process does not actually employ cooking to imitate the aging process. The term may be due to inaccurate translation, as ''sh\u00f3u'' (\u719f) means both \"fully cooked\" and \"fully ripened\".\n\nThe process used to convert ''m\u00e1och\u00e1'' into ripened pu'er manipulates conditions to approximate the result of the aging process by prolonged bacterial and fungal fermentation in a warm humid environment under controlled conditions, a technique called ''W\u00f2 Du\u012b'' ([[wikt:\u6e25|\u6e25]][[wikt:\u5806|\u5806]], \"wet piling\" in [[English language|English]]), which involves piling, dampening, and turning the tea leaves in a manner much akin to [[composting]].<ref name=\"teahub2013\"/>\n\nThe piling, wetting, and mixing of the piled ''m\u00e1och\u00e1'' ensures even fermentation. The bacterial and fungal cultures found in the fermenting piles were found to vary widely from factory to factory throughout Yunnan, consisting of multiple strains of ''[[Aspergillus]]'' spp., ''[[Penicillium]]'' spp., [[yeast]]s, and a wide range of other microflora. Control over the multiple variables in the ripening process, particularly humidity and the growth of ''Aspergillus'' spp., is key in producing ripened pu'er of high quality.<ref name=\"chenetal2006\">{{cite journal |author1=Ch\u00e9n K\u011b-K\u011b [\u9648\u53ef\u53ef] |author2=Zh\u016b H\u00f3ng-T\u0101o [\u6731\u5b8f\u6d9b] |author3=W\u00e1ng D\u014dng [\u738b\u4e1c] |author4=Zh\u0101ng Y\u01d0ng-J\u016bn [\u5f20\u9896\u541b] |author5=Y\u00e1ng Ch\u00f3ng-R\u00e9n [\u6768\u5d07\u4ec1] |year=2006 |script-title=zh:\u666e\u6d31\u719f\u8336\u540e\u53d1\u9175\u52a0\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f2\u9709\u83cc\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9274\u5b9a |trans-title=Isolation and identification of Aspergillus species from the post fermentative process of Pu-Er ripe tea |journal=Acta Botanica Yunnanica [\u4e91\u5357\u690d\u7269\u7814\u7a76] |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=123\u2013126 |url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-YOKE200602005.htm |accessdate=2018-03-23}} <!-- url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/cba/617373 --></ref><ref name=\"tianetal2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Tian|first1=Jianqing |last2=Zhu|first2=Zixiang |last3=Wu|first3=Bing |last4=Wang|first4=Lin |last5=Liu|first5=Xingzhong |title=Bacterial and fungal communities in Pu'er tea samples of different ages |journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=78 |issue=8 |pages=M1249\u20131256 |date=2013-08-19 |pmid=23957415 |doi=10.1111/1750-3841.12218}}</ref> Poor control in fermentation/oxidation process can result in bad ripened pu'er, characterized by badly decomposed leaves and an aroma and texture reminiscent of [[compost]].

The tea is sold both in flattened and loose form. Some tea collectors believe \"ripened\" Shu Cha should not be aged for more than a decade.\n\nWet pile fermented pu'er has higher levels of caffeine and much higher levels of [[gallic acid]] compared with traditionally aged raw pu'er.

First, a specific quantity of dry ''m\u00e1och\u00e1'' or ripened tea leaves pertaining to the final weight of the ''bingcha'' is weighed out. The dry tea is then lightly steamed in perforated cans to soften and make it more tacky. This will allow it to hold together and not crumble during compression. A ticket, called a \"''n\u00e8i f\u0113i''\" ([[wiktionary:\u5185|\u5185]][[wiktionary:\u98de|\u98de]]) or additional adornments, such as colored ribbons, are placed on or in the midst of the leaves and inverted into a cloth bag or wrapped in cloth. The pouch of tea is gathered inside the cloth bag and wrung into a ball, with the extra cloth tied or coiled around itself. This coil or knot is what produces the [[dimple]]d indentation at the reverse side of a tea cake when pressed. Depending on the shape of the pu'er being produced, a cotton bag may or may not be used.

In the past, hand lever presses were used, but were largely superseded by [[hydraulic press]]es. The press forces the tea into a metal form that is occasionally decorated with a motif in [[sunken-relief]]. Due to its efficiency, this method is used to make almost all forms of pressed pu'er. Tea can be pressed either with or without it being bagged, with the latter done by using a metal mould. Tightly compressed ''b\u01d0ng'', formed directly into a mold without bags using this method are known as ''ti\u00e9 b\u01d0ng'' ([[wiktionary:\u9435|\u9435]][[wiktionary:\u9905|\u9905]], literally \"iron cake/[[Hockey puck|puck]]\") due to its density and hardness. The taste of densely compressed raw pu'er is believed to benefit from careful aging for up to several decades.\n* A large heavy stone, carved into the shape of a short cylinder with a handle, simply weighs down a bag of tea on a wooden board. The tension from the bag and the weight of the stone together give the tea its rounded and sometimes non-uniform edge. This method of pressing is often referred to as: \"hand\" or \"stone-pressing\", and is how many [[artisanal]] ''pu'er b\u01d0ng'' are still manufactured.\n\nPressed pu'er is removed from the cloth bag and placed on latticed shelves, where they are allowed to air dry, which may take several weeks or months, depending on the wetness of the pressed cakes.<ref name=chan2006 /> The pu'er cakes are then individually wrapped by hand, and packed.\n\n===Fermentation===\nPu'er is a microbially fermented tea obtained through the action of molds, bacteria and yeasts on the harvested leaves of the tea plant. It is thus truly a fermented tea, whereas teas known in the west as black teas (known in China as Red teas) have only undergone large-scale oxidation through naturally occurring tea plant enzymes. Mislabelling the oxidation process as fermentation and thus naming black teas, such as Assam, Darjeeling or Keemun, as fermented teas has created endless confusion.

Larger specimens of this shape are sometimes called \"human-head tea\" ([[wikt:\u4eba|\u4eba]][[wikt:\u982d|\u982d]][[wikt:\u8336|\u8336]]), due in part to its size and shape, and because in the past it was often presented in court in a similar manner to severed heads of enemies or criminals.\n|}\n\n===Process and oxidation===\nPu'er teas are often collectively classified in Western tea markets as post-fermentation, and in Eastern  markets as black teas, but there is general confusion due to improper use of the terms \"oxidation\" and \"fermentation\". Typically black tea is termed \"fully fermented\", which is incorrect as the process used to create black tea is oxidation and does not involve microbial activity. Black teas are fully oxidized, green teas are unoxidized, and Oolong teas are partially oxidized to varying degrees.\n\nAll pu'er teas undergo some oxidation during sun drying and then become either:\n#Fully fermented with microbes during a processing phase which is largely anaerobic, i.e. without the presence of oxygen. This phase is similar to composting and results in Shu (ripened) pu'er\n#Partly fermented by microbial action, and partly oxidized during the natural aging process resulting in Sheng (raw) pu'er. The aging process depends on how the sheng pu'er is stored, which determines the degree of fermentation and oxidization achieved.\n\nAccording to the production process, four main types of pu'er are commonly available on the market:\n*''Maocha'', green pu'er leaves sold in loose form as the raw material for making pressed pu'er. Badly processed ''maocha'' will produce an inferior pu'er.\n*Green/raw pu'er, pressed ''maocha'' that has not undergone additional processing; high quality green pu'er is highly sought by collectors.\n*Ripened/cooked pu'er, ''maocha'' that has undergone an accelerated fermentation process lasting 45 to 60 days on average. Badly fermented ''maocha'' will create a muddy tea with fishy and sour flavors indicative of inferior aged pu'er.\n*Aged raw pu'er, a tea that has undergone a slow secondary oxidation and microbial fermentation. Although all types of pu'er can be aged, the pressed raw pu'er is typically the most highly regarded, since aged ''maocha'' and ripened pu'er both lack a clean and assertive taste.\n\n===Regions===\n\n====Yunnan====\nPu'er is produced in almost every county and prefecture in the province. Proper pu'er is sometimes considered to be limited to that produced in [[Pu'er City]].\n\n=====Six Great Tea Mountains=====\nThe best known pu'er areas are the Six Great Tea Mountains ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:\u516d|\u516d]][[wiktionary:\u5927|\u5927]][[wiktionary:\u8336|\u8336]][[wiktionary:\u5c71|\u5c71]]|p=li\u00f9 d\u00e0 ch\u00e1 sh\u0101n}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Forbes|first1=Andrew |last2=Henley|first2=David |title=China's Ancient Tea Horse Road |chapter=Six Great Tea Mountains |year=2011 |publisher=[[Cognoscenti Books]] |location=[[Chiang Mai]] |language=English |isbn=9781300464860 <!--asin=B005DQV7Q2-->}}</ref>), a group of mountains in [[Xishuangbanna]], Yunnan, renowned for their climates and environments, which not only provide excellent growing conditions for pu'er, but also produce unique taste profiles (akin to [[terroir]] in [[wine]]) in the produced pu'er tea.

The standard has been disputed, particularly by producers from [[Guangdong]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Tempest over tea: What is the true Puer? |author=Shen Jingting |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2009-06/15/content_8286028.htm |date=2009-06-15 |work=[[China Daily]] |accessdate=2018-03-23}}</ref> Fermented tea in the pu'er style made outside of Yunnan is often branded as \"dark tea\" in light of this standard.\n\n====Other regions====\nIn addition to China, border regions touching Yunnan in [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Burma]] are also known to produce pu'er tea, though little of this makes its way to the Chinese or international markets.\n\n===Cultivation===\nPerhaps equally or even more important than region or even grade in classifying pu'er is the method of cultivation. Pu'er tea can come from three different cultivation methods:\n*Plantation bushes (''gu\u00e0nm\u00f9'', [[wiktionary:\u704c|\u704c]][[wiktionary:\u6728|\u6728]]; ''ta\u00edd\u00ec'', [[wiktionary:\u53f0|\u53f0]][[wiktionary:\u5730|\u5730]]): Cultivated tea bushes, from the seeds or cuttings of wild tea trees and planted in relatively low altitudes and flatter terrain. The tea produced from these plants are considered inferior due to the use of pesticides and [[Fertilizer|chemical fertilizer]] in cultivation, and the lack of pleasant flavors, and the presence of harsh bitterness and astringency from the tea.\n*\"Wild arbor\" trees (''y\u011bf\u00e0ng'', [[wiktionary:\u91ce|\u91ce]][[wiktionary:\u653e|\u653e]]): Most producers claim that their pu'er is from wild trees, but most use leaves from older plantations that were cultivated in previous generations that have gone feral due to the lack of care. These trees produce teas of better flavor due to the higher levels of [[secondary metabolite]]s produced in the tea tree. As well, the trees are typically cared for using organic practices, which includes the scheduled [[pruning]] of the trees in a manner similar to [[pollarding]]. Despite the good quality of their produced teas, \"wild arbor\" trees are not as prized as the truly wild trees.\n*''Wild trees'' (g\u016dsh\u00f9, [[wiktionary:\u53e4|\u53e4]][[wiktionary:\u6811|\u6811]]; literally \"old tree\"): Teas from old wild trees, grown without human intervention, are the highest valued pu'er teas. Such teas are valued for having deeper and more complex flavors, often with camphor or \"mint\" notes, said to be imparted by the many camphor trees that grow in the same environment as the wild tea trees. Young raw pu'er teas produced from the leaf tips of these trees also lack overwhelming astringency and bitterness often attributed to young pu'er. Pu'er made from the distinct but closely related so-called ''wild'' species ''[[Camellia taliensis]]'' can command a much higher price than pu'er made from the more common ''[[Camellia sinensis]].''<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu|first1=Yang |last2=Yang|first2=Shi-xiong |last3=Ji|first3=Peng-zhang |last4=Gao|first4=Li-zhi |title=Phylogeography of ''Camellia taliensis'' (Theaceae) inferred from chloroplast and nuclear DNA: insights into evolutionary history and conservation |date=2012-06-21 |journal=[[BMC Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=92 |pages= 92|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-12-92|pmid=22716114 |pmc=3495649 }}</ref>\n\nDetermining whether or not a tea is wild is a challenging task, made more difficult through the inconsistent and unclear terminology and labeling in Chinese. Terms like ''y\u011bsh\u0113ng'' ([[wiktionary:\u91ce|\u91ce]][[wiktionary:\u751f|\u751f]]; literally \"wild\" or \"uncultivated\"), ''qi\u00e1om\u00f9'' ([[wiktionary:\u4e54|\u4e54]][[wiktionary:\u6728|\u6728]]; literally \"tall tree\"), ''y\u011bsh\u0113ng qi\u00e1om\u00f9'' ([[wiktionary:\u91ce|\u91ce]][[wiktionary:\u751f|\u751f]][[wiktionary:\u4e54|\u4e54]][[wiktionary:\u6728|\u6728]]; literally \"uncultivated trees\"), and ''g\u01d4sh\u00f9'' are found on the labels of cakes of both wild and \"wild arbor\" variety, and on blended cakes, which contain leaves from tea plants of various cultivations. These inconsistent and often misleading labels can easily confuse uninitiated tea buyers regardless of their grasp of the [[Chinese language]]. As well, the lack of specific information about tea leaf sources in the printed wrappers and identifiers that come with the pu'er cake makes identification of the tea a difficult task. Pu'er journals and similar annual guides such as ''The Profound World of Chi Tse'', ''Pu-erh Yearbook'', and ''Pu-erh Teapot Magazine'' contain credible sources for leaf information. Tea factories are generally honest about their leaf sources, but someone without access to tea factory or other information is often at the mercy of the middlemen or an unscrupulous vendor. Many pu'er aficionados seek out and maintain relationships with vendors who they feel they can trust to help mitigate the issue of finding the \"truth\" of the leaves.\n\nSadly, even in the best of circumstances, when a journal, factory information, and trustworthy vendor all align to assure a tea's genuinely wild leaf, fakes fill the market and make the issue even more complicated. Because collectors often doubt the reliability of written information, some believe certain physical aspects of the leaf can point to its cultivation. For example, drinkers cite the evidence of a truly wild old tree in a [[menthol]] effect (\"[[camphor]]\" in tea specialist terminology) supposedly caused by the [[Cinnamomum camphora|Camphor laurel]] trees that grow amongst wild tea trees in Yunnan's tea forests. As well, the presence of thick veins and sawtooth-edged on the leaves along with [[camphor]] flavor elements and taken as signifiers of wild tea.{{citation needed |date=March 2018 |reason=The shop houdeasianart.com was previously cited without specifying any article within}}\n\n===Grade===\nPu'er can be sorted into ten or more grades. Generally, grades are determined by leaf size and quality, with higher numbered grades meaning older/larger, broken, or less tender leaves. Grading is rarely consistent between factories, and first grade tea leaves may not necessarily produce first grade cakes. Different grades have different flavors; many bricks blend several grades chosen to balance flavors and strength.\n\n===Season===\nHarvest season also plays an important role in the flavor of pu'er. Spring tea is the most highly valued, followed by fall tea, and finally summer tea. Only rarely is pu'er produced in winter months, and often this is what is called \"early spring\" tea, as harvest and production follows the weather pattern rather than strict monthly guidelines.\n\n==Tea factories==\n[[Image:Menghai 2006 7742-protection ticket.jpg|thumb|upright=0.68|A Menghai microprinted ticket, first appearing in 2006]]\nFactories are generally responsible for the production of pu'er teas. While some individuals oversee small-scale production of high-quality tea, such as the Xizihao and Yanqinghao brands,{{citation needed |date=March 2018 |reason=The shop houdeasianart.com was previously cited without specifying any article within}} the majority of tea on the market is compressed by factories or tea groups. Until recently factories were all state-owned and under the supervision of the ''China National Native Produce & Animal Byproducts Import & Export Corporation'' (CNNP), Yunnan Tea Branch. Kunming Tea Factory, Menghai Tea Factory, Pu'er Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory are the most notable of these state-owned factories. While CNNP still operates today, few factories are [[Public ownership|state-owned]], and CNNP contracts out much production to privately owned factories.\n\nDifferent tea factories have earned good reputations. Menghai Tea Factory and Xiaguan Tea Factory, which date from the 1940s, have enjoyed good reputations, but in the twentyfirst century face competition from many of the newly emerging private factories. For example, [[Haiwan Tea Factory]], founded by former Menghai Factory owner Zhou Bing Liang in 1999,<ref name=Leseine>{{cite web |title=2005 Haiwan Lao Tong Zhi Label |year=2005 |author=Jing Tea Shop |url= http://www.jingteashop.com/pd_beeng_cha_lao.cfm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061018054159/http://www.jingteashop.com/pd_beeng_cha_lao.cfm |archivedate=2006-10-18}} <!--orig editor names author of jingteashop page as Sebastien Leseine, but no such name appears on the site--></ref> has a good reputation, as do [[Changtai Tea Group]], [[Mengku Tea Company]], and other new tea makers formed in the 1990s. However, due to production inconsistencies and variations in manufacturing techniques, the reputation of a tea company or factory can vary depending on the year or the specific cakes produced during a year.\n\nThe producing factory is often the first or second item listed when referencing a pu'er cake, the other being the year of production.\n\n==Recipes==\nTea factories, particularly formerly government-owned factories, produce many cakes using recipes for [[Tea blending and additives|tea blends]], indicated by a four-digit ''recipe number''. The first two digits of recipe numbers represent the year the recipe was first produced, the third digit represents the grade of leaves used in the recipe, and the last digit represents the factory. The number 7542, for example, would denote a recipe from 19''75'' using ''fourth''-grade tea leaf made by Menghai Tea Factory (represented by ''2'').\n*'''Factory numbers (fourth digit in recipe):'''\n*# Kunming Tea Factory\n*# Menghai Tea Factory aka Dayi\n*#  Xiaguan\n*# Lan Cang Tea Factory or Feng Qing Tea Factory\n*# Pu-erh Tea Factory (now Pu-erh Tea group Co.Ltd )\n*# Six Famous Tea Mountain Factory\n*# unknown / not specified\n*# Haiwan Tea Factory and Long Sheng Tea Factory\nTea of all shapes can be made by numbered recipe. Not all recipes are numbered, and not all cakes are made by recipe. The term \"recipe,\" it should be added, does not always indicate consistency, as the quality of some recipes change from year-to-year, as do the contents of the cake. Perhaps only the factories producing the recipes really know what makes them consistent enough to label by these numbers.\n\nOccasionally, a three digit code is attached to the recipe number by hyphenation. The first digit of this code represents the year the cake was produced, and the other two numbers indicate the production number within that year. For instance, the seven digit sequence ''8653-602'', would indicate the ''second'' production in 200''6'' of factory recipe 8653. Some productions of cakes are valued over others because production numbers can indicate if a tea was produced earlier or later in a season/year. This information allows one to be able to single out tea cakes produced using a better batch of ''m\u00e1och\u00e1''.\n\n==Tea packaging==\nPu'er tea is specially packaged for trade, identification, and storage. These attributes are used by tea drinkers and collectors to determine the authenticity of the pu'er tea.\n\n===Individual cakes===\n[[Image:Cake dissection.jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|Typical contents of a wrapped ''B\u012dngch\u00e1'']]\nPu'er tea cakes, or ''b\u012dngch\u00e1'', are almost always sold with a:<ref name=\"houdeinfo\">{{cite web |title=Pu-erh Information |year=2012 |work=Hou De Asian Art & Fine Tea <!--likely author=Guang Lee, who writes most posts on houdeblog.com, but he is not explicitly named here--> |url=http://www.houdeasianart.com/index.php?main_page=puerhinfo |accessdate=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n* ''Wrapper'': Made usually from thin cotton cloth or cotton paper and shows the tea company/factory, the year of production, the region/mountain of harvest, the plant type, and the recipe number. The wrapper can also contain decals, logos and artwork. Occasionally, more than one wrapper will be used to wrap a pu'er cake.\n* ''N\u00e8i f\u0113i'' ([[wiktionary:\u5185|\u5185]][[wiktionary:\u98de|\u98de]] or [[wiktionary:\u5167|\u5167]][[wiktionary:\u98db|\u98db]]): A small ticket originally stuck on the tea cake but now usually embedded into the cake during pressing. It is usually used as proof, or a possible sign, to the authenticity of the tea. Some higher end pu'er cakes have more than one n\u00e8i f\u0113i embedded in the cake. The ticket usually indicates the tea factory and brand.\n* ''N\u00e8i pi\u00e0o'' ([[wiktionary:\u5185|\u5185]][[wiktionary:\u7968|\u7968]]): A larger description ticket or flyer packaged loose under the wrapper. Both aid in assuring the identity of the cake. It usually indicates factory and brand. As well, many ''n\u00e8i pi\u00e0o'' contain a summary of the tea factories' history and any additional laudatory statements concerning the tea, from its taste and rarity, to its ability to cure [[disease]]s and effect [[weight loss]].\n* ''B\u012dng'': The tea cake itself. Tea cakes or other compressed pu'er can be made up of two or more grades of tea, typically with higher grade leaves on the outside of the cake and lower grades or broken leaves in the center. This is done to improve the appearance of the tea cake and improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.\n\n[[File:Tong of pu'er tea (2006 7742 recipe by Menghai Tea Factory).jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|A ''t\u01d2ng'' of recipe 7742 tea cakes wrapped in bamboo shoot husks]]\nRecently, ''n\u00e8i f\u0113i'' have become more important in identifying and preventing [[counterfeit]]s. Menghai Tea Factory in particular has begun [[microprinting]] and [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]] their tickets in an effort to curb the growth of counterfeit teas found in the marketplace in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Some ''n\u00e8i f\u0113i'' also include vintage year and are production-specific to help identify the cake and prevent counterfeiting through a surfeit of different brand labels.\n\nCounterfeit pu'er is common. The practices include claiming the tea is older than it actually is, misidentifying the origin of the leaf as Yunnan instead of a non-Yunnan region, labeling terrace tea as forest tea, and selling green tea instead of raw pu'er. The interpretation of the packing of pu'er is usually dependent on the consumer's knowledge and negotiation between the consumer and trader.\n\n===Wholesale===\nWhen bought in large quantities, pu'er tea is generally sold in stacks, referred to as a ''t\u01d2ng'' ([[wiktionary:\u7b52|\u7b52]]), which are wrapped in [[bamboo]] [[bamboo shoot|shoot]] husks, bamboo stem husks, or coarse paper. Some tongs of vintage pu'er will contain a ''t\u01d2ng pi\u00e0o'' ([[wiktionary:\u7b52|\u7b52]][[wiktionary:\u7968|\u7968]]), or tong ticket, but it is less common to find them in productions past the year 2000.<ref name= chan2006 /> The number of ''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1'' in a ''t\u01d2ng'' varies depending on the weight of individual ''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1''. For instance one ''t\u01d2ng'' can contain:\n* Seven 357\u2013500g ''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1'''',\n* Five 250g mini-''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1''''\n* Ten 100g mini-''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1''''\n\nTwelve ''t\u01d2ng'' are referred to as being one ''ji\u00e0n'' ([[wiktionary:\u4ef6|\u4ef6]]), although some producers/factories vary how many ''t\u01d2ng'' equal one ''ji\u00e0n''. A ''ji\u00e0n'' of tea, which is bound together in a loose bamboo basket, will usually have a large ''batch ticket'' ([[wiktionary:\u5927|\u5927]][[wiktionary:\u7968|\u7968]]; pinyin: ''d\u00e0pi\u00e0o'') affixed to its side that will indicate information such as the batch number of the tea in a season, the production quantities, tea type, and the factory where it was produced.<ref name=chan2006 />\n\n==Aging and storage==\nPu'er teas of all varieties, shapes, and cultivation can be aged to improve their flavor, but the tea's physical properties will affect the speed of aging as well as its quality. These properties include:\n* ''Leaf quality'': The most important factor, arguably, is leaf quality. ''Maocha'' that has been improperly processed will not age to the level of finesse as properly processed ''maocha''. The grade and cultivation of the leaf also greatly affect its quality, and thus its aging.\n* ''Compression'': The tighter a tea is compressed, the slower it will age. In this respect, looser hand- and stone-pressed pu'er teas will age more quickly than denser hydraulic-pressed pu'er.\n* ''Shape and size'' : The more surface area, the faster the tea will age. ''B\u01d0ngch\u00e1'' and ''zhuancha'' thus age more quickly than ''golden melon'', ''tuocha'', or ''jincha''. Larger ''bingcha'' age slower than smaller ''''''b\u01d0ngch\u00e1'''''', and so forth.\n\nJust as important as the tea's properties, [[environmental factor]]s for the tea's storage also affect how quickly and successfully a tea ages. They include:\n* ''Air flow'': Regulates the oxygen content surrounding the tea and removes odors from the aging tea. Dank, stagnant air will lead to dank, stale smelling aged tea. Wrapping a tea in plastic will eventually arrest the aging process.\n* ''Odors'': Tea stored in the presence of strong odors will acquire them, sometimes for the duration of their \"lifetime.\" Airing out pu'er teas can reduce these odors, though often not completely.\n* ''Humidity'' : The higher the humidity, the faster the tea will age. Liquid water accumulating on tea may accelerate the aging process but can also cause the growth of mold or make the flavor of the tea less desirable. 60\u201385% humidity is recommended.<ref>{{cite web |title=How to store your pu-erh tea |year=2007 |author=Jing Tea Shop |url= http://www.jingteashop.com/puerh_storage.cfm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518224846/http://www.jingteashop.com/puerh_storage.cfm |archivedate=2007-05-18}} Jing Tea Shop(2005)</ref> It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating humidity levels.\n* ''Sunlight'': Tea that is exposed to sunlight dries out prematurely, and often becomes bitter.\n* ''Temperature'': Teas should not be subjected to high heat since undesirable flavors will develop. However at low temperatures, the aging of pu'er tea will slow down drastically. It is argued whether tea quality is adversely affected if it is subjected to highly fluctuating temperature.\n\nWhen preserved as part of a ''tong'', the material of the ''tong'' wrapper, whether it is made of bamboo shoot husks, bamboo leaves, or thick paper, can also affect the quality of the aging process. The packaging methods change the environmental factors and may even contribute to the taste of the tea itself.\n\nFurther to what has been mentioned it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there will come a time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing methods used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each tea will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they have peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.\n\n===Raw pu'er===\nOver time, raw pu'er acquires an earthy flavor due to slow oxidation and other, possibly microbial processes. However, this oxidation is not analogous to the oxidation that results in green, [[oolong]], or black tea, because the process is not catalyzed by the plant's own enzymes but rather by fungal, bacterial, or autooxidation influences. Pu'er flavors can change dramatically over the course of the aging process, resulting in a brew tasting strongly earthy but clean and smooth, reminiscent of the smell of rich garden soil or an autumn leaf pile, sometimes with roasted or sweet undertones. Because of its ability to age without losing \"quality\", well aged good pu'er gains value over time in the same way that aged roasted oolong does.<ref name=\"lee2006\">{{cite magazine|author=Guang Chung Lee|year=2006|title=The Varieties of Formosa Oolong|url=http://www.the-art-of-tea.com/viewissue.php?url=aXNzdWVfbm89MQ==|magazine=The Art of Tea <!--\u666e\u6d31\u58fa\u85dd isbn=9789578964334-->|language=English|location=[[Taipei, Taiwan|Taipei]]|publisher=WuShing Books [\u4e94\u884c\u5716\u66f8\u51fa\u7248\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8]|issue=1|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071007011806/http://www.the-art-of-tea.com/viewissue.php?url=aXNzdWVfbm89MQ==|archivedate=2007-10-07}} <!--orig accessdate=2006-12-12--></ref>\n\nRaw pu'er can undergo \"wet storage\" (''sh\u012bc\u0101ng'', [[wiktionary:\u6e7f|\u6e7f]][[wiktionary:\u4ed3|\u4ed3]]) and \"dry storage\" (''g\u0101nc\u0101ng'' [[wiktionary:\u5e72|\u5e72]][[wiktionary:\u4ed3|\u4ed3]]), with teas that have undergone the latter ageing more slowly, but thought to show more complexity. Dry storage involves keeping the tea in \"comfortable\" temperature and humidity, thus allowing the tea to age slowly. Wet or \"humid\" storage refers to the storage of pu'er tea in humid environments, such as those found naturally in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan.\n\nThe practice of \"Pen Shui\" [[wiktionary:\u55b7|\u55b7]][[wiktionary:\u6c34|\u6c34]] involves spraying the tea with water and allowing it dry off in a humid environment. This process speeds up oxidation and microbial conversion, which only loosely mimics the quality of natural dry storage aged pu'er. \"Pen Shui\" [[wiktionary:\u55b7|\u55b7]][[wiktionary:\u6c34|\u6c34]] pu'er not only does not acquire the nuances of slow aging, it can also be hazardous to drink because of mold, yeast, and bacteria cultures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nPu'er properly stored in different environments can develop different tastes at different rates due to environmental differences in ambient humidity, temperature, and odors.<ref name=chan2006 /> For instance, similar batches of pu'er stored in the different environments of [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]] are known to age very differently. Because the process of aging pu'er is lengthy, and teas may change owners several times, a batch of pu'er may undergo different aging conditions, even swapping wet and dry storage conditions, which can drastically alter its flavor. Raw pu'er can be ruined by storage at very high temperatures, or exposure to direct contact with sunlight, heavy air flow, liquid water, or unpleasant smells.\n\nAlthough low to moderate air flow is important for producing a good-quality aged raw pu'er, it is generally agreed by most collectors and connoisseurs that raw pu'er tea cakes older than 30 years should not be further exposed to \"open\" air since it would result in the loss of flavors or degradation in mouthfeel. The tea should instead be preserved by wrapping or [[Hermetic seal|hermetically sealing]] it in plastic wrapping or ideally glass.\n\n===Ripe pu'er===\nSince the ripening process was developed to imitate aged raw pu'er, many arguments surround the idea of whether aging ripened pu'er is desirable. Mostly, the issue rests on whether aging ripened pu'er will, better or worse, alter the flavor of the tea.\n\nIt is often recommended to age ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping ripened pu'er longer than 10 to 15 years makes little sense, stating that the tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu'er indeed does take on nuances through aging,<ref name=\"houdeinfo\"/> and point to side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages. Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.\n\n===Vintaging===\nThe common misconception is that all types of pu'er tea will improve in taste\u2014and therefore gain in value\u2014as they get older. There are many requisite variables for a pu'er tea to age beautifully. Further, the ripe (shu) pu'er will not evolve as dramatically as the raw (sheng) type will over time due to secondary oxidation and fermentation.\n\nAs with [[aging wine]], only finely made and properly stored teas will improve and increase in value. Similarly, only a small percentage of teas will improve over a long period of time.\n\nFrom 2008 Pu'er prices dropped dramatically. Investment-grade Pu'er did not drop as much as the more common varieties. Many producers made large losses, and some decided to leave the industry altogether.<ref name=jacobs2009>{{cite news |title=A County In China Sees Its Fortunes In Tea Leaves Until a Bubble Bursts |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-01-16 |last=Jacobs|first=Andrew |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/17/world/asia/17tea.html |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\nPreparation of ''pu'erh'' involves first separating a well-sized<!--what does \"well-sized\" mean?--> portion of the compressed tea for brewing. This can be done by flaking off pieces of the cake or by steaming the entire cake until it is soft from heat and hydration.<ref name=\"houdeinfo\"/> A ''pu'erh knife'', which is similar to an oyster knife or a rigid [[letter opener]], is used to pry large horizontal flakes of tea off the cake to minimize leaf breakage. Smaller cakes such as ''tuocha'' or mushroom ''pu'erh'' are often steamed until they can be rubbed apart and then dried. In both cases, a vertical sampling of the cake should be obtained since the quality of the leaves in a cake usually varies between the surface and the center.\n\n''Pu'erh'' is generally expected to be served [[Gongfu tea ceremony|Gongfu]] style, generally in ''[[Yixing clay|Yixing]] [[teaware]]'' or in a type of Chinese [[teacup]] called a ''[[gaiwan]]''. Optimum temperatures are generally regarded to be around 95&nbsp;\u00b0C for lower quality ''pu'erh''s and 85\u201389&nbsp;\u00b0C for good ripened and aged raw ''pu'erh''. The tea is steeped for 12 to 30 seconds in the first few infusions, increasing to 2 to 10 minutes in the last infusions. The prolonged steeping sometimes used in the west can produce dark, bitter, and unpleasant brews. Quality aged ''pu'erh'' can yield many more infusions, with different flavor nuances when brewed in the traditional Gong-Fu method.\n\nBecause of the prolonged fermentation in ripened ''pu'erh'' and slow oxidization of aged raw ''pu'erh'', these teas often lack the bitter, astringent properties of other teas, and can be brewed much stronger and repeatedly, with some claiming 20 or more infusions of tea from one pot of leaves.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} On the other hand, young raw ''pu'erh'' is known and expected to be strong and aromatic, yet very bitter and somewhat astringent when brewed, since these characteristics are believed to produce better aged raw ''pu'erh''.\n\n===Judging quality===\n[[Image:Wetstored-ripe.jpg|upright=1.13|thumb|Spent leaves of badly stored shu pu'er. Note the crumbling leaf faces that are barely held together by leaf veins]]\nQuality of the tea can be determined through inspecting the dried leaves, the tea liquor, or the spent tea leaves. The \"true\" quality of a specific batch of ''pu'erh'' can ultimately only be revealed when the tea is brewed and tasted. Although not concrete and sometimes dependent on preference, there are several general indicators of quality:\n* ''Dried tea'': There should be a lack of twigs, extraneous matter and white or dark mold spots on the surface of the compressed ''pu'erh''. The leaves should ideally be whole, visually distinct, and not appear muddy. The leaves may be dry and fragile, but not powdery. Good tea should be quite fragrant, even when dry. Good pressed pu'er cakes often have a matte sheen on the surface, though this is not necessarily a sole indicator of quality.\n* ''Liquor'': The tea liquor of both raw and ripe ''pu'erh'' should never appear cloudy. Well-aged raw ''pu'erh'' and well-crafted ripe ''pu'erh'' tea may produce a dark reddish liquor, reminiscent of a dried [[jujube]], but in either case the liquor should not be opaque, \"muddy,\" or black in color. The flavors of ''pu'erh'' liquors should persist and be revealed throughout separate or subsequent infusions, and never abruptly disappear, since this could be the sign of added flavorants.\n**''Young raw pu'erh'': The ideal liquors should be aromatic with a light but distinct odors of [[camphor]], rich herbal notes like [[traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medicine]], fragrance floral notes, hints of [[dried fruit]] aromas such as preserved [[plum]]s, and should exhibit only some grassy notes to the likes of fresh [[sencha]]. Young raw pu'er may sometimes be quite bitter and astringent, but should also exhibit a pleasant mouthfeel and \"sweet\" aftertaste, referred to as ''g\u0101n'' (\u7518) and ''h\u00faig\u0101n'' (\u56de\u7518).\n**''Aged raw pu'erh'': Aged pu'er should never smell moldy, musty, or strongly fungal, though some ''pu'erh'' drinkers consider these smells to be unoffensive or even enjoyable. The smell of aged ''pu'erh'' may vary, with an \"aged\" but not \"stuffy\" odor. The taste of aged raw ''pu'erh'' or ripe ''pu'erh'' should be smooth, with slight hints of bitterness, and lack a biting astringency or any off-sour tastes. The element of taste is an important indicator of aged ''pu'erh'' quality, the texture should be rich and thick and should have very distinct ''g\u0101n'' (\u7518) and ''h\u00faig\u0101n'' (\u56de\u7518) on the tongue and cheeks, which together induces salivation and leaves a \"feeling\" in the back of the throat.\n* ''Spent tea'': Whole leaves and leaf bud systems should be easily seen and picked out of the wet spent tea, with a limited amount of broken fragments. Twigs and the fruits of the tea plant should not be found in the spent tea leaves; however, animal (and human) hair, strings, [[rice]] grains and chaff may occasionally be included in the tea.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The leaves should not crumble when rubbed, and with ripened ''pu'erh'', it should not resemble compost. Aged raw ''pu'erh'' should have leaves that unfurl when brewed while leaves of most ripened ''pu'erh'' will generally remain closed.\n\n===Practices===\nIn [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] culture, ''pu'erh'' is known as ''po-lay'' (or ''bo-lay'') tea ({{zh|cy=bou2 nei2}}). Among the Cantonese long settled in California, it is called ''bo-nay'' or ''po-nay'' tea.<!--Can it please be explained how \"bo-nay\" came from \"bo-lay\" and is this also in Guangdong/Hongkong/Taishan or only in California?--> It is often drunk during [[dim sum]] meals, as it is believed to help with digestion. It is not uncommon to add dried [[sweet osmanthus|osmanthus]] flowers, [[pomelo]] rinds, or [[chrysanthemum]] flowers into brewing pu'er tea in order to add a light, fresh fragrance to the tea liquor. Pu'er with chrysanthemum is the most common pairing, and referred as ''guk pou'' or ''guk bou'' ([[wiktionary:\u83ca|\u83ca]][[wiktionary:\u666e|\u666e]]; {{zh|cy=guk1 pou2}}; pinyin: j\u00fa p\u01d4).\n\nSometimes [[wolfberry|wolfberries]] are brewed with the tea, plumping in the process.\n\n==Health==\n{{See also|Potential effects of tea on health}}\nPu'er tea is widely sold, by itself or in blends, with unsubstantiated claims that it promotes loss of [[body weight]] in humans.\nUnlike pu'er, some Bianxiao brick tea has been found to contain very high levels of [[fluorine]].

{"title_page": "Call signs in New Zealand", "text_new": "'''Call signs in New Zealand''' are no longer generally used to identify broadcast stations. However, New Zealand's radio stations were once known by their [[call signs]] and would usually broadcast their call signs as a number followed by X, Y, or Z, and another letter (e.g. 1YA). [[Call signs]] are regulated internationally by the [[ITU]] and nationally by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), formerly the Ministry of Economic Development.  The ministry is also responsible for providing policy advice to Government on the allocation of New Zealand's radio spectrum to support, efficient, reliable and responsive wireless telecommunications and broadcasting infrastructure.<ref>[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms Radio Spectrum Management]</ref>\n\nIn 1924, New Zealand was granted the prefix 'Z',<ref>[http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/ccc/Orbell/milestones%20etc.pdf http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/ccc/Orbell/milestones%20etc.pdf]</ref> and in 1925 the number of licensed amateur reached 100. In 1927 the International Telecommunication Union Conference in Washington (D.C., USA) established internally agreed upon call sign prefixes \u2013 New Zealand was assigned 'OZ'.  In 1929 this was expanded to the ZK\u2013ZM letter block, with New Zealand opting for the ZL prefix for land based stations.  'OZ' by 1927 was reassigned to Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rac.ca/en/amateur-radio/regulatory/callsigns/international-letters.php# |title=International Prefixes Starting With Letters |access-date=2016-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504083201/http://www.rac.ca/en/amateur-radio/regulatory/callsigns/international-letters.php# |archive-date=2015-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1969 the ZM prefix was allowed to celebrate the Captain James Cook bicentenary.  In 1974 the prefix was allowed again to celebrate the Commonwealth Games, as well as in 1989 when the Games returned. In 1981 the ZL0 prefix was allowed for visitors to New Zealand.\n\n==Allocations and assignments==\n\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] has assigned New Zealand the following call sign blocks for all radio communication, broadcasting or transmission:<ref>[http://life.itu.ch/radioclub/rr/ap42.htm International Telecommunication Union country call sign assignments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234420/http://life.itu.ch/radioclub/rr/ap42.htm |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! style=\"background: #ddddff;\" |Call sign block\n! |Allocation\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |E5A\u2013E5Z\n| New Zealand \u2013 Cook Islands\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |ZKA\u2013ZMZ\n| New Zealand\n|-\n|}\n\nWhile not directly related to call signs, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) further has divided all countries assigned amateur radio prefixes into [[International Telecommunication Union region|three regions]]; New Zealand is located in ITU Region 3, within ITU Zone 60.\n\nThere are 4 possible 2-letter prefixes and 40 2-letter/1-number prefixes available to New Zealand operators based on the ITU blocks (ZK, ZL, ZM and E5).  This provides for about 720,000 three-character-suffix call signs and significantly more if numerals comprise either or both of the first two characters of the suffix.  A further 18.8 million 4-character call signs are potentially available, as well as considerably more when digits are assigned in the suffix.\n\nOf these prefixes, 1 is currently assigned (ZL) for normal amateur radio operation.  ZM can be used in place of ZL for short special events (e.g. contests), and E5 calls are issued in the Cook Islands (both North and South Cooks).\n\nAlthough ZL1 to ZL4 were previously issued strictly according to the operator's location within New Zealand, that is no longer the case.\n\nNew Zealand is assigned [[DX Century Club|DXCC]] entity #170.  Primary callsign suffixes can be from to four letters in the A\u2013Y, AA\u2013YZ, AAA\u2013YZZ and AAAA\u2013YZZZ blocks. Temporary special event callsigns may have five or six letter suffixes.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! Prefixes\n! Subseries\n!

A \"stand-down\" period of six months applies in regard to the reallocation of temporary callsigns to the same licence holder or club. However, the callsign may be reallocated for further 12-month periods without stand-down, provided the licence authority receives at the time of the application (which must be made prior to the expiry of the then current 12-month period) evidence to the licensing authority's satisfaction that a temporary callsign is being used on a regular basis.\n\n===Two-numeral callsigns===\nThe E5 prefix for the Cook Islands produces two-numeral callsigns when the separating numeral is attached.  The 'E51' prefix is most often used.\n\n===Five and six letter callsigns===\nTemporary callsigns may be issued with up to 6 letter suffixes, such as ZL1ABCDEF. Such callsigns may be allocated for up to 12 months, typically for special events and notable anniversaries.\n\n===Allocation of temporary callsigns in the ZL10 to ZL100 Series===\nA licence holder with a primary or secondary callsign in the ZL1 to ZL9\nseries may be allocated, as a temporary callsign for a period not exceeding 3 months, a\nZL10 to ZL100 prefix to commemorate their anniversary as an active amateur (or the\nestablishment of the club). For example, the holder of ZL1WZZ celebrating 40 years in\namateur radio may be allocated, for a 3-month period, the callsign ZL40WZZ.<ref>[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/tools-and-services/publications/public-information-brochures-pibs/pib-46 New Zealand Radio Operator Certificate and Callsign Rules Part B, Section 4]</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n[[Image:Philco-401-NZradio1.jpg|thumb|right|Radio dials like this one from a vintage [[Philco]] (circa 1953) included New Zealand call signs.]]\nAll radio stations call signs started with ZL, although this was excluded when broadcast.\n\nThe number referred to the geographical area:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 1 \n| [[North Island]] north of [[Taupo]] \n|-\n| 2 \n| North Island south of Taupo, [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]]\n|-\n| 3 \n| [[South Island]] north of the [[Waitaki River]], excluding Nelson and Marlborough\n|-\n|4\n| South Island south of Waitaki River\n|}\n\nThe first letter referred to the type of station:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| X\n| Private commercial stations \n|-\n| Y\n| [[Radio New Zealand]] non-commercial stations\n|-\n| Z\n| [[Radio New Zealand]] commercial stations (now [[The Radio Network]])\n|}\n\nFor private stations, beginning with X, the final letter in the call sign was usually the first letter of the name of the station or the name of the town the station was based in or simply a letter chosen by the station.\n\nFor non-commercial stations beginning with the letter Y, the four main centres (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) had YA stations, the second largest centre at the time was typically assigned a YZ station such as 3YZ in Greymouth and 4YZ in Southland, this was for [[Radio New Zealand National|National Radio]].  For other regions the final letter was typically the first letter the location. The [[Radio New Zealand Concert|Concert Programme]] in the 4 main centres was assigned YC and at this stage only broadcast in the main centres however the Concert Programme was relayed onto other stations during evenings.\n\nThe last letter was either the first letter of the location, (e.g. 1ZH in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and 4ZG in Gore) or was assigned in order with ZB going to the 4 main centres (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) and ZA going to the second largest region at the time such as 1ZA Taupo, 2ZA Palmerston North, 3ZA Greymouth and 4ZA Invercargill.\n\nThis system of allocating call signs was for AM radio stations only, the very few FM radio stations that were operating had 3 letters in the call sign, the first number remained the same. Radio stations that were originally on AM but began broadcasting on FM often kept the AM call sign name or an additional letter was added to the existing call sign name. Some examples are 2ZM in Wellington became 2ZZM (but at this point branded as [[ZM (New Zealand)|ZMFM]]) and 1XX in Whakatane became 1XXX but remained branded as One Double X. Call signs for these stations were often an abbreviation of the stations brand name. The FM call signs assigned to [[Radio New Zealand Concert|Concert FM]] usually followed the format of the area number, the first letter of the city or region and then the letters CP (Concert Programme), for example 1ACP in Auckland and 4DCP in Dunedin. [[Radio New Zealand National|National Radio]] was not broadcasting on FM when stations were allocated call signs so no call signs were ever allocated to National Radio's FM frequencies.\n\n==List of call signs==\nThe following is a list of some of the call signs assigned to radio stations prior to 1990 when New Zealand stopped assigning call signs to radio stations.\n\n===Region 1===\n\n====AM stations====\nRadio stations that originally broadcast on an AM frequency.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

However, New Zealand's radio stations were once known by their [[call signs]] and would usually broadcast their call signs as a number followed by X, Y, or Z, and another letter (e.g. 1YA). [[Call signs]] are regulated internationally by the [[ITU]] and nationally by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), formerly the Ministry of Economic Development.  The ministry is also responsible for providing policy advice to Government on the allocation of New Zealand's radio spectrum to support, efficient, reliable and responsive wireless telecommunications and broadcasting infrastructure.<ref>[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms Radio Spectrum Management]</ref>\n\nIn 1924, New Zealand was granted the prefix 'Z',<ref>[http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/ccc/Orbell/milestones%20etc.pdf http://www.nzvrs.pl.net/ccc/Orbell/milestones%20etc.pdf]</ref> and in 1925 the number of licensed amateur reached 100. In 1927 the International Telecommunication Union Conference in Washington (D.C., USA) established internally agreed upon call sign prefixes \u2013 New Zealand was assigned 'OZ'.  In 1929 this was expanded to the ZK\u2013ZM letter block, with New Zealand opting for the ZL prefix for land based stations.  'OZ' by 1927 was reassigned to Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rac.ca/en/amateur-radio/regulatory/callsigns/international-letters.php# |title=International Prefixes Starting With Letters |access-date=2016-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504083201/http://www.rac.ca/en/amateur-radio/regulatory/callsigns/international-letters.php# |archive-date=2015-05-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1969 the ZM prefix was allowed to celebrate the Captain James Cook bicentenary.  In 1974 the prefix was allowed again to celebrate the Commonwealth Games, as well as in 1989 when the Games returned. In 1981 the ZL0 prefix was allowed for visitors to New Zealand.\n\n==Allocations and assignments==\n\nThe [[International Telecommunication Union]] has assigned New Zealand the following call sign blocks for all radio communication, broadcasting or transmission:<ref>[http://life.itu.ch/radioclub/rr/ap42.htm International Telecommunication Union country call sign assignments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706234420/http://life.itu.ch/radioclub/rr/ap42.htm |date=2011-07-06 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! style=\"background: #ddddff;\" |Call sign block\n! |Allocation\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |E5A\u2013E5Z\n| New Zealand \u2013 Cook Islands\n|-\n| align=\"center\" |ZKA\u2013ZMZ\n| New Zealand\n|-\n|}\n\nWhile not directly related to call signs, the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) further has divided all countries assigned amateur radio prefixes into [[International Telecommunication Union region|three regions]]; New Zealand is located in ITU Region 3, within ITU Zone 60.\n\nThere are 4 possible 2-letter prefixes and 40 2-letter/1-number prefixes available to New Zealand operators based on the ITU blocks (ZK, ZL, ZM and E5).  This provides for about 720,000 three-character-suffix call signs and significantly more if numerals comprise either or both of the first two characters of the suffix.  A further 18.8 million 4-character call signs are potentially available, as well as considerably more when digits are assigned in the suffix.\n\nOf these prefixes, 1 is currently assigned (ZL) for normal amateur radio operation.  ZM can be used in place of ZL for short special events (e.g. contests), and E5 calls are issued in the Cook Islands (both North and South Cooks).\n\nAlthough ZL1 to ZL4 were previously issued strictly according to the operator's location within New Zealand, that is no longer the case.\n\nNew Zealand is assigned [[DX Century Club|DXCC]] entity #170.  Primary callsign suffixes can be from to four letters in the A\u2013Y, AA\u2013YZ, AAA\u2013YZZ and AAAA\u2013YZZZ blocks. Temporary special event callsigns may have five or six letter suffixes.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! Prefixes\n! Subseries\n!

A \"stand-down\" period of six months applies in regard to the reallocation of temporary callsigns to the same licence holder or club. However, the callsign may be reallocated for further 12-month periods without stand-down, provided the licence authority receives at the time of the application (which must be made prior to the expiry of the then current 12-month period) evidence to the licensing authority's satisfaction that a temporary callsign is being used on a regular basis.\n\n===Two-numeral callsigns===\nThe E5 prefix for the Cook Islands produces two-numeral callsigns when the separating numeral is attached.  The 'E51' prefix is most often used.\n\n===Five and six letter callsigns===\nTemporary callsigns may be issued with up to 6 letter suffixes, such as ZL1ABCDEF. Such callsigns may be allocated for up to 12 months, typically for special events and notable anniversaries.\n\n===Allocation of temporary callsigns in the ZL10 to ZL100 Series===\nA licence holder with a primary or secondary callsign in the ZL1 to ZL9\nseries may be allocated, as a temporary callsign for a period not exceeding 3 months, a\nZL10 to ZL100 prefix to commemorate their anniversary as an active amateur (or the\nestablishment of the club). For example, the holder of ZL1WZZ celebrating 40 years in\namateur radio may be allocated, for a 3-month period, the callsign ZL40WZZ.<ref>[http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/tools-and-services/publications/public-information-brochures-pibs/pib-46 New Zealand Radio Operator Certificate and Callsign Rules Part B, Section 4]</ref>\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n[[Image:Philco-401-NZradio1.jpg|thumb|right|Radio dials like this one from a vintage [[Philco]] (circa 1953) included New Zealand call signs.]]\nAll radio stations call signs started with ZL, although this was excluded when broadcast.\n\nThe number referred to the geographical area:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| 1 \n| [[North Island]] north of [[Taupo]] \n|-\n| 2 \n| North Island south of Taupo, [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]]\n|-\n| 3 \n| [[South Island]] north of the [[Waitaki River]], excluding Nelson and Marlborough\n|-\n|4\n| South Island south of Waitaki River\n|}\n\nThe first letter referred to the type of station:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| X\n| Private commercial stations \n|-\n| Y\n| [[Radio New Zealand]] non-commercial stations\n|-\n| Z\n| [[Radio New Zealand]] commercial stations (now [[The Radio Network]])\n|}\n\nFor private stations, beginning with X, the final letter in the call sign was usually the first letter of the name of the station or the name of the town the station was based in or simply a letter chosen by the station.\n\nFor non-commercial stations beginning with the letter Y, the four main centres (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) had YA stations, the second largest centre at the time was typically assigned a YZ station such as 3YZ in Greymouth and 4YZ in Southland, this was for [[Radio New Zealand National|National Radio]].  For other regions the final letter was typically the first letter the location. The [[Radio New Zealand Concert|Concert Programme]] in the 4 main centres was assigned YC and at this stage only broadcast in the main centres however the Concert Programme was relayed onto other stations during evenings.\n\nThe last letter was either the first letter of the location, (e.g. 1ZH in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and 4ZG in Gore) or was assigned in order with ZB going to the 4 main centres (Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) and ZA going to the second largest region at the time such as 1ZA Taupo, 2ZA Palmerston North, 3ZA Greymouth and 4ZA Invercargill.\n\nThis system of allocating call signs was for AM radio stations only, the very few FM radio stations that were operating had 3 letters in the call sign, the first number remained the same. Radio stations that were originally on AM but began broadcasting on FM often kept the AM call sign name or an additional letter was added to the existing call sign name. Some examples are 2ZM in Wellington became 2ZZM (but at this point branded as [[ZM (New Zealand)|ZMFM]]) and 1XX in Whakatane became 1XXX but remained branded as One Double X. Call signs for these stations were often an abbreviation of the stations brand name. The FM call signs assigned to [[Radio New Zealand Concert|Concert FM]] usually followed the format of the area number, the first letter of the city or region and then the letters CP (Concert Programme), for example 1ACP in Auckland and 4DCP in Dunedin. [[Radio New Zealand National|National Radio]] was not broadcasting on FM when stations were allocated call signs so no call signs were ever allocated to National Radio's FM frequencies.\n\n==List of call signs==\nThe following is a list of some of the call signs assigned to radio stations prior to 1990 when New Zealand stopped assigning call signs to radio stations.\n\n===Region 1===\n\n====AM stations====\nRadio stations that originally broadcast on an AM frequency.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; This etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'.\n\nvadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n==Mythology==\nAccording to the Pahlavi texts, Ahura Mazda began his quest at the time of creation and linked human beings to each other, going through a period of mixing in which [[good and evil]] compete for supremacy, reaching the epicenter of a period in which the world Once again it will be the way that Ahura Mazda had created it.In Isna 1.6, [[Spenta Armaiti]] is said to have been the daughter of Ahura Mazda, but no details on how [[Ahura Mazda]] was her father can be found. On the other hand, it is said that Ahura Mazda was both his father and mother of creation; his mother when he was brought up in the world of thought and his father when he brought it into the world of being. Denig has said of the first manuscripts (the first humans) that the creator enjoyed the action from which all creatures were made, in which it is a word that can refer to sexual activity but is not unambiguous. Denkard says people should do it because it is clear that the creator did it when he made such creations.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nXwedodah is considered the highest act of worship.

Unlike incest in Egypt, or Rome, or Medieval European royalty, this form of nuclear family incest was not relegated to just royalty but was widely popular among all facets of society from slaves, to free men, to the middle class, aristocrats and royalty. Nuclear family incest resulting in progeny was a far cry from an exclusively or even predominantly royal custom.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Non-Persian Sources and Studies==\nMost of Pahlavi's texts are self-contained by [[Edward William West]]'s comments. Brief evaluations and references include Friedrich Spiegel and standard books on Zoroastrianism (such as Boyce).\n\n===Middle Persian scripts and Pahlavi texts===\nThe earliest use of the word Xwedodah in Middle Persian in the inscription Kordir on the [[Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]] is in the role of [[Naqsh-e Rostam]].\n\nPerhaps a much more recent reference can be found in the Pahlavi-Chinese bilingual tomb inscriptions in Xi'an, in which the deceased woman, from the Surin family princes, is read in Chinese as \"wife\" but in Pahlavi's \"daughter\" but The interpretation of the inscription is unclear.\n\n===Persian literature===\n[[Ferdowsi]] mentions incest only between Bahman and his sister Homa.<ref name=\"iranicaonline.org\">http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin</ref>\n\n===In classical sources===\nThe common feature of non-Iranian sources is that they rarely mention the Iranians themselves, even if they do occasionally mention the clerics.\n\nNumerous classical sources and later authors point to the incarnation of incest in the Achaemenid monarchies of the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties.\n\nSome of the earliest Greek references to non-royal incest are those by [[Xanthus (historian)|Xanthus]] in his book Magica, which [[Clement of Alexandria]] quoted as saying that [[Magi]] had sex with their mothers, daughters and sisters, and that [[Ctesias]] had mentioned a brother-sister marriage.

The nineteenth-century qa\u00eatvadatha style (with q instead of Avesta x) and similar writings reappear in modern literature.\n\nThe first part of the compound seems to be a \"family\" (or similar) of Khito (x\u1d5ba\u0113tu), which is generally thought to derive from the \"self\" (x\u1d5ba\u0113-) with the suffix -you (-tu-), although this is not entirely straightforward . The second part, vada\u03b8a, is nowadays generally regarded as a derivative of the verb (From * Wad-) 'resulting in marriage', related to other Iranian and Hindu European languages which refer to marriage or marriage partner (compare with ancient Indik). \"Wife\" Av. Va\u03b4\u016b; Pahlavi way\u016bg (Pers. Bayu) \"bride\"; Avestan va\u03b4ut \"one who has reached the age of marriage\"; Pahlavi way\u016bdag \"bride's room\"; This etymology was suggested by Carl Goldner, and accepted by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] and Christian Bartholomae, and became a popular opinion among Western scholars. However, there is no * vadha- to Vedic or * vada- root in the Avesta of the vadh root; in Avesta the v\u0101\u03b4aya and upa.v\u0101\u03b4aiia- 'lead (to marry)' and uzuu\u0101\u03b4aiia are 'leaving the father's house'.\n\nvadh-Vedic, vad-Avestan should not be confused with vah-Avestan \"to take\", vaz-Avestan with the uhy\u00e1-unknown form.\n\n==The mythical origin==\nAccording to the Pahlavi texts, Ahura Mazda began his quest at the time of creation and linked human beings to each other, going through a period of mixing in which [[good and evil]] compete for supremacy, reaching the epicenter of a period in which the world Once again it will be the way that Ahura Mazda had created it.In Isna 1.6, [[Spenta Armaiti]] is said to have been the daughter of Ahura Mazda, but no details on how [[Ahura Mazda]] was her father can be found. On the other hand, it is said that Ahura Mazda was both his father and mother of creation; his mother when he was brought up in the world of thought and his father when he brought it into the world of being. Denig has said of the first manuscripts (the first humans) that the creator enjoyed the action from which all creatures were made, in which it is a word that can refer to sexual activity but is not unambiguous. Denkard says people should do it because it is clear that the creator did it when he made such creations.\n\n== Zoroastrian religious views ==\nXwedodah is considered the highest act of worship.

The case was significant in the extensive use of social media as evidence and in opening a national discussion on the concept of [[rape culture]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/18/fox-news-steubenville-rape-victim_n_2901635.html|title=CNN, Fox News, MSNBC Air Name of Steubenville Rape Victim|date=March 18, 2013|last=Fung|first=Katherine|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}</ref><ref name=nyt20121217>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/17/sports/high-school-football-rape-case-unfolds-online-and-divides-steubenville-ohio.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& |title=Rape Case Unfolds on Web and Splits City |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 2012|last1=Schweber|first1=Nate|last2=Macur|first2=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSteubenville is located at {{coord|40|21|30|N|80|37|0|W|type:city}} (40.359, \u221280.614).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|10.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|10.55|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.08|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The city lies along the [[Ohio River]], with the city spreading west from the floodplains to the hills that surround the city.

The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater.

Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006.

When the surveyors completed their task a few years later, the fort was abandoned. In the meantime, settlers had built homes around the fort; they named their settlement Steubenville. The name Steubenville was derived from [[Fort Steuben]] to honor [[Baron von Steuben]] (the fort was named for the Baron).

Steubenville received a city charter in 1851. In 1856, Frazier, Kilgore and Company erected a rolling mill (the forerunner of steel mills) and the Steubenville Coal and Mining Company sank a coal shaft. The city was a stop along the [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]], which connected [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] to [[Chicago]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].\n\nIn 1946, the College of Steubenville was founded by the [[Franciscan]] [[Friar]]s of the [[Third Order of St. Francis|Third Order Regular]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Franciscan University of Steubenville |publisher=Ohio Historical Society |accessdate=2006-11-07 |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2514}}</ref> In 1980, its name was changed to University of Steubenville, and finally in 1985 to [[Franciscan University of Steubenville]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Franciscan University of Steubenville |accessdate=2013-01-18 |url=http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118000741/http://www.franciscan.edu/OurHistory/ |archivedate=2013-01-18 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the Jefferson County Technical Institute was founded.

Corporations such as [[Weirton Steel]] have had to reduce their workforce in order to become more efficient and competitive against other steel producers and lower steel prices worldwide.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe new Findlay Connector has been built in western [[Pennsylvania]] as a toll-access highway between [[Pittsburgh International Airport]] at [[Interstate 376]] and U.S. Route 22 in northwestern [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]]. Travel time between the Pittsburgh International Airport and the city of Steubenville is now approximately 25 minutes.\n\nSteubenville is located near two large [[shale]] formations - the [[Marcellus Formation|Marcellus]] and Utica formations.\n\n==Culture==\n===Historic sites===\nFort Steuben, located downtown on South Third Street, is a reconstructed 18th century fort on its original location overlooking the Ohio River. Built in 1787 to protect the government surveyors of the [[Seven Ranges]] of the Northwest Territory, Fort Steuben housed 150 men of the 1st American Regiment. The non-profit organization that worked to rebuild the fort also developed the surrounding block into Fort Steuben Park that includes the Veterans Memorial Fountain and the Berkman Amphitheater. The Fort Steuben Visitors center is home to the Museum Shop and the Steubenville Convention & Visitors Bureau and is an official site on the Ohio River Scenic Byway.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAdjacent to the fort is the First Federal Land Office with its original logs from 1801. After the Ohio country was surveyed, it could be sold or given away as land grants; the settlers brought their deeds to be registered at the Land Office to David Hoge, the Registrar of Lands and Titles for the Northwest Territory.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n\"Ohio Valley Steelworker\" Statue was created by artist Dimitri Akis as a tribute to the [[Ohio Valley]] [[Steelworkers]].  The life-size figure carries a long-handled dipping ladle and is wearing the hooded fire-proof suit worn in the steel mills. The statue was located at the junction of Hwy 22 (University Blvd) and Hwy 7 (Dean Martin Blvd).  In the fall of 2014, the statue was moved to its new home, displayed on South Fourth Street at the site of the Public Library of Steubenville and Jefferson County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|title=Steelworker on the Move|first=Dave|last=Gossett|date=13 November 2014|newspaper=Herald-Star|access-date=2014-11-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220062105/http://www.heraldstaronline.com/page/content.detail/id/611930/Steelworker-on-the-move.html?nav=5010|archive-date=2014-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThere is a statue downtown commemorating [[Edwin Stanton]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[secretary of war]].

The 6th district is the longest US House district in Ohio and runs along the southeast state borders of Ohio.\n\n====Political corruption====\nSteubenville has had a reputation for [[political corruption]]. Over a period of 20 years the city lost, or settled out of court, 48 civil rights lawsuits involving its police force. The city paid out more than $800,000, including $400,000 between 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1997, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] alleged that the city and police force had subjected numerous individuals to \"excessive force, false arrests, charges, and reports\" and had engaged in practices regarding \"improper stops, searches, and seizures\". The report from the Department also stated that excessive force was levied against individuals who witnessed incidents of police misconduct, and against those who were known critics of the city and its police force. Those individuals were also falsely detained if the city and the police agreed that they were \"likely to complain of abuse\". It further stated that the officers involved falsified reports and tampered with official police recorders so that \"misconduct would not be recorded\".<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/steubencomp.php 1997 DoJ complaint against Steubenville]</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city's police force became the second city in the United States to sign a consent decree with the federal government due to an excessive number of civil rights lawsuits. The decree was signed on September 4, 1997, under the \"pattern or practice\" provision. Under this agreement, the city agreed to improve the training of its police officers, implement new guidelines and procedures, establish an internal affairs unit, and establish an \"early warning system\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-nobody-trusts-steubenville-171732708.html|title=Why Nobody Trusts Steubenville|first=Alexander |last=Abad-Santos|work=The Atlantic Wire|date=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Speed camera lawsuit====\nThe speed camera program began in 2005 and earned the city $600,000 in revenues, as nearly 7,000 tickets at $85 each were issued during that time period. In March 2006, the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas ruled that the city ordinance of supporting the speed camera program was illegal and unconstitutional. The city refused to remove the cameras, however, because it stated it was \"bound by contract to continue the services\" of Traffipax, Inc., the US subsidiary of ROBOT Visual Systems, a German corporation. Despite attempts to remove the cameras, the city continued to defy the judge's order and reinstated an identical ordinance to continue issuing citations. Councilman at Large Michael Hernon cast the sole dissenting vote against reinstating the traffic cameras.<ref>[http://www.wtov9.com/news/9402098/detail.html \"Steubenville Reinstates Traffic Cameras\" 20 June. 2006. WTOV9]</ref>\n\nIn mid-2006, an attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against the city of Steubenville for illegally collecting fines and generating unnecessary revenue from motorists. He won the case in December 2007 and the city was forced to refund thousands of tickets totaling $258,000.<ref name=\"HS_050407\">{{cite news | last = Law | first = Mark | title = Traffic camera case returns | publisher = Herald Star | date = 2007-05-04 | url = http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 | accessdate = 2007-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055147/http://www.hsconnect.com/news/articles.asp?articleID=13402 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Stern also gathered enough signatures from the residents of the city to put forth a referendum that posed the question of whether the city's ordinance authorizing the speed camera program should continue.
