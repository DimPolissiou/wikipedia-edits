He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]].

He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister.

It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]].

Hideaki | last = Nishino | date = March 18, 2020 | accessdate = March 20, 2020 | work = [[PlayStation Blog]] }}</ref>\n\n==Hardware==\nThe PlayStation 5 uses [[AMD]]'s [[Zen 2]] [[microarchitecture]] with 8 CPU cores running at a variable frequency capped at 3.5&nbsp;GHz.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> The GPU is a customized [[system-on-a-chip]] (SoC) based on AMD's [[RDNA 2]], featuring 36 compute units running at a variable frequency, capped at 2.23&nbsp;GHz, and capable of 10.28 [[FLOPS|TFLOPS]].<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> Both the CPU and GPU are monitored by a special boost system incorporating AMD's SmartShift technology that adjusts the frequency of these systems based on the current activities of both chips, to target ideal constant power drawn and a model SoC performance profile. For example, if the CPU is running at lower activity, the boost system may reduce its frequency and increase the frequency of the GPU to allow that GPU to run at higher performance without otherwise affecting power use or cooling.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> Because of this, Cerny said that any direct comparison to other hardware systems based on compute units or FLOPS may not be accurate.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> The GPU supports [[hardware acceleration]] of real-time [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray traced]] rendering.<ref name=\"sieannounce\"/> It has a new audio technology called Tempest Engine, which allows not only for hundreds of sound sources within a game to be accounted for in producing audio output compared to 50 for the PlayStation 4, but also how that audio is presented based on the end user's device and preferences.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> The system has {{nowrap|16 GB}} of [[GDDR6 SDRAM]] with a bandwidth of 448&nbsp;GB/s.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/>\n\nA custom [[solid-state drive|SSD]] storage solution was designed for the PlayStation 5 to increase data input/output rates for fast loading times and larger bandwidth. This speed allows games to be more immersive and to support [[8K resolution]].<ref name=\"wired ps5 april2019\"/> The base system has a 825&nbsp;GB SSD connected via a 12-channel interface to the main system, achieving a 5.5 GB/s transfer rate uncompressed, and between 8 to 9 GB/s using compression with the Oodle Kraken protocol from RAD Game Tools. This atypical drive size was found to be optimal for the 12-channel pathway for the system rather than more typical 500&nbsp;GB or 1&nbsp;TB units. Direct storage for games is expandable through a [[NVM Express]] (NVMe) port supporting either M.1 or M.2 formats, while additional storage can be made available through USB-compatible drives. The system includes a 4K-compatible [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] optical drive.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> Though game installation from a disc is mandatory as to take advantage of the SSD, the user has some fine-grain control of how much to install, such as only installing the multiplayer components of a game.<ref name=\"wired ps5 oct2019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-playstation-5/ | title = Exclusive: A Deeper Look at the PlayStation 5 | first = Peter | last = Rubin | date = October 8, 2019 | accessdate = October 8, 2019 | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191008121717/https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-playstation-5/ | archive-date = October 8, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> \n\nSony is developing improved support for suspended gameplay state, for the PlayStation 5 to consume less energy than the PlayStation 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-23-ps5-wont-waste-as-much-energy-as-ps4-sony-says|title=PS5 won't waste as much energy as PS4, Sony says|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|work=Eurogamer|date=September 25, 2019|access-date=October 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924031533/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-23-ps5-wont-waste-as-much-energy-as-ps4-sony-says|archive-date=September 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===DualSense controller===\n{{Main|DualSense}}\nThe new DualSense wireless controller for the PlayStation 5 was revealed on April 7, 2020.<ref name=\"dualsense\">{{cite web | url = https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/04/07/introducing-dualsense-the-new-wireless-game-controller-for-playstation-5/ | title=  Introducing DualSense, the New Wireless Game Controller for PlayStation 5 | first=  Hideaki | last = Nishino | date  =April 7, 2020 | accessdate = April 7, 2020 | work = [[PlayStation Blog]] }}</ref> The DualSense controller is based on the [[DualShock]] controllers but with modifications influenced by discussions with game designers and players.<ref name=\"dualsense\"/> The DualSense controller has adaptive triggers that can change the resistance to the player as necessary, supporting an experience such as virtually drawing an arrow from a bow.<ref name=\"wired ps5 oct2019\"/> The DualSense has strong [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] through [[voice coil]] actuators, which together with an improved controller speaker is intended to give better in-game feedback.<ref name=\"wired ps5 oct2019\"/> While the DualSense maintains most of the same buttons as the [[DualShock 4]], it renames the \"Share\" button to \"Create\" with additional means for players to share and create content with others.

with 8 CPU cores running at a variable frequency capped at 3.5&nbsp;GHz.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> The GPU is a customized [[system-on-a-chip]] (SoC) based on AMD's [[RDNA 2]], featuring 36 compute units running at a variable frequency, capped at 2.23&nbsp;GHz, and capable of 10.28 [[FLOPS|TFLOPS]].<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> Both the CPU and GPU are monitored by a special boost system incorporating AMD's SmartShift technology that adjusts the frequency of these systems based on the current activities of both chips, to target ideal constant power drawn and a model SoC performance profile. For example, if the CPU is running at lower activity, the boost system may reduce its frequency and increase the frequency of the GPU to allow that GPU to run at higher performance without otherwise affecting power use or cooling.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> Because of this, Cerny said that any direct comparison to other hardware systems based on compute units or FLOPS may not be accurate.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> The GPU supports [[hardware acceleration]] of real-time [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray traced]] rendering.<ref name=\"sieannounce\"/> It has a new audio technology called Tempest Engine, which allows not only for hundreds of sound sources within a game to be accounted for in producing audio output compared to 50 for the PlayStation 4, but also how that audio is presented based on the end user's device and preferences.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> The system has {{nowrap|16 GB}} of [[GDDR6 SDRAM]] with a bandwidth of 448&nbsp;GB/s.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/>\n\nA custom [[solid-state drive|SSD]] storage solution was designed for the PlayStation 5 to increase data input/output rates for fast loading times and larger bandwidth. This speed allows games to be more immersive and to support [[8K resolution]].<ref name=\"wired ps5 april2019\"/> The base system has a 825&nbsp;GB SSD connected via a 12-channel interface to the main system, achieving a 5.5 GB/s transfer rate uncompressed, and between 8 to 9 GB/s using compression with the Oodle Kraken protocol from RAD Game Tools. This atypical drive size was found to be optimal for the 12-channel pathway for the system rather than more typical 500&nbsp;GB or 1&nbsp;TB units. Direct storage for games is expandable through a [[NVM Express]] (NVMe) port supporting either M.1 or M.2 formats, while additional storage can be made available through USB-compatible drives. The system includes a 4K-compatible [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] optical drive.<ref name=\"df fullspecs\"/> Though game installation from a disc is mandatory as to take advantage of the SSD, the user has some fine-grain control of how much to install, such as only installing the multiplayer components of a game.<ref name=\"wired ps5 oct2019\">{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-playstation-5/ | title = Exclusive: A Deeper Look at the PlayStation 5 | first = Peter | last = Rubin | date = October 8, 2019 | accessdate = October 8, 2019 | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191008121717/https://www.wired.com/story/exclusive-playstation-5/ | archive-date = October 8, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> \n\nSony is developing improved support for suspended gameplay state, for the PlayStation 5 to consume less energy than the PlayStation 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-23-ps5-wont-waste-as-much-energy-as-ps4-sony-says|title=PS5 won't waste as much energy as PS4, Sony says|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|work=Eurogamer|date=September 25, 2019|access-date=October 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190924031533/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-23-ps5-wont-waste-as-much-energy-as-ps4-sony-says|archive-date=September 24, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===DualSense controller===\n{{Main|DualSense}}\nThe new DualSense wireless controller for the PlayStation 5 was revealed on April 7, 2020.<ref name=\"dualsense\">{{cite web | url = https://blog.us.playstation.com/2020/04/07/introducing-dualsense-the-new-wireless-game-controller-for-playstation-5/ | title=  Introducing DualSense, the New Wireless Game Controller for PlayStation 5 | first=  Hideaki | last = Nishino | date  =April 7, 2020 | accessdate = April 7, 2020 | work = [[PlayStation Blog]] }}</ref> The DualSense controller is based on the [[DualShock]] controllers but with modifications influenced by discussions with game designers and players.<ref name=\"dualsense\"/> The DualSense controller has adaptive triggers that can change the resistance to the player as necessary, supporting an experience such as virtually drawing an arrow from a bow.<ref name=\"wired ps5 oct2019\"/> The DualSense has strong [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] through [[voice coil]] actuators, which together with an improved controller speaker is intended to give better in-game feedback.<ref name=\"wired ps5 oct2019\"/> While the DualSense maintains most of the same buttons as the [[DualShock 4]], it renames the \"Share\" button to \"Create\" with additional means for players to share and create content with others.
