At that time he served under the command of Colonel [[Kodandera Subayya Thimayya|K. S. Thimmayya]], who would later rise to the rank of general and become Chief of the Army Staff from 1957 to 1961. Sharma was [[Mentioned in dispatches|mentioned in despatches]] for his actions during the fighting of the Arakan Campaign.<ref name=\"The soldier who won India's first Param Vir Chakra\" />\n\nThroughout his military career, Sharma was greatly influenced by his uncle Captain K. D. Vasudeva's gallantry in action. Vasudeva also served with the 8th Battalion, participating in the [[Malayan Campaign]] during which he died aiding hundreds of soldiers under his command to survive from the Japanese offensive.<ref name=\"The soldier who won India's first Param Vir Chakra\" />\n\n===Battle of Badgam===\n{{main|Battle of Badgam}}\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\nOn 27 October 1947, a batch of troops of the Indian Army was deployed in response to the invasion by Pakistan on 22 October into the [[Kashmir Valley]]. On 31 October, D Company of 4th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Sharma, was airlifted to [[Srinagar]]. During this time, his left hand was in a [[plaster cast]] as a result of injuries sustained previously on the [[hockey]] field, but he insisted on being with his company in combat and was subsequently given permission to go.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nOn 3 November, a batch of three companies was deployed to the [[Badgam]] area on patrol duties. Their objective was to check the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, two of the three deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00{{nbsp}}pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00{{nbsp}}pm. At 2:35{{nbsp}}pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but counter-fire was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. Suddenly, a tribal ''lashkar'' ([[English (language)|English]]: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of [[Gulmarg]]. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to the enemy fire as he ran from one post to the other.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nWhen heavy casualties adversely affected the company's firing power, Sharma took upon himself the task of distributing ammunition to his men, operating [[light machine gun]]s. While busy fighting the infiltrators, a mortar shell exploded on a pile of ammunition near him.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=75\u201376}} Before he succumbed to his injuries, he transmitted a message to his brigade's headquarters which read:\n{{Quotation|\n\"The enemies are only 50 yards from us. We are heavily outnumbered. We are under devastating fire. I shall not withdraw an inch but will fight to our last man and our last round.\"\n|author=Major Somanth Sharma, Battle of Badgam, 1947 GOPAL SHARMA\n\n|source={{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=75\u201376}}<ref name=\"The soldier who won India's first Param Vir Chakra\" />\n}}\n\nBy the time a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the position held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance.

He reached his objective at first light on 3 November and took up a position south of Badgam at 11:00 hours. The enemy, estimated at about 500 attacked his company position from three sides; the company began to sustain heavy casualties. Fully realizing the gravity of the situation and the direct threat that would result to both the aerodrome and Srinagar via Hum Hom, Major Somnath Sharma urged his company to fight the enemy tenaciously. With extreme bravery he kept rushing across the open ground to his sections exposing himself to heavy and accurate fire to urge them to hold on. Keeping his nerve, he skilfully directed the fire of his sections into the ever-advancing enemy. He repeatedly exposed himself to the full fury of enemy fire and laid out cloth strips to guide our aircraft onto their targets in full view of the enemy. Realising that casualties had affected the effectiveness of his light automatics, this officer whose left hand was in plaster, personally commenced filling magazines and issuing them to the light machine gunners. A mortar shell landed right in the middle of the ammunition resulting in an explosion that killed him. Major Sharma's company held on to this position and the remnants withdrew only when almost completely surrounded. His inspiring example resulted in the enemy being delayed for six hours, thus gaining time for our reinforcements to get into position at Hum Hom to stem the tide of the enemy advance. His leadership, gallantry and tenacious defence were such that his men were inspired to fight the enemy by seven to one, six hours after this gallant officer had been killed. He has set an example of courage and qualities seldom equalled in the history of the Indian Army.

At that time he served under the command of Colonel [[Kodandera Subayya Thimayya|K. S. Thimmayya]], who would later rise to the rank of general and become Chief of the Army Staff from 1957 to 1961. Sharma was [[Mentioned in dispatches|mentioned in despatches]] for his actions during the fighting of the Arakan Campaign.<ref name=\"The soldier who won India's first Param Vir Chakra\" />\n\nThroughout his military career, Sharma was greatly influenced by his uncle Captain K. D. Vasudeva's gallantry in action. Vasudeva also served with the 8th Battalion, participating in the [[Malayan Campaign]] during which he died aiding hundreds of soldiers under his command to survive from the Japanese offensive.<ref name=\"The soldier who won India's first Param Vir Chakra\" />\n\n===Battle of Badgam===\n{{main|Battle of Badgam}}\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\nOn 27 October 1947, a batch of troops of the Indian Army was deployed in response to the invasion by Pakistan on 22 October into the [[Kashmir Valley]]. On 31 October, D Company of 4th Battalion of Kumaon Regiment, under the command of Sharma, was airlifted to [[Srinagar]]. During this time, his left hand was in a [[plaster cast]] as a result of injuries sustained previously on the [[hockey]] field, but he insisted on being with his company in combat and was subsequently given permission to go.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nOn 3 November, a batch of three companies was deployed to the [[Badgam]] area on patrol duties. Their objective was to check the infiltrators moving toward Srinagar from the north. As there was no enemy movement, two of the three deployed companies returned to Srinagar at 2:00{{nbsp}}pm. However, Sharma's D Company, was ordered to stay in position until 3:00{{nbsp}}pm. At 2:35{{nbsp}}pm, Sharma's company was fired upon from the local resident houses in Badgam but counter-fire was not ordered to avoid injuring or killing innocent civilians. Suddenly, a tribal ''lashkar'' ([[English (language)|English]]: militiamen) of 700 infiltrators approached Badgam from the direction of [[Gulmarg]]. D Company was soon surrounded from three sides and sustained heavy casualties from mortar fire. Sharma realized the importance of holding onto his position as both the city of Srinagar and the airport would be vulnerable if lost. Under heavy fire, and outnumbered by a ratio of seven to one, he urged his company to fight bravely, often exposing himself to the enemy fire as he ran from one post to the other.{{Sfn|Chakravorty|1995|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nWhen heavy casualties adversely affected the company's firing power, Sharma took upon himself the task of distributing ammunition to his men, operating [[light machine gun]]s.

The court ruled in his favor in 1774 and he took possession of the estate.<ref>Baltz, 1984, 39\u201341</ref>\n\nBenjamin Ogle became a friend of [[George Washington]] whose presidential records show he dined at Belair on October 1, 1773 and that Washington frequently sought Ogle's counsel.<ref>Warfield, 248\u2013250</ref>\n\n====Post Revolution to Civil War====\nBenjamin Ogle operated Belair and gained prominence as a gentleman. He was elected [[Governor of Maryland]] in 1798.<ref>{{cite web| title =Historical List, Governors of Maryland | publisher=Maryland State Archives| url =http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/speccol/sc2600/sc2685/html/govintro.html | access-date = June 25, 2007}}</ref> That same year the Direct Federal Tax assessment listed Belair as containing:\n{{quotation|\n\"a mansion with a [[greenhouse]], 24&nbsp;by&nbsp;15&nbsp;feet, adjoining the {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}}&nbsp;square kitchen-office, a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} square poultry house, a single-story dwelling, 2&nbsp;by&nbsp;16&nbsp;feet, a meat house and a [[Belair Stable Museum|stable]], all built of brick. Additional outbuildings included a frame stable, a deer house, [[tobacco]] houses and several houses for [[Negroes]]. It was by far the most valuable and best equipped plantation of that section of Prince George's County.<ref>Baltz, 1984, 50</ref>\n}}\nHe continued to prosper until his death in 1809 when the property was inherited by his son, Benjamin Ogle II. Ogle II operated the estate and stud farm until his death in 1844 when his two sons, George Cooke Ogle and [[Richard Lowndes Ogle]] divided the estate into two parcels. George took the parcel with the mansion and Richard moved to a house on his parcel known as ''Bladen'' (which was torn down in the 1960s to make way for the Kenilworth Elementary School).<ref name=baltz64>Baltz, 1984, 64</ref> When George took possession of the deed to Belair, it carried an interesting restriction: George's youngest sister, Rosalie Ogle, must be able to remain in her room in the mansion as long as she remained single. She chose a large room of 17&nbsp;by&nbsp;20&nbsp;feet on the upper floor.<ref name=p68>Baltz, 1984, 68</ref>\n\n====Civil War and the end of Ogle Ownership====\nAs Belair was a [[slave]]-operated plantation, the ratification of the [[Maryland Constitution of 1864]] which emancipated the slaves in the state effectively ended its operation as a plantation.<ref name=p65-68>Baltz, 1984, 65\u201368</ref> In 1867, Dr. George C. Ogle reported to the Maryland State Commissioner of Slave Statistics that he had freed 41 slaves, 24 of them 18 years or younger.<ref>Baltz, 2005, p. 104</ref>  Belair, like other plantations, was \"possessed of huge tracts of land but suddenly without the built-in workforce to make them productive, they were often unable to meet mortgage debts or to pay taxes.\"  By 1870, the house had fallen into bad repair and George Ogle was in debt of $7,400 to his brother-in-law [[William Henry Tayloe]] of [[Virginia]] as well as several lesser debts to others including $2,400 to the estate of Maria Jackson, being executed by James Mullikin. In 1871 Ogle defaulted on the latter debt, Mullikin filed suit and the court ruled the Belair be sold to satisfy the debt.<ref name=p65-68/> The property was described in the auction notices as:\n{{quotation|\n\"550&nbsp;acres, more or less, and in one of the finest farms in Prince George's County. It lies along the line of the [[Baltimore and Potomac Railroad]] about one-quarter of a mile from [[Collington, Maryland|Collington]], where there will be a Depot on said road. The improvements are a large, two story brick dwelling house, 3 tobacco houses, corn house, granary, stables, servants' house, etc. The soil is well adapted to the growth of tobacco, corn, wheat, etc. Wood and water abundant.\"<ref name=p65-68/>}}\n\nThe property was sold to the executors of the estate of the [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] holder, [[William Henry Tayloe]] on May 16, 1871. The winning bidders were Thomas Munford and Henry Augustine Tayloe II who paid $5,100 but the contingency remained on the deed and Rosalie Ogle remained in the house.<ref name=p68/> When [[tenant farmer]]s moved in the mansion alongside Rosalie, she took them to court stating that she could not live in a house with people so far below her station.

Rutter. Belair subsequently changed hands numerous times while it continued to fall further into disrepair. The property was divided into smaller parcels, some of which were then recombined.
