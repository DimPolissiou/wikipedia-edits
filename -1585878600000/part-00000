(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

It begins in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], as [[George Washington Bridge Plaza|Fletcher Avenue]] crosses the [[U.S. Route 1/9|US&nbsp;1\u20139]], [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]], and the [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95) approaches to the [[George Washington Bridge]], and heads north up the west side of the [[Hudson River]] to [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] in [[Albany, New York]]. As its \"W\" suffix indicates, US&nbsp;9W is a westerly alternate route of US&nbsp;9 between the two locations. US&nbsp;9W directly serves three cities\u2014[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], [[Kingston (city), New York|Kingston]], and Albany\u2014and enters the vicinity of several others. As the route heads north, it connects to several highways of regional importance, including [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]], [[U.S. Route 209|US&nbsp;209]], [[New York State Route&nbsp;23]] (NY&nbsp;23), and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. Much of US&nbsp;9W parallels the [[New York State Thruway]] and [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]]; additionally, the latter [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with US&nbsp;9W in four different locations.\n\n==Route description==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nFor much of its length, US&nbsp;9W is a two-lane surface road. However, some stretches in New Jersey and New York widen to four lanes, and much of the highway in Orange County is like an expressway even if not so designated.\n\n===New Jersey===\n[[File:2018-07-22 11 50 15 View north along U.S. Route 9W just north of The Esplanade in Alpine, Bergen County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View north along US 9W between The Esplanade and Hillside Avenue in Alpine, New Jersey.]]\nUS&nbsp;9W begins as a four lane road. Heading north on Fletcher Avenue (from Kelby Street intersection, near the [[George Washington Bridge]]) in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], US&nbsp;9W occupies the right-of-way of the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] (PIP) to Lemoine Avenue, the northern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 67|Route&nbsp;67]]. US&nbsp;9W exits the right-of-way, turning north onto Lemoine Avenue, later Sylvan Avenue, in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|Englewood Cliffs]], where it passes the headquarters of [[Ferrari|Ferrari of North America]], [[Unilever]], and [[CNBC]]. As the roadway enters Tenafly from Englewood Cliffs, it reduces to a two lane roadway from four lanes. It continues to parallel the PIP to its west as they progress northward along the west bank of the [[Hudson River]] until reaching the border with New York State. Both roads run very near the top of the [[New Jersey Palisades|Palisades]], occasionally offering views of New York City and the river.\n\nLemoine Avenue is heavy with commercial development in the Coytesville section of Fort Lee, but as the road runs into Englewood Cliffs it transitions to corporate office buildings,  and into the affluent community of [[Alpine, New Jersey|Alpine]] in the state's northeastern corner, it becomes more residential. Near [[Norwood, New Jersey|Norwood]], just south of the state line, US&nbsp;9W crosses under the parkway and enters New York.  Before the construction of the PIP, US&nbsp;9W used to follow a route through the State Line Lookout at the New Jersey\u2013New York border which is now accessible only from the parkway.\n\nThe entire route of US&nbsp;9W in New Jersey is within [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]].\n\n===New York===\n\n====Rockland County====\nAcross the state line, US&nbsp;9W continues in [[Palisades, New York|Palisades]] as Highland Avenue, a two-lane road through mostly residential suburban surroundings. It passes [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and then [[Tallman Mountain State Park]]. Bending westward to [[Sparkill, New York|Sparkill]], it meets [[New York State Route 340|NY&nbsp;340]].\n\nIt returns to the riverside at [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], where it takes the name Broadway Avenue. Running due north, it enters [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and meets with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]]) just west of the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. It then runs along the Thruway to the east terminus of [[New York State Route 59|NY&nbsp;59]] in downtown Nyack, where it becomes North Highland Avenue once again. North of [[Upper Nyack, New York|Upper Nyack]], it passes Rockland Lake thru [[Valley Cottage, New York|Valley Cottage]] and then [[Rockland Lake State Park]].\n\nAlongside the park, it crosses town lines again. [[New York State Route 303|NY&nbsp;303]] reaches its north end just after the park, and after a tight curve [[New York State Route 304|NY&nbsp;304]], reaches its northern terminus as well.\n\nUS&nbsp;9W then returns to the riverside briefly, trending away from it into [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw]] under the name Congers Avenue. The village is followed immediately by [[West Haverstraw, New York|West Haverstraw]], where [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] comes in at an oblique angle and joins US&nbsp;9W, creating the first [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] along the route.\n\n[[File:Hudson River National Defense Reserve (Mothball) Fleet.jpg|thumb|left|Hudson River ''Mothball'' Fleet]]\nThe combined highways head north from the Haverstraws as South, then North, Liberty Drive, passing [[Stony Point Battlefield]]. They return to the Hudson at Tomkins Cove, where the Hudson River National Defense Reserve (Mothball) Fleet was moored from 1947 to 1971.  Between Tomkins Cove and Jones Point there are two large ships anchor surrounding a monument alongside the road that marks the spot which is just across from the [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in [[Buchanan, New York|Buchanan]].\n\n[[File:US 9W north of Stony Point.jpg|thumb|left|Route&nbsp;9W climbing Dunderburg Mountain in northern Rockland County.]]\nAt Jones Point the road curves and bends above the river as it works its way around [[Dunderberg Mountain]], the southernmost peak of the [[Hudson Highlands]] and part of [[Bear Mountain State Park]].\n\nAt Iona Island, it levels out again briefly and then US&nbsp;9W/202 climbs to the heart of the state park at Bear Mountain Inn and [[Hessian Lake]], where the [[Appalachian Trail]] crosses beneath the road in the only man-made tunnel along its entire route. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] line is crossed just before Bear Mountain Circle.\n\n====Orange County====\n[[File:US9WBearMountainCircle.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;9W, as seen from the north end of Palisades Interstate Parkway at the Bear Mountain Circle in Fort Montgomery]]\nThe circle marks the northern terminus of the Palisades Parkway and the junction with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]]. US&nbsp;202 leaves US&nbsp;9W to join US&nbsp;6 here and cross the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. North of the circle, US&nbsp;9W continues as an undivided four-lane road, crossing [[Popolopen Creek]] and affording views of the similarly named Torne. It passes first the historic [[Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)|Fort Montgomery]], then enters the small hamlet of [[Fort Montgomery, New York|the same name]], distinguished by a post office, gas station, and some other small businesses.\n\nA half-mile (1&nbsp;km) further north, [[New York State Route 218|NY&nbsp;218]] ([[Storm King Highway]]), the former route of US&nbsp;9W, forks off to the right, carrying traffic to [[Highland Falls, New York|Highland Falls]] and the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. At this point US&nbsp;9W becomes a divided [[limited-access highway]] as it starts to climb the highlands above the village and the academy. The first exit is NY&nbsp;218, which joins US&nbsp;9W for a mile just north of the village. It leaves the highway at the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 293|NY&nbsp;293]] to run alongside [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]].\n\n[[File:West Point from 9@.JPG|left|thumb|[[United States Military Academy|West Point]] viewed from US&nbsp;9W just before passing over [[Crow's Nest (Hudson Highlands)|Crow's Nest]]]]\nFrom here, US&nbsp;9W continues its ascent, offering sweeping views over the river and Highlands, with an overlook available to northbound drivers. The surrounding land is all woods, part of the vast USMA property. After passing Crow's Nest, Storm King and the rocky cliff faces of Butter Hill dominate the northward view. Another parking lot allows travelers to stop and sightsee, as well as [[hiking|hike]] the Stillman Trail up the two peaks.\n\nAfter Storm King, the road begins a long descent into the [[Cornwall, New York|Town of Cornwall]]. Just outside the village of [[Cornwall on Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] and the fields of [[New York Military Academy]], NY&nbsp;218 ends its loop. Shortly afterwards, the division ends and grade intersections resume, although the road remains four lanes as it enters the [[New Windsor, New York|Town of New Windsor]].\n\n[[File:US 9W in Hudson Highlands.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;9W winding through the Hudson Highlands]]\nIt descends again where [[Breakneck Ridge]] and [[Bull Hill]] tower across the river. Traffic begins to slow down at [[New Windsor (CDP), New York|the center of town]], where [[New York State Route 94|NY&nbsp;94]] ends its journey across the county. After this traffic light, the road begins to narrow. Once across [[Quassaick Creek]] and into [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], it is Robinson Avenue, a wide urban arterial with parking along the sides.\n\nIt ascends gently past [[Delano-Hitch Stadium]] and the associated park to the center of its passage across Newburgh, the intersection with Broadway. Here [[New York State Route 17K|NY&nbsp;17K]] has its eastern terminus, and [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]], the other main surface route west of the Hudson, begins its first concurrency with US&nbsp;9W.\n\nPassing Broadway School, a former elementary school which is in the process of being converted into the City of Newburgh Court House, the two routes head into a more residential sector of the city, marked by the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed [[Downing Park (Newburgh, New York)|Downing Park]]. The road's climb continues until the North campus of Newburgh Free Academy, where it starts to descend to the busy exit at [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]], visible ahead, just west of the [[Newburgh&ndash;Beacon Bridge]]. This junction, also including [[New York State Route 52|NY&nbsp;52]], is the city's northern limit.\n\n[[File:Downing Park, Newburgh, NY.jpg|thumb|left|Downing Park in the city of Newburgh]]\nImmediately after it, NY&nbsp;32 leaves to the northwest while US&nbsp;9W continues northwards. It passes [[Powelton Country Club]], part of the affluent community of [[Balmville, New York|Balmville]], the first of several within the [[Newburgh (town), New York|Town of Newburgh]] that 9W will pass. Middle Hope follows, as the road becomes a two-lane route with a rural feel. Development continues along the road, but there are increasingly large unbroken fields or [[woodlot]]s and finally, in the northern reaches of the town, [[orchard]]s. At Roseton, past the access road to the nearby power plants, the highway reaches the county line just past the turnoff to the [[Gomez Mill House]], the earliest surviving Jewish home in the U.S.\n\n====Ulster County====\n\nTraffic is slowed when it passes through the hamlet of [[Marlboro, New York|Marlboro]], but otherwise there is little change in US&nbsp;9W until it widens to four lanes again just south of the [[Mid-Hudson Bridge]] approach overpass. At this point, [[U.S. Route 44 in New York|US&nbsp;44]] and [[New York State Route 55|NY&nbsp;55]] join the highway from the east. The road becomes a busy commercial strip for the next mile to the concurrency's end, where NY&nbsp;44 and NY&nbsp;55 go down into [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|Highland]]. The four lanes continue, however, for several more miles until well past the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 299|NY&nbsp;299]], the road that carries traffic west toward the Thruway and [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]].\n\nAbout {{convert|2|mi|1}} north of that intersection, the road returns to two lanes through [[West Park, New York|West Park]] and [[Esopus, New York|Esopus]], passing primarily through largely undeveloped, primarily wooded countryside. It becomes more built up at [[Port Ewen, New York|Port Ewen]], just south of Kingston, which it enters by crossing [[Rondout Creek]] via the [[John T. Loughran Bridge]] and becoming Frank Koenig Boulevard and four lanes with limited access.\n\n[[File:US 9W Kingston south approach.jpg|right|thumb|US&nbsp;9W entering Kingston.]]\n\nIt runs right through Kingston this way and meets NY&nbsp;32 again at the city's northern boundary. Turning left, US&nbsp;9W's second concurrency with NY&nbsp;32 is only {{convert|500|ft|m}} long as it almost immediately turns right onto East Chester Street. The road widens again, becoming a busy commercial strip. At the freeway interchange ahead for the [[Kingston&ndash;Rhinecliff Bridge]], [[U.S. Route 209|US&nbsp;209]] comes to its northern end and [[New York State Route 199|NY&nbsp;199]] its western.\n\nIn [[Lake Katrine, New York|Lake Katrine]], the road begins to narrow and traffic lightens. US&nbsp;9W stays on a straight northward course, following alongside [[Esopus Creek]] but not crossing it, until it veers northeast to merge, once again, with NY&nbsp;32.\n\nThis third concurrency finally brings the road over the Esopus and into the riverside village of [[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties]]. Here US&nbsp;9W follows Main Street when the routes part again, with NY&nbsp;32 carrying [[New York State Route 212|NY&nbsp;212]] out of this junction. As Malden Avenue, the highway continues north alongside the river once again, passing through the hamlet of [[Malden, New York|Malden-on-Hudson]] on its way up into [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]].\n\n====Greene County and north====\n\nIn [[Catskill (town), New York|Catskill]], US&nbsp;9W meets with [[New York State Route 23A|NY&nbsp;23A]], then [[New York State Route 385|NY&nbsp;385]] at its southern terminus, then a mile north, [[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]].\n\nIn [[Coxsackie (town), New York|Coxsackie]], US&nbsp;9W meets this time with the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;385, as well as the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 81|NY&nbsp;81]]. In [[West Coxsackie, New York|West Coxsackie]], US&nbsp;9W meets with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]). Further north, the route meets [[New York State Route 144|NY&nbsp;144]], and in the village of [[Ravena, New York|Ravena]], it meets [[New York State Route 143|NY&nbsp;143]].\n\n[[New York State Route 396|NY&nbsp;396]] meets US&nbsp;9W in [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]]. After briefly joining with NY&nbsp;32 again, US&nbsp;9W meets [[Interstate 787|I-787]] south of Albany. Immediately thereafter, [[New York State Route 443|NY&nbsp;443]] joins US&nbsp;9W until Madison Avenue ([[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]), where NY&nbsp;443 ends. US&nbsp;9W, however, continues on, meeting with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] (junction not signed on NY&nbsp;5) before ending at [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] ([[Clinton Avenue Historic District (Albany, New York)|Clinton Avenue]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nIn New York, much of what is now US&nbsp;9W was designated as Route&nbsp;3, an unsigned [[legislative route]], by the [[New York State Legislature]] in 1908. The route extended from the [[New Jersey]] state line at [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] and went northward through the [[Hudson Valley]] to the city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Route&nbsp;3 broke from modern US&nbsp;9W in several locations, mostly in areas where the route has since been moved onto bypasses. In [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], Route&nbsp;3 veered west to serve [[Congers, New York|Congers]] via Lake and Old Haverstraw Roads. From [[Highland Falls, New York|Highland Falls]] to [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]], Route&nbsp;3 followed modern [[New York State Route 218|NY&nbsp;218]] around [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]]. Lastly, Route&nbsp;3 utilized current [[New York State Route 385|NY&nbsp;385]] between [[Catskill (village), New York|Catskill]] and [[Coxsackie (village), New York|Coxsackie]].<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

It begins in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]], as [[George Washington Bridge Plaza|Fletcher Avenue]] crosses the [[U.S. Route 1/9|US&nbsp;1\u20139]], [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]], and the [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|Interstate&nbsp;95]] (I-95) approaches to the [[George Washington Bridge]], and heads north up the west side of the [[Hudson River]] to [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] in [[Albany, New York]]. As its \"W\" suffix indicates, US&nbsp;9W is a westerly alternate route of US&nbsp;9 between the two locations. US&nbsp;9W directly serves three cities\u2014[[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], [[Kingston (city), New York|Kingston]], and Albany\u2014and enters the vicinity of several others. As the route heads north, it connects to several highways of regional importance, including [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]], [[U.S. Route 209|US&nbsp;209]], [[New York State Route&nbsp;23]] (NY&nbsp;23), and [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]. Much of US&nbsp;9W parallels the [[New York State Thruway]] and [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]]; additionally, the latter [[overlap (road)|overlap]]s with US&nbsp;9W in four different locations.\n\n==Route description==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\nFor much of its length, US&nbsp;9W is a two-lane surface road. However, some stretches in New Jersey and New York widen to four lanes, and much of the highway in Orange County is like an expressway even if not so designated.\n\n===New Jersey===\n[[File:2018-07-22 11 50 15 View north along U.S. Route 9W just north of The Esplanade in Alpine, Bergen County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|View north along US 9W between The Esplanade and Hillside Avenue in Alpine, New Jersey.]]\nUS&nbsp;9W begins as a four lane road. Heading north on Fletcher Avenue (from Kelby Street intersection, near the [[George Washington Bridge]]) in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], US&nbsp;9W occupies the right-of-way of the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]] (PIP) to Lemoine Avenue, the northern terminus of [[New Jersey Route 67|Route&nbsp;67]]. US&nbsp;9W exits the right-of-way, turning north onto Lemoine Avenue, later Sylvan Avenue, in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|Englewood Cliffs]], where it passes the headquarters of [[Ferrari|Ferrari of North America]], [[Unilever]], and [[CNBC]]. As the roadway enters Tenafly from Englewood Cliffs, it reduces to a two lane roadway from four lanes. It continues to parallel the PIP to its west as they progress northward along the west bank of the [[Hudson River]] until reaching the border with New York State. Both roads run very near the top of the [[New Jersey Palisades|Palisades]], occasionally offering views of New York City and the river.\n\nLemoine Avenue is heavy with commercial development in the Coytesville section of Fort Lee, but as the road runs into Englewood Cliffs it transitions to corporate office buildings,  and into the affluent community of [[Alpine, New Jersey|Alpine]] in the state's northeastern corner, it becomes more residential. Near [[Norwood, New Jersey|Norwood]], just south of the state line, US&nbsp;9W crosses under the parkway and enters New York.  Before the construction of the PIP, US&nbsp;9W used to follow a route through the State Line Lookout at the New Jersey\u2013New York border which is now accessible only from the parkway.\n\nThe entire route of US&nbsp;9W in New Jersey is within [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]].\n\n===New York===\n\n====Rockland County====\nAcross the state line, US&nbsp;9W continues in [[Palisades, New York|Palisades]] as Highland Avenue, a two-lane road through mostly residential suburban surroundings. It passes [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and then [[Tallman Mountain State Park]]. Bending westward to [[Sparkill, New York|Sparkill]], it meets [[New York State Route 340|NY&nbsp;340]].\n\nIt returns to the riverside at [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], where it takes the name Broadway Avenue. Running due north, it enters [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and meets with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]] and [[Interstate 287|I-287]]) just west of the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]]. It then runs along the Thruway to the east terminus of [[New York State Route 59|NY&nbsp;59]] in downtown Nyack, where it becomes North Highland Avenue once again. North of [[Upper Nyack, New York|Upper Nyack]], it passes Rockland Lake thru [[Valley Cottage, New York|Valley Cottage]] and then [[Rockland Lake State Park]].\n\nAlongside the park, it crosses town lines again. [[New York State Route 303|NY&nbsp;303]] reaches its north end just after the park, and after a tight curve [[New York State Route 304|NY&nbsp;304]], reaches its northern terminus as well.\n\nUS&nbsp;9W then returns to the riverside briefly, trending away from it into [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw]] under the name Congers Avenue. The village is followed immediately by [[West Haverstraw, New York|West Haverstraw]], where [[U.S. Route 202 in New York|US&nbsp;202]] comes in at an oblique angle and joins US&nbsp;9W, creating the first [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] along the route.\n\n[[File:Hudson River National Defense Reserve (Mothball) Fleet.jpg|thumb|left|Hudson River ''Mothball'' Fleet]]\nThe combined highways head north from the Haverstraws as South, then North, Liberty Drive, passing [[Stony Point Battlefield]]. They return to the Hudson at Tomkins Cove, where the Hudson River National Defense Reserve (Mothball) Fleet was moored from 1947 to 1971.  Between Tomkins Cove and Jones Point there are two large ships anchor surrounding a monument alongside the road that marks the spot which is just across from the [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in [[Buchanan, New York|Buchanan]].\n\n[[File:US 9W north of Stony Point.jpg|thumb|left|Route&nbsp;9W climbing Dunderburg Mountain in northern Rockland County.]]\nAt Jones Point the road curves and bends above the river as it works its way around [[Dunderberg Mountain]], the southernmost peak of the [[Hudson Highlands]] and part of [[Bear Mountain State Park]].\n\nAt Iona Island, it levels out again briefly and then US&nbsp;9W/202 climbs to the heart of the state park at Bear Mountain Inn and [[Hessian Lake]], where the [[Appalachian Trail]] crosses beneath the road in the only man-made tunnel along its entire route. The [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]] line is crossed just before Bear Mountain Circle.\n\n====Orange County====\n[[File:US9WBearMountainCircle.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;9W, as seen from the north end of Palisades Interstate Parkway at the Bear Mountain Circle in Fort Montgomery]]\nThe circle marks the northern terminus of the Palisades Parkway and the junction with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]]. US&nbsp;202 leaves US&nbsp;9W to join US&nbsp;6 here and cross the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. North of the circle, US&nbsp;9W continues as an undivided four-lane road, crossing [[Popolopen Creek]] and affording views of the similarly named Torne. It passes first the historic [[Fort Montgomery (Hudson River)|Fort Montgomery]], then enters the small hamlet of [[Fort Montgomery, New York|the same name]], distinguished by a post office, gas station, and some other small businesses.\n\nA half-mile (1&nbsp;km) further north, [[New York State Route 218|NY&nbsp;218]] ([[Storm King Highway]]), the former route of US&nbsp;9W, forks off to the right, carrying traffic to [[Highland Falls, New York|Highland Falls]] and the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. At this point US&nbsp;9W becomes a divided [[limited-access highway]] as it starts to climb the highlands above the village and the academy. The first exit is NY&nbsp;218, which joins US&nbsp;9W for a mile just north of the village. It leaves the highway at the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 293|NY&nbsp;293]] to run alongside [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]].\n\n[[File:West Point from 9@.JPG|left|thumb|[[United States Military Academy|West Point]] viewed from US&nbsp;9W just before passing over [[Crow's Nest (Hudson Highlands)|Crow's Nest]]]]\nFrom here, US&nbsp;9W continues its ascent, offering sweeping views over the river and Highlands, with an overlook available to northbound drivers. The surrounding land is all woods, part of the vast USMA property. After passing Crow's Nest, Storm King and the rocky cliff faces of Butter Hill dominate the northward view. Another parking lot allows travelers to stop and sightsee, as well as [[hiking|hike]] the Stillman Trail up the two peaks.\n\nAfter Storm King, the road begins a long descent into the [[Cornwall, New York|Town of Cornwall]]. Just outside the village of [[Cornwall on Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] and the fields of [[New York Military Academy]], NY&nbsp;218 ends its loop. Shortly afterwards, the division ends and grade intersections resume, although the road remains four lanes as it enters the [[New Windsor, New York|Town of New Windsor]].\n\n[[File:US 9W in Hudson Highlands.jpg|thumb|right|US&nbsp;9W winding through the Hudson Highlands]]\nIt descends again where [[Breakneck Ridge]] and [[Bull Hill]] tower across the river. Traffic begins to slow down at [[New Windsor (CDP), New York|the center of town]], where [[New York State Route 94|NY&nbsp;94]] ends its journey across the county. After this traffic light, the road begins to narrow. Once across [[Quassaick Creek]] and into [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], it is Robinson Avenue, a wide urban arterial with parking along the sides.\n\nIt ascends gently past [[Delano-Hitch Stadium]] and the associated park to the center of its passage across Newburgh, the intersection with Broadway. Here [[New York State Route 17K|NY&nbsp;17K]] has its eastern terminus, and [[New York State Route 32|NY&nbsp;32]], the other main surface route west of the Hudson, begins its first concurrency with US&nbsp;9W.\n\nPassing Broadway School, a former elementary school which is in the process of being converted into the City of Newburgh Court House, the two routes head into a more residential sector of the city, marked by the [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]-designed [[Downing Park (Newburgh, New York)|Downing Park]]. The road's climb continues until the North campus of Newburgh Free Academy, where it starts to descend to the busy exit at [[Interstate 84 in New York|I-84]], visible ahead, just west of the [[Newburgh&ndash;Beacon Bridge]]. This junction, also including [[New York State Route 52|NY&nbsp;52]], is the city's northern limit.\n\n[[File:Downing Park, Newburgh, NY.jpg|thumb|left|Downing Park in the city of Newburgh]]\nImmediately after it, NY&nbsp;32 leaves to the northwest while US&nbsp;9W continues northwards. It passes [[Powelton Country Club]], part of the affluent community of [[Balmville, New York|Balmville]], the first of several within the [[Newburgh (town), New York|Town of Newburgh]] that 9W will pass. Middle Hope follows, as the road becomes a two-lane route with a rural feel. Development continues along the road, but there are increasingly large unbroken fields or [[woodlot]]s and finally, in the northern reaches of the town, [[orchard]]s. At Roseton, past the access road to the nearby power plants, the highway reaches the county line just past the turnoff to the [[Gomez Mill House]], the earliest surviving Jewish home in the U.S.\n\n====Ulster County====\n\nTraffic is slowed when it passes through the hamlet of [[Marlboro, New York|Marlboro]], but otherwise there is little change in US&nbsp;9W until it widens to four lanes again just south of the [[Mid-Hudson Bridge]] approach overpass. At this point, [[U.S. Route 44 in New York|US&nbsp;44]] and [[New York State Route 55|NY&nbsp;55]] join the highway from the east. The road becomes a busy commercial strip for the next mile to the concurrency's end, where NY&nbsp;44 and NY&nbsp;55 go down into [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|Highland]]. The four lanes continue, however, for several more miles until well past the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 299|NY&nbsp;299]], the road that carries traffic west toward the Thruway and [[New Paltz (village), New York|New Paltz]].\n\nAbout {{convert|2|mi|1}} north of that intersection, the road returns to two lanes through [[West Park, New York|West Park]] and [[Esopus, New York|Esopus]], passing primarily through largely undeveloped, primarily wooded countryside. It becomes more built up at [[Port Ewen, New York|Port Ewen]], just south of Kingston, which it enters by crossing [[Rondout Creek]] via the [[John T. Loughran Bridge]] and becoming Frank Koenig Boulevard and four lanes with limited access.\n\n[[File:US 9W Kingston south approach.jpg|right|thumb|US&nbsp;9W entering Kingston.]]\n\nIt runs right through Kingston this way and meets NY&nbsp;32 again at the city's northern boundary. Turning left, US&nbsp;9W's second concurrency with NY&nbsp;32 is only {{convert|500|ft|m}} long as it almost immediately turns right onto East Chester Street. The road widens again, becoming a busy commercial strip. At the freeway interchange ahead for the [[Kingston&ndash;Rhinecliff Bridge]], [[U.S. Route 209|US&nbsp;209]] comes to its northern end and [[New York State Route 199|NY&nbsp;199]] its western.\n\nIn [[Lake Katrine, New York|Lake Katrine]], the road begins to narrow and traffic lightens. US&nbsp;9W stays on a straight northward course, following alongside [[Esopus Creek]] but not crossing it, until it veers northeast to merge, once again, with NY&nbsp;32.\n\nThis third concurrency finally brings the road over the Esopus and into the riverside village of [[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties]]. Here US&nbsp;9W follows Main Street when the routes part again, with NY&nbsp;32 carrying [[New York State Route 212|NY&nbsp;212]] out of this junction. As Malden Avenue, the highway continues north alongside the river once again, passing through the hamlet of [[Malden, New York|Malden-on-Hudson]] on its way up into [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]].\n\n====Greene County and north====\n\nIn [[Catskill (town), New York|Catskill]], US&nbsp;9W meets with [[New York State Route 23A|NY&nbsp;23A]], then [[New York State Route 385|NY&nbsp;385]] at its southern terminus, then a mile north, [[New York State Route 23|NY&nbsp;23]].\n\nIn [[Coxsackie (town), New York|Coxsackie]], US&nbsp;9W meets this time with the northern terminus of NY&nbsp;385, as well as the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 81|NY&nbsp;81]]. In [[West Coxsackie, New York|West Coxsackie]], US&nbsp;9W meets with the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]). Further north, the route meets [[New York State Route 144|NY&nbsp;144]], and in the village of [[Ravena, New York|Ravena]], it meets [[New York State Route 143|NY&nbsp;143]].\n\n[[New York State Route 396|NY&nbsp;396]] meets US&nbsp;9W in [[Selkirk, New York|Selkirk]]. After briefly joining with NY&nbsp;32 again, US&nbsp;9W meets [[Interstate 787|I-787]] south of Albany. Immediately thereafter, [[New York State Route 443|NY&nbsp;443]] joins US&nbsp;9W until Madison Avenue ([[U.S. Route 20 in New York|US&nbsp;20]]), where NY&nbsp;443 ends. US&nbsp;9W, however, continues on, meeting with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] (junction not signed on NY&nbsp;5) before ending at [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] ([[Clinton Avenue Historic District (Albany, New York)|Clinton Avenue]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nIn New York, much of what is now US&nbsp;9W was designated as Route&nbsp;3, an unsigned [[legislative route]], by the [[New York State Legislature]] in 1908. The route extended from the [[New Jersey]] state line at [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] and went northward through the [[Hudson Valley]] to the city of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Route&nbsp;3 broke from modern US&nbsp;9W in several locations, mostly in areas where the route has since been moved onto bypasses. In [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], Route&nbsp;3 veered west to serve [[Congers, New York|Congers]] via Lake and Old Haverstraw Roads. From [[Highland Falls, New York|Highland Falls]] to [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]], Route&nbsp;3 followed modern [[New York State Route 218|NY&nbsp;218]] around [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]]. Lastly, Route&nbsp;3 utilized current [[New York State Route 385|NY&nbsp;385]] between [[Catskill (village), New York|Catskill]] and [[Coxsackie (village), New York|Coxsackie]].<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

On April&nbsp;8, 1934, three people were killed by a rockslide on the Storm King Highway, expediting plans for the new highway, known as the Storm King Cut-off.<ref name=\"1939nyt\">{{cite news |title=Storm King Cut-Off Pushed |last=Mathieu |first=George M. |date=August 6, 1939 |newspaper=The New York Times |pages=XX1, XX10}}</ref> The southernmost {{convert|2|mi|1}} of the highway\u2014from the bridge to just north of [[Fort Montgomery, New York|Fort Montgomery]]\u2014utilized the existing right-of-way of US&nbsp;9W,<ref name=\"1937nyt\" /> which was widened from two to four lanes<ref name=\"1939nyt\" /> and straightened through the construction of rock [[cut (earthmoving)|cut]]s.

It was built with four lanes and constructed along the sides of Storm King Mountain and other, smaller hills in the area. The high elevation of the roadway gave rise to a bevy of scenic, panoramic views that stretched for several miles into the distance; as a result, a fifth lane was added in some areas to allow motorists to stop and view the scenery. Like the section south of Fort Montgomery, the one-mile stretch that utilized the original US&nbsp;9W was widened to four lanes as well. Several interchanges were built along the route, including with [[New York State Route 293|NY&nbsp;293]] and [[New York State Route 307|NY&nbsp;307]].<ref name=\"1939nyt\" /> The cut-off was opened to traffic from Fort Montgomery to NY&nbsp;293 sometime in 1939 or 1940 and to Angola Road ([[County Route 9 (Orange County, New York)|CR&nbsp;9]]) on September&nbsp;26, 1940.<ref name=\"1939nyt\" /><ref>{{cite news |title=A New Route North |last=Mathieu |first=George M. |date=September 22, 1940 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=XX1}}</ref> The last section, from Angola Road north to Blooming Grove Turnpike north of Cornwall-on-Hudson, was opened to traffic on May&nbsp;31, 1941.
