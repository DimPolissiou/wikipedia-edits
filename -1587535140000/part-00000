In 1994 Vreni Schumacher donated Fritz's personal library and archives. The library has about fifteen thousand books. The library building is 2,000 square foot, located on the side of Jug End Mountain in the Berkshire region of Massachusetts.

Their partnership grew after graduation as part of the comedy group [[The Credibility Gap]] with [[Harry Shearer]] in Los Angeles, but McKean's breakthrough came in 1976 when he and Lander joined the cast of ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' portraying Lenny and Squiggy. McKean directed one episode, and the characters became something of a phenomenon, even releasing an album as ''[[Lenny and the Squigtones]]'' in 1979, which featured a young [[Christopher Guest]] on guitar (credited as ''Nigel Tufnel''\u2014the name Guest would use a few years later as part of the spoof [[rock music|rock]] band, [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]). \"Foreign Legion of Love\" was a big hit for the Squigtones, with frequent play on the ''[[Dr. Demento#The Dr. Demento radio show|Dr. Demento Show]]''. McKean also played his character in an episode of ''[[Happy Days]]''. After leaving ''Laverne & Shirley'' in 1982, McKean played [[David St. Hubbins]] in the comedy ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'' with both Guest and Shearer, and appeared in the soap opera spoof ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]''.\n\nMcKean quickly became a recognizable name in film and television, with appearances in films such as ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980), ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' (1985), ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'' (1987), ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' (1988), and taking a lead role in ''[[Short Circuit 2]]'' (1988).\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, McKean appeared opposite [[Kiefer Sutherland]] and [[Dennis Hopper]] in the American [[adventure comedy]] ''[[Flashback (1990 film)|Flashback]]''.

Their partnership grew after graduation as part of the comedy group [[The Credibility Gap]] with [[Harry Shearer]] in Los Angeles, but McKean's breakthrough came in 1976 when he and Lander joined the cast of ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' portraying Lenny and Squiggy. McKean directed one episode, and the characters became something of a phenomenon, even releasing an album as ''[[Lenny and the Squigtones]]'' in 1979, which featured a young [[Christopher Guest]] on guitar (credited as ''Nigel Tufnel''\u2014the name Guest would use a few years later as part of the spoof [[rock music|rock]] band, [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]]). \"Foreign Legion of Love\" was a big hit for the Squigtones, with frequent play on the ''[[Dr. Demento#The Dr. Demento radio show|Dr. Demento Show]]''. McKean also played his character in an episode of ''[[Happy Days]]''. After leaving ''Laverne & Shirley'' in 1982, McKean played [[David St. Hubbins]] in the comedy ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'' with both Guest and Shearer, and appeared in the soap opera spoof ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]''.\n\nMcKean quickly became a recognizable name in film and television, with appearances in films such as ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980), ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' (1985), ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'' (1987), ''[[Earth Girls Are Easy]]'' (1988), and taking a lead role in ''[[Short Circuit 2]]'' (1988).\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, McKean appeared opposite [[Kiefer Sutherland]] and [[Dennis Hopper]] in the American [[adventure comedy]] ''[[Flashback (1990 film)|Flashback]]''.
