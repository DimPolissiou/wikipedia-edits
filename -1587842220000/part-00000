''Yadavas'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''patal(mukhiya)'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nDespite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Customs ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masai Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morvi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Family arrangements ===\nMembers of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2\u20133, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nMarried couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Bharwads practice \"sartorial conservatism\", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&nbsp;\u2014 in terms of style, colour and material&nbsp;\u2014 have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}\n\nThe clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&nbsp;\u2014 as late as the early 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nThere also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dhangar]]\n* [[Rabari]]\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{notelist}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |title=Culture and Customs of India |first=Carol E. |last=Henderson |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=9780313305139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaRVePXX6vEC}}\n*{{citation |title=People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part One |editor1-first=Rajendra Behari |editor1-last=Lal |editor2-first=P.

''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nDespite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Customs ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masai Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morvi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Family arrangements ===\nMembers of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2\u20133, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nMarried couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Bharwads practice \"sartorial conservatism\", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&nbsp;\u2014 in terms of style, colour and material&nbsp;\u2014 have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}\n\nThe clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&nbsp;\u2014 as late as the early 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nThere also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dhangar]]\n* [[Rabari]]\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{notelist}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |title=Culture and Customs of India |first=Carol E. |last=Henderson |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=9780313305139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaRVePXX6vEC}}\n*{{citation |title=People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part One |editor1-first=Rajendra Behari |editor1-last=Lal |editor2-first=P.

His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104\u2013103 victory in the game and a 3\u20131 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the [[New York Knicks]] in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], Mourning and teammate [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] led the Hornets to a [[1994\u201395 Charlotte Hornets season|50-win season]] and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in [[point (basketball)|scoring]] (21.3 per game), [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] (9.9 per game), [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] (2.92 per game), and [[field goal percentage]] (.519), and played in the [[1995 NBA All-Star Game]] where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n===Miami Heat===\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves [[Pete Myers]] and [[LeRon Ellis]] in exchange for [[Glen Rice]], [[Matt Geiger]], [[Khalid Reeves]] and a first-round pick in the [[1996 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cawthon|first1=Raad|author2=Michael Sokolov|title=Hornets Forced To Deal Alonzo Mourning, Seeking $13 Million A Year, Went To Miami In A Six-player Swap.

In the playoffs, Miami defeated the [[Orlando Magic]] in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where [[Heat\u2013Knicks rivalry|the rivalry]] between the Heat and the [[New York Knicks]] intensified. The Knicks took a 3\u20131 series lead, but following a brawl between [[Charlie Ward]] and [[P. J. Brown]] late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down.

O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004\u201305 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest.

As a senior, he averaged 25 points, 15 rebounds and 12 blocked shots per game. He was named Player of the Year by USA Today, Parade, Gatorade, and Naismith. He was the #1 recruit of the 1988 class, over Billy Owens, Kenny Williams, [[Shawn Kemp]], Stanley Roberts, [[Christian Laettner]], [[Rick Fox]], and Malik Sealy, among others.\n\n==College career==\nMourning played [[college basketball]] for the [[Georgetown University]] [[Georgetown Hoyas|Hoyas]]. He led the nation in blocked shots his freshman year and was an All-American his last year there.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Charlotte Hornets===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2014}}\nMourning was selected second overall in the [[1992 NBA draft]] by the [[Charlotte Hornets]], behind [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and before [[Christian Laettner]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hornets Happenings: The Five Best Hornets Draft Picks of All Time |first= Paul |last= Augustin |url= http://bleacherreport.com/articles/210796-hornets-happenings-the-best-hornets-draft-picks-of-all-time|work= [[Bleacher Report]] |date= July 2, 2009}}</ref> Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks.

Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] in the [[1989\u201390 NBA season|1989\u201390 season]] to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the [[Boston Celtics]]. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104\u2013103 victory in the game and a 3\u20131 victory in the series. The Hornets lost in the second round to the [[New York Knicks]] in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|1994\u201395 season]], Mourning and teammate [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] led the Hornets to a [[1994\u201395 Charlotte Hornets season|50-win season]] and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in [[point (basketball)|scoring]] (21.3 per game), [[rebound (basketball)|rebounding]] (9.9 per game), [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] (2.92 per game), and [[field goal percentage]] (.519), and played in the [[1995 NBA All-Star Game]] where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n===Miami Heat===\nOn November 3, 1995, after Mourning rejected Charlotte's contract extension offer worth an average of $11.2 million for seven years and knowing they would not be able to re-sign him, the Hornets traded him, along with reserves [[Pete Myers]] and [[LeRon Ellis]] in exchange for [[Glen Rice]], [[Matt Geiger]], [[Khalid Reeves]] and a first-round pick in the [[1996 NBA draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cawthon|first1=Raad|author2=Michael Sokolov|title=Hornets Forced To Deal Alonzo Mourning, Seeking $13 Million A Year, Went To Miami In A Six-player Swap.

In the playoffs, Miami defeated the [[Orlando Magic]] in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where [[Heat\u2013Knicks rivalry|the rivalry]] between the Heat and the [[New York Knicks]] intensified. The Knicks took a 3\u20131 series lead, but following a brawl between [[Charlie Ward]] and [[P. J. Brown]] late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down.

O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004\u201305 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest.
