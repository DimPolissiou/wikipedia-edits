Soon, children who were born with the Gastrea virus and obtained superhuman abilities as a result, are discovered and dubbed \"Cursed Children\". Due to the Gastrea virus' intervention, the Cursed Children could only be female. Civil Securities are formed to specialize fighting against Gastrea, operating with the pair of an Initiator, who are cursed children, and a Promoter, serving to lead the cursed children. Ten years after the epidemic, Rentar\u014d Satomi, a high school student who is also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security Agency owned by his childhood friend Kisara Tend\u014d, along with his Initiator, Enju Aihara, conducts missions to prevent the destruction of the Tokyo Area and the world.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Tend\u014d Civil Security===\n;{{Nihongo|Rentar\u014d Satomi|\u91cc\u898b \u84ee\u592a\u90ce|Satomi Rentar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=\"eng cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-24/chris-patton-luci-christian-star-in-black-bullet-english-dub/.93348|title=Chris Patton, Luci Christian Star in ''Black Bullet'' English Dub|website=Anime News Network|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>}}\n:Rentar\u014d is the protagonist, a second year student in Magata High School and also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security. Rentar\u014d's parents died in the war against Gastrea ten years ago, and was adopted by the Tend\u014d family, but left the family along with Kisara. Rentar\u014d lost his right leg, right arm and left eye in a fight with Gastrea to protect Kisara, and was saved by Doc's \"New Human Creation Plan\" which replaced his lost limbs with Varanium. Due to his kind and sincere nature Rentaro is one of the few sympathizers of the cursed children. He usually goes to extreme lengths to help them. This trait also leads many cursed children to either take an interest in him or become infatuated with him. He uses an [[HS2000|XD]] and is a beginner in Tend\u014d style martial arts in the beginning of the story.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enju Aihara|\u85cd\u539f \u5ef6\u73e0|Aihara Enju}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Luci Christian]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Enju is a Cursed Child, and is Rentar\u014d's Model Rabbit Initiator in Tend\u014d Civil Security. She lives with Rentar\u014d and goes to  primary school normally until her status as a Cursed Child was revealed during the incident involving Kagetane Hiruko, and was forced to transfer to a new school. When first introduced to Rentar\u014d by the International Initiator Supervising Organization (IISO), Enju had severe trust problems, but this has since improved through getting along with Rentar\u014d and eventually becoming infatuated with him despite her young age. She is a fan of the ''Tenchuu Girls'' anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kisara Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u6728\u66f4|Tend\u014d Kisara}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Christina Kelly]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kisara is the president of Tend\u014d Civil Security. Originally from the Tend\u014d clan, she left the family after a certain conflict along with her childhood friend Rentar\u014d. Kisara's kidneys are barely functioning due to the trauma of witnessing her parents being eaten alive by Gastrea. Believing that her parents' deaths were connected to the Tend\u014d family, she swore to avenge them and has been searching for the murderers. She is extremely skilled at the Tend\u014d style of martial arts, but is unable to fight for extended periods of time due to her condition. Kisara has feelings for Rentar\u014d, who has shown the attraction to be mutual, but their attempts to communicate their feelings towards one another are usually interrupted, most of the time by Enju. However, her obsession with exacting revenge on the Tend\u014d clan is a source of concern for Rentar\u014d, who fears it may one day lead to them parting ways.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tina Sprout|\u30c6\u30a3\u30ca\u30fb\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a6\u30c8|Tina Supurauto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoyo Kurosawa]]|[[Caitlynn French]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Tina is a product of Ayn Rand's mechanized soldiers and his Model Owl Initiator. Tina was ordered to assassinate Seitenshi by Ayn but was instead foiled by Enju's interference and eventually defeated by Rentar\u014d. Seitenshi gave her special treatment and only ordered to keep her under observation, and was hired by Tend\u014d Civil Security when she was released. She later on forms a pair with Kisara, while becoming infatuated with Rentar\u014d just like Enju, with whom she competes for his attention.\n\n===Tokyo Area===\n;{{Nihongo|Seitenshi|\u8056\u5929\u5b50|Seitenshi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]|[[Carli Mosier]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Real name unknown, Seitenshi is the ruler of Tokyo Area, one of the five largest areas in Japan after the war.

She has an IQ of 210 but is unsuited to front-line battles. During her mission to eliminate the Hiruko pair, she was separated from Sh\u014dgen and met Rentar\u014d. As she protected the area from Gastrea led by the Hiruko pair's battle, the amount of Gastrea virus in her body exceeded the critical value, thus she requested Rentar\u014d to shoot her while she was still human.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Takuto Yasuwaki|\u4fdd\u8107 \u5353\u4eba|Yasuwaki Takuto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Subaru Kimura]]|Scott Gibbs}}\n:Seitenshi's personal guard who is conceited and unhappy about Rentar\u014d being hired as part of Seitenshi's protection squad from Tina's assassination attempts.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kazumitsu Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u548c\u5149|Tend\u014d Kazumitsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]]|Houston Hayes<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kazumitsu is one of Kisara's four brothers who conspired against their parents, leading to their deaths.

Soon, children who were born with the Gastrea virus and obtained superhuman abilities as a result, are discovered and dubbed \"Cursed Children\". Due to the Gastrea virus' intervention, the Cursed Children could only be female. Civil Securities are formed to specialize fighting against Gastrea, operating with the pair of an Initiator, who are cursed children, and a Promoter, serving to lead the cursed children. Ten years after the epidemic, Rentar\u014d Satomi, a high school student who is also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security Agency owned by his childhood friend Kisara Tend\u014d, along with his Initiator, Enju Aihara, conducts missions to prevent the destruction of the Tokyo Area and the world.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Tend\u014d Civil Security===\n;{{Nihongo|Rentar\u014d Satomi|\u91cc\u898b \u84ee\u592a\u90ce|Satomi Rentar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=\"eng cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-24/chris-patton-luci-christian-star-in-black-bullet-english-dub/.93348|title=Chris Patton, Luci Christian Star in ''Black Bullet'' English Dub|website=Anime News Network|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>}}\n:Rentar\u014d is the protagonist, a second year student in Magata High School and also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security. Rentar\u014d's parents died in the war against Gastrea ten years ago, and was adopted by the Tend\u014d family, but left the family along with Kisara. Rentar\u014d lost his right leg, right arm and left eye in a fight with Gastrea to protect Kisara, and was saved by Doc's \"New Human Creation Plan\" which replaced his lost limbs with Varanium. Due to his kind and sincere nature Rentaro is one of the few sympathizers of the cursed children. He usually goes to extreme lengths to help them. This trait also leads many cursed children to either take an interest in him or become infatuated with him. He uses an [[HS2000|XD]] and is a beginner in Tend\u014d style martial arts in the beginning of the story.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enju Aihara|\u85cd\u539f \u5ef6\u73e0|Aihara Enju}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Luci Christian]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Enju is a Cursed Child, and is Rentar\u014d's Model Rabbit Initiator in Tend\u014d Civil Security. She lives with Rentar\u014d and goes to  primary school normally until her status as a Cursed Child was revealed during the incident involving Kagetane Hiruko, and was forced to transfer to a new school. When first introduced to Rentar\u014d by the International Initiator Supervising Organization (IISO), Enju had severe trust problems, but this has since improved through getting along with Rentar\u014d and eventually becoming infatuated with him despite her young age. She is a fan of the ''Tenchuu Girls'' anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kisara Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u6728\u66f4|Tend\u014d Kisara}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Christina Kelly]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kisara is the president of Tend\u014d Civil Security. Originally from the Tend\u014d clan, she left the family after a certain conflict along with her childhood friend Rentar\u014d. Kisara's kidneys are barely functioning due to the trauma of witnessing her parents being eaten alive by Gastrea. Believing that her parents' deaths were connected to the Tend\u014d family, she swore to avenge them and has been searching for the murderers. She is extremely skilled at the Tend\u014d style of martial arts, but is unable to fight for extended periods of time due to her condition. Kisara has feelings for Rentar\u014d, who has shown the attraction to be mutual, but their attempts to communicate their feelings towards one another are usually interrupted, most of the time by Enju. However, her obsession with exacting revenge on the Tend\u014d clan is a source of concern for Rentar\u014d, who fears it may one day lead to them parting ways.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tina Sprout|\u30c6\u30a3\u30ca\u30fb\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a6\u30c8|Tina Supurauto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoyo Kurosawa]]|[[Caitlynn French]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Tina is a product of Ayn Rand's mechanized soldiers and his Model Owl Initiator.

She has an IQ of 210 but is unsuited to front-line battles. During her mission to eliminate the Hiruko pair, she was separated from Sh\u014dgen and met Rentar\u014d. As she protected the area from Gastrea led by the Hiruko pair's battle, the amount of Gastrea virus in her body exceeded the critical value, thus she requested Rentar\u014d to shoot her while she was still human.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Takuto Yasuwaki|\u4fdd\u8107 \u5353\u4eba|Yasuwaki Takuto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Subaru Kimura]]|Scott Gibbs}}\n:Seitenshi's personal guard who is conceited and unhappy about Rentar\u014d being hired as part of Seitenshi's protection squad from Tina's assassination attempts.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kazumitsu Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u548c\u5149|Tend\u014d Kazumitsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]]|Houston Hayes<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kazumitsu is one of Kisara's four brothers who conspired against their parents, leading to their deaths.

reprehensible, singling out the portrayal of [[#Characters|Enju Aihara]] as otaku bait; Bamboo Dong and Carl Kimlinger similarly praised it for being decently written and leaving enough room for story and character developments, the former saying that it might get better with later episodes while the latter criticized it for being the same as every other anime of its ilk; Rebecca Silverman said that the premise had intrigue with visuals that catch the eyes' attention but it needs to work on its pacing and story developments to reach its potential. The fifth reviewer, Theron Martin, while finding the story schematics generic and filled with otaku trappings was hopeful because of the technical aspects that complement the action scenes and the sense of intrigue throughout, concluding that \"it looks like it could be an entertaining (if not necessarily original) action romp, especially if the kinks get ironed out.\"<ref name=\"BB Ep 1 Review\"/> [[Kotaku]]'s Richard Eisenbeis was negative towards the series, saying it had a good concept but was bogged down by an amalgam of genres that don't go together, follows a formulaic blueprint set by other anime series and is filled with plot holes that require a suspension of disbelief, concluding that, \"In the end, I simply would not recommend ''Black Bullet'' to anyone.

He identified the first clear candidate for a [[black hole]], [[Cygnus X-1]], with his colleague [[Betty Louise Turtle|Louise Webster]].\n\nHe studied Mathematics and Physics at the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Rochester|Rochester]]. In 1962, he took an eight-week summer residential course supporting researchers at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in [[Herstmonceux]] and at the end was offered a post by the [[Astronomer Royal]], [[Richard van der Riet Woolley|Richard Woolley]].  He left to study a PhD at Rochester and returned to the RGO in 1970 as a research fellow.  During his three-year contract there, he wondered what he could contribute to find out about the provenance of powerful cosmic [[X-ray astronomy|x-ray]] sources that had recently been detected, particularly Cygnus X-1.  After he had made unsuccessful searches for light variations and unusual spectra among the hundreds of stars within the area of positional uncertainty of the X-ray source, a radio star was found that was coincident with a star HDE226868.  He decided, with Louise Webster, to investigate whether the star was a [[binary star]], possibly with one of the pair being the X-ray source as well as a radio source, but not being visible. They measured the [[Doppler shift]] to find that HDE226868 was a binary star with an orbit of 5.6 days orbiting an invisible partner, presumably the source of the X-rays, and which they calculated to be certainly more than 2.5 and probably more than six solar masses.  Such a star cannot be a white dwarf or neutron star and they assumed this body to be a black hole. With the Australian Louise Webster, he submitted a paper with \"modest\" language to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', only mentioning the term \u201cblack hole\u201d in the final sentence. Woolley was quite conservative in his views on astronomy, regarding black holes as \"fanciful\" (also famously dismissing worthwhile space exploration as \"utter bilge\"). Astronomer [[Charles Thomas Bolton]] then published a paper with a similar conclusion and more astronomers followed suit. The discovery helped Murdin to secure his future employment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Murdin|first=Paul|title=Full Meridian of Glory: Perilous Adventures in the Competition to Measure the Earth|publisher=Copernicus Books|location=New York|year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Black Hole Apocalypse|network=WGBH Boston/ARTE France|series=Nova|last=DeNooyer|first=Rushmore|date=2018}}</ref>\n\nHe and Webster were amongst the first staff astronomers at the [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] and he continued in his vein of discovery using similar techniques. He returned  to the Royal Greenwich Observatory and worked on developing the UK-Netherlands observatory at [[La Palma]], which became the [[Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes]]. He was its first head of operations until 1987. He was the director of the [[Royal Observatory, Edinburgh]] from 1991-93. Then he joined the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]], planning and developing the UK's space research policy. He was President of the [[European Astronomical Society]] and Treasurer of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] (to which he'd first been elected as a Junior Member at the age of 17 in 1959, moving to Fellow in April 1963), during which time membership increased, its public outreach programme was established and its journal became the most prominent worldwide.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to work hard and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}}\n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel.

Rather, the ''Juntong'' targeted the secret service loyal to the Wang regime.

[[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.\n\nOn 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}} \n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel.

Rather, the ''Juntong'' targeted the secret service loyal to the Wang regime. This was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected first to the ''Juntong'' and then to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=553}}</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese; had powers to arrest without warrant, torture and to kill extrajudicially; kidnapped businessmen for ransom; and were deeply involved in organized crime, charging a \"fee\" to all of the opium dens, brothels and casinos of Shanghai to allow them to operate.<ref name=FJp357/> In September 1939, Wang Tianmu, the chief ''Juntong'' agent in Shanghai was kidnapped on the Nanjing road by No. 76 agents, was taken to 76 Jessfield Road where he was held for three weeks before being released.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=554}}</ref> Wang had not been tortured and Dai suspected that he had been \"turned\"; Dai ordered him assassinated and a ''Juntong'' agent shot him in the shoulder during a failed attempt to kill him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554/>\n\nThe No. 76 organization blew up the headquarters of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai while the ''Juntong'' assassins killed a dozen of No. 76 organization leaders in the fall of 1939.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=555}}</ref> Wang's defection to the No. 76 organization proved a most serious blow as he betrayed all of the agents under his command, and the ''Kempeitai'' arrested dozens of ''Juntong agents'' in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin due to the information provided by Wang.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 15 November 1939, Zhao Gangyi, the ''Juntong'' chief in Qingdao, fearing it was only a matter of time before the ''Kempeitai'' arrested him owing to the information provided by Wang, decided to save himself and defected over to the Wang regime,  betraying all of the agents under his command to the ''Kempeitai''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 24 November 1939, thanks to information provided by Zhao, the ''Kempeitai'' raided the ''Juntong'''s headquarters in Beijing.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nOn 21 December 1939, Ding was almost killed when his mistress [[Zheng Pingru]] a girl born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, led him into a ''Juntong'' assassination attempt.<ref name=WFp194>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic, Jr|title=The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TbpNjDlPSq0C&pg=PR7#v=onepage|accessdate=01-05-2017|date=25 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-52871-9|pages=194|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laydate=}}</ref>  When Ding ordered his men to execute Zheng, then aged 22, she asked them not to shoot her in the face, so she would still be beautiful at her funeral, a request that No. 76 execution squad honored.<ref name=WFp194/> This incident is generally believed to have been the inspiration for the 1979 novella [[Lust, Caution (novella)|''Lust, Caution'']] by [[Eileen Chang]], which in turn inspired the 2007 film ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeitai'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3,000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.{{sfn|Polmar|Allen|1997|p=111}} Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".{{sfn|Polmar|Allen|1997|p=111-112}} The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>{{harvnb|Polmar|Allen|1997|p=112}}</ref> China regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China. China greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.\n\nOn 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau.

His research discovered that in the early 17th century, armed [[bandit]]s would take refuge in the Sierra Morena mountains of Spain and that people feared for their lives when they had to travel through the region. The words of the first verse of \"Cielito Lindo\" were found in a song from that era, hinting at that fear. But with time the meaning of the verse changed as people began romanticizing it. \"Your face is the Sierra Morena. Your eyes are thieves who live there.\" The verse had other melodies put to it and variations on the lyrics. Quirino Mendoza, the composer, adapted the verse to his own melody and gave us the song we know today.\n\n==Versions==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\nThe song has been subject to many versions:\n*A recording dated 26 November 1926 from Mexican Tipica Orchestra, matrix 20384A, Victor<ref>[https://archive.org/details/78_cielito-lindo-beautiful-heaven_mexican-tipica-orchestra_gbia0003122a Cielito Lindo (Beautiful Heaven) : Mexican Tipica Orchestra : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive]</ref>\n*[[Anthony Mann]] 1945 noir thriller [[The Great Flamarion]] starring [[Erich von Stroheim]] , [[Mary Beth Hughes]] , and [[Dan Duryea]] opens with a Mexican vaudeville performance of \"Cielito Lindo\".\n*\"Heavenly Night\" is an English version, with the melody adapted by [[Sebastian Yradier]] and Neil Wilson.

His research discovered that in the early 17th century, armed [[bandit]]s would take refuge in the Sierra Morena mountains of Spain and that people feared for their lives when they had to travel through the region. The words of the first verse of \"Cielito Lindo\" were found in a song from that era, hinting at that fear. But with time the meaning of the verse changed as people began romanticizing it. \"Your face is the Sierra Morena. Your eyes are thieves who live there.\" The verse had other melodies put to it and variations on the lyrics. Quirino Mendoza, the composer, adapted the verse to his own melody and gave us the song we know today.\n\n==Versions==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2019}}\nThe song has been subject to many versions:\n*A recording dated 26 November 1926 from Mexican Tipica Orchestra, matrix 20384A, Victor<ref>[https://archive.org/details/78_cielito-lindo-beautiful-heaven_mexican-tipica-orchestra_gbia0003122a Cielito Lindo (Beautiful Heaven) : Mexican Tipica Orchestra : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive]</ref>\n*[[Anthony Mann]] 1945 noir thriller [[The Great Flamarion]] starring [[Erich von Stroheim]] , [[Mary Beth Hughes]] , and [[Dan Duryea]] opens with a Mexican vaudeville performance of \"Cielito Lindo\".\n*\"Heavenly Night\" is an English version, with the melody adapted by [[Sebastian Yradier]] and Neil Wilson.

The nodal plane of the orbitals, viewed as a ribbon, is a [[M\u00f6bius strip]], rather than a cylinder, hence the name. The pattern of orbital energies is given by a rotated [[M\u00f6bius\u2013H\u00fcckel concept|Frost circle]] (with the edge of the polygon on the bottom instead of a vertex), so systems with 4''n'' electrons are aromatic, while those with  4''n'' + 2 electrons are anti-aromatic/non-aromatic.  Due to incrementally twisted nature of the orbitals of a M\u00f6bius aromatic system, stable M\u00f6bius aromatic molecules need to contain at least 8 electrons, although 4 electron M\u00f6bius aromatic transition states are well known in the context of the Dewar-Zimmerman framework for [[pericyclic reaction]]s.

Despite having 16 electrons in its pi system (making it a 4n [[antiaromatic]] compound) the [[M\u00f6bius\u2013H\u00fcckel concept|Heilbronner prediction]] was borne out because according to Herges the M\u00f6bius compound was found to have aromatic properties.  With [[bond length]]s deduced from [[X-ray crystallography]] a [[Harmonic Oscillator Model of Aromaticity|HOMA]] value was obtained of 0.50 (for the [[polyene]] part alone) and 0.35 for the whole compound which qualifies it as a moderate aromat.\n\nIt was pointed out by [[Henry Rzepa]] that the conversion of intermediate '''5''' to '''6''' can proceed by either a H\u00fcckel or a M\u00f6bius [[transition state]].<ref>''The Aromaticity of Pericyclic Reaction Transition States'' Henry S.

For this reason resonance integral <math>\\beta^\\prime</math> is given by\n:<math>\\beta^\\prime=\\beta\\cos(\\pi/N)</math>,\nwhere <math>\\beta</math> is the standard H\u00fcckel resonance integral value (with completely parallel orbitals).\nNevertheless, after going all the way around, the ''N''th and 1st orbitals are almost completely out of phase. (If the twisting were to continue after the <math>N</math>th orbital, the <math>(N+1)</math>st orbital would be exactly phase-inverted compared to the 1st orbital).  For this reason, in the H\u00fcckel matrix the resonance integral between carbon <math>1</math> and <math>N</math> is <math>-\\beta^\\prime</math>.<br />\nFor the generic <math>N</math> carbon M\u00f6bius system, the Hamiltonian matrix <math>\\mathbf{H}</math> is:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{H}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n \\alpha& \\beta' & 0 &\\cdots& -\\beta' \\\\\n \\beta' & \\alpha& \\beta' & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n 0 & \\beta' & \\alpha & \\cdots & 0 \\\\\n \\vdots &\\vdots &\\vdots &\\ddots &\\vdots \\\\\n -\\beta' &0& 0 & \\cdots & \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>.\nEigenvalues for this matrix can now be found, which correspond to the energy levels of the M\u00f6bius system.

The nodal plane of the orbitals, viewed as a ribbon, is a [[M\u00f6bius strip]], rather than a cylinder, hence the name. The pattern of orbital energies is given by a rotated [[M\u00f6bius\u2013H\u00fcckel concept|Frost circle]] (with the edge of the polygon on the bottom instead of a vertex), so systems with 4''n'' electrons are aromatic, while those with  4''n'' + 2 electrons are anti-aromatic/non-aromatic.

The classification of a pericyclic transition state as either M\u00f6bius or H\u00fcckel topology determines whether 4''N'' or 4''N'' + 2 electrons are required to make the transition state aromatic or antiaromatic, and therefore, allowed or forbidden, respectively. Based on the energy level diagrams derived from [[H\u00fcckel method|H\u00fcckel MO theory]], (4''N'' + 2)-electron H\u00fcckel and (4''N'')-electron M\u00f6bius transition states are aromatic and allowed, while (4''N'' + 2)-electron M\u00f6bius and (4''N'')-electron H\u00fcckel transition states are antiaromatic and forbidden.

(If the twisting were to continue after the <math>N</math>th orbital, the <math>(N+1)</math>st orbital would be exactly phase-inverted compared to the 1st orbital).
