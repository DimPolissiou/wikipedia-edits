It was known as '''Ping Chau''' ({{zh|c=\u5e73\u6d32}}). ''Tung'' ({{zh|c=\u6771}}, meaning ''east'') is prepended to the name so as to avoid possible confusion with ''[[Peng Chau]]'', another island in Hong Kong with an identically pronounced name in the [[Cantonese language]]. Administratively, the island is part of the [[Tai Po District]] in the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Ping Chau is an offshore island located in the northeast corner of Hong Kong in [[Mirs Bay]],<ref name=\"Marine Park\"/> close to the border with [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[mainland China]]. The island has an area of 1.16&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref>Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department: [http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf Hong Kong geographic data sheet]</ref> and consists of [[shale]] rock. The island is the most easterly point of the Hong Kong territory and is much closer to mainland China (4&nbsp;km) than to the main landmass of Hong Kong. It is close to [[Nan'ao Subdistrict|Nan'ao]] of [[Dapeng Peninsula|Dapeng]].\n\nThe island has the shape of a [[kidney bean]] with its concave side facing northeast. Its name \"Ping Chau\" means \"flat island\" in Chinese.<ref name=\"Plover Cove (Ext.)\"/> The highest points on the island are {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the south and {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the north. The eastern inner shore of the crescent hugs Ping Chau Hoi (\u5e73\u6d32\u6d77) with [[Beaches of Hong Kong|a few beaches]], including Cheung Sha Wan (\u9577\u6c99\u7063) in the northeast. In contrast, the western coast of the island is fairly rocky as a result of the greater wave action taking its toll on the inclined [[siltstone]] there.\n\nThe island's largest village, Sha Tau (\u6c99\u982d), is something of a ghost town, with many cottages boarded up.

It was known as '''Ping Chau''' ({{zh|c=\u5e73\u6d32}}). ''Tung'' ({{zh|c=\u6771}}, meaning ''east'') is prepended to the name so as to avoid possible confusion with ''[[Peng Chau]]'', another island in Hong Kong with an identically pronounced name in the [[Cantonese language]]. Administratively, the island is part of the [[Tai Po District]] in the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Ping Chau is an offshore island located in the northeast corner of Hong Kong in [[Mirs Bay]],<ref name=\"Marine Park\"/> close to the border with [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[mainland China]]. The island has an area of 1.16&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref>Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department: [http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf Hong Kong geographic data sheet]</ref> and consists of [[shale]] rock. The island is the most easterly point of the Hong Kong territory and is much closer to mainland China (4&nbsp;km) than to the main landmass of Hong Kong. It is close to [[Nan'ao Subdistrict|Nan'ao]] of [[Dapeng Peninsula|Dapeng]].\n\nThe island has the shape of a [[kidney bean]] with its concave side facing northeast. Its name \"Ping Chau\" means \"flat island\" in Chinese.<ref name=\"Plover Cove (Ext.)\"/> The highest points on the island are {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the south and {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the north. The eastern inner shore of the crescent hugs Ping Chau Hoi (\u5e73\u6d32\u6d77) with [[Beaches of Hong Kong|a few beaches]], including Cheung Sha Wan (\u9577\u6c99\u7063) in the northeast. In contrast, the western coast of the island is fairly rocky as a result of the greater wave action taking its toll on the inclined [[siltstone]] there.\n\nThe island's largest village, Sha Tau (\u6c99\u982d), is something of a ghost town, with many cottages boarded up. A large part of the island is country parkland,<ref name=\"showing\"/> with footpaths overgrown with orchids, wild mint, and [[morning glory|morning glories]].<ref name=\"island_hopping\"/>\n\n==History==\nPing Chau has a checkered history.

In 2013, Maastricht University was the second Dutch university to be rewarded the \u2018Distinctive Quality Feature for Internationalisation\u2019 by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tans, J.G.H. - SFA002019729.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Sjeng Tans, founder of UM]]\n[[File:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 poort 20100513.jpg|thumb|Gate of former Jesuit monastery. Lectures started here in 1974]]\nMaastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the [[Mining in Limburg|Limburg coal mining industry]].<ref name=\"zicht1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zichtopmaastricht.nl/tekst/onderwerpen/universiteit|title=Universiteit|publisher=Zicht op Maastricht|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of [[Problem Based Learning|problem-based learning]]. About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the [[States General of the Netherlands|Dutch Parliament]] eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.<ref>''Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'' (\"State Journal of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\"), 1975, p.717.</ref> The new university, named ''Rijksuniversiteit Limburg'' (State University of Limburg), was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] signed the university's founding charter at a ceremony in the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]]. Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.\n\nSoon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The Faculty of Law was created in 1981, followed by the Faculty of Economics in 1984. In 1994, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and one year later the Faculty of Psychology were established. The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the Department of Knowledge Engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance.  Together with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.<ref>Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004 310 9}}</ref>\n\nThe university was renamed ''Universiteit Maastricht'' in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.\n\n=== 2019 cyber attack ===\nOn December 23rd, Maastricht University suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a ransomware attack. The ransomware encrypted all major software used by Maastricht University, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the Christmas break. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A ransom was set from the offenders, which, if paid on time, would allow a decryption of the University systems. The lessons resumed with no delays on the 6th of January, with most online services again available to both students and staff members. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Campuses==\nMaastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.\n\n===City Centre Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht-Universiteitsbibliotheek aan de Grote Looiersstraat.jpg|thumb|Former poorhouse at Grote Looiersstraat, part of the inner city library]]\n[[File:Maastricht, Universiteitsbibliotheek Binnenstad2.jpg|thumb|University library, south entrance at Nieuwenhofstraat]]\n\nThe university's arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht's city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university's inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht's historic city centre.<ref name=\"Beijer, Hans 2006\">Beijer, Hans et al. (2006). ''MonUMent'', published to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Maastricht University.</ref>\n\n====University buildings in Jekerkwartier====\nThe first building that was obtained by the university was the former [[Jesuit]] monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the Faculty of Medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (''mensa'' in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect [[Jo Coenen]].\n\nThe Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as ''Oud Gouvernement'' in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river [[Meuse]] in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies ''Slijpe Court'', a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.\n\nThe university's administrative headquarters is located at ''Minderbroedersberg'', in a former [[Franciscan]] monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its ''Aula'' (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the ''Bonnefanten'', now the university's Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from [[Li\u00e8ge]] who were referred to as \"''bons enfants''\", \"good children\". In the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, [[Bonnefantenmuseum]]. In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city's [[poor house]] and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city's public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.\n\n[[University College Maastricht]] is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century [[b\u00e9guinage]], named ''Nieuwenhof''. [[Maastricht Science College]] has its new home since 2012 in the renovated ''Hustinx Mansion'' in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented fa\u00e7ade and a courtyard that is now covered.\n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 20100513.jpg|Tongersestraat, School of Economics\nFile:Gouvernement Bouillonstraat Bremer Maastricht.jpg|Bouillonstraat: Faculty of Law\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 26821 - Bouillonstraat 8 20100514.jpg|Bouillonstraat,  Knowledge Engineering\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506711 - Kapoenstraat 2 20100703.jpg|Kapoenstraat, Science Programme\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Maastricht, GroteGracht, Hof van Tilly04.jpg|thumb|Entrance Faculty of Arts at ''Tilly Court'']]\n\n====University buildings elsewhere in the city centre====\nSeveral other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. In Abtstraat, close to Jekerkwartier, UM owns two buildings that are used both by the faculties of law and economics. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon's house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. ''Soiron Mansion'', built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Saint Servatius Church]], the former Ursuline school buildings and ''Tilly Court'', built for the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century. \n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506609 - Gasthuis Calvarienberg - Abtstraat 2a 20100513.jpg|Abtstraat, ''Calvari\u00ebnberg''\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27014 - Grote Gracht 82 20100718.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Soiron Mansion'', Faculty of Arts\nFile:GroteGracht37.jpg|Grote Gracht, Ursuline School, Faculty of Arts\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27017 - Hof van Tilly - Grote Gracht 90-92 20100516.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Tilly Court'', Faculty of Arts\n</gallery>\n\n===Randwyck Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht University - Campus Randwyck.jpg|thumb|Campus Randwyck buildings: Life Sciences]]\nThe Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and  life science activities. Here, plans for the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck.\n\nThe focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, local [[Public housing#Netherlands|housing association]] Servatius started construction of the ambitious campus project 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital. The costly project, designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space. The project was canceled by Servatius because the costs were unrealistic.\n<gallery>\nFile:Exterieur Universiteitsbibliotheek Maastricht, locatie Randwyck.jpg|Faculty of Medicine\nFile:Maastricht, Randwyck, AZM04.jpg|University hospital\nFile:Maastricht, Randwyck, UM building1.jpg|Peter Debyeplein 1\nFile:Interieur Universiteitsbibliotheek Randwyck.JPG|Randwyck library\n</gallery>\n\n===Satellite campuses===\nIn recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of [[Venlo]], the Belgian capital of [[Brussels]] and the city of [[Bangalore, India]].\n\nThe [[Maastricht University, Campus Venlo]] is located in the renovated \"Raad van Arbeid\" building at Nassaustraat, close to the center of [[Venlo]].

The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the Faculty of Health Sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in [[healthcare science]]s, made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master's program in global health is available.\n\nThe two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital (''Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht'' or AZM) which opened in 1991. The AZM has been renamed MUMC+ (Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum Plus).\n\n==== Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience ====\nFounded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: [[cognitive psychology]] and [[biological psychology]]. It is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Faculty|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Faculties/PsychologyAndNeuroscience/Theme/AboutTheFaculty.htm|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2013-07-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023005544/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Faculties/PsychologyAndNeuroscience/Theme/AboutTheFaculty.htm|archivedate=2013-10-23}}</ref> The faculty offers a Dutch and English bachelor's programme in psychology, two English-taught master's programmes and one research master's programme. The one-year master's programme in psychology offers specialisations in [[neuropsychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and [[organisational psychology]]. In conjunction with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and [[psychopathology]]. The selective two-year master programme [[Forensic Psychology]] in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty's unique research infrastructure \u2013 including hypermodern high field MRI scanners \u2013 allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.\n\n[[File:University building.JPG|thumb|School of Business and Economics, Tongersestraat]]\n\n==== School of Business and Economics ====\n\nThe School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984.<ref>Hein Schreuder, Economics in Maastricht had to be intimidatingly different, more international and better, in: Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004310 9}}</ref> It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers.

Ninety students enrolled in the first year. In the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focused on European, comparative and international law. The programme was taught partly in English. A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007. It was the first English-language bachelor's programme in law in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"History\"/> The faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff. It offers four bachelor's ([[LLB|LL.B.]]) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, the Dutch-language ELS and the English-language ELS. In addition, the faculty offers seven master's ([[LLM|LL.M.]]) programmes and three advanced master's programmes, most of which are taught in English.\n\nIn research, the faculty's Graduate School of Law has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maastricht Graduate School of Law - Research & training|url=https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/maastricht-graduate-school-law|publisher=Maastricht University, Faculty of Law|accessdate=2017-12-02}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}} \nThe faculty participates in two national research schools, the School of Human Rights and the Ius Commune Research School, and is home to several research institutes: the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO), the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights, the Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht, the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI), and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI).\n\nThe faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof b\u00e9guinage, currently home to University College Maastricht. With the number of students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location in 1990. This building, the former seat of the provincial government of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices. The building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the former ballroom.\n\n[[File:Maastricht, GroteGracht, HuisSoiron03.jpg|thumb|'Classy' classroom with 18th-century stucco (FASoS, House Soiron)]]\n[[File:Overzicht gevels binnenplaats - Maastricht - 20364778 - RCE(copy).jpg|thumb|''Nieuwenhof'', [[University College Maastricht]]]]\n\n==== Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences ====\nThe Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, also known as FASoS, was founded in 1994.

According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|title=Problem-Based Learning|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121836/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|archivedate=2010-01-13}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}} In 1974, Maastricht's newly established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.\n\nAt the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\"/> A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|title=Tutorial groups|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101702/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|archivedate=2009-09-30}}</ref> A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named 'tutor',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|title=Tutors|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002012944/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|archivedate=2009-10-02}}</ref> plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.\n\nEven though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.observantonline.nl/Artikelen/tabid/69/agentType/View/PropertyID/316/Default.aspx|title=How to survive Maastricht|publisher=Observant|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Rankings and reputation ===\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 201-300<small> (2019)</small> | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|website=ShanghaiRanking|accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 127<small> (2020)</small> | THE_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/maastricht-university|title=Maastricht University|date=September 9, 2019|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 239<small> (2020)</small> | QS_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|title=QS World University Rankings 2020|date=June 5, 2019|website=Top Universities}}</ref>\n| USNWR_W = 196<small> (2020)</small> | USNWR_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?page=20|title=U.S. News Education: Best Global Universities 2020}}</ref>\n| Leiden_W = 243<small> (2019)</small> | Leiden_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2019/list|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019|website=|accessdate=2019-11-21|publisher=}}</ref>\n| QS_Under50 = 23<small> (2020)</small> | QS_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\" />\n| THE_Under50 = 10<small> (2019)</small> | THE_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\" />\n}}\nAccording to ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] 2016'', Maastricht University occupied 88th (127th as of 2020) position in the world rank.  \n[[QS World University Rankings]] 2017/18 ranked Maastricht University as the 200th best university in the world, while ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' (or ''Shanghai Ranking'') counted Maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.\n\nIn the ''[[QS World University Rankings#QS Top 50 under 50|QS Top 50 Under 50]]'', which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, UM reached the 23rd place in 2020.<ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/top-50-under-50-next-50-under-50/qs-top-50-under-50-2020|title=QS Top 50 Under 50 2020 - Top Universities|date=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a similar list published by Times Higher Education (''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings#THE 100 under 50 universities|THE 100 Under 50 universities]] 2019''), Maastricht University was placed at the 10th in the world.<ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-young-universities-world|title=Best young universities in the world 2019 |author=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Financial Times]]'', places the School of Business and Economics at the 60th place in 2016.\n\nThe School of Business and Economics has been awarded the '[[Triple accreditation]]' by the prestigious [[AACSB]], [[EQUIS]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].\n\n=== Research ===\n[[File:Promotie Maastricht.jpg|thumb|Ph.D. conferral at UM]]\nResearch at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World. Examples of issues addressed through UM research are: healthy ageing, climate change, demographic changes, sustainability, the impact of technological developments, population ageing, healthy and affordable food, and the [[European integration]] process. A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.\n\nA noted research platform is Scannexus (formerly known as: Brains Unlimited): a scanning lab at the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants.

Maastricht University was at 88th place in the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|Times Higher Education World Ranking]] in 2016 (127th as of 2020), and 4th among Young Universities (10th in 2020).<ref name=\"timeshighereducation.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/maastricht-university|title=Times Higher Education Ranking for Maastricht University 2020 (and previous years)|last=|first=|date=8 April 2020|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Amongst others, Maastricht University's master's programme in International Business is ranked 25, being in the top 25 of the best business programmes in the world according to the [[Financial Times]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/organisation/rankings-accreditations|title=Rankings & accreditations - About UM - Maastricht University|website=www.maastrichtuniversity.nl}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}}. In 2013, Maastricht University was the second Dutch university to be rewarded the \u2018Distinctive Quality Feature for Internationalisation\u2019 by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tans, J.G.H. - SFA002019729.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Sjeng Tans, founder of UM]]\n[[File:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 poort 20100513.jpg|thumb|Gate of former Jesuit monastery. Lectures started here in 1974]]\nMaastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the [[Mining in Limburg|Limburg coal mining industry]].<ref name=\"zicht1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zichtopmaastricht.nl/tekst/onderwerpen/universiteit|title=Universiteit|publisher=Zicht op Maastricht|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of [[Problem Based Learning|problem-based learning]]. About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the [[States General of the Netherlands|Dutch Parliament]] eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.<ref>''Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'' (\"State Journal of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\"), 1975, p.717.</ref> The new university, named ''Rijksuniversiteit Limburg'' (State University of Limburg), was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] signed the university's founding charter at a ceremony in the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]]. Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.\n\nSoon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The Faculty of Law was created in 1981, followed by the Faculty of Economics in 1984. In 1994, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and one year later the Faculty of Psychology were established. The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the Department of Knowledge Engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance.  Together with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.<ref>Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004 310 9}}</ref>\n\nThe university was renamed ''Universiteit Maastricht'' in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.\n\n=== 2019 cyber attack ===\nOn December 23rd, Maastricht University suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a ransomware attack. The ransomware encrypted all major software used by Maastricht University, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the Christmas break. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A ransom was set from the offenders, which, if paid on time, would allow a decryption of the University systems. The lessons resumed with no delays on the 6th of January, with most online services again available to both students and staff members. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Campuses==\nMaastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.\n\n===City Centre Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht-Universiteitsbibliotheek aan de Grote Looiersstraat.jpg|thumb|Former poorhouse at Grote Looiersstraat, part of the inner city library]]\n[[File:Maastricht, Universiteitsbibliotheek Binnenstad2.jpg|thumb|University library, south entrance at Nieuwenhofstraat]]\n\nThe university's arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht's city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university's inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht's historic city centre.<ref name=\"Beijer, Hans 2006\">Beijer, Hans et al. (2006). ''MonUMent'', published to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Maastricht University.</ref>\n\n====University buildings in Jekerkwartier====\nThe first building that was obtained by the university was the former [[Jesuit]] monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the Faculty of Medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (''mensa'' in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect [[Jo Coenen]].\n\nThe Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as ''Oud Gouvernement'' in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river [[Meuse]] in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies ''Slijpe Court'', a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.\n\nThe university's administrative headquarters is located at ''Minderbroedersberg'', in a former [[Franciscan]] monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its ''Aula'' (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the ''Bonnefanten'', now the university's Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from [[Li\u00e8ge]] who were referred to as \"''bons enfants''\", \"good children\". In the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, [[Bonnefantenmuseum]]. In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city's [[poor house]] and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city's public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.\n\n[[University College Maastricht]] is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century [[b\u00e9guinage]], named ''Nieuwenhof''. [[Maastricht Science College]] has its new home since 2012 in the renovated ''Hustinx Mansion'' in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented fa\u00e7ade and a courtyard that is now covered.\n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 20100513.jpg|Tongersestraat, School of Economics\nFile:Gouvernement Bouillonstraat Bremer Maastricht.jpg|Bouillonstraat: Faculty of Law\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 26821 - Bouillonstraat 8 20100514.jpg|Bouillonstraat,  Knowledge Engineering\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506711 - Kapoenstraat 2 20100703.jpg|Kapoenstraat, Science Programme\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Maastricht, GroteGracht, Hof van Tilly04.jpg|thumb|Entrance Faculty of Arts at ''Tilly Court'']]\n\n====University buildings elsewhere in the city centre====\nSeveral other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. In Abtstraat, close to Jekerkwartier, UM owns two buildings that are used both by the faculties of law and economics. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon's house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. ''Soiron Mansion'', built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Saint Servatius Church]], the former Ursuline school buildings and ''Tilly Court'', built for the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century. \n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506609 - Gasthuis Calvarienberg - Abtstraat 2a 20100513.jpg|Abtstraat, ''Calvari\u00ebnberg''\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27014 - Grote Gracht 82 20100718.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Soiron Mansion'', Faculty of Arts\nFile:GroteGracht37.jpg|Grote Gracht, Ursuline School, Faculty of Arts\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27017 - Hof van Tilly - Grote Gracht 90-92 20100516.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Tilly Court'', Faculty of Arts\n</gallery>\n\n===Randwyck Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht University - Campus Randwyck.jpg|thumb|Campus Randwyck buildings: Life Sciences]]\nThe Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and  life science activities. Here, plans for the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck.\n\nThe focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, local [[Public housing#Netherlands|housing association]] Servatius started construction of the ambitious campus project 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital. The costly project, designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space.

The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the Faculty of Health Sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in [[healthcare science]]s, made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master's program in global health is available.\n\nThe two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital (''Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht'' or AZM) which opened in 1991. The AZM has been renamed MUMC+ (Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum Plus).\n\n==== Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience ====\nFounded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: [[cognitive psychology]] and [[biological psychology]]. It is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Faculty|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Faculties/PsychologyAndNeuroscience/Theme/AboutTheFaculty.htm|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2013-07-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023005544/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Faculties/PsychologyAndNeuroscience/Theme/AboutTheFaculty.htm|archivedate=2013-10-23}}</ref> The faculty offers a Dutch and English bachelor's programme in psychology, two English-taught master's programmes and one research master's programme. The one-year master's programme in psychology offers specialisations in [[neuropsychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and [[organisational psychology]]. In conjunction with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and [[psychopathology]]. The selective two-year master programme [[Forensic Psychology]] in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty's unique research infrastructure \u2013 including hypermodern high field MRI scanners \u2013 allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.\n\n[[File:University building.JPG|thumb|School of Business and Economics, Tongersestraat]]\n\n==== School of Business and Economics ====\n\nThe School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984.<ref>Hein Schreuder, Economics in Maastricht had to be intimidatingly different, more international and better, in: Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004310 9}}</ref> It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers.

Ninety students enrolled in the first year. In the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focused on European, comparative and international law. The programme was taught partly in English. A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007. It was the first English-language bachelor's programme in law in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"History\"/> The faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff. It offers four bachelor's ([[LLB|LL.B.]]) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, the Dutch-language ELS and the English-language ELS. In addition, the faculty offers seven master's ([[LLM|LL.M.]]) programmes and three advanced master's programmes, most of which are taught in English.\n\nIn research, the faculty's Graduate School of Law has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maastricht Graduate School of Law - Research & training|url=https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/maastricht-graduate-school-law|publisher=Maastricht University, Faculty of Law|accessdate=2017-12-02}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}} \nThe faculty participates in two national research schools, the School of Human Rights and the Ius Commune Research School, and is home to several research institutes: the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO), the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights, the Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht, the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI), and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI).\n\nThe faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof b\u00e9guinage, currently home to University College Maastricht. With the number of students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location in 1990. This building, the former seat of the provincial government of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices. The building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the former ballroom.\n\n[[File:Maastricht, GroteGracht, HuisSoiron03.jpg|thumb|'Classy' classroom with 18th-century stucco (FASoS, House Soiron)]]\n[[File:Overzicht gevels binnenplaats - Maastricht - 20364778 - RCE(copy).jpg|thumb|''Nieuwenhof'', [[University College Maastricht]]]]\n\n==== Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences ====\nThe Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, also known as FASoS, was founded in 1994.

According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|title=Problem-Based Learning|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121836/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|archivedate=2010-01-13}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}} In 1974, Maastricht's newly established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.\n\nAt the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\"/> A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|title=Tutorial groups|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101702/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|archivedate=2009-09-30}}</ref> A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named 'tutor',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|title=Tutors|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002012944/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|archivedate=2009-10-02}}</ref> plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.\n\nEven though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.observantonline.nl/Artikelen/tabid/69/agentType/View/PropertyID/316/Default.aspx|title=How to survive Maastricht|publisher=Observant|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Rankings and reputation ===\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 201-300<small> (2019)</small> | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|website=ShanghaiRanking|accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 127<small> (2020)</small> | THE_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/maastricht-university|title=Maastricht University|date=September 9, 2019|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 239<small> (2020)</small> | QS_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|title=QS World University Rankings 2020|date=June 5, 2019|website=Top Universities}}</ref>\n| USNWR_W = 196<small> (2020)</small> | USNWR_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?page=20|title=U.S. News Education: Best Global Universities 2020}}</ref>\n| Leiden_W = 243<small> (2019)</small> | Leiden_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2019/list|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019|website=|accessdate=2019-11-21|publisher=}}</ref>\n| QS_Under50 = 23<small> (2020)</small> | QS_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\" />\n| THE_Under50 = 10<small> (2019)</small> | THE_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\" />\n}}\nAccording to ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] 2018'', Maastricht University occupied 103th position in the world rank.  \n[[QS World University Rankings]] 2017/18 ranked Maastricht University as the 200th best university in the world, while ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' (or ''Shanghai Ranking'') counted Maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.\n\nIn the ''[[QS World University Rankings#QS Top 50 under 50|QS Top 50 Under 50]]'', which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, UM reached the 23rd place in 2020.<ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/top-50-under-50-next-50-under-50/qs-top-50-under-50-2020|title=QS Top 50 Under 50 2020 - Top Universities|date=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a similar list published by Times Higher Education (''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings#THE 100 under 50 universities|THE 100 Under 50 universities]] 2019''), Maastricht University was placed at the 10th in the world.<ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-young-universities-world|title=Best young universities in the world 2019 |author=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Financial Times]]'', places the School of Business and Economics at the 60th place in 2016.\n\nThe School of Business and Economics has been awarded the '[[Triple accreditation]]' by the prestigious [[AACSB]], [[EQUIS]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].\n\n=== Research ===\n[[File:Promotie Maastricht.jpg|thumb|Ph.D. conferral at UM]]\nResearch at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World.

A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.\n\nA noted research platform is Scannexus (formerly known as: Brains Unlimited): a scanning lab at the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. The internationally renowned Tissue Regeneration group of Professor Clemens van Blitterswijk moved to Maastricht University in February 2014. His presence fits in the large investment programme ''Kennis-As Limburg'', that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy. So does the Institute of Nanoscopy, led by Professor Peter Peters.\n\nIn 2011 the number of [[dissertations]] at the University of Maastricht had reached 213; the number of scientific publications 3,567.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/factsAndFigures.htm|title=Facts & figures|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012161159/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/factsAndFigures.htm|archivedate=12 October 2013}}</ref> Most [[PhD]] programmes take place in faculty research units (so-called [[graduate schools]]) or associated institutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/ResearchUM.htm|title=Research at UM|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012222918/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/ResearchUM.htm|archivedate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Research and graduate schools ====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}\n* Research and graduate schools affiliated to the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences:\n** Netherlands School of Primary Care (CaRe)\n** School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), linked to CaRe and WTMC\n** School for Cardiovascular Diseases (CARIM)\n** School for Oncology and Developmental Biology (GROW)\n** School of Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism (NUTRIM)\n** School of Health Professions Education (SHE), linked to ICO\n* Research and graduate schools of the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience:\n** Graduate School Psychology and Neuroscience (GSPN), linked to EPOS, EPP, EURON, Psychology and Health, and M-Bic\n** European Graduate School of Neuroscience (EURON)\n** School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), linked to EURON\n[[File:2016 Maastricht, Boschstraat, UNU-MERIT.jpg|thumb|[[UNU-MERIT]] at Boschstraat]]\n[[File:Maastricht, Randwyck, BrainsUnlimited2.jpg|thumb|Scannexus, part of Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus in Randwyck]]\n\n* Research and graduate schools of the School of Business and Economics:\n** Graduate School of Business and Economics (GSBE)\n** International Centre for Integrated assessment and Sustainable development (ICIS)\n** METEOR, Maastricht Research School of Economics of Technology and Organization, an umbrella for research schools affiliated with the UM School of Business and Economics:\n*** KAANS, monitoring school careers of youngsters in Limburg\n*** Limburg Institute of Financial Economics (LIFE)\n*** Maastricht Academic Centre for Research in Services (MAXX)\n*** Maastricht Accounting and Audit Research Centre (MARC)\n*** Network Social Innovation (NSI)\n*** Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market (ROA)\n* Graduate schools of the Faculty of Law:\n** Maastricht Graduate School of Law (MGSL)\n** Ius Commune\n** School of Human Rights Research\n* Graduate schools of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences:\n** Graduate School of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASOS), linked to WTMC, NIG, Huizinga Institute, OSL, Posthumus Institute, NICA, CERES, NOG, RMeS, and OPG\n* Graduate schools of the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences:\n** Maastricht University graduate School of susTainability science (MUST), linked to SENSE\n** Maastricht Graduate School of Governance (MGSoG)\n\n==== Independent research institutes ====\n* Maastricht Centre for Human Rights\n* Maastricht European Institute for Transnational Law Research (METRO), publishes the ''Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law''\n* Montesquieu Institute, Centre for European Parliamentary History and Constitutional Development (in [[The Hague]] and Maastricht)\n* [[UNU-MERIT]], Maastricht Economic and social Research and training centre on Innovation and Technology, part of [[United Nations University]]\n\n==== Knowledge transfer, entrepreneurship ====\nAs elsewhere, ongoing research at Maastricht University is translated into practice, leading to new products to be launched on the market. UM cooperates with businesses and socially relevant organisations through various programmes and institutes, like the Maastricht Centre for Entrepreneurship, Service Science Factory, BioMedbooster, BioPartner Center Maastricht, Contract Research Centre and SME Portal Maastricht University. UM Holding is the corporate venture firm of UM spin-off companies and participations.\n\nBrainport 2020 is the name of a programme that aims at campus development in four locations in the province of Limburg, in cooperation with the local government, business sector and knowledge institutions in the region:\n* Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus in Maastricht-Randwyck, specialising in health and wellbeing\n* Chemelot Campus in [[Sittard-Geleen]], focusing on chemistry and materials\n* Smart Services Hub in [[Heerlen]], focusing on finance, administration and informational services\n* Greenport Campus in [[Venlo]], focusing on food and horticulture, with links to logistics and manufacturing\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:2018 Maastricht, Zuid-Willemsvaart 13.jpg|thumb|Rowing with MSRV Saurus in [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]]]]\nIn 2013, nearly 16,000 students studied at Maastricht University, 47% of whom were foreign.  Students in Maastricht can affiliate with a number of student associations, international associations or debating societies. They present themselves during the annual INKOM, the general introduction week for new Maastricht students. Furthermore, Maastricht offers several cultural and sports activities in and around the city.\n\n[[File:GroteGracht42-54.jpg|thumb|left|Student housing, Grote Gracht]]\n\n===Student housing===\nLike most other Dutch universities, UM itself does not provide regular student housing. However, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students. About 2,700 rooms and apartments offered through the Maastricht student housing foundation are provided by local housing associations Woonpunt, Servatius and Maasvallei. Some 8,000 other accommodations are provided by private landlords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kamerburo.net/content/about.asp?lang=uk&task=over|title=About the Kamerburo|publisher=Kamerburo Maastricht|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Most units are located in houses or small apartment complexes across the historic city centre or in its immediate surrounding neighbourhoods. Many foreign exchange students live at the UM Guesthouse in Annadal, which provides short-term housing.\n\n===Student Service Centre===\nUM's Student Service Centre is located in the former Bonnefanten monastery and offers financial, legal and other forms of advise to students. Part of the Student Service Centre is the ''Studium Generale'' cultural programma, offering lectures on a broad range of topics and other cultural activities to members of the university community and the general public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sg.unimaas.nl/info.asp?lang=en|title=General Information|publisher=Studium Generale, Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-01-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923065536/http://www.sg.unimaas.nl/info.asp?lang=en|archivedate=2008-09-23}}</ref>\n\n===Observant and BreakingMaas===\nThe university's independent newspaper, ''Observant'', is published on a weekly basis and distributed throughout the university.

It is the [[county town]] of Devon, and home to [[Devon County Council]] and the [[University of Exeter]].\n\nIn [[Roman Britain]], Exeter was established as the base of [[Legio II Augusta]] under the personal command of [[Vespasian]].

In the late 19th century, Exeter became an affluent centre for the [[wool trade]], although by the [[First World War]] the city was in decline. After the [[Second World War]], much of the city centre was rebuilt and is now a centre for business and tourism in Devon and Cornwall.\n\nThe administrative area of Exeter has the status of a [[non-metropolitan district]] under the administration of the County Council; a plan to grant the city [[unitary authority]] status was scrapped by the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|2010 coalition government]].\n\n==Name==\nThe modern name of Exeter is a development of the [[Old English]] ''Escanceaster'',<ref name=tcodoepn>{{cite book |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names |author=Eilert Ekwall |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |page=171 |isbn=0-19-869103-3}}</ref> from the [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] form of the river now known as the [[River Exe|Exe]] and the Old English [[suffix]] {{nowrap|[[Chester (placename element)|-''ceaster'']]}} (as in [[Dorset#Toponymy|Dorset]] and [[Gloucester#Etymology|Glowcester]]), used to mark important fortresses or fortified towns.

Many historic buildings in the heart of the city were destroyed and others, including the Cathedral, were damaged. On the night of 4 May, the only hope that Exeter had to avoid total destruction was the heavily outnumbered Polish 307 Squadron which had four available aircraft against the forty German Junkers-88 bombers. During the next 75 minutes, the squadron prevented four German bombers releasing their load of bombs on Exeter. The squadron suffered no casualties in the process. \n156 people were killed in the attacks,[51]however a lot more people in Exeter would have been killed, and the effect on the city much greater had it not been for the \u2018Lw\u00f3w Eagle Owls\u2019.\n\nTo demonstrate British-Polish cooperation and the friendship that had formed between 307 Squadron and Exeter, the squadron presented the city with a Polish flag on 15 November 1942 (the first British city to have had that honour) outside Exeter Cathedral.\n\nSince 2012 a Polish flag is raised over the city's Guildhall on 15 November in honour of 307 Squadron, the day is now known as '307 Squadron Day' in Exeter.\nOn 15 November 2017, a plaque in memory of the squadron was unveiled in the St James Chapel of Exeter Cathedral by the Polish Ambassador His Excellency Arkady Rzegocki.\n\nLarge areas of the city centre were rebuilt in the 1950s when little attempt was made to preserve Exeter's heritage. Damaged buildings were generally demolished rather than restored, and the street plan was altered in an attempt to improve traffic circulation. Former landmarks such as St. Lawrence, the College of the Vicars Choral & Bedford circus disappeared. The modern architecture stands in sharp contrast to the red sandstone of buildings that survived the Blitz.<ref name=payne>{{cite book|title=The West Country: A Cultural History|first=John|last=Payne|p=176|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|year=2011|isbn=978-1-908-49350-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Exe Flood Relief Channel - geograph.org.uk - 695255.jpg|thumb|Exe Flood Relief Channel built after the floods of 1960]]\nOn 27 October 1960, following very heavy rain, the Exe overflowed and flooded large areas of Exeter including Exwick, St Thomas and Alphington. The water rose as high as 2 metres above ground level in places and 150 employees of the local firm Beach Bros were trapped for nine hours. 2,500 properties were flooded. Later the same year on 3 December the river levels rose again, flooding 1,200 properties. These floods led to the construction of new [[flood defences]] for Exeter. Work began in 1965, took 12 years to complete and cost \u00a38 million. The defences included three flood relief channels, and were complemented by the construction of two new concrete bridges (built in 1969 and 1972) to replace the old Exe Bridge which had obstructed the flow of the river and made the flooding worse.<ref>{{cite web\n | title        = The Exeter floods of the 1960s\n | url        = http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | work        = Exeter Memories\n | date        = 28 October 2010\n | accessdate        = 15 September 2012\n | archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20121028034133/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | archive-date        = 28 October 2012\n | url-status        = live\n }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[Princesshay]] shopping centre adjoining the [[Cathedral Close, Exeter|Cathedral Close]] and the High Street was redeveloped between 2005 and 2007,<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Doors open at Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |publisher    = BBC Devon\n |date         = 20 September 2007\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217211042/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |archive-date = 17 February 2008\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | title       = Heaven for shoppers as Princesshay gets off to a flying start with huge crowds for opening day\n | url         = http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=142326&command=displayContent&sourceNode=142321&contentPK=18452155&folderPk=79876&pNodeId=142331\n | work   = [[Express & Echo]]\n | date        = 21 September 2007\n | accessdate  = 21 September 2007\n}}</ref> despite some local opposition.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = High Street revamp plans criticised\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 4 March 2003\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20030819112856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |archive-date = 19 August 2003\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref> It incorporates 123 varied residential units.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Key facts about Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |publisher    = Land Securities Group\n |work         = Princesshay.com\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014035943/http://princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |archive-date = 14 October 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nTo enable people with limited mobility to enjoy the city, Exeter Community Transport Association provides manual and powered wheelchairs and scooters (called Shopmobility) for use by anyone suffering from short or long-term mobility impairment to access to the city centre and shopping facilities, events and meetings with friends and company.<ref>{{cite web\n | title       = Shopmobility\n | url       = http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | work       = Exeter Community Transport Association\n | accessdate       = 13 July 2008\n | archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406220728/http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | archive-date       = 6 April 2012\n | url-status       = dead\n }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008 there was an [[22 May 2008 Exeter bombing|attempted terrorist attack]] on the Giraffe cafe in Princesshay, but the bomber was the only one injured.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Nail-bomber given life sentence\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 30 January 2009\n |accessdate   = 15 September 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090217020915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |archive-date = 17 February 2009\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>\n\nA \u00a330 million improvement scheme for the flood defences was approved in March 2015.

Exeter itself is relatively marginal, and since World War II its Member of Parliament has usually been drawn from the governing party, though the Exeter seat is becoming increasingly a Labour stronghold.  The Exeter MP is [[Ben Bradshaw]] and [[Simon Jupp]] represents East Devon. Exeter is part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England European constituency]], which elects 6 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.

Historically, the bridges were a significant bottleneck for holiday traffic heading to southwest England, leading to the construction of the first bypass in the mid-1930s over [[Countess Wear|Countess Wear Bridge]], followed by the M5 in 1977.<ref name=dcc>{{cite web|url=https://www.devonnewscentre.info/the-changing-face-of-bridge-road-in-exeter/|title=The changing face of Bridge Road in Exeter|publisher=Devon County Council|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=15 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012100749/https://www.devonnewscentre.info/the-changing-face-of-bridge-road-in-exeter/|archive-date=12 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> To further address the problem of congestion in the city centre, [[Devon County Council]] has current park and ride services and is considering the introduction of [[congestion charge]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6125042.stm|title=Drivers facing congestion charge|publisher=BBC News|date=7 November 2006|accessdate=13 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216082313/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/devon/6125042.stm|archive-date=16 February 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2019}}\n\nExeter's main operator of local buses is [[Stagecoach South West]], which operates most of the services in the city. [[Dartline]] is a minor operator in the City. Former Cooks Coaches were taken over by [[Stagecoach Devon|Stagecoach]] forming Stagecoach South West. [[Western Greyhound]] was also a main operator connecting Exeter to Cornwall, [[Somerset]] and many different places in [[South West England]] until being taken over by [[First South West|First Devon & Cornwall]], [[Plymouth Citybus]] and [[Stagecoach South West]] in March 2015.\n\nThe High Street, pedestrianised except for bus and bicycle traffic, serves as the main hub for local buses. Country and express services operate from the city's bus station, in Paris Street, which intersects the High Street at its eastern end; some also call at [[Exeter St Davids railway station]] for direct connection to train services.\n\nCountry bus services, mostly operated by Stagecoach, run from Exeter to most places in East and [[North Devon]], but some are very infrequent. Regional express services run to [[Plymouth]], [[Torbay]], [[Bude]], and along the [[Jurassic Coast]] to [[Lyme Regis]]. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates long-distance routes, for example to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and London.\n\n===Railway===\n[[File:2008 at Exeter St Davids - station frontage.jpg|thumb|Exeter St Davids Railway Station]]\n\nExeter is considered to be the main rail hub within the south-west and is linked to most branch lines in Devon, including to [[Riviera Line|Paignton]], [[Avocet Line|Exmouth]], [[Tarka Line|Barnstaple]] and [[Okehampton]] (by a special service). This makes it possible to reach most stations in Devon directly from [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]], although only during the summer months.\n\nExeter is served by three main railway stations. [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]] is served by all services and is a major [[interchange station]] within the [[South West Peninsula]]'s rail network, whilst [[Exeter Central railway station|Exeter Central]] is more convenient for the city centre but served only by local services and the main line route to London Waterloo. In the south-west of the city, [[Exeter St Thomas railway station|Exeter St Thomas]] serves the western side of the city. There are also six suburban stations, [[Topsham railway station|Topsham]], [[St James Park railway station|St James Park]], [[Polsloe Bridge railway station|Polsloe Bridge]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Digby and Sowton railway station|Digby & Sowton]] and [[Newcourt (Exeter) railway station|Newcourt]], served only by local services.\n\nThere are two main line railway routes from Exeter to London, the faster [[Reading to Taunton line|route via Taunton and Reading to London Paddington]] and the slower [[West of England Main Line]] via [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]] and [[Basingstoke]] to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]. Another main line, the [[Cross Country Route]], links Exeter with [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]], [[Derby]], [[Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen]]. [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] and [[CrossCountry]] services continue westwards along the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line]], variously serving [[Torquay]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Cornwall]]. Local branch lines run to [[Paignton]] (see [[Riviera Line]]), [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] (see [[Avocet Line]]) and [[Barnstaple]] (see [[Tarka Line]]). There is also a summer weekend service to [[Okehampton]] for access to [[Dartmoor]].\n\nThe [[Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR|Exeter to Plymouth line of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR)]] used to provide an alternative route via [[Okehampton]] connecting north [[Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]] to Exeter and the rest of the UK railway system until its closure in 1968.

It is also a base for [[Thomson Airways]] with flights to [[Faro Airport|Faro]], [[Mallorca]], [[Lanzarote]] and elsewhere. The airport offers a range of scheduled flights to British and Irish regional airports and [[Charter airline|charter]] flights. Connections to international hubs began with [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]] in 2005 and later a daily service to [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]]. [[Ryanair]] started flights in 2019 to Luqa, Naples and Malaga.\n\n===Canal===\n[[File:Exeter Canal Basin - geograph.org.uk - 238695.jpg|thumb|Exeter Canal Basin]]\nThe [[Exeter Canal]], also known as the Exeter Ship Canal, was first constructed by John Trew in about 1566,<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth R.|last=Clew|title=The Exeter Canal|location=Chichester|publisher=Phillimore|year=1984|isbn=0-85033-544-2}}</ref> representing one of the oldest artificial waterways in Britain. It was cut to bypass the St James' Weir that had been built across the [[River Exe]] at Duckes Marsh to provide a leat to a mill constructed just below the confluence of the Northbrook, in what became the village of Countess Weir. The weir had the effect of preventing water-born trade in the City of Exeter and forced boats to load and unload at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] from where the [[Earl of Devon|Earls of Devon]] were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to and from Exeter.\n\nOriginally 3 feet deep and 16 feet wide (0.9 m by 5 m), the canal ran {{convert|2.0|mi|2|abbr=out}} from the confluence of the Matford Brook, just above Bridge Road in [[Countess Wear|Countess Weir]] to Haven Banks, close to the centre of Exeter. In order to maintain a consistent navigable water level, another weir was constructed by Trew, just below the point the canal joins the river. The canal was later extended south to Topsham Lock {{convert|3.65|mi|2|abbr=out}}, deepened and widened, and later still it was extended to Turf Lock near [[Manor_of_Powderham|Powderham]] {{convert|5.0|mi|2|abbr=out}}. The canal was successful until the middle of the 19th century since when its use gradually declined \u2013 the last commercial use was in 1972. However it is now widely used for leisure purposes, and the city basin is part of a \u00a324&nbsp;million redevelopment scheme.\n\n==Education==\n{{see also|List of schools in Devon}}\n[[File:Laver Building, University of Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 148746.jpg|thumb|upright|Laver Building, University of Exeter]]\nThe [[University of Exeter]] has two campuses in the city, both notable for their attractive parkland.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It is one of the largest employers in the city. The university includes the [[University of Exeter Business School|Business School]], the [[Bill Douglas Cinema Museum]], the [[Henry Wellcome]] building for Biocatalysis, and, as of September 2018, the Exeter Centre for [[Ellen MacArthur Foundation|Circular Economy]].\n\n[[Exeter College, Exeter|Exeter College]] is a [[further education]] college. It previously operated as the sole [[sixth form]] for the entire [[maintained school]] sector in the city. However, in 2014 [[Exeter Mathematics School]] was established, a [[Free school (England)|free school]] sixth form with a specialism in Mathematics.\n\nFor about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a [[maintained school]] system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The changeover back to the more typical structure led to a citywide, [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] funded, rebuilding programme for the high schools and led to the changing of names for some schools.

A tower stands on the northeast side, with the overall design being described as \u201chighly picturesque by Nikolaus Pevsner.\n\nSt Edmund-on-the-Bridge was built on the Exe Bridge ca. 1230\u201340. Two arches of the bridge remain under the undercroft though the church was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1835, using the old materials.\n\nSt Martin's is in the [[Cathedral Close]]; the plan is odd, and there are numerous items of church furniture, though these are not of high aesthetic value. St Mary Arches is a Norman church with aisles. St Mary Steps was originally by the West Gate of the city; the font is Norman, and there is a remarkable early clock. St Michael, Heavitree was built in 1844\u201346 and extended later in the century. [[St Pancras Church, Exeter|St Pancras]] is of the 13th century and has a nave and chancel only; the font is Norman. The plan of [[St Petrocks Church, Exeter|St Petroc's]] church is highly unusual: a second chancel has been added facing north while the original chancel has another use and faces east. There are two aisles on the south, one of 1413 and another of the 16th century.\n\nSt Sidwell's church is by W. Burgess, 1812, in the Perpendicular style.

Currently, the theatre is a charity and is used as a venue for amateur and professional theatrical companies.\n\nThe Cygnet Theatre in Friars Walk is the home of the [[Cygnet Training Theatre]] and is a member of the [[Conference of Drama Schools]]. As well as performances given by students in training, this theatre also stages performances from visiting repertory companies and has a good reputation for quality events.\n\nThe Bike Shed Theatre and Cocktail Bar opened in September 2010 before permanently closing in March 2018. The Theatre was forced to close after failing to generate enough profit from the cocktail bar in order to operate the theatre. Fundamentally, the theatre offered intimate live music and performances and operated from basement premises in Fore Street.\n\nAdditionally, more innovative and contemporary performances, theatrical productions and dance pieces are programmed by Exeter Phoenix in Exeter City Centre and The Exeter Corn Exchange in Market Street.\n\n===Music===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nThere are two festivals each year, of all the arts but with a particular concentration of musical events: the annual \"Vibraphonic\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibraphonic2011.co.uk/|title=Vibraphonic 2011 website|work=Vibraphonic 2011 Festival website|access-date=5 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929144320/http://www.vibraphonic2011.co.uk/|archive-date=29 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> festival, held in March provides a fortnight of soul, blues, jazz, funk, reggae and electronic music.\n\nThe largest orchestra based in Exeter is the EMG Symphony Orchestra<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emgsymphonyorchestra.org|title=EMG Symphony Orchestra website|accessdate=19 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509124758/http://www.emgsymphonyorchestra.org/|archive-date=9 May 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> which frequently presents concerts at the University of Exeter and at Exeter Cathedral.\n\n[[Chris Martin]], who is lead singer of internationally famous band [[Coldplay]], grew up in Countess Wear in the south east of the city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Meritt |first1=Anita |title=Chris Martin and Exeter - why Coldplay dropped album exclusive in city paper |url=https://www.devonlive.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/chris-martin-exeter-coldplay-dropped-3461066 |website=Devon Live |accessdate=29 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029030243/https://www.devonlive.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/chris-martin-exeter-coldplay-dropped-3461066 |archive-date=29 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Museums and Galleries===\n* The [[Royal Albert Memorial Museum]] in Queen Street is Exeter's predominant museum. The museum maintains its own collections of regional, national and international importance. Recently, the museum underwent an extensive refurbishment.

In the evenings, BBC Radio Devon joins the South West Regional service. [[Heart South West]], formerly [[Gemini FM]] and [[Devonair]], broadcasts on 97.0 FM, with [[East Devon]] and [[Torbay]] utilising their own frequencies. Both Heart South West and BBC Devon broadcast from the St. Thomas transmitter. AM radio is broadcast from Pearce's Hill located at J31 of the M5.\n\nOther radio stations include [[Exeter FM]], an easy listening station broadcasting on 107.3 FM, Phonic.FM which provides a \"no adverts no playlist\" alternative on 106.8 FM or online at www.phonic.fm, VI, a station broadcasting from the West of England School and College on 1386 AM/MW.\n\nAdditionally, Exeter University has a well established student station, [[Xpression FM]], which broadcasts on 87.7 FM using two low-powered transmitters, although it can be heard over much of the north of the city.\n\nThe local [[commercial radio]] station is [[107.3 Radio Exe|Radio Exe]]. The local [[community radio]] station is [[Phonic FM]].\n\n===Television===\nBoth [[BBC Spotlight]] and [[ITV West Country]] provide Exeter with regional news outputs. BBC Spotlight is broadcast from Plymouth and ITV Westcountry is broadcast from Bristol. Although, both services do have newsrooms in Exeter.

[[England]], on the [[River Exe]] {{convert|36|mi|km}} northeast of [[Plymouth]] and {{convert|65|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bristol]]. It is the [[county town]] of Devon, and home to [[Devon County Council]] and the [[University of Exeter]].\n\nIn [[Roman Britain]], Exeter was established as the base of [[Legio II Augusta]] under the personal command of [[Vespasian]]. Exeter became a religious centre in the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Exeter Cathedral]], founded in the mid 11th century, became [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] in the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. In the late 19th century, Exeter became an affluent centre for the [[wool trade]], although by the [[First World War]] the city was in decline. After the [[Second World War]], much of the city centre was rebuilt and is now a centre for business and tourism in Devon and Cornwall.\n\nThe administrative area of Exeter has the status of a [[non-metropolitan district]] under the administration of the County Council; a plan to grant the city [[unitary authority]] status was scrapped by the [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|2010 coalition government]].\n\n==Name==\nThe modern name of Exeter is a development of the [[Old English]] ''Escanceaster'',<ref name=tcodoepn>{{cite book |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names |author=Eilert Ekwall |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1981 |page=171 |isbn=0-19-869103-3}}</ref> from the [[Anglicization of names|anglicised]] form of the river now known as the [[River Exe|Exe]] and the Old English [[suffix]] {{nowrap|[[Chester (placename element)|-''ceaster'']]}} (as in [[Dorset#Toponymy|Dorset]] and [[Gloucester#Etymology|Glowcester]]), used to mark important fortresses or fortified towns.

Many historic buildings in the heart of the city were destroyed and others, including the Cathedral, were damaged. On the night of 4 May, the only hope that Exeter had to avoid total destruction was the heavily outnumbered Polish 307 Squadron which had four available aircraft against the forty German Junkers-88 bombers. During the next 75 minutes, the squadron prevented four German bombers releasing their load of bombs on Exeter. The squadron suffered no casualties in the process. \n156 people were killed in the attacks,[51]however a lot more people in Exeter would have been killed, and the effect on the city much greater had it not been for the \u2018Lw\u00f3w Eagle Owls\u2019.\n\nTo demonstrate British-Polish cooperation and the friendship that had formed between 307 Squadron and Exeter, the squadron presented the city with a Polish flag on 15 November 1942 (the first British city to have had that honour) outside Exeter Cathedral.\n\nSince 2012 a Polish flag is raised over the city's Guildhall on 15 November in honour of 307 Squadron, the day is now known as '307 Squadron Day' in Exeter.\nOn 15 November 2017, a plaque in memory of the squadron was unveiled in the St James Chapel of Exeter Cathedral by the Polish Ambassador His Excellency Arkady Rzegocki.\n\nLarge areas of the city centre were rebuilt in the 1950s when little attempt was made to preserve Exeter's heritage. Damaged buildings were generally demolished rather than restored, and the street plan was altered in an attempt to improve traffic circulation. Former landmarks such as St. Lawrence, the College of the Vicars Choral & Bedford circus disappeared. The modern architecture stands in sharp contrast to the red sandstone of buildings that survived the Blitz.<ref name=payne>{{cite book|title=The West Country: A Cultural History|first=John|last=Payne|p=176|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|year=2011|isbn=978-1-908-49350-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Exe Flood Relief Channel - geograph.org.uk - 695255.jpg|thumb|Exe Flood Relief Channel built after the floods of 1960]]\nOn 27 October 1960, following very heavy rain, the Exe overflowed and flooded large areas of Exeter including Exwick, St Thomas and Alphington. The water rose as high as 2 metres above ground level in places and 150 employees of the local firm Beach Bros were trapped for nine hours. 2,500 properties were flooded. Later the same year on 3 December the river levels rose again, flooding 1,200 properties. These floods led to the construction of new [[flood defences]] for Exeter. Work began in 1965, took 12 years to complete and cost \u00a38 million. The defences included three flood relief channels, and were complemented by the construction of two new concrete bridges (built in 1969 and 1972) to replace the old Exe Bridge which had obstructed the flow of the river and made the flooding worse.<ref>{{cite web\n | title        = The Exeter floods of the 1960s\n | url        = http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | work        = Exeter Memories\n | date        = 28 October 2010\n | accessdate        = 15 September 2012\n | archive-url        = https://web.archive.org/web/20121028034133/http://www.exetermemories.co.uk/em/exeter_floods.php\n | archive-date        = 28 October 2012\n | url-status        = live\n }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[Princesshay]] shopping centre adjoining the [[Cathedral Close, Exeter|Cathedral Close]] and the High Street was redeveloped between 2005 and 2007,<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Doors open at Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |publisher    = BBC Devon\n |date         = 20 September 2007\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080217211042/http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/09/19/princesshay_opening_day_feature.shtml\n |archive-date = 17 February 2008\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n | title       = Heaven for shoppers as Princesshay gets off to a flying start with huge crowds for opening day\n | url         = http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=142326&command=displayContent&sourceNode=142321&contentPK=18452155&folderPk=79876&pNodeId=142331\n | work   = [[Express & Echo]]\n | date        = 21 September 2007\n | accessdate  = 21 September 2007\n}}</ref> despite some local opposition.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = High Street revamp plans criticised\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 4 March 2003\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20030819112856/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2817257.stm\n |archive-date = 19 August 2003\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref> It incorporates 123 varied residential units.<ref>{{cite web\n |title        = Key facts about Princesshay\n |url          = http://www.princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |publisher    = Land Securities Group\n |work         = Princesshay.com\n |accessdate   = 21 September 2007\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071014035943/http://princesshay.com/community/Keyfacts/index.aspx\n |archive-date = 14 October 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nTo enable people with limited mobility to enjoy the city, Exeter Community Transport Association provides manual and powered wheelchairs and scooters (called Shopmobility) for use by anyone suffering from short or long-term mobility impairment to access to the city centre and shopping facilities, events and meetings with friends and company.<ref>{{cite web\n | title       = Shopmobility\n | url       = http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | work       = Exeter Community Transport Association\n | accessdate       = 13 July 2008\n | archive-url       = https://web.archive.org/web/20120406220728/http://www.exetercta.co.uk/shopmobility.asp\n | archive-date       = 6 April 2012\n | url-status       = dead\n }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008 there was an [[22 May 2008 Exeter bombing|attempted terrorist attack]] on the Giraffe cafe in Princesshay, but the bomber was the only one injured.<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Nail-bomber given life sentence\n |url          = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |publisher    = [[BBC News Online]]\n |date         = 30 January 2009\n |accessdate   = 15 September 2012\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090217020915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7859887.stm\n |archive-date = 17 February 2009\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref>\n\nA \u00a330 million improvement scheme for the flood defences was approved in March 2015.

Exeter itself is relatively marginal, and since World War II its Member of Parliament has usually been drawn from the governing party, though the Exeter seat is becoming increasingly a Labour stronghold.  The Exeter MP is [[Ben Bradshaw]] and [[Simon Jupp]] represents East Devon. Exeter is part of the [[South West England (European Parliament constituency)|South West England European constituency]], which elects 6 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s. In 2014, a majority of Exeter voters voted for Labour in the European elections, but in 2019 Labour fell to fourth - the Brexit Party won 28.1% of votes in the city and the Greens won 27.2%.\n\nExeter's [[city council]] is a [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] authority, and shares responsibility for local government with the [[Devon County Council]]. In May 2012 Labour became the majority party on the council. [[Exeter City Council]]'s bid for the city to become a [[Unitary Authority]] was initially approved by ministers in February 2010.

It is at this point that the Exe, having just been joined by the [[River Creedy]], opens onto a wide [[flood plain]] and estuary which results in quite common flooding. Historically this was the [[lowest bridging point]] of the River Exe which was tidal and navigable up to the city until the construction of weirs later in its history. This combined with the easily defensible higher ground of the ridge made the current location of the city a natural choice for settlement and trade. In [[George Oliver (historian)|George Oliver]]'s ''The History of the City of Exeter'', it is noted that the most likely reasons for the original settling of what would become modern Exeter was the \"fertility of the surrounding countryside\" and the area's \"beautiful and commanding elevation [and] its rapid and navigable river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Oliver|first=George|title=History of the City of Exeter|year=1861|page=1|isbn=0-217-79997-3}}</ref>\nIts woodland would also have been ideal for natural resources and hunting.\n\nExeter sits predominantly on sandstone and conglomerate geology, although the structure of the surrounding areas is varied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|title=Southwest EDRP Geographical Area and Physical Context|last=DEFRA|accessdate=13 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113123623/http://www.defra.gov.uk/erdp/docs/swchapter/section11/topography.htm|archive-date=13 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe topography of the ridge which forms the backbone of the city includes a [[volcanic plug]], on which the [[Rougemont Castle]] is situated.

Temperatures do not vary much throughout the year. The hottest month is July with an average high of {{convert|21.7|C|F|}}, and the coldest month is January with an average high of {{convert|8.8|C|F|}}.

[[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter St Davids]] is served by all services and is a major [[interchange station]] within the [[South West Peninsula]]'s rail network, whilst [[Exeter Central railway station|Exeter Central]] is more convenient for the city centre but served only by local services and the main line route to London Waterloo. In the south-west of the city, [[Exeter St Thomas railway station|Exeter St Thomas]] serves the western side of the city. There are also six suburban stations, [[Topsham railway station|Topsham]], [[St James Park railway station|St James Park]], [[Polsloe Bridge railway station|Polsloe Bridge]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Digby and Sowton railway station|Digby & Sowton]] and [[Newcourt (Exeter) railway station|Newcourt]], served only by local services.\n\nThere are two main line railway routes from Exeter to London, the faster [[Reading to Taunton line|route via Taunton and Reading to London Paddington]] and the slower [[West of England Main Line]] via [[Salisbury, England|Salisbury]] and [[Basingstoke]] to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]]. Another main line, the [[Cross Country Route]], links Exeter with [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]], [[Derby]], [[Leeds]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen]]. [[Great Western Railway (train operating company)|Great Western Railway]] and [[CrossCountry]] services continue westwards along the [[Exeter to Plymouth Line]], variously serving [[Torquay]], [[Plymouth]] and [[Cornwall]]. Local branch lines run to [[Paignton]] (see [[Riviera Line]]), [[Exmouth, Devon|Exmouth]] (see [[Avocet Line]]) and [[Barnstaple]] (see [[Tarka Line]]). There is also a summer weekend service to [[Okehampton]] for access to [[Dartmoor]].\n\nThe [[Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR|Exeter to Plymouth line of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR)]] used to provide an alternative route via [[Okehampton]] connecting north [[Cornwall]] and [[Plymouth]] to Exeter and the rest of the UK railway system until its closure in 1968.

It was cut to bypass the St James' Weir that had been built across the [[River Exe]] at Duckes Marsh to provide a leat to a mill constructed just below the confluence of the Northbrook, in what became the village of Countess Weir. The weir had the effect of preventing water-born trade in the City of Exeter and forced boats to load and unload at [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]] from where the [[Earl of Devon|Earls of Devon]] were able to exact large tolls to transport goods to and from Exeter.\n\nOriginally 3 feet deep and 16 feet wide (0.9 m by 5 m), the canal ran {{convert|2.0|mi|2|abbr=out}} from the confluence of the Matford Brook, just above Bridge Road in [[Countess Wear|Countess Weir]] to Haven Banks, close to the centre of Exeter. In order to maintain a consistent navigable water level, another weir was constructed by Trew, just below the point the canal joins the river. The canal was later extended south to Topsham Lock {{convert|3.65|mi|2|abbr=out}}, deepened and widened, and later still it was extended to Turf Lock near [[Manor_of_Powderham|Powderham]] {{convert|5.0|mi|2|abbr=out}}. The canal was successful until the middle of the 19th century since when its use gradually declined \u2013 the last commercial use was in 1972. However it is now widely used for leisure purposes, and the city basin is part of a \u00a324&nbsp;million redevelopment scheme.\n\n==Education==\n{{see also|List of schools in Devon}}\n[[File:Laver Building, University of Exeter - geograph.org.uk - 148746.jpg|thumb|upright|Laver Building, University of Exeter]]\nThe [[University of Exeter]] has two campuses in the city, both notable for their attractive parkland.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} It is one of the largest employers in the city.

It previously operated as the sole [[sixth form]] for the entire [[maintained school]] sector in the city. However, in 2014 [[Exeter Mathematics School]] was established, a [[Free school (England)|free school]] sixth form with a specialism in Mathematics.\n\nFor about 30 years the city of Exeter operated a [[maintained school]] system in which the divisions between phases came at different ages from most of the United Kingdom, with first, middle and high rather than infant, junior and secondary schools, so that children transferred between schools at the age of about 8 and 12 rather than 7 and 11.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} From 2005, however, it has adopted the more usual pattern, because of the pressures of the UK [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]]. The changeover back to the more typical structure led to a citywide, [[Private Finance Initiative|PFI]] funded, rebuilding programme for the high schools and led to the changing of names for some schools.

A tower stands on the northeast side, with the overall design being described as \u201chighly picturesque by Nikolaus Pevsner.\n\nSt Edmund-on-the-Bridge was built on the Exe Bridge ca. 1230\u201340. Two arches of the bridge remain under the undercroft though the church was rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1835, using the old materials.\n\nSt Martin's is in the [[Cathedral Close]]; the plan is odd, and there are numerous items of church furniture, though these are not of high aesthetic value. St Mary Arches is a Norman church with aisles. St Mary Steps was originally by the West Gate of the city; the font is Norman, and there is a remarkable early clock. St Michael, Heavitree was built in 1844\u201346 and extended later in the century. [[St Pancras Church, Exeter|St Pancras]] is of the 13th century and has a nave and chancel only; the font is Norman. The plan of [[St Petrocks Church, Exeter|St Petroc's]] church is highly unusual: a second chancel has been added facing north while the original chancel has another use and faces east. There are two aisles on the south, one of 1413 and another of the 16th century.\n\nSt Sidwell's church is by W. Burgess, 1812, in the Perpendicular style.
