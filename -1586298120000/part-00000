The program is currently hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and presented as an adjunct to his weekday radio program, ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\nOriginally a production of [[Watermark Inc.]] (later a division of ABC Radio known as [[ABC Watermark]], now [[Cumulus Media Networks]]), ''AT40'' is now distributed by [[Premiere Networks]] (a division of [[iHeartMedia]]). [[American_Top_40#Syndication|Nearly 430 radio stations in the United States, and several other territories worldwide]] air AT40 making it one of the most listened-to weekly radio programs in the world. It can also be heard on [[iHeartRadio]], [[TuneIn]] and the official AT40 applications on mobile smartphones and tablets as well as on [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]] consoles (via iHeartRadio's console app) and the [[Armed Forces Network]]. [[GEICO]] is the main sponsor for the show.\n\nCo-creator Casey Kasem hosted the original ''AT40'' from its inauguration on July 4, 1970, until August 6, 1988. [[Shadoe Stevens]] took over the program on August 13, 1988, and hosted until January 28, 1995, when the original program came to an end. Three years later, Kasem teamed up with Premiere's predecessor AMFM Radio Networks to relaunch ''AT40''. Kasem, who had spent nine years hosting [[Casey's Top 40|his own countdown]] for Westwood One, returned to hosting his creation on March 28, 1998. Seacrest took over ''AT40'' on January 10, 2004, following Kasem's retirement from the series.\n\nCurrently, ''AT40'' with Seacrest airs in two different formats, with one distributed to [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] (Top 40) stations and the other to [[Hot Adult Contemporary]] stations. However, there is no distinction made between the two shows on air. There are also two classic editions of the original ''AT40'' distributed every weekend, featuring past Kasem-hosted shows from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn its early years, the ''AT40'' used the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to compile the countdown, touting it as \"the only source\". The program subsequently switched to being based on ''[[Radio and Records]]'' airplay data upon its late 1990s return.<ref>Durkee, p. 259.</ref> The current source for the ''AT40'' charts are unpublished mainstream Top 40 and hot adult contemporary charts compiled by [[Mediabase]].\n\nThrough most of the 1980s, the countdown was compiled by Stu Jacobs.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970\u201388: First Casey Kasem era===\n{{quote|text= Here we go with the Top 40 hits of the nation this week on ''American Top 40'', the best-selling and most-played songs from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], from [[Canada]] to [[Mexico]].

The show quickly gained popularity once it was commissioned, and expanded to a four-hour-program on October 7, 1978, to reflect the increasing average length of singles on ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Hot 100 chart. The producing staff expanded to eight people, some of them still in the business: Nikki Wine, Ben Marichal, Scott Paton, Matt Wilson, Merrill Shindler, [[Guy Aoki]], Ronnie Allen and Sandy Stert Benjamin. (Bustany retired from ''AT40'' in 1989; beginning in 1994, he hosted a political talk show on listener-sponsored [[KPFK]].) By the early 1980s, the show could be heard on 520 stations in the United States<ref>Durkee, p. 137.</ref> and at its zenith, the show was broadcast on 1,000-plus stations in some 50 countries.

The second song in the segment would usually be introduced by Kasem with a brief story connected with the song, which could be about its performer, its composer, or a random bit of trivia. Kasem would often lead into the commercial break preceding the segment with a brief preview of the story, sometimes even giving away the song title or artist.\n\nThe top-ranking song on the chart always was introduced with one of these stories, which would be followed with a drum roll and the final reveal. Here is an example from the week of October 8, 1983:\n\n{{quote|A stunning achievement for 33-year-old New York-born [[Jim Steinman]]. Jim started writing songs when he was going to [[Amherst College]] in Massachusetts, and not just your basic rock & roll tunes, but words and music for a full-blown rock musical called ''The Dream Engine''. The college musical was seen by a man who heads up the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], [[Joseph Papp]]. Joseph Papp was so impressed, that he bought the rights to it and commissioned Jim Steinman to write another musical. Jim came up with a show called ''More Than You Deserve''. And it was at auditions for that show, that he met a singer calling himself [[Meat Loaf]]. The two men started working together, and that collaboration resulted in Jim's writing and arranging songs for Meat Loaf, including the big hit \"[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]\". In 1981, Jim Steinman released his own solo album ''[[Bad for Good]]''. It featured the Top 40 hit \"[[Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through]]\". But so far, it looks as though the thing that Jim Steinman does best, is write and produce songs for other artists. And his latest productions are his biggest yet: the number 2 and the number 1 songs this week. Probably a chart first for one individual. We just heard the number 2 song he wrote and produced for [[Air Supply]], \"[[Making Love Out of Nothing at All]]\". Now, here's the other one, the one at the very top. (drum roll) The most popular song in the land for the second consecutive week, is a hit written and produced by Jim Steinman. At number 1, [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\".}}\n\n* '''\"Number\" jingles:''' Occasionally, a song was preceded by a brief audio clip of a group of singers announcing the song's position on the chart (e.g. \"Number 40!\"). This was especially common for the first song played in each hour of the show, but was usually not done for the #1 song (which was usually introduced with a drum roll), or for songs preceded by a story. The \"number\" jingles were updated and re-recorded from time to time, and by the mid-1980s, the show began using two sets of \"number\" jingles: the standard set, to be used with up-tempo songs; and a softer alternate set, usually used with low-key or romantic songs.\n* '''Chart trivia:''' ''AT40'' also featured several letters in each show where a listener wrote to ask a chart trivia question. Sometimes these letters led to an extra song being played, though this became less common as songs increased in length in the 1980s.\n* '''Long Distance Dedication:''' This feature evolved from a spoken-word 45 single that Kasem had recorded in 1964, \"Letter from Elaina\", in which a girl wrote to Kasem about her encounter with The Beatles.<ref>Durkee, p. 90.</ref>\n\nIn a 2007 Valentine's Day special edition of ''American Top 10'', Kasem explained that the LDD feature was intended to be part of the show from the beginning. He knew, however, that it was going to take some time before a listener wrote in with a request and let the process proceed organically. Kasem's patience proved correct, as staffer Matt Wilson found such a letter while checking the show's mail in August 1978. The listener asked Kasem to play the song \"[[Desiree (song)|Desiree]]\" by [[Neil Diamond]], which he dedicated to his girlfriend of the same name who was moving to West Germany to live with her family on an Army base. The request was fulfilled on the weekend of August 26, 1978; when that show was rebroadcast the weekend of August 25\u201326, 2007, Kasem recorded two optional segments (played at the discretion of the station) in which he did phone interviews with the man and his former girlfriend about the LDD. Most shows featured two long distance dedications, usually with one during each half of the show. (Sometimes, a song currently in the countdown was requested as a LDD; in such cases, Kasem would typically read the dedication first, and sometimes not even announce the song's chart status until after the song was played.) This feature endured on ''AT40'' into Shadoe Stevens' run as host of the show, from 1988 to 1995, and also followed Kasem on his [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] shows, first as \"Request and Dedication\", and then back to LDD when he returned to ''AT40'' in 1998. Long Distance Dedications were dropped after Ryan Seacrest became host in 2004, but they continued as part of Kasem's adult contemporary countdowns.\n* '''Top Three recaps:''' Beginning the weekend of February 24\u201325, 1979, a recap of the previous week's top three songs started off each ''AT40'' episode. Originally all three songs would be played before the countdown began in earnest, but when time constraints became an issue, Kasem would simply announce the #3 and #2 songs and play only the #1 song, or just announce all three songs. By mid-1983, abbreviated recaps became the norm.\n* '''#1's on other ''Billboard'' charts:''' Kasem gave a rundown on songs and albums that were #1 on other ''Billboard'' charts, such as country, soul/R&B, and dance/disco. These were typically announced during the Top 10, often before the #1 song on ''AT40''. When Kasem relaunched the show in 1998, he brought this feature back albeit with the chart the show was currently using. However, it was limited to songs and only covered the Mediabase alternative, adult contemporary, and R&B charts.\n* '''Predicting next week's #1 song:''' For a time in 1972 and 1973, following the week's #1 song, Kasem tried to predict what the #1 song would be on the following week's countdown, based on a poll of the ''AT40'' staff. During the 46-week period that these predictions were used, the poll was successful only 22 weeks, and failed 24 weeks. The final song predicted, on the December 8, 1973, broadcast, was \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]\" by [[Charlie Rich]], which was #1 the next week.\n* '''Debut songs and songs falling out:''' In most countdowns, most commonly if #39 was a debut song or often with the first debut song after #40, Kasem would mention the number of songs that debut in the Top 40 and would then proceed to read off the list of songs that fell out of the countdown that week making room for the debuts.\n* '''Great Radio Stations:''' Once an hour, generally halfway into the hour, Kasem relayed three or four radio stations that carried ''AT40'', beginning each list with \"''American Top 40'' is heard in the fifty states and around the world every week on great radio stations like ... \". One foreign ''AT40'' affiliate, or mention of [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio]], was often included, usually as the last station in the list. In addition, new ''AT40'' affiliates were mentioned at the top of one of the hours (never the first hour). The multiple station mentions became a regular feature in 1972; prior to then, only one station was mentioned per hour. The first station mentioned on ''AT40'' was KMEN (now [[KKDD]]) in [[San Bernardino, California]], on the August 29, 1970, program.<ref>Durkee, p. 69, 86.</ref> Kasem would also do this for the spinoff versions of ''AT40'' he did for adult contemporary stations.\n* '''Special Reports:''' Occasionally, Kasem did a special report on a particular subject involving the music industry, usually related to a particular song or artist on the week's countdown. For example, when [[Musical Youth]] were in the countdown in 1983 with \"[[Pass the Dutchie]]\", he reported on the history of [[reggae]] music.\n* '''Whatever happened to ... :''' Kasem periodically did a segment giving an update on an artist who had not been on the charts for some time.\n* '''Oldies:''' During its first year, each ''AT40'' show featured 3 or 4 \"oldies\", or chart-topping songs of the past. Normally, one old song aired per hour, which at the time mirrored the format of many Top 40 stations. Most of the oldies included were from the Rock 'N Roll era (post 1955). But occasionally, songs by pre-rock artists like Kay Starr, Perry Como or Nat King Cole were included. Each song was heavily promoted by Kasem and contained a story about the artist or some fact making it relevant to the contemporary audience. By the fall of 1971, only one old song appeared per show. The following year, the \"oldie\" feature was dropped altogether. Oldies were brought back to ''AT40'' in the fall of 1975 under the title \"''AT40'' Extra\". But the feature was phased out again by the end of 1976. Old songs rarely appeared again until the \"''AT40'' Archives\" feature began in 1978. Today, some classic rock stations airing re-runs of these early shows will edit some of the \"oldies\" features out of the broadcast, as songs from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s do not reflect the stations' mostly 1970s and 1980s music format.\n* '''''AT40'' Archives:''' Once the show expanded to four hours, each of the first three hours ended with the \"AT40 Archives\" segment that looked back at number one songs of the past. From October 1978 to June 1980, the number one songs of the 1970s were featured in this segment, chronologically, and from June 1980 to November 1981 the number one songs of the 1960s were featured. The \"AT40 Archives\" feature ended in November 1981; for a short time in 1985, however, the show did feature a segment known as the \"AT40 Hall of Fame\", spotlighting a noteworthy artist (who may or may not have been charting that week).\n* '''Commercial bumpers:''' Many commercial breaks generally had a singing jingle at the start and end of each one, known as a \"split logo\". At the start of the break was either \"Casey's coast to coast\" or \"The hits from coast to coast\"; both were used interchangeably. The end of the break was marked by the name of the program, \"''American Top 40''\". The bumpers were originally designed so that stations with no local ads at that point could continue straight to the next segment, with the bumpers changing to a mere jingle: \"Casey's coast to coast ... ''American Top 40''\".\n* '''Bumper music:''' The end of each hour's worth of programming was typically indicated by an approximately one-minute-long piece of nondescript [[bumper music]]. For the first few years of the program, it was merely the ''AT40'' theme, but beginning in 1978, different pieces began to be used. Like the \"number\" jingles and the ''AT40'' theme music, the bumpers were occasionally updated and re-recorded, but its only distinguishing feature was the occasional use of the ''AT40'' theme as a [[leitmotif]]. The bumper music was typically and often cut short by the local station carrying the program, usually to give the [[station identification]] before starting the next hour, and was also used by stations to \"pad out\" the show so that it would always end on time. (The first weekend [[XM Satellite Radio]] played ''AT40'' shows, the entire bumper music was played, as they were all played completely uncut, but later they played the station identification for the XM channels they were on.) When ''AT40'' returned in 1998, the bumper music was preceded by a preview of the next song, and the lyrics \"countin' down the hits with Casey Kasem\" were added and played twice. The bumper was then followed by the station ID, with Kasem introducing the next song immediately after; this method was introduced in 1989 on his Westwood One program, ''Casey's Top 40'', and carried over to ''AT40'' upon his move to AMFM in 1998.\n* '''Sign-off:''' After the #1 song was played, the bumper music began playing, and over that, Kasem typically reported that week's chart date and read the end credits, then signed off with what became his, and the show's, unofficial motto: ''\"Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars.\"'' Beginning with the show of June 25, 1977, he usually added \"and keep your radio tuned right where it is\", as a way to help its affiliated stations improve listener loyalty;<ref name=\":0\">''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.82). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> this phrase would be retired in 1984, but returned to the show when the ''AT40'' brand name was revived in the late 1990s (Kasem had also used it on ''Casey's Top 40'' and its Adult Contemporary-format spinoffs). Guest hosts would be prohibited from using Kasem's sign-off, but still used the \"keep your radio tuned right where it is\" phrase when its usage was in effect. Even his sign-on and sign-off music became popular, as \"[[Shuckatoom]]\" (composed by [[James R. Kirk]]) became a highly requested song, although it was never used apart from the show; \"Shuckatoom\" was first used to close ''AT40'' with the \"Top 40 Rock & Roll Acts of the 1950s\" on October 4, 1975, and first used to open ''AT40'' on November 8, 1975.<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (p.157 & 159). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref>\n\nAlthough the show's format implied an average of ten countdown songs per hour (once the show had gone to a four-hour format), this was not rigidly enforced; however, by the mid-1980s, it had become increasingly rare for the final hour of the show to have any more than the top eleven or any fewer than the top nine songs left to play. The songs' run times determined how many would comfortably fit into each hour. The show bent to fit the ''Billboard'' rankings, and some songs had to be edited (in addition to whatever edits had been done for the single release), with a verse or chorus cut (usually for songs on their way out of the countdown), in order to fit into the show. But Kasem and his producers never lost sight of the stations carrying their show, and that the stories behind the songs were the chief reason that listeners tuned to ''AT40''.\n\n===1988\u201395: Shadoe Stevens era===\nIn 1988, Kasem left the show over contract concerns with ABC and signed with [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to host a competing weekly countdown. Industry trade paper ''Billboard'' magazine reported that the main disputes between Kasem and Watermark/ABC were over his salary (which Westwood One tripled upon his signing), because of declining ratings and a smaller group of stations airing the show. Casey's final ''AT40'' show, the 940th in the series, aired on August 6, 1988. At no point during that final show did Kasem ever let on that any changes were afoot. However, he closed the show by telling the audience to catch him on the television show ''[[America's Top 10]]'' and did not plug the following week's ''AT40'' (since December 19, 1987, he had always plugged both during his signoff). The #1 song during Casey's final show in the original ''AT40'' era was \"[[Roll with It (Steve Winwood song)|Roll with It]]\" by [[Steve Winwood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1988-08-06|title=The Hot 100:The week of August 6, 1988|publisher=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nKasem was replaced by [[Shadoe Stevens]], whose first ''American Top 40'' show aired on August 13, 1988, on 1,014 stations.<ref>Durkee, p. 189.</ref> To introduce Stevens to the audience, a two-minute cold open was recorded to start the show with Stevens making his way to the studio through the show's fictitious hall of history; Kasem was mentioned during the course of the open, as a \"giant marble statue\" of him helped guide Stevens to the studio. The change did not do much to stem the decline as loyal listeners did not take to Stevens as they had to Kasem.\n\nLater, Stevens and ''AT40'' lost a significant number of affiliates when, on January 21, 1989, Kasem's Westwood One show launched. The program, titled ''[[Casey's Top 40]]'', used the weekly chart survey published by ''[[Radio & Records]]'' instead of the ''Billboard'' chart ''AT40'' was still using. Further complications arose when some stations that stayed with Stevens also added Kasem's new show.\n\nIn an attempt to win back an audience, ''AT40'' tried new features, including interview clips, music news, top 5 flashbacks, and previews of upcoming chart hits (called the \"''AT40'' Sneek Peek\"<ref>According to Durkee, p. 252: \"The word 'sneek'...was misspelled in the script for the first show that aired the feature, and [it] was never never subsequently corrected.\"</ref>). It also stopped using the Hot 100 chart, switching first to the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart and finally to the [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. Later still, the countdown would use what was called a \"No Nuttin'\" gimmick that drew criticism; at various points of the show, a song would start immediately after the jingle for its position on the chart was played and Stevens would not offer any commentary until it concluded.<ref>Durkee, p. 240-241.</ref>\n\nABC kept ''American Top 40'' in its syndication lineup despite the continued lack of improvement in ratings, but in 1994 the network finally decided to look elsewhere.<ref>Durkee, p. 216.</ref> ABC announced it would be acquiring the ''[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]'', which was using the same charts that ''Casey's Top 40'' was, and that they would no longer carry ''American Top 40'' as a result. The final ''AT40'' for ABC aired on July 9, 1994, five days after its twenty-fourth anniversary. [[Radio Express]], founded by original show creator Tom Rounds, kept ''AT40'' in production following the move by ABC as the program was still carried in foreign markets.<ref>Durkee, p. 218.</ref><ref>Durkee, p. 165.</ref> It was under Radio Express that the show finally came to an end nearly seven months later in the remaining markets that were carrying it, which by this point consisted entirely of overseas affiliates.\n\nThe very last original ''AT40'' aired on January 28, 1995, and it ended with an extended last segment. As usual, the #2 song on the chart led it off; that song was \"[[Another Night (Real McCoy song)|Another Night]]\" by [[Real McCoy (band)|Real McCoy]], which had been the #1 song one week earlier. Stevens then took a moment to thank the listeners for their support over the previous twenty-four plus years and played one last Long Distance Dedication, sent by him to the fans. After going into depth about his potential choices, Stevens revealed his selection to be \"[[(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On]]\" by [[James Brown]]. Stevens then gave a rundown of how many songs had been played over the series' entire run to that point, with a final total of 552 different chart toppers, including the one he was about to play as it returned to the top of the chart that week: \"[[On Bended Knee]]\" by [[Boyz II Men]]. As Stevens then read the credits and signed off for the final time, he played one final song. Perhaps appropriately, considering the circumstances, the song was \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\".\n\n===1998\u20132004: ''American Top 40'' returns; second Casey Kasem era===\nNearly three years after the cancellation of ''AT40'', a series of events began that would result in the return of the long-running countdown to radio. Original host Casey Kasem had acquired the rights to the name and branding of his creation, but found Westwood One unwilling to exploit them. In addition, Kasem and his syndicator's parent company were in a salary dispute as Kasem felt he was not getting fair treatment while the syndicator believed the amount of advertising revenue ''Casey's Top 40'' was generating did not justify Kasem's demands.\n\nSince there was interest in Kasem, who was now 65 years old and hosting two adult contemporary countdown shows in addition to his pop show, Westwood One decided it was best for them to retain Kasem and in December 1997 he reupped for one additional year. However, he left Westwood One toward the end of February 1998 and gave no notice that he would not be back.<ref>Durkee, p. 253.</ref>\n\nChancellor Media, a forerunner of [[iHeartRadio]], and Kasem began negotiations to relaunch ''AT40''; Chancellor had just started a syndication service called AMFM Radio Networks and scored a significant coup by luring Kasem away from what had been a nine-year relationship with Westwood One. Although Kasem would eventually be taken to court by his former syndicator, the signing enabled him to reintroduce the ''American Top 40'' name and brand to a modern audience. It also gave Chancellor the rights to the historic name as Kasem signed over his rights to the branding.\n\nOn the weekend of March 28, 1998, one week after Westwood One finally cancelled the three countdowns Kasem was hosting for them after four weeks without him. Chancellor also brought Kasem's AC countdowns to their network, with both now being branded as ''American Top 20'' (see [[American Top 40#Spin-off programming|Spin-off programming]] below). Following the merger between Chancellor/AMFM and Clear Channel Communications (the predecessor of what is now [[iHeartMedia]]) in 1999, ''AT40'' and other syndicated shows from AMFM Radio Networks were transferred into Premiere Radio Networks, which continues to syndicate the show as of today.\n\nThe resurrected ''American Top 40'' kept the ''Radio and Records'' CHR/Pop chart previously used for ''Casey's Top 40'' and was used as the basis for the show for the majority of this period. The only exception was a brief period from October 2000 to August 2001 when an obscure [[Mediabase]] chart was used. This chart had a rather ambiguous [[recurrent rotation|recurrent rule]], which would see songs removed weekly from the chart from as high as #10, while that chart also resulted in songs that charted/peaked lower than #40 on ''Radio & Records'' pop charts to appear on the ''AT40'' charts. By the time Kasem's last show aired, the show had gone back to using Mediabase's charts.\n\nIn December 2003, as part of a new deal with Premiere Radio Networks, Kasem announced that he would retire from hosting ''American Top 40'' so he could focus on his duties hosting Hot AC and AC versions of the show, ''American Top 20.'' He also announced that the new host of ''AT40'' would be [[Ryan Seacrest]], an afternoon DJ host from [[KYSR]] who was rapidly gaining stardom from his hosting of the successful music reality TV show. ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-12-12.pdf|title=Kasem Strikes New Countdown Deal As Seacrest Takes on AT40|date=December 12, 2003|work=Radio and Records|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKasem's last show as host of ''AT40'' aired on the weekend of January 3/4, 2004. His final #1 was [[Outkast]]'s \"[[Hey Ya!]]\", which hit the top of the chart on the weekend of December 13, 2003.<ref>\"American Top 40\" January 3, 2004, dist. by.

Retrieved on June 5, 2009.</ref> With the host change, ''AT40'' underwent a makeover, using a new theme song and introducing several new features. These extras included interviews with celebrities (which were not restricted to musical or countdown artists), a gossip section, and an update on movies screening in cinemas. Other extras inducted on a regular basis include \"AT40 Breakout\", a song predicted to crack the chart within the next few weeks (formerly known as the \"Out of The Box\" hit); \"Request Line\", a segment in which Ryan Seacrest will play a song requested by a listener; \"Double Play\", a former hit from the artist just played; \"AT40 Sleaze\" (inspired by the \"Dees Sleaze\" segment of the ''[[Rick Dees]] Weekly Top 40'' radio show); and \"AT40 Rewind\", a hit song from the past decade or so. In between songs, Seacrest and his guest hosts often make deadpan one-liners while writers and producers can be heard laughing frequently, including the security guard \"Roger\". Additionally, Seacrest initially opened most shows by playing the previous week's #1 song, as Kasem often did in the 1980s; this was discontinued after 2006, but in mid-2009 Seacrest began including a shorter recap segment in the show's introduction, in which he would play brief segments of the previous week's top three hits. In December 2004, the Hot AC version of the show debuted, giving both Seacrest and Kasem competing countdowns in the same format until 2009.\n\nThe show also began using a new chart that used no recurrent rule. On the first show with Ryan Seacrest, this led to several older songs reappearing after having dropped off many weeks earlier. Over the long term, it meant songs could spend long runs for about a year on the chart even after they went to recurrent status on other published charts. \"[[Here Without You]]\" by [[3 Doors Down]] set a longevity record in 2004 for the CHR show by lasting 50 weeks before finally falling off. In 2006, \"[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]\" by [[Papa Roach]] would go on to tie the record. In 2011, [[Taio Cruz]] set AT40's all time longevity record with his song \"[[Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)|Dynamite]]\". This hit remained on the chart for 72 weeks, from July 2010 to November 2011. On the Hot AC version of AT40, \"[[Use Somebody]]\" by [[Kings of Leon]] set the all-time record in 2011 at 117 consecutive weeks. ''American Top 40'' also became more interactive, involving online song voting and e-mail. In December 2006, the series' website was revamped, and the online song voting was discontinued in favor of publishing the Hot AC chart. The website also includes a toll-free number where fans can make requests and \"[[shout-out|shoutouts]]\", as they would to a local radio station, and by 2009 replayed clips of shoutouts became part of the show. Online song voting was later reinstated, with results of votes on American Top 40's website factored into the chart rankings. AT40 was also expanded to social media through Twitter and Facebook where listeners from around the world will request a song to be included in the AT40 Extra segment, as well as their own mobile application which is available for free download on the Apple AppStore for iOS devices and on Google Play for Android devices.\n\nIn March 2010, Premiere Radio Networks announced that \"American Top 5,\" a condensed daily top-5 countdown, would begin airing as part of the daily radio program ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air]]'', also hosted by Seacrest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premiereradio.com/news/view/841.html |title=Premiere Radio Networks \u2013 Home |publisher=Premiereradio.com |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128142249/http://premiereradio.com/news/view/841.html |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2016, the show underwent some minor changes. \"Tell Me Something Good\", a segment from Seacrest's weekday show ''On Air'', was added to ''American Top 40''. Additionally, any \"extra\" songs that aired during the show are announced by Seacrest before playing. The following month, the show resumed mentioning some of its affiliates around the world during the show.\n\nWhen Seacrest was named the new co-host of ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live with Kelly]]'' on May 1, 2017, he began to host the show from [[WHTZ]] in New York. Another studio near the Live with Kelly set was set up for ''On Air''. Various guest hosts, however, will continue to do hosting duties from its original Hollywood studios when Seacrest is not around.\n\nIn February 2018, the show introduced new jingles with new voiceover artists replacing Dave Foxx and Kelly Doherty, who departed iHeartMedia (Premiere's parent company) in January.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, ''American Top 40'' is produced by Easton Allyn and Jennifer Sawalha, and engineered by James Rash.\n\n==Competition==\n''American Top 40'' has faced numerous competitors since its debut in 1970. These include ''The Weekly Top 30 with Mark Elliot'' (1979-1982), several Dick Clark hosted shows starting in 1981 with the ''National Music Survey'', and the ''[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]'', which has run continuously since 1983 with [[Rick Dees]] as host. Numerous other shows following the same format, both in the general top-40 category and in various specific [[radio format]]s, have aired over the course of ''AT40's'' history. In addition to Dees's show, [[Sean Hamilton|Sean \"Hollywood\" Hamilton]], [[Carson Daly]], the hosts at [[Radio Disney]], and (in overseas via ''World Chart Show'') Mike Savage, all host competing countdown shows targeted at the pop top 40 market.\n\n==Reairing of older shows==\n\n===AT40 flashback===\n\nFrom January 2001 to December 2002, many radio stations aired reruns of 1980\u201388 episodes under the title ''American Top 40 Flashback''. The show was syndicated by [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. In its early weeks the shows were the original four-hour format of an ''American Top 40'' episode, but after the first month and a half the show was reduced to three hours. Although the national syndication of ''American Top 40 Flashback'' ceased in December 2002, radio station [[WMMX]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], continued to carry ''American Top 40 Flashback'' on Saturday mornings until the premiere of ''Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 80s''.\n\n===Casey Kasem's American Top 40\u2014the 70s and 80s===\n\nOn August 4, 2006, [[XM Satellite Radio]] began replays of the original 1970s and 1980s AT40 shows with Casey Kasem that were digitally remastered from the original vinyl LPs and open-reel master tapes by Shannon Lynn of [http://www.charismusicgroup.com Charis Music Group]. The event began with a weekend long marathon of original shows, with AT40 then being added as a regular show on two of XM's Decades channels, \"[[The 70s on 7]]\" and \"[[The 80s on 8]]\". With the merger of [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and XM Satellite Radio, these AT40 shows began airing on both services on November 15, 2008. On the 70s on 7, it replaced the 'Satellite Survey', a Top 30 countdown of 1970s hits, produced by Sirius and hosted by Dave Hoeffel. On the 80s on 8, it replaced 'The Big 40' countdown produced by Sirius and hosted by [[Nina Blackwood]]. As of October 11, 2009, Sirius XM replaced the AT40 countdown on 80s on 8 and debuted a revised version of 'The Big 40' countdown now co-hosted by three of the five original MTV VJs: Nina Blackwood, [[Mark Goodman]] and [[Alan Hunter (VJ)|Alan Hunter]] ([[Martha Quinn]] was a fourth co-host from 2009 to 2015).\n\n[[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] \"70s on 7\" currently runs AT40 each Saturday at 12PM with encore broadcasts the following Sunday at 9AM and at 12 midnight. Most show dates roughly correspond to the current week in real time. The mix of AT40 episodes being run on XM include the year-end countdowns, which are typically run in two parts: the first half (#100-#51) in one time slot, and then the second half (#50-#1) in the following time slot. The AT40 specials are also part of XM's rotation; for instance, \"AT40 Goes to the Movies\" aired prior to the [[79th Academy Awards|2007 Academy Awards]], and on February 24, \"The Top 40 Acts of the 80s So Far\" aired on XM 80s the first week of July 2007. Also, \"The Top 40 Songs of the Disco Era (1974\u20131979)\" aired on Sirius XM \"70s on 7\" the second weekend of July 2011.\n\nFrom October through early November 2006, [[oldies]] radio station [[KQQL]] in [[Minneapolis/St. Paul]], which is owned by [[Clear Channel Communications]], ran a series of American Top 40 episodes from the 1970s. Aside from one week, when the station attempted to air a four-hour episode from 1979 in the three-hour timeslot (resulting in the show getting cut off at #11 and the top 10 not being heard), this test run was largely successful. Because of the success, Premiere Radio Networks decided to launch \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202194412/http://www.premiereradio.com/shows/view/at40_70s.html Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 1970s]\" into national syndication featuring the three-hour shows from 1970 to 1978, and the last three hours of shows originally aired from October 1978 through December 1979. (One original four-hour program, first aired in October 1978, was edited into a three-hour program for reairing in 2007, and the four-hour \"Disco Hits\" special from July 1979 with the first hour optional was aired in 2008, but until the fall of 2010, no other program from the last 15 months of the 1970s was included in the \"AT40: The 70s\" package. Starting in late 2010, Premiere began airing three-hour versions of four-hour AT40s from 1978 to 1979, beginning the broadcasts at the start of the countdown's second hour; during the spring of 2012, Premiere began making the first hour of these programs \"optional,\" meaning that stations can choose to air all four hours of the four-hour programs, or just the last three.) Starting in 2012, whenever programs from 1970 to 1972 were scheduled to air, Premiere began offering affiliates the option of airing a later 1970s program instead (typically, a corresponding year from seven years later, or 1977\u20131979).\n\nThe 1980s version premiered on April 8, 2007, replacing the ''American Top 40 Flashback'' reruns. The shows are available in either their full original four-hour format, or an abbreviated three-hour version that omits the first hour of the show. To date, the latest program to air as part of the \"AT40: The 80s\" package has been August 6, 1988 \u2013 Kasem's last show with the original program. Due to the rights to Shadoe Stevens-era episodes being held by Cumulus Media, no programs from August 13, 1988, to 1995 have been re-aired as part of this or any similar block.\n\nTo date, the only re-aired classic AT40 programs that featured a host other than Kasem are the shows of March 25, 1972, with [[Dick Clark]] as host, and September 12, 1981, with Gary Owens as host. Both have been aired as tributes after Clark's and Owens' deaths.\n\nNewly produced extra segments hosted by voiceover talent Larry Morgan are available for use at stations' discretion. Prior to Casey leaving Premiere Radio, these segments were hosted by his son Mike; when the series first began, these segments were hosted by one of Casey's former guest hosts, [[Ed McMann]]. These extra segments are also heard on the 80s show. KQQL was the first to sign on, airing programs beginning on December 30, 2006. Typically, the \"optional extras\" were songs that had yet to enter the top 40 of the Hot 100. However, some songs never reached the top 40 but had since become popular at classic hits/oldies/classic rock stations, while others were tributes to performers who had just died. For early 1970s programs, some of the \"optional extras\" were actually extras (i.e., \"oldies\") that were originally a part of the original program; in this case, Kasem's original commentary and introduction of the song were kept intact, in lieu of Morgan's voiceover.\n\nIn March 2008, XM Satellite Radio rebranded the XM broadcasts with the \"Casey Kasem's American Top 40\" name and logo used for terrestrial broadcasts, although XM still aired the commercial-free broadcasts, while Premiere Radio carries edited and recut broadcasts with commercials. Following the merger of Sirius and XM, the AT40 shows airing on those platforms have occasionally been edited. In some cases, extras and LDDs have been cut from the original broadcasts.\n\nSirius XM 70s on 7 aired the inaugural AT 40 (which originally aired July 4, 1970) on July 4, 2013, as part of a special July 4 broadcast.\n\nAs of 2017, ''American Top 40: The 70s & 80s'' are produced by Toby James Petty and engineered by Shannon Lynn, both of whom had been members of the current ''AT40'' production staff prior to Kasem's 2004 departure.\n\nAs of 2014, ''American Top 40: The 70s'' shows that were originally produced in mono are being converted to true stereo by Ken Martin.\n\nAs of 2019, shows from the 1970s and 1980s are airing continually, without commercials, on the iHeartRadio station \"[https://www.iheart.com/live/classic-american-top-40-6545/ Classic American Top 40]\". Most of iHeart's branded stations utilize an [[HD Radio]] subchannel in one of their markets to originate their app-only stations, and in this case, [[WMMX|WMMX-HD2]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], carries it over-the-air in that market.\n\n==Chart data used by American Top 40==\n\n===''Billboard'' magazine===\nAT40 used the top 40 songs from the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart from the show's inception in 1970 to November 23, 1991. The chart was widely regarded as the industry standard for tracking the popularity of singles, and was thus a natural choice to be used. Kasem would frequently announce during the show that Billboard was the only source for the countdown. While using these charts worked well for the first half of the 1970s, as music changed during the decade and disco became popular on the charts, some rock stations began to drop the show because of complaints from program directors that AT40 was playing too many songs not normally heard on their stations.\n\nThis gradually became a wide schism as rock splintered into several formats in the early 1980s. As a result, AT40's weekly playlist could be very diverse in the styles and formats of the songs played. Historians have noted that no one station actually played all of the songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] list, because they represented overlapping formats, such as hard rock, mainstream rock, heavy metal, dance, new wave, punk, rap, pop, easy listening/adult contemporary and country. Stations tended to specialize in only one or two of these formats and completely ignore the others.\n\nOne solution for the AT40 producers was to air frequent specials (at least three or four times a year) that concentrated on the classic music of the past, such as ''Rock in the Movies'' and ''Top Hits of the Seventies''. But as Top 40 stations evolved into [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]], they began to avoid syndicated shows like AT40, preferring to stick with their own special niche formats.\n\nBy the early [[1990s in music|1990s]], many singles, mostly of the rap, heavy metal or grunge genres, reached the chart based on strong sales despite low airplay; several were very long, others were too controversial or risqu\u00e9 for mainstream airplay (for instance, the sexually explicit \"[[Me So Horny]]\" by [[2 Live Crew]] made it to #26 on the Hot 100 in 1989). These songs would generally only be aired in brief snippets during the show.\n\nBecause of this, ''American Top 40'' switched to the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|Hot 100 Airplay]] chart (then known as the Top 40 Radio Monitor). These songs generally scored much higher radio airplay, and some were not even released as singles (such as \"Steel Bars\" by [[Michael Bolton]]). During this time, a few songs made very high debuts, including two that almost debuted in the #1 spot: \"I'll Be There\" by [[Mariah Carey]], which entered at #4, and \"Erotica\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], which entered at #2.\n\nIn January 1993, ''American Top 40'' switched charts again, this time to the ''Billboard'' [[Top 40 Mainstream]] chart. This chart had more mainstream hits but fewer urban, dance and rap songs.\n\nAT40 did not always use the official year-end Billboard chart during the 25 years in which the show used Billboard charts. In 1972, 1973 and 1977, as well as 1980-1984 and  1990-1994, AT40 compiled its own year-end chart. These charts were often close to Billboard's, but AT40 would use a mid-December to early-December time period while Billboard's survey year varied from year to year. AT40 matched Billboard's #1 year-end song every year except 1977, 1984, 1990 and 1993.\n\n===''Radio & Records'' magazine===\nWith the show's revival in 1998, a new chart was implemented, the top 40 portion of ''Radio and Records'' CHR/Pop top 50 chart, which was already in use on ''Casey's Top 40''. This chart used a [[recurrent rotation|recurrent rule]] that removed songs below #25 that had exceeded 26 weeks in the top 50; these removals, if they occurred in the top 40, would be reflected on the appropriate week's program. In 1999, the rule was modified to further restrict long chart runs: songs falling below #20 with at least 20 weeks in the top 50 would now be removed.\n\nOn October 21, 2000, ''American Top 40'' began using an unpublished chart on a weekly basis for the first time in its history. The chart seemed to be a variant of the CHR/Pop chart provided by [[Mediabase]], the data provider to ''Radio & Records''. The most noticeable feature of this new chart was its ambiguous recurrent rule. Songs would be removed regularly from within the top 15, seemingly regardless of the number of weeks they had spent on the chart. Additionally, the chart has resulted in songs that otherwise peaked at #41-50 on R&R's charts appearing on the ''AT40'' charts. This chart lasted until August 11, 2001, when AT40 returned to the ''Radio & Records'' pop chart. The return coincided with another modification in the recurrent rule; songs would be removed below #25 after three consecutive weeks without a bullet (an increase in radio plays). This change would be short-lived, as in November 2001, ''Radio & Records'' returned to the 20 weeks/below #20 rule, which remained in place for the remainder of Kasem's tenure.\n\n== Spin-off programming ==\n===Adult Contemporary countdowns===\n{{main|American Top 20}}\nWhen Casey Kasem joined what was then AMFM Radio Networks, he had been doing two weekly countdowns for adult contemporary formatted stations. Both of these shows would find a home with him at his new syndicator and were rebranded once he joined. Both shows took the name ''American Top 20'' and launched the same weekend as Kasem's new ''AT40''. He would concurrently host both shows with ''AT40'' until he handed the show over to Ryan Seacrest in January 2004, then continue as host of the AC countdowns until he retired in 2009. After Kasem retired, the Hot AC ''American Top 20'' and the Adult Contemporary ''American Top 10'' were discontinued.\n\n===Television spinoff===\n{{main|America's Top 10}}\n\nFrom 1980 to 1992, a [[music video|video]] version of the show entitled [[America's Top 10]] was aired in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] to television stations across the United States. Kasem hosted this version from 1980 to 1989. When Kasem left ''American Top 40'' in 1988, he remained as host of ''America's Top 10'' until the end of 1989, when he would be replaced by [[Siedah Garrett]] and later [[Tommy Puett]]. Kasem returned by 1991, and the show ran until 1992.\n\n===Other formats===\nBased on the success of ''American Top 40'', Kasem and Don Bustany created a spinoff top 40 countdown for Watermark for Country Radio called ''[[American Country Countdown]]'', patterned after Kasem's program. \"ACC\" premiered in 1973, and was hosted by [[Don Bowman (singer)|Don Bowman]] until 1978, then by [[Bob Kingsley]] until 2005 when [[Kix Brooks]] of the late country music duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] took over, and has been doing so since. Kingsley later moved to another program, ''[[Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40|Country Top 40]]'' (abbreviating, not coincidentally, as \"CT40\"), which follows the same format as AT40 and ACC; Kingsley died in 2019. Both ACC and CT40 remain on the air, ACC on [[Westwood One]] and CT40 syndicated by [[Hubbard Broadcasting]].\n\nAfter Kasem left ABC, the network launched ''American Gold'', a spinoff oldies countdown (featuring far fewer songs, and often focusing on a particular artist) hosted by [[Dick Bartley]]. American Gold's last show aired at the end of March 2009, replaced with another show hosted by Bartley for [[United Stations Radio Networks]], ''[[Classic Countdown]]''.\n\nThe American Top 40 format was adapted in an Australian show titled ''[[Take 40 Australia]]'', similarly counting down the top 40 songs in the country.\n\n==Censorship, offensive songs and affiliate standards==\nCasey Kasem and Watermark's policy regarding putting ''American Top 40'' together was to always play the forty most popular songs in the United States and never to ban a record from the countdown. However, whenever songs with potentially offensive lyrical content made the top 40, Watermark would send out memos to affiliated stations alerting them of the presence of that song in the countdown and sometimes provide stations with suggestions on how to edit the song out of their ''AT40'' broadcasts.\n\n===Offensive content===\nThe first song to receive this advisory was in April and May 1971, with a spoken word piece, \"[[The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley]]\", by [[Terry Nelson (musician)|Terry Nelson]] and C-Company.<ref>Durkee, p. 66.</ref><ref>[http://www.oldradioshows.com/at40/042471.html ''oldradioshows.com: Casey Kasem's American Top 40, 4/24/71''].

This song would chart in the high-30s for four weeks, dropping out after May 15, 1971.</ref> Some more well-known songs which received this treatment included \"[[Kodachrome (song)|Kodachrome]]\" by [[Paul Simon]], \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" by [[The Police]], \"[[Ain't Love a Bitch]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]], and \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]\" by [[Meatloaf (singer)|Meat Loaf]].\n\nPerhaps the most infamous of these songs was [[Chuck Berry]]'s number-one hit \"[[My Ding-a-Ling]]\", which put some stations in the odd position of having to air ''AT40'' without playing the number one song; at least one station, [[KTBZ (AM)|KELI]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], censored out the song at its #1 position, replacing it with a message from station management, explaining why they chose to censor the program.<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (p.70).

The affiliates usually used the suggestion, though some did not and no major complaints were ever heard. (Many of these memos have been reprinted in Pete Battistini's book, \"American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s\".)\n\nIn situations where a charting song contained offensive language and the record company was unable to provide AT40 with a clean edit of the song, the producers would often make an edit themselves. Such was a case with [[Bob Dylan]]'s Top 40 single, \"[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]\", which peaked at #33 in January 1972 and appeared for two weeks on AT40. The offensive lyric in the song was, \"He wouldn't take [[shit]] from no one.\" To rectify the problem, AT40 engineer Bill Hergonson edited the lyric, which was now heard as \"He wouldn't take ''it'' from no one.\"<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.54\u201355). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> A similar situation occurred again in July 1975, when [[The Isley Brothers]]' ''[[Fight the Power (Part 1 & 2)|Fight the Power]]'' was in the Top 40, but in this case, the substitute version provided by the group's label was unsuitable, resorting to the engineer to substitute grunts and extra drum beats over the offending parts of the original record. However, this was not before AT40 erroneously played the uncensored version (with the lyric \"...{{nbsp}}by all this bullshit goin' down\") the first two weeks on the chart, on the July 12 and 19, 1975 editions.<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.152\u2013154). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref>\n\nSongs with offensive words in their titles were often censored for radio airplay, and is reflected in their inclusion on AT40. In 2011, three such songs have made it to the #1 position on AT40: \"[[Fuck You (CeeLo Green song)|Fuck You]]\" by [[CeeLo Green]] (changed to \"Forget You\"), \"[[Fuckin' Perfect]]\" by [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] (changed to \"Perfect\"), and \"[[Tonight (I'm Lovin' You)|Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)]]\" by [[Enrique Iglesias]] (changed to \"Tonight (I'm Lovin' You)\"). Other notable songs included \"[[Niggas in Paris]]\" by [[Jay-Z]] & [[Kanye West]] (becoming \"In Paris\", peaking at #5), \"[[Ass Back Home]]\" by [[Gym Class Heroes]] (became \"Get Yourself Back Home\", peaking at #12), \"[[I Don't Fuck With You]]\" by [[Big Sean]] featuring [[E-40]] (became \"I Don't Mess With You,\" peaking at #34), \"[[Fuck U Betta]]\" by [[Neon Hitch]] (becoming \"Love U Betta\" and peaking at #29; this song was also first played in [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s ''Fresh Buzz Song of the Week'').{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 2000, \"Sexual (Li Da Di)\" by [[Amber (singer)|Amber]] and \"[[The Bad Touch]]\" by [[Bloodhound Gang]] debuted on AT40 without any censorship despite both songs' context referring to sexual activity. The songs peaked at #25 and #21 respectively. That same year, the show also used a slightly suggestive version of [[soulDecision]]'s \"[[Faded (soulDecision song)|Faded]]\" (which peaked at #6), despite a more radio-friendly version of the song being available.\n\nIn 2015, [[The Chainsmokers]]'s \"[[Roses (The Chainsmokers song)|Roses]]\" (feat. ROZES), [[Travis Scott (musician)|Travis Scott]]'s \"[[Antidote (Travis Scott song)|Antidote]]\", [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]]'s \"[[New Americana]]\", and [[Alessia Cara]]'s \"[[Here (Alessia Cara song)|Here]]\" had been edited by censoring one of their chorus in the lyrics dealt with [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibited drugs]]. In 2018, [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]]'s \"[[Young Dumb & Broke]]\" was similarly censored, with the lyric \"I'm so high at the moment\" being completely edited out of the song due to references to drugs. However, on some versions of the show, the lyric was not censored.\n\nIn 2017, [[Jason Derulo]]'s \"[[Swalla]]\" (feat. [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Ty Dolla $ign]]) also had its chorus heavily censored due to the context of the title referring to [[oral sex]]. However, the title of the song was announced without being censored, presumably due to the fact that Ty Dolla $ign uses the title lyric to refer to drinking during his verse in the song.\n\nIn 2018, [[N.E.R.D]] and [[Rihanna]]'s \"[[Lemon (N.E.R.D and Rihanna song)|Lemon]]\" was significantly edited. An alternate version of the song was played, which had the final two verses of the song played on loop. This is presumably to remove the first two verses, in which the lyrics included highly charged political issues such as [[immigration]], [[racism]] and anti-[[Donald Trump]] sentiments.\n\nIn 2019, the chorus of [[Fletcher (singer)|Fletcher]]'s \"[[Undrunk]]\" was edited due to lyrics about masturbation.\n\n===Unannounced titles===\nAlthough Kasem never banned a ''song'' from the countdown, there was at least one instance in which both Kasem and his guest host, Charlie Van Dyke, refused to announce the ''title'' of a song on his show. When [[George Michael]]'s \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\" hit the Billboard charts in the summer of 1987, Kasem and Van Dyke refused to announce the name of the song; only its artist (e.g., \"George Michael's latest hit is up five notches this week{{nbsp}}...\"). Also, as had been done with previous controversial hits, because of the song's suggestiveness, the show's structure was altered slightly, so stations could opt out of the song. This pattern was also evident during the 1987 Year End countdown. The song title was mentioned five times during its chart run (June 20, 1987; June 27, 1987; April 7, 1987; December 9, 1987, and September 19, 1987), during the week-ending episode of September 26, 1987, when it dropped out of the Top 40, and during the Top 100 of 1987 show; Shadoe Stevens, his successor, however did mention the title on the show from July 31, 1993, as part of the Flashback feature, as it was in the top 5 from that week in 1987. In the spring of 1991, when \"[[People Are Still Having Sex]]\" by [[LaTour]] and \"[[I Wanna Sex You Up]]\" by [[Color Me Badd]] debuted the same week, their titles were announced in full.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAnother song that had its title unannounced after its first week was \"[[Me So Horny]]\" by [[2 Live Crew]], in the fall of 1989 (the Shadoe Stevens era). It was mentioned twice at the beginning of the song, and back announced once, its debut week. For the rest of its chart run, the title was never again mentioned. When [[2 Live Crew]] returned to the top 40 in the Summer of 1990, with \"[[Banned in the U.S.A. (song)|Banned in the U.S.A.]]\", Shadoe did mention that it was the follow-up to \"[[Me So Horny]]\". The song did come with edit out instructions for stations as well. Other songs around that time with edit out warnings were \"[[The Humpty Dance]]\" by [[The Digital Underground]], and \"[[Tic Tac Toe]]\" by Kyper.\n\nIn 2018, \"[[God is a Woman]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] had its title not mentioned and its chorus edited in some airings of the show in some Middle Eastern countries, presumably due to religious beliefs; despite this some radio stations such as Hi FM in Oman play the song in its entirety during normal programming.\n\n===Lengthy songs and double-sided hits===\nVery rarely was a song on that week's chart excluded from that week's AT40, if so only due to time considerations\u2014on an edition that aired the weekend of December 19, 1970, [[The Guess Who]]'s \"[[Share the Land]]\", which ranked at #30 that week, was omitted from AT40, in order to play both sides of that week's #1 [[Double A-side]] hit, [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\" / \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\".<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (p.23). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> Normally when a Double A-side appears on the charts, one side is played one week, with the other played the next week, alternating each week as long as it was in the Top 40. Similar omissions occurred in February 1974 when both the [[Gordon Sinclair]] and [[Byron MacGregor]] versions of ''[[The Americans (commentary)|The Americans]]'' simultaneously hit the Top 40; in each case, only one version was played each week alternately.\n\n[[Don McLean]]'s 1971 hit ''[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]'', which was 8:33 long, was split into two segments for the single release. When the song aired on AT40, each part was played alternately, with the entire song played when it reached #1.\n\nIn early 2013, [[Justin Timberlake]]'s single \"[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]\" had to be edited for time, as the song is over eight minutes long.\n\n===Remixes and alternate versions of charted songs===\nOn several occasions, the show would play remixed versions of charted songs. Notable examples included [[Enya]]'s \"[[Only Time]]\", [[LeAnn Rimes]]' \"[[Can't Fight the Moonlight]]\", [[Mikaila]]'s \"So\nIn Love With Two\", [[Whitney Houston]]'s \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\" and \"[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]\" among others.\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, AT40 played the original versions of [[Joe (singer)|Joe]]'s \"[[Stutter (Joe song)|Stutter]]\", [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s \"[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]\" and [[Samantha Mumba]]'s \"[[Baby, Come Over (This Is Our Night)|Baby Come on Over]]\", in which airplay was given for remixed versions of each song.\n\nIn 2019, AT40 played the original version of [[Lil Nas X]]\u2019s \u201c[[Old Town Road]]\u201d, despite the remix version with Billy Ray Cyrus receiving airplay.\n\n===Disco and rap===\nAs has been mentioned previously, many rock radio stations in the late 1970s adopted anti-[[disco]] stances, and this, too, was reflected in the way some affiliates edited ''AT40''. For example, one 1979 show featured a story about disco saving New York; again, the show was structured so that anti-disco stations could edit the story out of the show. (Notably, Kasem ended the monologue with the prediction that \"disco is here to stay,\" which was proven false in short order, as disco rapidly fell out of fashion by 1980.)\n\nMore famously, on the weekend of July 7\u20138, 1979, [[Cleveland]], Ohio AT40 affiliate [[WNCX|WGCL]] (now [[WNCX]]), instead of carrying the \"American Top 40 Top 40 Disco Songs\" special because of being an anti-disco radio station, did its own version of ''American Top 40'' using the July 7, 1979 Billboard chart as the source with [[Townsend Coleman]] handling the hosting duties for Casey Kasem. The special Cleveland-only ''American Top 40'' episode did not feature the ''AT40'' Archives, extras, or Long Distance Dedications \u2013 just the top 40 singles of that week, which was preceded by a recap of the previous week's top three. Because the station did not have disco songs in the playlist, and the top 40 that week had several disco songs, WGCL had to reach outside its library to find copies of some of the songs, some of which were not the single versions; \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\" by [[Donna Summer]], the songs occupying the #3 and #2 spots on the Billboard chart for that week respectively, were conveniently available as a [[12-inch single|12-inch]] medley, which Coleman used for the show. Through clever editing, Coleman also took the \"Casey's Coast to Coast\" jingle (pronounced \"K-C's Coast to Coast\") and spliced in a \"T,\" to provide an appropriate \"TC's Coast to Coast\" jingle. Kasem himself did not learn about the deception until 1996, laughing the whole thing off by saying, \"Maybe I don't ''want'' to hear it!\"\n\nColeman's sleight-of-hand was actually the ''second'' time a version of the ''AT40'' had aired that was not quite on the up and up. According to Rob Durkee's book \"American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century\", Dave Morgan of WDHF (now [[WEBG]]) in Chicago ghosted an edition of the program sometime in the summer of 1975. When the station's copy of the show did not arrive in time, he used ''Billboard''{{'}}s list and merely played the records, apparently heavily implying that the show was ''American Top 40'' without actually identifying it as such. \"My program director made me do it!\" Morgan said years later. The following year, WDHF would refuse to play AT40's \"Fourth of July's Greatest Hits\" special, due to the special's overabundance of #1 hits from the pre-rock era. But while the special was a stark departure from the contemporary sound of the 1970s, Tom Rounds in his press release reminded stations that it was the United States' \"one and only bicentennial.\"<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.175). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref>\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994, two radio stations still carrying ''American Top 40'' had to carry customized versions of the show. [[WPLJ]] in New York City aired the show with the urban/dance/rap songs mentioned but not played and were replaced here and there by [[Hot Adult Contemporary]]-leaning extras. [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, aired AT40 with a few songs that did not fit the station's Top 40 Rhythm format omitted each week. It has also been reported that [[WSTR (FM)|WSTR]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], being an anti-rap station and a very Adult Contemporary-leaning CHR, edited \"[[Another Night (Real McCoy song)|Another Night]]\" by [[Real McCoy (band)|Real McCoy]] (a [[Euro disco]] record with rap breaks) out of its broadcasts of ''Casey's Top 40'' in 1994, even while the song was at #1 on the show (which used the Radio & Records CHR/Pop chart).\n\n==Special Countdowns==\nOccasionally ''American Top 40'' airs special countdowns in place of the regular ''American Top 40'' countdown show. These included<sup>1</sup>:\n* \"Top 40 Recording Acts of the Rock Era 1955\u20131971\" (Weekend of May 1\u20132, 1971)\n* \"Top 40 Christmas Songs\" (Weekend of December 25\u201326, 1971)\n* \"Top 40 Songs of the Rock Era 1955\u20131972\" (weekend of July 1\u20132, 1972)\n* \"Top 40 Albums of the Week\" (weekend of August 5\u20136, 1972)\n* \"Top 40 Artists from Sept 1, 1967, to Sept 1, 1972\" (weekend of September 30 \u2013 October 1, 1972)\n* \"Top 40 Songs from March 1968 to March 1973\" (weekend of April 7\u20138, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Disappearing Acts\" (weekend of July 7\u20138, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Recording Acts of the Rock Era 1955\u20131973\" (weekend of October 6\u20137, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Christmas Songs\" (weekend of December 22\u201323, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of British Artists 1955\u20131974\" (weekend of April 6\u20137, 1974)\n* \"Top 40 Acts of the 1970s, So Far\" (weekend of July 6\u20137, 1974)\n* \"Top 10 Producers of the 1970s\" (weekend of October 5\u20136, 1974)\n* \"Top 40 Disappearing Acts\" (weekend of April 1\u20132, 1975)\n* \"Top 40 Rock 'n' Roll Acts of the 1950s\" (weekend of October 4\u20135, 1975)\n* \"Bicentennial Special: #1 July 4 Songs of the Past 40 Years\" (weekend of July 3\u20134, 1976)\n* \"Top 40 Songs of the 'Beatle Years'[1964\u20131970]\" (weekend of October 2\u20133, 1976)\n* \"Top 40 Girls of the Rock Era 1955\u20131977\" (weekend of July 2\u20133, 1977)\n* \"Top 40 Movie Songs 1960\u20131978\" (weekend of Apr 4\u20135, 1978)\n* \"Top 40 Acts of the 1970s, So Far\" (weekend of Jul 1\u20132, 1978)\n* \"The Top 40 Songs of the Disco Era 1974\u20131979\" (weekend of July 7\u20138, 1979)\n* \"The Top 50 Songs of the 1970s\" (weekend of January 5\u20136, 1980)\n* \"AT40 Book of Records\" (weekend of July 5\u20136, 1980)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of the Beatles: Together and Apart\" (weekend of July 4\u20135, 1981)\n* \"Top 40 Acts of the 1980s, So Far\" (weekend of July 2\u20133, 1983)\n* \"Giants of Rock\" (weekend of July 5\u20136, 1986)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of the 1980s, So Far\" (weekend of July 4\u20135, 1987)\n* \"Top 40 Newcomers of the 1980s, So Far\" (weekend of May 30\u201331, 1988)\n* \"Triathlon of Rock 'n Roll\" (weekend of July 4\u20135, 1988)\n* \"World Tour\" (weekend of May 27\u201329, 1989)\n* \"AT40 Book of Records, 1980s Edition\" (weekend of August 31 \u2013 September 4, 1989)\n* \"Top 40 American Acts of the Previous 10 Years\" (weekend of July 1\u20132, 1991)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of the Past Decade\" (weekend of January 2\u20133, 2010)\n* \"Top 40 Songs of the Decade\u201d (weekend of December 28-29, 2019)\n\n===Annual Countdowns===\nThe top songs of the year are counted down near the turning of each year, though the format has varied over the years.\n\n*'''Top 40 (over 1 week)''': 1971, 1973, 1999, 2010-present*\n*'''Top 50 (over 1 week)''': 1979, 1994\n*'''Top 80 (over 2 weeks)''': 1970, 1972\n*'''Top 100 (over 2 weeks)''': 1974-78, 1980\u201383, 1992, 1998, 2000\u201309\n*'''Top 100 (over 1 week)''': 1984-91, 1993\n\nDuring the show's original run, the 2-week Top 100 programs came with special instructions for editing the show into one 8-hour block. Conversely, the 1-week Top 100 programs came with instructions to split the show into two 4-hour blocks.\n\nIn 1971 and 1973, only the top 40 was counted down due to AT40's Top 40 Christmas Countdowns which aired the week prior. The show did not air Christmas countdowns again until the spinoff shows \"American Top 20\" and \"American Top 10\" came into existence, as both of these spinoffs aired a \"Top 60 Christmas Songs\" special annually the two weeks immediately preceding Christmas.\n\nIn 1994, the show was no longer airing in the US, and would be put on hiatus a month later.\n\nSince 2010, the show has aired the same Top 40 year-end chart two weeks in a row, with the only differences being the optional AT40 Extras and re-cut announcements mentioning the [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]] (which Seacrest also hosts) as a past event instead of an upcoming event. An exception to this was in 2019 when the year-end chart was aired only on the weekend before Christmas, due to the decade-end chart airing the following weekend, with the normal chart resuming the first weekend of January.\n\n===Decade-End Countdowns===\nIn 1979, 1999, 2009 and 2019, the show aired special countdowns of the decade's biggest hits. In 1979 and 1999, the annual year-end countdown show was cut to one week (4 hours) to accommodate the special countdown, though in 2009, they aired a third special week after their usual two-week Top 100. The decade-end shows counted down the Top 50 of the 1970s, and the Top 40s of the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. There was no decade-end countdown for the 1980s.\n\n==Substitute hosts==\nOver 50 celebrities\u2014among them radio personalities, game show hosts, and (particularly since Ryan Seacrest took over hosting duties) charting artists\u2014have substituted for these three throughout the show's run. Radio announcer [[Charlie Van Dyke]] filled in for Casey a record 31 times in the 1980s.<ref>Durkee, p. 144.</ref>\n\nSubstitutes for Ryan Seacrest have included:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Christina Aguilera]]\n* [[Kris Allen]]\n* [[Adam Lambert]]\n* [[Pamela Anderson]]\n* [[Nick Cannon]]\n* [[Steve Carell]]\n* [[Kelly Clarkson]]\n* [[Miley Cyrus]]\n* [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]\n* [[Gavin DeGraw]]\n* [[Hilary Duff]]\n* [[Brody Jenner]]\n* [[Nick Lachey]]\n* [[Mario Lopez]]\n* [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]]\n* [[Paul Doucette]]\n* [[Jesse McCartney]]\n* [[Mandy Moore]]\n* [[Katy Perry]]\n* [[Sean Combs|P.

In its original recording, the song's lyrics are entirely in German, though the show would sometimes play a mix that omitted the verses in favor of a timeline (narrated in English) of the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].\n* In July 2018, \"[[Mine (Bazzi song)|Mine]]\" by [[Bazzi (singer)|Bazzi]] became the shortest song at 2:13 to reach #1.\n* In 2019, [[Lil Nas X]]\u2019s \"[[Old Town Road]]\" became the shortest song on the chart at 1:53.\n* Also in 2019, [[Billie Eilish]] became the first artist to be born in the 2000s to have a number 1 song with \"[[Bad Guy (Billie Eilish song)|Bad Guy]]\".\n\n==References==\n* Durkee, Rob.

The program is currently hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and presented as an adjunct to his weekday radio program, ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]''.\n\nOriginally a production of [[Watermark Inc.]] (later a division of ABC Radio known as [[ABC Watermark]], now [[Cumulus Media Networks]]), ''AT40'' is now distributed by [[Premiere Networks]] (a division of [[iHeartMedia]]). [[American_Top_40#Syndication|Nearly 430 radio stations in the United States, and several other territories worldwide]] air AT40 making it one of the most listened-to weekly radio programs in the world. It can also be heard on [[iHeartRadio]], [[TuneIn]] and the official AT40 applications on mobile smartphones and tablets as well as on [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 4]] consoles (via iHeartRadio's console app) and the [[Armed Forces Network]]. [[GEICO]] is the main sponsor for the show.\n\nCo-creator Casey Kasem hosted the original ''AT40'' from its inauguration on July 4, 1970, until August 6, 1988. [[Shadoe Stevens]] took over the program on August 13, 1988, and hosted until January 28, 1995, when the original program came to an end. Three years later, Kasem teamed up with Premiere's predecessor AMFM Radio Networks to relaunch ''AT40''. Kasem, who had spent nine years hosting [[Casey's Top 40|his own countdown]] for Westwood One, returned to hosting his creation on March 28, 1998. Seacrest took over ''AT40'' on January 10, 2004, following Kasem's retirement from the series.\n\nCurrently, ''AT40'' with Seacrest airs in two different formats, with one distributed to [[Contemporary Hit Radio]] (Top 40) stations and the other to [[Hot Adult Contemporary]] stations. However, there is no distinction made between the two shows on air. There are also two classic editions of the original ''AT40'' distributed every weekend, featuring past Kasem-hosted shows from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIn its early years, the ''AT40'' used the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to compile the countdown, touting it as \"the only source\". The program subsequently switched to being based on ''[[Radio and Records]]'' airplay data upon its late 1990s return.<ref>Durkee, p. 259.</ref> The current source for the ''AT40'' charts are unpublished mainstream Top 40 and hot adult contemporary charts compiled by [[Mediabase]].\n\nThrough most of the 1980s, the countdown was compiled by Stu Jacobs.\n\n==History==\n\n===1970\u201388: First Casey Kasem era===\n{{quote|text= Here we go with the Top 40 hits of the nation this week on ''American Top 40'', the best-selling and most-played songs from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], from [[Canada]] to [[Mexico]].

The show quickly gained popularity once it was commissioned, and expanded to a four-hour-program on October 7, 1978, to reflect the increasing average length of singles on ''Billboard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Hot 100 chart. The producing staff expanded to eight people, some of them still in the business: Nikki Wine, Ben Marichal, Scott Paton, Matt Wilson, Merrill Shindler, [[Guy Aoki]], Ronnie Allen and Sandy Stert Benjamin.

The second song in the segment would usually be introduced by Kasem with a brief story connected with the song, which could be about its performer, its composer, or a random bit of trivia. Kasem would often lead into the commercial break preceding the segment with a brief preview of the story, sometimes even giving away the song title or artist.\n\nThe top-ranking song on the chart always was introduced with one of these stories, which would be followed with a drum roll and the final reveal. Here is an example from the week of October 8, 1983:\n\n{{quote|A stunning achievement for 33-year-old New York-born [[Jim Steinman]]. Jim started writing songs when he was going to [[Amherst College]] in Massachusetts, and not just your basic rock & roll tunes, but words and music for a full-blown rock musical called ''The Dream Engine''. The college musical was seen by a man who heads up the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]], [[Joseph Papp]]. Joseph Papp was so impressed, that he bought the rights to it and commissioned Jim Steinman to write another musical. Jim came up with a show called ''More Than You Deserve''. And it was at auditions for that show, that he met a singer calling himself [[Meat Loaf]]. The two men started working together, and that collaboration resulted in Jim's writing and arranging songs for Meat Loaf, including the big hit \"[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]\". In 1981, Jim Steinman released his own solo album ''[[Bad for Good]]''. It featured the Top 40 hit \"[[Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through]]\". But so far, it looks as though the thing that Jim Steinman does best, is write and produce songs for other artists. And his latest productions are his biggest yet: the number 2 and the number 1 songs this week. Probably a chart first for one individual. We just heard the number 2 song he wrote and produced for [[Air Supply]], \"[[Making Love Out of Nothing at All]]\". Now, here's the other one, the one at the very top. (drum roll) The most popular song in the land for the second consecutive week, is a hit written and produced by Jim Steinman. At number 1, [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\".}}\n\n* '''\"Number\" jingles:''' Occasionally, a song was preceded by a brief audio clip of a group of singers announcing the song's position on the chart (e.g. \"Number 40!\"). This was especially common for the first song played in each hour of the show, but was usually not done for the #1 song (which was usually introduced with a drum roll), or for songs preceded by a story. The \"number\" jingles were updated and re-recorded from time to time, and by the mid-1980s, the show began using two sets of \"number\" jingles: the standard set, to be used with up-tempo songs; and a softer alternate set, usually used with low-key or romantic songs.\n* '''Chart trivia:''' ''AT40'' also featured several letters in each show where a listener wrote to ask a chart trivia question. Sometimes these letters led to an extra song being played, though this became less common as songs increased in length in the 1980s.\n* '''Long Distance Dedication:''' This feature evolved from a spoken-word 45 single that Kasem had recorded in 1964, \"Letter from Elaina\", in which a girl wrote to Kasem about her encounter with The Beatles.<ref>Durkee, p. 90.</ref>\n\nIn a 2007 Valentine's Day special edition of ''American Top 10'', Kasem explained that the LDD feature was intended to be part of the show from the beginning. He knew, however, that it was going to take some time before a listener wrote in with a request and let the process proceed organically. Kasem's patience proved correct, as staffer Matt Wilson found such a letter while checking the show's mail in August 1978. The listener asked Kasem to play the song \"[[Desiree (song)|Desiree]]\" by [[Neil Diamond]], which he dedicated to his girlfriend of the same name who was moving to West Germany to live with her family on an Army base. The request was fulfilled on the weekend of August 26, 1978; when that show was rebroadcast the weekend of August 25\u201326, 2007, Kasem recorded two optional segments (played at the discretion of the station) in which he did phone interviews with the man and his former girlfriend about the LDD. Most shows featured two long distance dedications, usually with one during each half of the show. (Sometimes, a song currently in the countdown was requested as a LDD; in such cases, Kasem would typically read the dedication first, and sometimes not even announce the song's chart status until after the song was played.) This feature endured on ''AT40'' into Shadoe Stevens' run as host of the show, from 1988 to 1995, and also followed Kasem on his [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]] shows, first as \"Request and Dedication\", and then back to LDD when he returned to ''AT40'' in 1998. Long Distance Dedications were dropped after Ryan Seacrest became host in 2004, but they continued as part of Kasem's adult contemporary countdowns.\n* '''Top Three recaps:''' Beginning the weekend of February 24\u201325, 1979, a recap of the previous week's top three songs started off each ''AT40'' episode. Originally all three songs would be played before the countdown began in earnest, but when time constraints became an issue, Kasem would simply announce the #3 and #2 songs and play only the #1 song, or just announce all three songs. By mid-1983, abbreviated recaps became the norm.\n* '''#1's on other ''Billboard'' charts:''' Kasem gave a rundown on songs and albums that were #1 on other ''Billboard'' charts, such as country, soul/R&B, and dance/disco. These were typically announced during the Top 10, often before the #1 song on ''AT40''. When Kasem relaunched the show in 1998, he brought this feature back albeit with the chart the show was currently using. However, it was limited to songs and only covered the Mediabase alternative, adult contemporary, and R&B charts.\n* '''Predicting next week's #1 song:''' For a time in 1972 and 1973, following the week's #1 song, Kasem tried to predict what the #1 song would be on the following week's countdown, based on a poll of the ''AT40'' staff. During the 46-week period that these predictions were used, the poll was successful only 22 weeks, and failed 24 weeks. The final song predicted, on the December 8, 1973, broadcast, was \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]\" by [[Charlie Rich]], which was #1 the next week.\n* '''Debut songs and songs falling out:''' In most countdowns, most commonly if #39 was a debut song or often with the first debut song after #40, Kasem would mention the number of songs that debut in the Top 40 and would then proceed to read off the list of songs that fell out of the countdown that week making room for the debuts.\n* '''Great Radio Stations:''' Once an hour, generally halfway into the hour, Kasem relayed three or four radio stations that carried ''AT40'', beginning each list with \"''American Top 40'' is heard in the fifty states and around the world every week on great radio stations like ... \". One foreign ''AT40'' affiliate, or mention of [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio]], was often included, usually as the last station in the list. In addition, new ''AT40'' affiliates were mentioned at the top of one of the hours (never the first hour). The multiple station mentions became a regular feature in 1972; prior to then, only one station was mentioned per hour. The first station mentioned on ''AT40'' was KMEN (now [[KKDD]]) in [[San Bernardino, California]], on the August 29, 1970, program.<ref>Durkee, p. 69, 86.</ref> Kasem would also do this for the spinoff versions of ''AT40'' he did for adult contemporary stations.\n* '''Special Reports:''' Occasionally, Kasem did a special report on a particular subject involving the music industry, usually related to a particular song or artist on the week's countdown. For example, when [[Musical Youth]] were in the countdown in 1983 with \"[[Pass the Dutchie]]\", he reported on the history of [[reggae]] music.\n* '''Whatever happened to ... :''' Kasem periodically did a segment giving an update on an artist who had not been on the charts for some time.\n* '''Oldies:''' During its first year, each ''AT40'' show featured 3 or 4 \"oldies\", or chart-topping songs of the past. Normally, one old song aired per hour, which at the time mirrored the format of many Top 40 stations. Most of the oldies included were from the Rock 'N Roll era (post 1955). But occasionally, songs by pre-rock artists like Kay Starr, Perry Como or Nat King Cole were included. Each song was heavily promoted by Kasem and contained a story about the artist or some fact making it relevant to the contemporary audience. By the fall of 1971, only one old song appeared per show. The following year, the \"oldie\" feature was dropped altogether. Oldies were brought back to ''AT40'' in the fall of 1975 under the title \"''AT40'' Extra\". But the feature was phased out again by the end of 1976. Old songs rarely appeared again until the \"''AT40'' Archives\" feature began in 1978. Today, some classic rock stations airing re-runs of these early shows will edit some of the \"oldies\" features out of the broadcast, as songs from the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s do not reflect the stations' mostly 1970s and 1980s music format.\n* '''''AT40'' Archives:''' Once the show expanded to four hours, each of the first three hours ended with the \"AT40 Archives\" segment that looked back at number one songs of the past. From October 1978 to June 1980, the number one songs of the 1970s were featured in this segment, chronologically, and from June 1980 to November 1981 the number one songs of the 1960s were featured. The \"AT40 Archives\" feature ended in November 1981; for a short time in 1985, however, the show did feature a segment known as the \"AT40 Hall of Fame\", spotlighting a noteworthy artist (who may or may not have been charting that week).\n* '''Commercial bumpers:''' Many commercial breaks generally had a singing jingle at the start and end of each one, known as a \"split logo\". At the start of the break was either \"Casey's coast to coast\" or \"The hits from coast to coast\"; both were used interchangeably. The end of the break was marked by the name of the program, \"''American Top 40''\". The bumpers were originally designed so that stations with no local ads at that point could continue straight to the next segment, with the bumpers changing to a mere jingle: \"Casey's coast to coast ... ''American Top 40''\".\n* '''Bumper music:''' The end of each hour's worth of programming was typically indicated by an approximately one-minute-long piece of nondescript [[bumper music]]. For the first few years of the program, it was merely the ''AT40'' theme, but beginning in 1978, different pieces began to be used. Like the \"number\" jingles and the ''AT40'' theme music, the bumpers were occasionally updated and re-recorded, but its only distinguishing feature was the occasional use of the ''AT40'' theme as a [[leitmotif]]. The bumper music was typically and often cut short by the local station carrying the program, usually to give the [[station identification]] before starting the next hour, and was also used by stations to \"pad out\" the show so that it would always end on time. (The first weekend [[XM Satellite Radio]] played ''AT40'' shows, the entire bumper music was played, as they were all played completely uncut, but later they played the station identification for the XM channels they were on.) When ''AT40'' returned in 1998, the bumper music was preceded by a preview of the next song, and the lyrics \"countin' down the hits with Casey Kasem\" were added and played twice. The bumper was then followed by the station ID, with Kasem introducing the next song immediately after; this method was introduced in 1989 on his Westwood One program, ''Casey's Top 40'', and carried over to ''AT40'' upon his move to AMFM in 1998.\n* '''Sign-off:''' After the #1 song was played, the bumper music began playing, and over that, Kasem typically reported that week's chart date and read the end credits, then signed off with what became his, and the show's, unofficial motto: ''\"Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars.\"'' Beginning with the show of June 25, 1977, he usually added \"and keep your radio tuned right where it is\", as a way to help its affiliated stations improve listener loyalty;<ref name=\":0\">''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.82). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> this phrase would be retired in 1984, but returned to the show when the ''AT40'' brand name was revived in the late 1990s (Kasem had also used it on ''Casey's Top 40'' and its Adult Contemporary-format spinoffs). Guest hosts would be prohibited from using Kasem's sign-off, but still used the \"keep your radio tuned right where it is\" phrase when its usage was in effect. Even his sign-on and sign-off music became popular, as \"[[Shuckatoom]]\" (composed by [[James R. Kirk]]) became a highly requested song, although it was never used apart from the show; \"Shuckatoom\" was first used to close ''AT40'' with the \"Top 40 Rock & Roll Acts of the 1950s\" on October 4, 1975, and first used to open ''AT40'' on November 8, 1975.<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (p.157 & 159). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref>\n\nAlthough the show's format implied an average of ten countdown songs per hour (once the show had gone to a four-hour format), this was not rigidly enforced; however, by the mid-1980s, it had become increasingly rare for the final hour of the show to have any more than the top eleven or any fewer than the top nine songs left to play. The songs' run times determined how many would comfortably fit into each hour. The show bent to fit the ''Billboard'' rankings, and some songs had to be edited (in addition to whatever edits had been done for the single release), with a verse or chorus cut (usually for songs on their way out of the countdown), in order to fit into the show. But Kasem and his producers never lost sight of the stations carrying their show, and that the stories behind the songs were the chief reason that listeners tuned to ''AT40''.\n\n===1988\u201395: Shadoe Stevens era===\nIn 1988, Kasem left the show over contract concerns with ABC and signed with [[Westwood One (1976-2011)|Westwood One]] to host a competing weekly countdown. Industry trade paper ''Billboard'' magazine reported that the main disputes between Kasem and Watermark/ABC were over his salary (which Westwood One tripled upon his signing), because of declining ratings and a smaller group of stations airing the show. Casey's final ''AT40'' show, the 940th in the series, aired on August 6, 1988. At no point during that final show did Kasem ever let on that any changes were afoot. However, he closed the show by telling the audience to catch him on the television show ''[[America's Top 10]]'' and did not plug the following week's ''AT40'' (since December 19, 1987, he had always plugged both during his signoff). The #1 song during Casey's final show in the original ''AT40'' era was \"[[Roll with It (Steve Winwood song)|Roll with It]]\" by [[Steve Winwood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1988-08-06|title=The Hot 100:The week of August 6, 1988|publisher=Billboard}}</ref>\n\nKasem was replaced by [[Shadoe Stevens]], whose first ''American Top 40'' show aired on August 13, 1988, on 1,014 stations.<ref>Durkee, p. 189.</ref> To introduce Stevens to the audience, a two-minute cold open was recorded to start the show with Stevens making his way to the studio through the show's fictitious hall of history; Kasem was mentioned during the course of the open, as a \"giant marble statue\" of him helped guide Stevens to the studio. The change did not do much to stem the decline as loyal listeners did not take to Stevens as they had to Kasem.\n\nLater, Stevens and ''AT40'' lost a significant number of affiliates when, on January 21, 1989, Kasem's Westwood One show launched. The program, titled ''[[Casey's Top 40]]'', used the weekly chart survey published by ''[[Radio & Records]]'' instead of the ''Billboard'' chart ''AT40'' was still using. Further complications arose when some stations that stayed with Stevens also added Kasem's new show.\n\nIn an attempt to win back an audience, ''AT40'' tried new features, including interview clips, music news, top 5 flashbacks, and previews of upcoming chart hits (called the \"''AT40'' Sneek Peek\"<ref>According to Durkee, p. 252: \"The word 'sneek'...was misspelled in the script for the first show that aired the feature, and [it] was never never subsequently corrected.\"</ref>). It also stopped using the Hot 100 chart, switching first to the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart and finally to the [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. Later still, the countdown would use what was called a \"No Nuttin'\" gimmick that drew criticism; at various points of the show, a song would start immediately after the jingle for its position on the chart was played and Stevens would not offer any commentary until it concluded.<ref>Durkee, p. 240-241.</ref>\n\nABC kept ''American Top 40'' in its syndication lineup despite the continued lack of improvement in ratings, but in 1994 the network finally decided to look elsewhere.<ref>Durkee, p. 216.</ref> ABC announced it would be acquiring the ''[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]'', which was using the same charts that ''Casey's Top 40'' was, and that they would no longer carry ''American Top 40'' as a result. The final ''AT40'' for ABC aired on July 9, 1994, five days after its twenty-fourth anniversary. [[Radio Express]], founded by original show creator Tom Rounds, kept ''AT40'' in production following the move by ABC as the program was still carried in foreign markets.<ref>Durkee, p. 218.</ref><ref>Durkee, p. 165.</ref> It was under Radio Express that the show finally came to an end nearly seven months later in the remaining markets that were carrying it, which by this point consisted entirely of overseas affiliates.\n\nThe very last original ''AT40'' aired on January 28, 1995, and it ended with an extended last segment. As usual, the #2 song on the chart led it off; that song was \"[[Another Night (Real McCoy song)|Another Night]]\" by [[Real McCoy (band)|Real McCoy]], which had been the #1 song one week earlier. Stevens then took a moment to thank the listeners for their support over the previous twenty-four plus years and played one last Long Distance Dedication, sent by him to the fans. After going into depth about his potential choices, Stevens revealed his selection to be \"[[(So Tired of Standing Still We Got to) Move On]]\" by [[James Brown]]. Stevens then gave a rundown of how many songs had been played over the series' entire run to that point, with a final total of 552 different chart toppers, including the one he was about to play as it returned to the top of the chart that week: \"[[On Bended Knee]]\" by [[Boyz II Men]]. As Stevens then read the credits and signed off for the final time, he played one final song. Perhaps appropriately, considering the circumstances, the song was \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\".\n\n===1998\u20132004: ''American Top 40'' returns; second Casey Kasem era===\nNearly three years after the cancellation of ''AT40'', a series of events began that would result in the return of the long-running countdown to radio. Original host Casey Kasem had acquired the rights to the name and branding of his creation, but found Westwood One unwilling to exploit them. In addition, Kasem and his syndicator's parent company were in a salary dispute as Kasem felt he was not getting fair treatment while the syndicator believed the amount of advertising revenue ''Casey's Top 40'' was generating did not justify Kasem's demands.\n\nSince there was interest in Kasem, who was now 65 years old and hosting two adult contemporary countdown shows in addition to his pop show, Westwood One decided it was best for them to retain Kasem and in December 1997 he reupped for one additional year. However, he left Westwood One toward the end of February 1998 and gave no notice that he would not be back.<ref>Durkee, p. 253.</ref>\n\nChancellor Media, a forerunner of [[iHeartRadio]], and Kasem began negotiations to relaunch ''AT40''; Chancellor had just started a syndication service called AMFM Radio Networks and scored a significant coup by luring Kasem away from what had been a nine-year relationship with Westwood One. Although Kasem would eventually be taken to court by his former syndicator, the signing enabled him to reintroduce the ''American Top 40'' name and brand to a modern audience. It also gave Chancellor the rights to the historic name as Kasem signed over his rights to the branding.\n\nOn the weekend of March 28, 1998, one week after Westwood One finally cancelled the three countdowns Kasem was hosting for them after four weeks without him. Chancellor also brought Kasem's AC countdowns to their network, with both now being branded as ''American Top 20'' (see [[American Top 40#Spin-off programming|Spin-off programming]] below). Following the merger between Chancellor/AMFM and Clear Channel Communications (the predecessor of what is now [[iHeartMedia]]) in 1999, ''AT40'' and other syndicated shows from AMFM Radio Networks were transferred into Premiere Radio Networks, which continues to syndicate the show as of today.\n\nThe resurrected ''American Top 40'' kept the ''Radio and Records'' CHR/Pop chart previously used for ''Casey's Top 40'' and was used as the basis for the show for the majority of this period. The only exception was a brief period from October 2000 to August 2001 when an obscure [[Mediabase]] chart was used. This chart had a rather ambiguous [[recurrent rotation|recurrent rule]], which would see songs removed weekly from the chart from as high as #10, while that chart also resulted in songs that charted/peaked lower than #40 on ''Radio & Records'' pop charts to appear on the ''AT40'' charts. By the time Kasem's last show aired, the show had gone back to using Mediabase's charts.\n\nIn December 2003, as part of a new deal with Premiere Radio Networks, Kasem announced that he would retire from hosting ''American Top 40'' so he could focus on his duties hosting Hot AC and AC versions of the show, ''American Top 20.'' He also announced that the new host of ''AT40'' would be [[Ryan Seacrest]], an afternoon DJ host from [[KYSR]] who was rapidly gaining stardom from his hosting of the successful music reality TV show. ''[[American Idol]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-12-12.pdf|title=Kasem Strikes New Countdown Deal As Seacrest Takes on AT40|date=December 12, 2003|work=Radio and Records|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nKasem's last show as host of ''AT40'' aired on the weekend of January 3/4, 2004.

Retrieved on June 5, 2009.</ref> With the host change, ''AT40'' underwent a makeover, using a new theme song and introducing several new features. These extras included interviews with celebrities (which were not restricted to musical or countdown artists), a gossip section, and an update on movies screening in cinemas. Other extras inducted on a regular basis include \"AT40 Breakout\", a song predicted to crack the chart within the next few weeks (formerly known as the \"Out of The Box\" hit); \"Request Line\", a segment in which Ryan Seacrest will play a song requested by a listener; \"Double Play\", a former hit from the artist just played; \"AT40 Sleaze\" (inspired by the \"Dees Sleaze\" segment of the ''[[Rick Dees]] Weekly Top 40'' radio show); and \"AT40 Rewind\", a hit song from the past decade or so. In between songs, Seacrest and his guest hosts often make deadpan one-liners while writers and producers can be heard laughing frequently, including the security guard \"Roger\". Additionally, Seacrest initially opened most shows by playing the previous week's #1 song, as Kasem often did in the 1980s; this was discontinued after 2006, but in mid-2009 Seacrest began including a shorter recap segment in the show's introduction, in which he would play brief segments of the previous week's top three hits. In December 2004, the Hot AC version of the show debuted, giving both Seacrest and Kasem competing countdowns in the same format until 2009.\n\nThe show also began using a new chart that used no recurrent rule. On the first show with Ryan Seacrest, this led to several older songs reappearing after having dropped off many weeks earlier. Over the long term, it meant songs could spend long runs for about a year on the chart even after they went to recurrent status on other published charts. \"[[Here Without You]]\" by [[3 Doors Down]] set a longevity record in 2004 for the CHR show by lasting 50 weeks before finally falling off. In 2006, \"[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]\" by [[Papa Roach]] would go on to tie the record. In 2011, [[Taio Cruz]] set AT40's all time longevity record with his song \"[[Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)|Dynamite]]\". This hit remained on the chart for 72 weeks, from July 2010 to November 2011. On the Hot AC version of AT40, \"[[Use Somebody]]\" by [[Kings of Leon]] set the all-time record in 2011 at 117 consecutive weeks. ''American Top 40'' also became more interactive, involving online song voting and e-mail. In December 2006, the series' website was revamped, and the online song voting was discontinued in favor of publishing the Hot AC chart. The website also includes a toll-free number where fans can make requests and \"[[shout-out|shoutouts]]\", as they would to a local radio station, and by 2009 replayed clips of shoutouts became part of the show. Online song voting was later reinstated, with results of votes on American Top 40's website factored into the chart rankings. AT40 was also expanded to social media through Twitter and Facebook where listeners from around the world will request a song to be included in the AT40 Extra segment, as well as their own mobile application which is available for free download on the Apple AppStore for iOS devices and on Google Play for Android devices.\n\nIn March 2010, Premiere Radio Networks announced that \"American Top 5,\" a condensed daily top-5 countdown, would begin airing as part of the daily radio program ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest (radio)|On Air]]'', also hosted by Seacrest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premiereradio.com/news/view/841.html |title=Premiere Radio Networks \u2013 Home |publisher=Premiereradio.com |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128142249/http://premiereradio.com/news/view/841.html |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2016, the show underwent some minor changes. \"Tell Me Something Good\", a segment from Seacrest's weekday show ''On Air'', was added to ''American Top 40''. Additionally, any \"extra\" songs that aired during the show are announced by Seacrest before playing. The following month, the show resumed mentioning some of its affiliates around the world during the show.\n\nWhen Seacrest was named the new co-host of ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live with Kelly]]'' on May 1, 2017, he began to host the show from [[WHTZ]] in New York. Another studio near the Live with Kelly set was set up for ''On Air''. Various guest hosts, however, will continue to do hosting duties from its original Hollywood studios when Seacrest is not around.\n\nIn February 2018, the show introduced new jingles with new voiceover artists replacing Dave Foxx and Kelly Doherty, who departed iHeartMedia (Premiere's parent company) in January.\n\n{{As of|2018}}, ''American Top 40'' is produced by Easton Allyn and Jennifer Sawalha, and engineered by James Rash.\n\n==Competition==\n''American Top 40'' has faced numerous competitors since its debut in 1970. These include ''The Weekly Top 30 with Mark Elliot'' (1979-1982), several Dick Clark hosted shows starting in 1981 with the ''National Music Survey'', and the ''[[Rick Dees Weekly Top 40]]'', which has run continuously since 1983 with [[Rick Dees]] as host. Numerous other shows following the same format, both in the general top-40 category and in various specific [[radio format]]s, have aired over the course of ''AT40's'' history. In addition to Dees's show, [[Sean Hamilton|Sean \"Hollywood\" Hamilton]], [[Carson Daly]], the hosts at [[Radio Disney]], and (in overseas via ''World Chart Show'') Mike Savage, all host competing countdown shows targeted at the pop top 40 market.\n\n==Reairing of older shows==\n\n===AT40 flashback===\n\nFrom January 2001 to December 2002, many radio stations aired reruns of 1980\u201388 episodes under the title ''American Top 40 Flashback''. The show was syndicated by [[Premiere Radio Networks]]. In its early weeks the shows were the original four-hour format of an ''American Top 40'' episode, but after the first month and a half the show was reduced to three hours. Although the national syndication of ''American Top 40 Flashback'' ceased in December 2002, radio station [[WMMX]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], continued to carry ''American Top 40 Flashback'' on Saturday mornings until the premiere of ''Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 80s''.\n\n===Casey Kasem's American Top 40\u2014the 70s and 80s===\n\nOn August 4, 2006, [[XM Satellite Radio]] began replays of the original 1970s and 1980s AT40 shows with Casey Kasem that were digitally remastered from the original vinyl LPs and open-reel master tapes by Shannon Lynn of [http://www.charismusicgroup.com Charis Music Group]. The event began with a weekend long marathon of original shows, with AT40 then being added as a regular show on two of XM's Decades channels, \"[[The 70s on 7]]\" and \"[[The 80s on 8]]\". With the merger of [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and XM Satellite Radio, these AT40 shows began airing on both services on November 15, 2008. On the 70s on 7, it replaced the 'Satellite Survey', a Top 30 countdown of 1970s hits, produced by Sirius and hosted by Dave Hoeffel. On the 80s on 8, it replaced 'The Big 40' countdown produced by Sirius and hosted by [[Nina Blackwood]]. As of October 11, 2009, Sirius XM replaced the AT40 countdown on 80s on 8 and debuted a revised version of 'The Big 40' countdown now co-hosted by three of the five original MTV VJs: Nina Blackwood, [[Mark Goodman]] and [[Alan Hunter (VJ)|Alan Hunter]] ([[Martha Quinn]] was a fourth co-host from 2009 to 2015).\n\n[[Sirius XM Radio|Sirius XM]] \"70s on 7\" currently runs AT40 each Saturday at 12PM with encore broadcasts the following Sunday at 9AM and at 12 midnight. Most show dates roughly correspond to the current week in real time. The mix of AT40 episodes being run on XM include the year-end countdowns, which are typically run in two parts: the first half (#100-#51) in one time slot, and then the second half (#50-#1) in the following time slot. The AT40 specials are also part of XM's rotation; for instance, \"AT40 Goes to the Movies\" aired prior to the [[79th Academy Awards|2007 Academy Awards]], and on February 24, \"The Top 40 Acts of the 80s So Far\" aired on XM 80s the first week of July 2007. Also, \"The Top 40 Songs of the Disco Era (1974\u20131979)\" aired on Sirius XM \"70s on 7\" the second weekend of July 2011.\n\nFrom October through early November 2006, [[oldies]] radio station [[KQQL]] in [[Minneapolis/St. Paul]], which is owned by [[Clear Channel Communications]], ran a series of American Top 40 episodes from the 1970s. Aside from one week, when the station attempted to air a four-hour episode from 1979 in the three-hour timeslot (resulting in the show getting cut off at #11 and the top 10 not being heard), this test run was largely successful. Because of the success, Premiere Radio Networks decided to launch \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202194412/http://www.premiereradio.com/shows/view/at40_70s.html Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 1970s]\" into national syndication featuring the three-hour shows from 1970 to 1978, and the last three hours of shows originally aired from October 1978 through December 1979. (One original four-hour program, first aired in October 1978, was edited into a three-hour program for reairing in 2007, and the four-hour \"Disco Hits\" special from July 1979 with the first hour optional was aired in 2008, but until the fall of 2010, no other program from the last 15 months of the 1970s was included in the \"AT40: The 70s\" package. Starting in late 2010, Premiere began airing three-hour versions of four-hour AT40s from 1978 to 1979, beginning the broadcasts at the start of the countdown's second hour; during the spring of 2012, Premiere began making the first hour of these programs \"optional,\" meaning that stations can choose to air all four hours of the four-hour programs, or just the last three.) Starting in 2012, whenever programs from 1970 to 1972 were scheduled to air, Premiere began offering affiliates the option of airing a later 1970s program instead (typically, a corresponding year from seven years later, or 1977\u20131979).\n\nThe 1980s version premiered on April 8, 2007, replacing the ''American Top 40 Flashback'' reruns. The shows are available in either their full original four-hour format, or an abbreviated three-hour version that omits the first hour of the show. To date, the latest program to air as part of the \"AT40: The 80s\" package has been August 6, 1988 \u2013 Kasem's last show with the original program. Due to the rights to Shadoe Stevens-era episodes being held by Cumulus Media, no programs from August 13, 1988, to 1995 have been re-aired as part of this or any similar block.\n\nTo date, the only re-aired classic AT40 programs that featured a host other than Kasem are the shows of March 25, 1972, with [[Dick Clark]] as host, and September 12, 1981, with Gary Owens as host. Both have been aired as tributes after Clark's and Owens' deaths.\n\nNewly produced extra segments hosted by voiceover talent Larry Morgan are available for use at stations' discretion. Prior to Casey leaving Premiere Radio, these segments were hosted by his son Mike; when the series first began, these segments were hosted by one of Casey's former guest hosts, [[Ed McMann]]. These extra segments are also heard on the 80s show. KQQL was the first to sign on, airing programs beginning on December 30, 2006. Typically, the \"optional extras\" were songs that had yet to enter the top 40 of the Hot 100. However, some songs never reached the top 40 but had since become popular at classic hits/oldies/classic rock stations, while others were tributes to performers who had just died. For early 1970s programs, some of the \"optional extras\" were actually extras (i.e., \"oldies\") that were originally a part of the original program; in this case, Kasem's original commentary and introduction of the song were kept intact, in lieu of Morgan's voiceover.\n\nIn March 2008, XM Satellite Radio rebranded the XM broadcasts with the \"Casey Kasem's American Top 40\" name and logo used for terrestrial broadcasts, although XM still aired the commercial-free broadcasts, while Premiere Radio carries edited and recut broadcasts with commercials. Following the merger of Sirius and XM, the AT40 shows airing on those platforms have occasionally been edited. In some cases, extras and LDDs have been cut from the original broadcasts.\n\nSirius XM 70s on 7 aired the inaugural AT 40 (which originally aired July 4, 1970) on July 4, 2013, as part of a special July 4 broadcast.\n\nAs of 2017, ''American Top 40: The 70s & 80s'' are produced by Toby James Petty and engineered by Shannon Lynn, both of whom had been members of the current ''AT40'' production staff prior to Kasem's 2004 departure.\n\nAs of 2014, ''American Top 40: The 70s'' shows that were originally produced in mono are being converted to true stereo by Ken Martin.\n\nAs of 2019, shows from the 1970s and 1980s are airing continually, without commercials, on the iHeartRadio station \"[https://www.iheart.com/live/classic-american-top-40-6545/ Classic American Top 40]\". Most of iHeart's branded stations utilize an [[HD Radio]] subchannel in one of their markets to originate their app-only stations, and in this case, [[WMMX|WMMX-HD2]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], carries it over-the-air in that market.\n\n==Chart data used by American Top 40==\n\n===''Billboard'' magazine===\nAT40 used the top 40 songs from the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart from the show's inception in 1970 to November 23, 1991. The chart was widely regarded as the industry standard for tracking the popularity of singles, and was thus a natural choice to be used. Kasem would frequently announce during the show that Billboard was the only source for the countdown. While using these charts worked well for the first half of the 1970s, as music changed during the decade and disco became popular on the charts, some rock stations began to drop the show because of complaints from program directors that AT40 was playing too many songs not normally heard on their stations.\n\nThis gradually became a wide schism as rock splintered into several formats in the early 1980s. As a result, AT40's weekly playlist could be very diverse in the styles and formats of the songs played. Historians have noted that no one station actually played all of the songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] list, because they represented overlapping formats, such as hard rock, mainstream rock, heavy metal, dance, new wave, punk, rap, pop, easy listening/adult contemporary and country. Stations tended to specialize in only one or two of these formats and completely ignore the others.\n\nOne solution for the AT40 producers was to air frequent specials (at least three or four times a year) that concentrated on the classic music of the past, such as ''Rock in the Movies'' and ''Top Hits of the Seventies''. But as Top 40 stations evolved into [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]], they began to avoid syndicated shows like AT40, preferring to stick with their own special niche formats.\n\nBy the early [[1990s in music|1990s]], many singles, mostly of the rap, heavy metal or grunge genres, reached the chart based on strong sales despite low airplay; several were very long, others were too controversial or risqu\u00e9 for mainstream airplay (for instance, the sexually explicit \"[[Me So Horny]]\" by [[2 Live Crew]] made it to #26 on the Hot 100 in 1989). These songs would generally only be aired in brief snippets during the show.\n\nBecause of this, ''American Top 40'' switched to the [[Billboard Hot 100 Airplay|Hot 100 Airplay]] chart (then known as the Top 40 Radio Monitor). These songs generally scored much higher radio airplay, and some were not even released as singles (such as \"Steel Bars\" by [[Michael Bolton]]). During this time, a few songs made very high debuts, including two that almost debuted in the #1 spot: \"I'll Be There\" by [[Mariah Carey]], which entered at #4, and \"Erotica\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], which entered at #2.\n\nIn January 1993, ''American Top 40'' switched charts again, this time to the ''Billboard'' [[Top 40 Mainstream]] chart. This chart had more mainstream hits but fewer urban, dance and rap songs.\n\nAT40 did not always use the official year-end Billboard chart during the 25 years in which the show used Billboard charts. In 1972, 1973 and 1977, as well as 1980-1984 and  1990-1994, AT40 compiled its own year-end chart. These charts were often close to Billboard's, but AT40 would use a mid-December to early-December time period while Billboard's survey year varied from year to year. AT40 matched Billboard's #1 year-end song every year except 1977, 1984, 1990 and 1993.\n\n===''Radio & Records'' magazine===\nWith the show's revival in 1998, a new chart was implemented, the top 40 portion of ''Radio and Records'' CHR/Pop top 50 chart, which was already in use on ''Casey's Top 40''. This chart used a [[recurrent rotation|recurrent rule]] that removed songs below #25 that had exceeded 26 weeks in the top 50; these removals, if they occurred in the top 40, would be reflected on the appropriate week's program. In 1999, the rule was modified to further restrict long chart runs: songs falling below #20 with at least 20 weeks in the top 50 would now be removed.\n\nOn October 21, 2000, ''American Top 40'' began using an unpublished chart on a weekly basis for the first time in its history. The chart seemed to be a variant of the CHR/Pop chart provided by [[Mediabase]], the data provider to ''Radio & Records''. The most noticeable feature of this new chart was its ambiguous recurrent rule. Songs would be removed regularly from within the top 15, seemingly regardless of the number of weeks they had spent on the chart. Additionally, the chart has resulted in songs that otherwise peaked at #41-50 on R&R's charts appearing on the ''AT40'' charts. This chart lasted until August 11, 2001, when AT40 returned to the ''Radio & Records'' pop chart. The return coincided with another modification in the recurrent rule; songs would be removed below #25 after three consecutive weeks without a bullet (an increase in radio plays). This change would be short-lived, as in November 2001, ''Radio & Records'' returned to the 20 weeks/below #20 rule, which remained in place for the remainder of Kasem's tenure.\n\n== Spin-off programming ==\n===Adult Contemporary countdowns===\n{{main|American Top 20}}\nWhen Casey Kasem joined what was then AMFM Radio Networks, he had been doing two weekly countdowns for adult contemporary formatted stations. Both of these shows would find a home with him at his new syndicator and were rebranded once he joined. Both shows took the name ''American Top 20'' and launched the same weekend as Kasem's new ''AT40''. He would concurrently host both shows with ''AT40'' until he handed the show over to Ryan Seacrest in January 2004, then continue as host of the AC countdowns until he retired in 2009. After Kasem retired, the Hot AC ''American Top 20'' and the Adult Contemporary ''American Top 10'' were discontinued.\n\n===Television spinoff===\n{{main|America's Top 10}}\n\nFrom 1980 to 1992, a [[music video|video]] version of the show entitled [[America's Top 10]] was aired in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] to television stations across the United States. Kasem hosted this version from 1980 to 1989. When Kasem left ''American Top 40'' in 1988, he remained as host of ''America's Top 10'' until the end of 1989, when he would be replaced by [[Siedah Garrett]] and later [[Tommy Puett]]. Kasem returned by 1991, and the show ran until 1992.\n\n===Other formats===\nBased on the success of ''American Top 40'', Kasem and Don Bustany created a spinoff top 40 countdown for Watermark for Country Radio called ''[[American Country Countdown]]'', patterned after Kasem's program. \"ACC\" premiered in 1973, and was hosted by [[Don Bowman (singer)|Don Bowman]] until 1978, then by [[Bob Kingsley]] until 2005 when [[Kix Brooks]] of the late country music duo [[Brooks & Dunn]] took over, and has been doing so since. Kingsley later moved to another program, ''[[Bob Kingsley's Country Top 40|Country Top 40]]'' (abbreviating, not coincidentally, as \"CT40\"), which follows the same format as AT40 and ACC; Kingsley died in 2019. Both ACC and CT40 remain on the air, ACC on [[Westwood One]] and CT40 syndicated by [[Hubbard Broadcasting]].\n\nAfter Kasem left ABC, the network launched ''American Gold'', a spinoff oldies countdown (featuring far fewer songs, and often focusing on a particular artist) hosted by [[Dick Bartley]]. American Gold's last show aired at the end of March 2009, replaced with another show hosted by Bartley for [[United Stations Radio Networks]], ''[[Classic Countdown]]''.\n\nThe American Top 40 format was adapted in an Australian show titled ''[[Take 40 Australia]]'', similarly counting down the top 40 songs in the country.\n\n==Censorship, offensive songs and affiliate standards==\nCasey Kasem and Watermark's policy regarding putting ''American Top 40'' together was to always play the forty most popular songs in the United States and never to ban a record from the countdown. However, whenever songs with potentially offensive lyrical content made the top 40, Watermark would send out memos to affiliated stations alerting them of the presence of that song in the countdown and sometimes provide stations with suggestions on how to edit the song out of their ''AT40'' broadcasts.\n\n===Offensive content===\nThe first song to receive this advisory was in April and May 1971, with a spoken word piece, \"[[The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley]]\", by [[Terry Nelson (musician)|Terry Nelson]] and C-Company.<ref>Durkee, p. 66.</ref><ref>[http://www.oldradioshows.com/at40/042471.html ''oldradioshows.com: Casey Kasem's American Top 40, 4/24/71'']. Retrieved on November 26, 2008. This song would chart in the high-30s for four weeks, dropping out after May 15, 1971.</ref> Some more well-known songs which received this treatment included \"[[Kodachrome (song)|Kodachrome]]\" by [[Paul Simon]], \"[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]\" by [[The Police]], \"[[Ain't Love a Bitch]]\" by [[Rod Stewart]], and \"[[Paradise by the Dashboard Light]]\" by [[Meatloaf (singer)|Meat Loaf]].\n\nPerhaps the most infamous of these songs was [[Chuck Berry]]'s number-one hit \"[[My Ding-a-Ling]]\", which put some stations in the odd position of having to air ''AT40'' without playing the number one song; at least one station, [[KTBZ (AM)|KELI]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], censored out the song at its #1 position, replacing it with a message from station management, explaining why they chose to censor the program.<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (p.70). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> The censorship of this song continued even into the twenty-first century; some stations, such as [[WOGL]] in [[Philadelphia]], replaced this song with an optional extra when it aired a rerun of the November 18, 1972, broadcast (where it ranked at #14)<ref>[http://www.oldradioshows.com/at40/111872.html oldradioshows.com: \"American Top 40, 11/18/1972\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104013312/http://www.oldradioshows.com/at40/111872.html |date=January 4, 2009 }} Retrieved on December 8, 2008.</ref> on December 6, 2008.\n\nIn the summer of 1977, radio station [[KSTZ|KRNQ]] in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], edited out \"[[The Killing of Georgie]]\" by Rod Stewart, because of the subject matter of a homosexual being murdered; that song peaked at #30 on the countdown.\n\nIn 1978, when Billy Joel's \"[[Only the Good Die Young]]\" (wherein Joel urged pre-marital sex by a teen Catholic girl, Virginia) was on the charts, AT40 had placed warnings in shipments to warn affiliates in highly Catholic populated areas along with a special break in the countdown for stations to substitute another song in its place. The affiliates usually used the suggestion, though some did not and no major complaints were ever heard. (Many of these memos have been reprinted in Pete Battistini's book, \"American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s\".)\n\nIn situations where a charting song contained offensive language and the record company was unable to provide AT40 with a clean edit of the song, the producers would often make an edit themselves. Such was a case with [[Bob Dylan]]'s Top 40 single, \"[[George Jackson (song)|George Jackson]]\", which peaked at #33 in January 1972 and appeared for two weeks on AT40. The offensive lyric in the song was, \"He wouldn't take [[shit]] from no one.\" To rectify the problem, AT40 engineer Bill Hergonson edited the lyric, which was now heard as \"He wouldn't take ''it'' from no one.\"<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.54\u201355). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> A similar situation occurred again in July 1975, when [[The Isley Brothers]]' ''[[Fight the Power (Part 1 & 2)|Fight the Power]]'' was in the Top 40, but in this case, the substitute version provided by the group's label was unsuitable, resorting to the engineer to substitute grunts and extra drum beats over the offending parts of the original record. However, this was not before AT40 erroneously played the uncensored version (with the lyric \"...{{nbsp}}by all this bullshit goin' down\") the first two weeks on the chart, on the July 12 and 19, 1975 editions.<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.152\u2013154). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref>\n\nSongs with offensive words in their titles were often censored for radio airplay, and is reflected in their inclusion on AT40. In 2011, three such songs have made it to the #1 position on AT40: \"[[Fuck You (CeeLo Green song)|Fuck You]]\" by [[CeeLo Green]] (changed to \"Forget You\"), \"[[Fuckin' Perfect]]\" by [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] (changed to \"Perfect\"), and \"[[Tonight (I'm Lovin' You)|Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)]]\" by [[Enrique Iglesias]] (changed to \"Tonight (I'm Lovin' You)\"). Other notable songs included \"[[Niggas in Paris]]\" by [[Jay-Z]] & [[Kanye West]] (becoming \"In Paris\", peaking at #5), \"[[Ass Back Home]]\" by [[Gym Class Heroes]] (became \"Get Yourself Back Home\", peaking at #12), \"[[I Don't Fuck With You]]\" by [[Big Sean]] featuring [[E-40]] (became \"I Don't Mess With You,\" peaking at #34), \"[[Fuck U Betta]]\" by [[Neon Hitch]] (becoming \"Love U Betta\" and peaking at #29; this song was also first played in [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s ''Fresh Buzz Song of the Week'').{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 2000, \"Sexual (Li Da Di)\" by [[Amber (singer)|Amber]] and \"[[The Bad Touch]]\" by [[Bloodhound Gang]] debuted on AT40 without any censorship despite both songs' context referring to sexual activity. The songs peaked at #25 and #21 respectively. That same year, the show also used a slightly suggestive version of [[soulDecision]]'s \"[[Faded (soulDecision song)|Faded]]\" (which peaked at #6), despite a more radio-friendly version of the song being available.\n\nIn 2015, [[The Chainsmokers]]'s \"[[Roses (The Chainsmokers song)|Roses]]\" (feat. ROZES), [[Travis Scott (musician)|Travis Scott]]'s \"[[Antidote (Travis Scott song)|Antidote]]\", [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]]'s \"[[New Americana]]\", and [[Alessia Cara]]'s \"[[Here (Alessia Cara song)|Here]]\" had been edited by censoring one of their chorus in the lyrics dealt with [[Prohibition of drugs|prohibited drugs]]. In 2018, [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]]'s \"[[Young Dumb & Broke]]\" was similarly censored, with the lyric \"I'm so high at the moment\" being completely edited out of the song due to references to drugs. However, on some versions of the show, the lyric was not censored.\n\nIn 2017, [[Jason Derulo]]'s \"[[Swalla]]\" (feat. [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Ty Dolla $ign]]) also had its chorus heavily censored due to the context of the title referring to [[oral sex]]. However, the title of the song was announced without being censored, presumably due to the fact that Ty Dolla $ign uses the title lyric to refer to drinking during his verse in the song.\n\nIn 2018, [[N.E.R.D]] and [[Rihanna]]'s \"[[Lemon (N.E.R.D and Rihanna song)|Lemon]]\" was significantly edited. An alternate version of the song was played, which had the final two verses of the song played on loop. This is presumably to remove the first two verses, in which the lyrics included highly charged political issues such as [[immigration]], [[racism]] and anti-[[Donald Trump]] sentiments.\n\nIn 2019, the chorus of [[Fletcher (singer)|Fletcher]]'s \"[[Undrunk]]\" was edited due to lyrics about masturbation.\n\n===Unannounced titles===\nAlthough Kasem never banned a ''song'' from the countdown, there was at least one instance in which both Kasem and his guest host, Charlie Van Dyke, refused to announce the ''title'' of a song on his show. When [[George Michael]]'s \"[[I Want Your Sex]]\" hit the Billboard charts in the summer of 1987, Kasem and Van Dyke refused to announce the name of the song; only its artist (e.g., \"George Michael's latest hit is up five notches this week{{nbsp}}...\"). Also, as had been done with previous controversial hits, because of the song's suggestiveness, the show's structure was altered slightly, so stations could opt out of the song. This pattern was also evident during the 1987 Year End countdown. The song title was mentioned five times during its chart run (June 20, 1987; June 27, 1987; April 7, 1987; December 9, 1987, and September 19, 1987), during the week-ending episode of September 26, 1987, when it dropped out of the Top 40, and during the Top 100 of 1987 show; Shadoe Stevens, his successor, however did mention the title on the show from July 31, 1993, as part of the Flashback feature, as it was in the top 5 from that week in 1987. In the spring of 1991, when \"[[People Are Still Having Sex]]\" by [[LaTour]] and \"[[I Wanna Sex You Up]]\" by [[Color Me Badd]] debuted the same week, their titles were announced in full.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nAnother song that had its title unannounced after its first week was \"[[Me So Horny]]\" by [[2 Live Crew]], in the fall of 1989 (the Shadoe Stevens era). It was mentioned twice at the beginning of the song, and back announced once, its debut week. For the rest of its chart run, the title was never again mentioned. When [[2 Live Crew]] returned to the top 40 in the Summer of 1990, with \"[[Banned in the U.S.A. (song)|Banned in the U.S.A.]]\", Shadoe did mention that it was the follow-up to \"[[Me So Horny]]\". The song did come with edit out instructions for stations as well. Other songs around that time with edit out warnings were \"[[The Humpty Dance]]\" by [[The Digital Underground]], and \"[[Tic Tac Toe]]\" by Kyper.\n\nIn 2018, \"[[God is a Woman]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] had its title not mentioned and its chorus edited in some airings of the show in some Middle Eastern countries, presumably due to religious beliefs; despite this some radio stations such as Hi FM in Oman play the song in its entirety during normal programming.\n\n===Lengthy songs and double-sided hits===\nVery rarely was a song on that week's chart excluded from that week's AT40, if so only due to time considerations\u2014on an edition that aired the weekend of December 19, 1970, [[The Guess Who]]'s \"[[Share the Land]]\", which ranked at #30 that week, was omitted from AT40, in order to play both sides of that week's #1 [[Double A-side]] hit, [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\" / \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\".<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (p.23). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref> Normally when a Double A-side appears on the charts, one side is played one week, with the other played the next week, alternating each week as long as it was in the Top 40. Similar omissions occurred in February 1974 when both the [[Gordon Sinclair]] and [[Byron MacGregor]] versions of ''[[The Americans (commentary)|The Americans]]'' simultaneously hit the Top 40; in each case, only one version was played each week alternately.\n\n[[Don McLean]]'s 1971 hit ''[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]'', which was 8:33 long, was split into two segments for the single release. When the song aired on AT40, each part was played alternately, with the entire song played when it reached #1.\n\nIn early 2013, [[Justin Timberlake]]'s single \"[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]\" had to be edited for time, as the song is over eight minutes long.\n\n===Remixes and alternate versions of charted songs===\nOn several occasions, the show would play remixed versions of charted songs. Notable examples included [[Enya]]'s \"[[Only Time]]\", [[LeAnn Rimes]]' \"[[Can't Fight the Moonlight]]\", [[Mikaila]]'s \"So\nIn Love With Two\", [[Whitney Houston]]'s \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\" and \"[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]\" among others.\n\nIn 2001 and 2002, AT40 played the original versions of [[Joe (singer)|Joe]]'s \"[[Stutter (Joe song)|Stutter]]\", [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s \"[[I'm Real (Jennifer Lopez song)|I'm Real]]\" and [[Samantha Mumba]]'s \"[[Baby, Come Over (This Is Our Night)|Baby Come on Over]]\", in which airplay was given for remixed versions of each song.\n\nIn 2019, AT40 played the original version of [[Lil Nas X]]\u2019s \u201c[[Old Town Road]]\u201d, despite the remix version with Billy Ray Cyrus receiving airplay.\n\n===Disco and rap===\nAs has been mentioned previously, many rock radio stations in the late 1970s adopted anti-[[disco]] stances, and this, too, was reflected in the way some affiliates edited ''AT40''. For example, one 1979 show featured a story about disco saving New York; again, the show was structured so that anti-disco stations could edit the story out of the show. (Notably, Kasem ended the monologue with the prediction that \"disco is here to stay,\" which was proven false in short order, as disco rapidly fell out of fashion by 1980.)\n\nMore famously, on the weekend of July 7\u20138, 1979, [[Cleveland]], Ohio AT40 affiliate [[WNCX|WGCL]] (now [[WNCX]]), instead of carrying the \"American Top 40 Top 40 Disco Songs\" special because of being an anti-disco radio station, did its own version of ''American Top 40'' using the July 7, 1979 Billboard chart as the source with [[Townsend Coleman]] handling the hosting duties for Casey Kasem. The special Cleveland-only ''American Top 40'' episode did not feature the ''AT40'' Archives, extras, or Long Distance Dedications \u2013 just the top 40 singles of that week, which was preceded by a recap of the previous week's top three. Because the station did not have disco songs in the playlist, and the top 40 that week had several disco songs, WGCL had to reach outside its library to find copies of some of the songs, some of which were not the single versions; \"Hot Stuff\" and \"Bad Girls\" by [[Donna Summer]], the songs occupying the #3 and #2 spots on the Billboard chart for that week respectively, were conveniently available as a [[12-inch single|12-inch]] medley, which Coleman used for the show. Through clever editing, Coleman also took the \"Casey's Coast to Coast\" jingle (pronounced \"K-C's Coast to Coast\") and spliced in a \"T,\" to provide an appropriate \"TC's Coast to Coast\" jingle. Kasem himself did not learn about the deception until 1996, laughing the whole thing off by saying, \"Maybe I don't ''want'' to hear it!\"\n\nColeman's sleight-of-hand was actually the ''second'' time a version of the ''AT40'' had aired that was not quite on the up and up. According to Rob Durkee's book \"American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century\", Dave Morgan of WDHF (now [[WEBG]]) in Chicago ghosted an edition of the program sometime in the summer of 1975. When the station's copy of the show did not arrive in time, he used ''Billboard''{{'}}s list and merely played the records, apparently heavily implying that the show was ''American Top 40'' without actually identifying it as such. \"My program director made me do it!\" Morgan said years later. The following year, WDHF would refuse to play AT40's \"Fourth of July's Greatest Hits\" special, due to the special's overabundance of #1 hits from the pre-rock era. But while the special was a stark departure from the contemporary sound of the 1970s, Tom Rounds in his press release reminded stations that it was the United States' \"one and only bicentennial.\"<ref>''American Top 40 with Casey Kasem: The 1970s'', by Pete Battistini (pp.175). Bloomington, Indiana: Author House, 2004.</ref>\n\nFrom 1992 to 1994, two radio stations still carrying ''American Top 40'' had to carry customized versions of the show. [[WPLJ]] in New York City aired the show with the urban/dance/rap songs mentioned but not played and were replaced here and there by [[Hot Adult Contemporary]]-leaning extras. [[KUBE (FM)|KUBE]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, aired AT40 with a few songs that did not fit the station's Top 40 Rhythm format omitted each week. It has also been reported that [[WSTR (FM)|WSTR]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], being an anti-rap station and a very Adult Contemporary-leaning CHR, edited \"[[Another Night (Real McCoy song)|Another Night]]\" by [[Real McCoy (band)|Real McCoy]] (a [[Euro disco]] record with rap breaks) out of its broadcasts of ''Casey's Top 40'' in 1994, even while the song was at #1 on the show (which used the Radio & Records CHR/Pop chart).\n\n==Special Countdowns==\nOccasionally ''American Top 40'' airs special countdowns in place of the regular ''American Top 40'' countdown show. These included<sup>1</sup>:\n* \"Top 40 Recording Acts of the Rock Era 1955\u20131971\" (Weekend of May 1\u20132, 1971)\n* \"Top 40 Christmas Songs\" (Weekend of December 25\u201326, 1971)\n* \"Top 40 Songs of the Rock Era 1955\u20131972\" (weekend of July 1\u20132, 1972)\n* \"Top 40 Albums of the Week\" (weekend of August 5\u20136, 1972)\n* \"Top 40 Artists from Sept 1, 1967, to Sept 1, 1972\" (weekend of September 30 \u2013 October 1, 1972)\n* \"Top 40 Songs from March 1968 to March 1973\" (weekend of April 7\u20138, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Disappearing Acts\" (weekend of July 7\u20138, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Recording Acts of the Rock Era 1955\u20131973\" (weekend of October 6\u20137, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Christmas Songs\" (weekend of December 22\u201323, 1973)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of British Artists 1955\u20131974\" (weekend of April 6\u20137, 1974)\n* \"Top 40 Acts of the 1970s, So Far\" (weekend of July 6\u20137, 1974)\n* \"Top 10 Producers of the 1970s\" (weekend of October 5\u20136, 1974)\n* \"Top 40 Disappearing Acts\" (weekend of April 1\u20132, 1975)\n* \"Top 40 Rock 'n' Roll Acts of the 1950s\" (weekend of October 4\u20135, 1975)\n* \"Bicentennial Special: #1 July 4 Songs of the Past 40 Years\" (weekend of July 3\u20134, 1976)\n* \"Top 40 Songs of the 'Beatle Years'[1964\u20131970]\" (weekend of October 2\u20133, 1976)\n* \"Top 40 Girls of the Rock Era 1955\u20131977\" (weekend of July 2\u20133, 1977)\n* \"Top 40 Movie Songs 1960\u20131978\" (weekend of Apr 4\u20135, 1978)\n* \"Top 40 Acts of the 1970s, So Far\" (weekend of Jul 1\u20132, 1978)\n* \"The Top 40 Songs of the Disco Era 1974\u20131979\" (weekend of July 7\u20138, 1979)\n* \"The Top 50 Songs of the 1970s\" (weekend of January 5\u20136, 1980)\n* \"AT40 Book of Records\" (weekend of July 5\u20136, 1980)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of the Beatles: Together and Apart\" (weekend of July 4\u20135, 1981)\n* \"Top 40 Acts of the 1980s, So Far\" (weekend of July 2\u20133, 1983)\n* \"Giants of Rock\" (weekend of July 5\u20136, 1986)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of the 1980s, So Far\" (weekend of July 4\u20135, 1987)\n* \"Top 40 Newcomers of the 1980s, So Far\" (weekend of May 30\u201331, 1988)\n* \"Triathlon of Rock 'n Roll\" (weekend of July 4\u20135, 1988)\n* \"World Tour\" (weekend of May 27\u201329, 1989)\n* \"AT40 Book of Records, 1980s Edition\" (weekend of August 31 \u2013 September 4, 1989)\n* \"Top 40 American Acts of the Previous 10 Years\" (weekend of July 1\u20132, 1991)\n* \"Top 40 Hits of the Past Decade\" (weekend of January 2\u20133, 2010)\n* \"Top 40 Songs of the Decade\u201d (weekend of December 28-29, 2019)\n\n===Annual Countdowns===\nThe top songs of the year are counted down near the turning of each year, though the format has varied over the years.\n\n*'''Top 40 (over 1 week)''': 1971, 1973, 1999, 2010-present*\n*'''Top 50 (over 1 week)''': 1979, 1994\n*'''Top 80 (over 2 weeks)''': 1970, 1972\n*'''Top 100 (over 2 weeks)''': 1974-78, 1980\u201383, 1992, 1998, 2000\u201309\n*'''Top 100 (over 1 week)''': 1984-91, 1993\n\nDuring the show's original run, the 2-week Top 100 programs came with special instructions for editing the show into one 8-hour block. Conversely, the 1-week Top 100 programs came with instructions to split the show into two 4-hour blocks.\n\nIn 1971 and 1973, only the top 40 was counted down due to AT40's Top 40 Christmas Countdowns which aired the week prior. The show did not air Christmas countdowns again until the spinoff shows \"American Top 20\" and \"American Top 10\" came into existence, as both of these spinoffs aired a \"Top 60 Christmas Songs\" special annually the two weeks immediately preceding Christmas.\n\nIn 1994, the show was no longer airing in the US, and would be put on hiatus a month later.\n\nSince 2010, the show has aired the same Top 40 year-end chart two weeks in a row, with the only differences being the optional AT40 Extras and re-cut announcements mentioning the [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]] (which Seacrest also hosts) as a past event instead of an upcoming event. An exception to this was in 2019 when the year-end chart was aired only on the weekend before Christmas, due to the decade-end chart airing the following weekend, with the normal chart resuming the first weekend of January.\n\n===Decade-End Countdowns===\nIn 1979, 1999, 2009 and 2019, the show aired special countdowns of the decade's biggest hits. In 1979 and 1999, the annual year-end countdown show was cut to one week (4 hours) to accommodate the special countdown, though in 2009, they aired a third special week after their usual two-week Top 100. The decade-end shows counted down the Top 50 of the 1970s, and the Top 40s of the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. There was no decade-end countdown for the 1980s.\n\n==Substitute hosts==\nOver 50 celebrities\u2014among them radio personalities, game show hosts, and (particularly since Ryan Seacrest took over hosting duties) charting artists\u2014have substituted for these three throughout the show's run. Radio announcer [[Charlie Van Dyke]] filled in for Casey a record 31 times in the 1980s.<ref>Durkee, p. 144.</ref>\n\nSubstitutes for Ryan Seacrest have included:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Christina Aguilera]]\n* [[Kris Allen]]\n* [[Adam Lambert]]\n* [[Pamela Anderson]]\n* [[Nick Cannon]]\n* [[Steve Carell]]\n* [[Kelly Clarkson]]\n* [[Miley Cyrus]]\n* [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]\n* [[Gavin DeGraw]]\n* [[Hilary Duff]]\n* [[Brody Jenner]]\n* [[Nick Lachey]]\n* [[Mario Lopez]]\n* [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]]\n* [[Paul Doucette]]\n* [[Jesse McCartney]]\n* [[Mandy Moore]]\n* [[Katy Perry]]\n* [[Sean Combs|P.

However with the help of smaller media companies including Cherry Creek Media ([[Northwestern United States]]), Forever Media ([[Delmarva]]), Ingstad Radio Group ([[the Dakotas]]), and Bicostal Media ([[Pacific Northwest]]), AT40 can be heard in smaller cities and towns. In the United States alone, AT40 is heard in more than 380 stations.

(The aforementioned ''The Americans'', along with [[Les Crane]]'s 1971 spoken word hit ''[[Desiderata]]'', both had instrumental music playing in the background.)\n* The #1 song of the 1970s was \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" by [[Debby Boone]].\n* The #1 song of the 1980s was \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\" by [[The Police]], as canonized by Ryan Seacrest during the 2000s decade-end chart (and repeated during the 2010s decade-end show), since AT40 did not have a 1980s decade-end show. The #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 (which AT40 was using in 1989) was \"[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]\" by [[Olivia Newton-John]], but whether AT40 would have used that chart, or their own compilation (as they sometimes did) is unknown.\n* The #1 song of the 1990s was \"[[I Love You Always Forever]]\" by [[Donna Lewis]].\n* The #1 song of the 2000s was \"[[Yeah!

In its original recording, the song's lyrics are entirely in German, though the show would sometimes play a mix that omitted the verses in favor of a timeline (narrated in English) of the life of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].\n* In July 2018, \"[[Mine (Bazzi song)|Mine]]\" by [[Bazzi (singer)|Bazzi]] became the shortest song at 2:13 to reach #1.\n* In 2019, [[Lil Nas X]]\u2019s \"[[Old Town Road]]\" became the shortest song on the chart at 1:53.\n* Also in 2019, [[Billie Eilish]] became the first artist to be born in the 2000s to have a number 1 song with \"[[Bad Guy (Billie Eilish song)|Bad Guy]]\".\n\n==References==\n* Durkee, Rob.

{"title_page": "Hermann Niebuhr", "text_new": "'''Hermann Niebuhr''' is a [[South African people|South African]] [[artist]] who lives in [[Johannesburg]].  He utilizes oils on canvas in a classical painterly style to document urban decay as well as rural landscapes.\n\n[[Image:HOMAGE joburg cityscape.jpg|thumb|''Homage'', a Johannesburg cityscape by Hermann Niebuhr]]\n \nNiebuhr was born in Johannesburg in 1972. He studied at [[Rhodes University]], [[Grahamstown]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (with distinction in History of Art) in 1993.\n\nHe spent six years in the arid region of South Africa known as the [[Karoo]]. Working from the small town of [[De Rust]], Niebuhr isolated himself and developed his technique.  Upon his return to his hometown of Johannesburg in 2002, he began to confront the challenges of living and making art in one of Africa's largest and politically most complex cities.\n\nIn ''Night Ride Home'' (2005), Niebuhr told the story of a young man from the northern suburbs driving past blurring lights on his way to a safe haven.\n\nNiebuhr's exhibition ''Night Shift'' (2008) brought him to the heart of the city. Armed with only a camera, he entered neighborhoods such as Hillbrow which had most dramatically shifted from [[Art Deco]] affluence in the mid-to-late 20th century to poverty and crime in the early 21st.  Niebuhr photographed the foyers of the lovely old buildings and then painted them in oils, taking the perspective of the (somewhat symbolic) security guards protecting the edifices and their residents.  These accurate and objective paintings, unpeopled but resonant with history, create a sense of melancholy around the city's decline.\n\nNiebuhr delved into Johannesburg's history as a gold-mining boomtown for ''mine'', a show un-ironically exhibited at the AshantiGold Gold of Africa Museum, sponsored by Africa's largest mining company.  For this series of monochromatic paintings, Niebuhr sourced photos of the mine dumps surrounding Johannesburg\u2014piles of gold dust and mining dregs which are as large as man-made pyramids and dominate the landscapes of Johannesburg's outlying areas.\n\n''White Painting'', a solo exhibition at the historic Casa Labia in Muizenberg, Cape Town, offered round canvases as portholes into Johannesburg, as though Capetonians could see their faraway sister city only through the long end of a telescope.  These paintings, too, were mostly black and white.\n\n2012 brought Niebuhr his first solo show at the Everard Read Gallery Johannesburg.  In ''City Chromatic'' Niebuhr's mastery of his subject matter, the Johannesburg cityscape, allowed him to experiment with new painterly techniques.  In doing so, his previously monochromatic work gained new washes of ecstatic color as well as portions of paintings dripping and dissolving\u2014representing both Johannesburg's explosions of innovation as well as its flux and disorder.\n\nNiebuhr's 2013 exhibition, \"Stillness,\" documented his journeys by bicycle through the Swartberg Mountains and Die Hel in South Africa and the Himalayas in India.  Since \"cycling is the new horseback,\" as he told an interviewer, it sets the perfect pace for a landscape painter. The series is called \"Stillness\" because of the internal space that opens up inside of the viewer while regarding the open landscapes.\n\nNiebuhr currently divides his time between his studios in Fordsburg, Johannesburg, and De Rust in the Klein Karoo.\n\nSELECTED EXHIBITIONS\n\n2013<br />\nStillness, THE CANOPY GALLERY, Johannesburg<br />\nWeather Report, ARTKLOP, Potchefstroom\n\n2012<br />\nCity Chromatic, EVERARD READ, Johannesburg<br />\nMine, PART - Prince Albert Art Festival, Prince Albert<br />\nYoung Masters, JUPITER ART ROOM, Pretoria\n\n2011<br />\nHorse, EVERARD READ, Johannesburg\n\n2010<br />\nDecade, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg<br />\nWhite Painting, CASA LABIA, Cape Town<br />\nDue South, EVERARD READ GALLERY, Cape Town\n\n2009<br />\nMine, ASHANTIGOLD GOLD OF AFRICA MUSEUM, Johannesburg<br />\nBram Fischer Memorial, BRAMFISCHERVILLE COMMUNITY HALL/JOHANNESBURG DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, Johannesburg<br />\nThe Great South African Nude, EVERARD READ GALLERY, Johannesburg<br />\nChampagne for my Facebook Friends, THE CANOPY GALLERY, Johannesburg\n\n2008<br />\nSouth Africa Abroad, HODNETT FINE ART STUDIO GALLERY, Vancouver<br />\nNight Shift, THE CANOPY GALLERY, Johannesburg\n\n2007<br />\nAntarctica - On Thin Ice, UNITED NATIONS GALLERY, [[New York City]]\n\n2006<br />\nA Month of Sundays, GALLERY ON THE SQUARE, Johannesburg\n\n2005<br />\nNight Ride Home, ABSA GALLERY, Johannesburg\n\n2004<br />\nCity Berlin, JABLONSKI STRASSE STUDIO, Berlin<br />\nAn African in Ireland, ENNISKERRY GALLERY, Dublin<br />\nCelebrating 10 Years of Democracy, EVERARD READ GALLERY, Johannesburg<br />\nTown/Country, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg\n\n2003<br />\nJoburg Notes, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg<br />\nSedibeng Sa Limpho, SOAN STUDIO, London\n\n2002<br />\nInside-Out, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Cape Town<br />\nGroundings, THIRD EYE GALLERY, Cape Town\n\n2001<br />\nUp and Coming, SOAN STUDIO, London<br />\nSouth African Landscape, UNISA ART GALLERY, Pretoria<br />\nKaroo, BRONZE AGE FOUNDRY, Cape Town\n\n2000<br />\nTurning Heads, SOAN STUDIO, London<br />\nKaroo Scapes, OPEN WINDOW ART ACADEMY, Pretoria<br />\nSouth African Landscapes, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg\n\n1999<br />\nContemporary South African Landscapes, KLEIN KAROO KUNSETFEES, Oudtshoorn\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\nAbsa Bank; Webber Wentzel Bowens; KPMG; Sasol; Rhodes University; General Cologne; Rosengarten-Rosin & Wright; J.P.Morgan; SAB Miller; Nedcor; Clifford Chance UK, Modise Attorneys; Ashanti Gold; Novocol.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*De Vries, Fred.

It resulted in a beautiful, almost dreamlike overview at the Absa Gallery, full of blurred visions and shattered lights, a kind of Edward Hopper for the 21st century.  The new paintings seem to go even deeper. \u201cAs your language develops you're able to describe more authentically the things you can see,\" says Niebuhr. \u201cThat's what I'm doing now.

He utilizes oils on canvas in a classical painterly style to document urban decay as well as rural landscapes.\n\n[[Image:HOMAGE joburg cityscape.jpg|thumb|''Homage'', a Johannesburg cityscape by Hermann Niebuhr]]\n \nNiebuhr was born in Johannesburg in 1972. He studied at [[Rhodes University]], [[Grahamstown]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (with distinction in History of Art) in 1993.\n\nHe spent six years in the arid region of South Africa known as the [[Karoo]]. Working from the small town of [[De Rust]], Niebuhr isolated himself and developed his technique.  Upon his return to his hometown of Johannesburg in 2002, he began to confront the challenges of living and making art in one of Africa's largest and politically most complex cities.\n\nIn ''Night Ride Home'' (2005), Niebuhr told the story of a young man from the northern suburbs driving past blurring lights on his way to a safe haven.\n\nNiebuhr's exhibition ''Night Shift'' (2008) brought him to the heart of the city. Armed with only a camera, he entered neighborhoods such as Hillbrow which had most dramatically shifted from [[Art Deco]] affluence in the mid-to-late 20th century to poverty and crime in the early 21st.  Niebuhr photographed the foyers of the lovely old buildings and then painted them in oils, taking the perspective of the (somewhat symbolic) security guards protecting the edifices and their residents.  These accurate and objective paintings, unpeopled but resonant with history, create a sense of melancholy around the city's decline.\n\nNiebuhr delved into Johannesburg's history as a gold-mining boomtown for ''mine'', a show un-ironically exhibited at the AshantiGold Gold of Africa Museum, sponsored by Africa's largest mining company.  For this series of monochromatic paintings, Niebuhr sourced photos of the mine dumps surrounding Johannesburg\u2014piles of gold dust and mining dregs which are as large as man-made pyramids and dominate the landscapes of Johannesburg's outlying areas.\n\n''White Painting'', a solo exhibition at the historic Casa Labia in Muizenberg, Cape Town, offered round canvases as portholes into Johannesburg, as though Capetonians could see their faraway sister city only through the long end of a telescope.  These paintings, too, were mostly black and white.\n\n2012 brought Niebuhr his first solo show at the Everard Read Gallery Johannesburg.  In ''City Chromatic'' Niebuhr's mastery of his subject matter, the Johannesburg cityscape, allowed him to experiment with new painterly techniques.  In doing so, his previously monochromatic work gained new washes of ecstatic color as well as portions of paintings dripping and dissolving\u2014representing both Johannesburg's explosions of innovation as well as its flux and disorder.\n\nNiebuhr's 2013 exhibition, \"Stillness,\" documented his journeys by bicycle through the Swartberg Mountains and Die Hel in South Africa and the Himalayas in India.  Since \"cycling is the new horseback,\" as he told an interviewer, it sets the perfect pace for a landscape painter. The series is called \"Stillness\" because of the internal space that opens up inside of the viewer while regarding the open landscapes.\n\nNiebuhr currently divides his time between his studios in Fordsburg, Johannesburg, and De Rust in the Klein Karoo.\n\nSELECTED EXHIBITIONS\n\n2013<br />\nStillness, THE CANOPY GALLERY, Johannesburg<br />\nWeather Report, ARTKLOP, Potchefstroom\n\n2012<br />\nCity Chromatic, EVERARD READ, Johannesburg<br />\nMine, PART - Prince Albert Art Festival, Prince Albert<br />\nYoung Masters, JUPITER ART ROOM, Pretoria\n\n2011<br />\nHorse, EVERARD READ, Johannesburg\n\n2010<br />\nDecade, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg<br />\nWhite Painting, CASA LABIA, Cape Town<br />\nDue South, EVERARD READ GALLERY, Cape Town\n\n2009<br />\nMine, ASHANTIGOLD GOLD OF AFRICA MUSEUM, Johannesburg<br />\nBram Fischer Memorial, BRAMFISCHERVILLE COMMUNITY HALL/JOHANNESBURG DEVELOPMENT AGENCY, Johannesburg<br />\nThe Great South African Nude, EVERARD READ GALLERY, Johannesburg<br />\nChampagne for my Facebook Friends, THE CANOPY GALLERY, Johannesburg\n\n2008<br />\nSouth Africa Abroad, HODNETT FINE ART STUDIO GALLERY, Vancouver<br />\nNight Shift, THE CANOPY GALLERY, Johannesburg\n\n2007<br />\nAntarctica - On Thin Ice, UNITED NATIONS GALLERY, [[New York City]]\n\n2006<br />\nA Month of Sundays, GALLERY ON THE SQUARE, Johannesburg\n\n2005<br />\nNight Ride Home, ABSA GALLERY, Johannesburg\n\n2004<br />\nCity Berlin, JABLONSKI STRASSE STUDIO, Berlin<br />\nAn African in Ireland, ENNISKERRY GALLERY, Dublin<br />\nCelebrating 10 Years of Democracy, EVERARD READ GALLERY, Johannesburg<br />\nTown/Country, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg\n\n2003<br />\nJoburg Notes, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg<br />\nSedibeng Sa Limpho, SOAN STUDIO, London\n\n2002<br />\nInside-Out, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Cape Town<br />\nGroundings, THIRD EYE GALLERY, Cape Town\n\n2001<br />\nUp and Coming, SOAN STUDIO, London<br />\nSouth African Landscape, UNISA ART GALLERY, Pretoria<br />\nKaroo, BRONZE AGE FOUNDRY, Cape Town\n\n2000<br />\nTurning Heads, SOAN STUDIO, London<br />\nKaroo Scapes, OPEN WINDOW ART ACADEMY, Pretoria<br />\nSouth African Landscapes, CAROL LEE FINE ART, Johannesburg\n\n1999<br />\nContemporary South African Landscapes, KLEIN KAROO KUNSETFEES, Oudtshoorn\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\nAbsa Bank; Webber Wentzel Bowens; KPMG; Sasol; Rhodes University; General Cologne; Rosengarten-Rosin & Wright; J.P.Morgan; SAB Miller; Nedcor; Clifford Chance UK, Modise Attorneys; Ashanti Gold; Novocol.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*De Vries, Fred.

The new paintings seem to go even deeper. \u201cAs your language develops you're able to describe more authentically the things you can see,\" says Niebuhr. \u201cThat's what I'm doing now.

Their plays and programs are designed to encourage and nurture young talent while broadening their awareness of culture, politics, aesthetics and the human condition. The role of parents and the community is a vital element of the SCTG philosophy and program.\n\nDescribed as \"smart theater for children\" by the Los Angeles Times,<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2005/oct/06/news/wk-cover6</ref> the SCTG continues to present productions which push the boundaries of traditional children's theater in terms of complex ideas, themes, characters and staging. Nearly all plays are original productions co-written by the students through its Writing Mentorship Program.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Silver Lake Children's Theatre Group <ref>http://silverlakechildrenstheatregroup.org/</ref> is the descendant of a theater company based at the Hollywood-Los Feliz Jewish Community Center (HLFJCC) in Silver Lake, California. The original company began in the mid-1990s and produced one spring play a year, usually a well-known Broadway musical. Productions included ''Guys And Dolls'', ''Fiddler On The Roof'' and ''The Music Man''. Loanne Hamrin and Trish Boyer helmed the group in the late 1990s, directly preceding the birth of the SCTG. Hamrin, a distinguished professional actress, brought her love of musicals and theatrical experience to her direction of the plays. Her good friend, Silver Lake architect Boyer, served as Assistant Director and together they choreographed and produced the plays. In the spring of 2000, their final production, ''Show Crazy'' was an original vehicle about \"a-small-theater-company-who-could\", which allowed Hamrin and Boyer to feature some of their favorite Broadway songs. [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566850/ Mark McCracken] <ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566850/</ref> and [[Broderick Miller]] a local actor/comedian and a screenwriter respectively, co-authored the play.\n\nHamrin announced her retirement from the theatre group following ''Show Crazy'' and with no one to direct the plays, the program was in danger of shutting down. [[Broderick Miller|Miller]], a member of the HLFJCC board, volunteered to helm the theatre group for no fee because his six-year-old daughter, Izzy, had such a great experience performing in ''Show Crazy.''\n\nThe timing was serendipitous. Just a few weeks earlier, Miller had taken his young daughters to a performance of ''Babes In Toyland'' at the [[Alex Theatre]] <ref>http://www.alextheatre.org/</ref> in Glendale, California and he was appalled at how pandering the show was to its young audience. The thought crossed his mind, \"if I ever ran a children's theatre group, we would do smart shows.\" So when the children's theatre opportunity presented itself a few weeks later, he felt the call.\n\nAlthough Miller was the godson of Academy Award-winning actor [[Broderick Crawford]], he found a mentor and second father in British stage and film director [[Lindsay Anderson]]. As a result, Miller was schooled in Anderson's primary influences, Anton Chekhov, Bertolt Brecht, Jean Vigo, Humphrey Jennings and U.S. filmmaker John Ford. \"Sentiment without sentimentality\" was Anderson's creative mantra which Miller brought to the SCTG along with his own love for the works of John Irving, David Mamet, Tennessee Williams, Tom Stoppard and Edward Albee. Miller's plays were unusual for a children's theatre company because they featured sophisticated adult-like dialogue while tackling humanist and provocative themes.\n\nMiller wrote and directed the first play under his stewardship, a comedy-musical titled ''Stay Awake!'' in the spring of 2001. The whimsical story centered on Paula, a 12-year-old girl too busy watching TV and playing video games to read books. Events sweep her into a world where each land is represented by a different classic book. Tracy wanders through 14 book \"lands\" ''(Little Women'', ''Moby Dick'', ''Harry Potter'', ''The Grapes of Wrath'', ''Dracula'', ''Eloise'', etc.), encountering the colorful characters from each story. While searching for a way home, she also discovers the joys of literature. Each scene also featured a contemporary song which commented on the action. These ranged from Heidi singing \"River Deep, Mountain High\" to Mary Poppins losing in love and singing \"Nothing Compares 2U.\"\n\nThe show was popular and the success emboldened Miller and his creative partners [http://www.briandavis.com/ Brian Davis], [http://sandisilbertdesign.com/ Sandi Silbert] and [http://silverlakechildrenstheatregroup.org/about-the-sctg/who-we-are Mark Feldman], to create the Silver Lake Children's Theatre Group as an official 501(c) 3 non-profit theatre company. Within two years the SCTG expanded to two productions a year (fall and spring) and continue to this day offering complex and challenging productions for kids. The SCTG believes that children respond to smart material and sees its productions as a means for its young actors and writers to explore the human condition while building community.\n\n===Theater Productions===\n\nEach year the SCTG presents spring and fall productions generated from original material created within the company. The shows widely vary in their genres and staging, ranging from dramas and comedies to musicals and cabaret. Themes are equally divergent and typically explore how a teenager relates to the world and how the world relates to them. \"The quintessential SCTG play,\" says Miller, \"is a search for wisdom with bittersweet results.\"\nIn addition to exploring provocative themes, the SCTG pursues unique methods of staging. In their comedy ''Dumb White Crackers'', for example, the cast was required to learn every role in the show. Just before the show went on, the audience randomly selected which actors would play which roles. Not only was this a powerful exercise in trust and commitment, but the experience tightly bonded the cast. Similar experimental shows include ''Havana'' (\"living theatre\" - where the audience follows the actors from room to room throughout the play.); ''Love and Hate'' (the play was first presented as a comedy; then at intermission the audience took seats on stage while the cast performed exactly the same play as a comedy in the seats); ''Teatro Della Morte'' <ref>http://www.teatrodellamorte.blogspot.com/,</ref>(a cabaret-like show performed in a circus tent inspired by the professional Seattle-based troupe [http://zinzanni.com/seattle/ Teatro Zinzanni] \u2013 whose performers actually conducted a workshop with SCTG students); and several others.\n\nAll plays written and directed by Broderick Miller except where indicated.\n\n2001 ''Stay Awake!''\n\n2001 ''O Lucky Girl!''\n\n2002 ''Cheyenne'' (original play written by Liz Tucillo, adapted for children's theatre by Broderick Miller)\n\n2003 ''The Puzzle People''\n\n2003 ''Spamelot'' (written by Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones & Michael Palin; adapted by Broderick Miller)\n\n2004 ''Attack of the Killer Kids''\n\n2005 ''The Community Producers'' \n \n2005 ''Buy America'' (written by Phoebe Minette & Broderick Miller)\n\n2005 ''The Rocke'' (written by Ivy Hammond and Broderick Miller)\n\n2005 ''The Window''\n\n2006 ''Killing Time at the Rothrottens'' (written and directed by Mark McCracken)\n\n2006 ''Free Will'' (written by Phoebe Minette & Broderick Miller)\n\n2006 ''Thunderboard'' (written by Robert Goldberg & Broderick Miller/directed by Montana Mills)\n\n2006 ''Love And Hate'' (written by Lindsey Horowitz & Broderick Miller)\n\n2007 ''Evil Schmeevil'' (written and directed by Mark McCracken)\n\n2007 ''Havana'' (written by Robert Goldberg, Lindsey Horowitz, Phoebe Minette, Tess Whittlesey & Broderick Miller)\n\n2007 ''Turbulence'' (written by Olivia Russin & Broderick Miller/directed by Ellie Bensinger)\n\n2007 ''Dumb White Crackers''\n\n2008 ''Teatro Della Morte'' (written by Ellie Bensinger & Broderick Miller)\n\n2008 ''Hellth Care'' (written by Riley Smith & Broderick Miller/directed by Olivia Russin)\n\n2008 ''The Color and the Noise''\n\n2009 ''The Rogues''\n\n2009 ''Significant Others'' (written and directed by Mark McCracken)\n\n2009 ''Jackpot'' (written by Josie Glore & Broderick Miller / directed by Libe Barer & Riley Smith)\n\n2009 ''My Man Godfrey'' (written by Morrie Ryskind & Eric Hatch; adaptation by Broderick Miller)\n\n2010 ''Jail Birds''(written by Sofia Shield & Broderick Miller)\n\n2010 ''The Nature Of My Game'' (written by Leo Murphy & Broderick Miller)\n\n2010 ''Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?''

(written by Madeleine Miller & Broderick Miller)\n\n===Directing Mentorship===\n\nThe SCTG directing mentorship allows students to creatively supervise a play entirely on their own. This is the most challenging task in the program, requiring a strong creative vision, a command of the material, self-discipline, relentless energy, and exceptional character.\n\n====SCTG Directors====\n\nMontana Mills \u2013 ''Thunderboard'', Fall 2006\n\nEllie Bensinger \u2013 ''Turbulence'', Fall 2007\n\nOlivia Russin \u2013 ''Hellth Care'', Fall 2008\n\nLibe Barer/Riley Smith \u2013 ''Jackpot'', Fall 2009\n\nRebecca Schumacher \u2013 ''Arrival'', Fall 2012\n\nBeja Wolf \u2013 ''Ciao, Utah'', Fall 2014\n\nLouLou Brazill Baltz- ''Decision 12'', Fall 2019\n\n===El Phoebax Award===\n\nEach show the SCTG honors an actor(s) for outstanding achievement in character. This is not an acting or popularity award. The award was instituted in 2001 as the \"PhoeBax\" award, named after its two founding winners - Phoebe Minette and Baxley Andresen \u2013 who defined the exemplary kind of character the SCTG sought to encourage and nurture. In 2012, the PhoeBax Award was renamed the \"El PhoeBax\" award to recognize the inspiring talent and contributions of student actress Ellie Bensinger.

She learned drawing, how to mix colour, and how to paint. \"By 1612, when she was not yet nineteen years old, her father could boast of her exemplary talents, claiming that in the profession of painting, which she had practised for three years, she had no peer\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garrard|first1=Mary|title=Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art|date=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=13}}</ref>\n\nSince her father's style took inspiration from [[Caravaggio]] during that period, her style was also heavily influenced by him. Artemisia's approach to subject matter was different from her father's. Her paintings are highly naturalistic and Orazio's are idealized. At the same time, Artemisia had to resist the \"traditional attitude and psychological submission to this ''brainwashing'' and jealousy of her obvious talent\".{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|p=113|ps=none}} By doing so, she gained great respect and recognition for her work.{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|ps=none}}<!--needs page number-->\n\nThe first surviving work of the seventeen-year-old Artemisia was the ''[[Susanna and the Elders (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Susanna and the Elders]]'' (1610, [[Sch\u00f6nborn family|Sch\u00f6nborn collection]] in [[Pommersfelden]]). At the time some, influenced by the prevailing misconceptions, suspected that she was helped by her father. The painting shows how Artemisia assimilated the realism of Caravaggio without being indifferent to the language of [[Annibale Carracci]] and the [[Bologna]] school. It is one of the few paintings on the theme of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] showing the sexual accosting by the two Elders as a traumatic event.\n\n===Rape by Agostino Tassi===\n[[File:Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist by Artemisia Gentileschi ca. 1610-1615.jpg|thumb|''[[Salome]] with the Head of Saint [[John the Baptist]]'', c. 1610\u20131615, [[Budapest]]]]\n\nIn 1611, her father was working with [[Agostino Tassi]] to decorate the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the [[Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi]] in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elizabeth S.|date=2000-01-01|title=The Trials of Artemisia Gentileschi: A Rape as History|jstor=2671289|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=31|issue=1|pages=47\u201375|doi=10.2307/2671289}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/baroque/Artemisia-Gentileschi.html|title=Artemisia Gentileschi - Biography & Art - The Art History Archive|website=www.arthistoryarchive.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webwinds.com/artemisia/trial.htm|title=Artemisia, The Rape and the Trial|website=www.webwinds.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\nAfter the rape, Artemisia continued to have sexual relations with Tassi, with the expectation that they were going to be married in order to restore her dignity and secure her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, her father Orazio pressed charges against Tassi.{{r|Cohen}} Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue of this trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio's paintings. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although the sentence was never carried out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artemisia Gentileschi|url=https://www.biography.com/people/artemisia-gentileschi-9308725|website=Biography.com|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=May 13, 2014}}</ref> Artemisia was tortured with [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrews]] at the trial, with the intention of verifying her testimony.<ref>[http://www.webwinds.com/artemisia/trial.htm Artemisia: The Rape and the Trial] Webwinds.com</ref>\n\nArtemisia was surrounded mainly by males since the loss of her mother at age 12. When Artemisia was 17, Orazio rented the upstairs apartment of their home to a female tenant, Tuzia. Artemisia befriended Tuzia; however, Tuzia allowed Agostino Tassi and Cosimo Quorlis to accompany Artemisia in Artemisia's home on multiple occasions. The day the rape occurred, Artemisia cried for the help of Tuzia, but Tuzia simply ignored Artemisia and pretended she knew nothing of what happened. Artemisia felt betrayed by Tuzia, and Tuzia's role in facilitating the rape has been compared to the role of a procuress who is complicit in the sexual exploitation of a prostitute.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zarucchi|first=Jeanne Morgan|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|title=The Gentileschi \"Dana\u00eb\": A Narrative of Rape|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=19| issue =  2|pages=13\u201319|jstor=1358400|doi=10.2307/1358400}}</ref>\n\nThe painting called ''Mother and Child'' is attributed to those early years. The baby has been interpreted as an indirect reference to Agostino Tassi, her rapist, as it dates to 1612, just two years after the rape. The painting appeared in a Swedish private collection during the 1960s. It depicts a strong and suffering woman and casts light on her anguish and expressive artistic capability.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/31048895|title=Distraught young mother breastfeeds her infant.

Shortly afterward the couple moved to Florence, where Artemisia received a commission for a painting at [[Casa Buonarroti]]. She became a successful [[court painter]], enjoying the patronage of the [[House of Medici]] and [[Charles I of England]]. It has been proposed that during this period Artemisia also painted the ''Virgin and Child'', now in the [[Palazzo Spada]], Rome.\n\nWhile in Florence, Artemisia and Pierantonio had a daughter around 1618, Prudentia, but who was also known as Palmira, which has led some scholars to conclude erroneously that Artemisia had two children, not one.{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|p=159|ps=none}} Prudentia was named after Artemisia's mother, who died when Artemisia was 12. It is known that her daughter was a painter, trained by her mother, although nothing is known of her work.{{sfnp|Garrard|1989|p=63|ps=none}}\n\nIn Florence, Artemisia appears to have enjoyed significant success. She was the first woman accepted into the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] (Academy of the Arts of Drawing). She maintained good relations with the most respected artists of her time, such as [[Cristofano Allori]], and was able to garner the favors and the protection of influential people, beginning with [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and especially of the Grand Duchess, [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Her acquaintance with [[Galileo Galilei]], evident from a letter she wrote to the scientist in 1635, appears to stem from her Florentine years.\n\nShe was esteemed by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger]] (nephew of [[Michelangelo]]): busy with construction of Casa Buonarroti to celebrate his notable relative, he asked Artemisia\u2014along with other Florentine artists, including Agostino Ciampelli, Sigismondo Coccapani, Giovan Battista Guidoni, and Zanobi Rosi\u2014to contribute a painting for the ceiling. Each artist was commissioned to present an allegory of a virtue associated with Michelangelo, and Artemisia was assigned the ''[[Allegory of Inclination]]'', presented in the form of a nude young woman holding a compass. It is believed that the subject bears a resemblance to Artemisia. Indeed, in several of her paintings, Artemisia's energetic heroines resemble her self-portraits.\n\nIn 2011, Francesco Solinas discovered a collection of thirty-six letters, dating from about 1616 to 1620, that provide new insight into Gentileschi's personal and financial life in Florence.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lettere di Artemisia: Edizione critica e annotata con quarantatre documenti inediti|last=Solinas|first=Francesco|publisher=De Luca|year=2011|isbn=9788865570524|location=Rome|pages=}}</ref> Most unexpectedly, they show that she had a passionate love affair with a wealthy Florentine nobleman named Francesco Maria Maringhi. Her husband, Stiattesi, was well aware of their relationship, and maintained a correspondence with Maringhi on the back of Artemisia's love letters. Nevertheless, he tolerated it, presumably because Maringhi was a powerful ally who provided the couple financial support. However, by 1620, rumors of the affair had begun to spread in the Florentine court, and this fact, combined with ongoing legal and financial problems, led them to resettle in Rome.\n\nSignificant works from this period include ''La Conversione della Maddalena'' (''The Conversion of the Magdalene''), ''Self-Portrait as a Lute Player'' (in the collection of the [[Wadsworth Atheneum|Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art]]) and ''Giuditta con la sua ancella'' (''Judith and her Maidservant''), now in the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. Artemisia painted a second version of ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', which now is housed in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery of Florence]]. The first, smaller ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'' (1612\u201313) is displayed in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples. Despite her success, financial excesses borne by her for her husband led to problems with creditors, and she fell out with her husband. She returned without him to Rome in 1621.\n\n===Return to Rome, Venetian period (1621\u20131630)===\nArtemisia arrived in [[Rome]] the same year her father Orazio departed for [[Genoa]]. While there is not enough evidence for this, some believe that Artemisia followed her father to Genoa, asserting that this time together would have accentuated the similarity of their styles, making it often difficult to determine which of the two painted certain works. Most of the evidence, however, supports the notion that Artemisia remained in Rome, trying to find a home and raise her daughter.\n\n[[Caravaggio]]'s style remained highly influential and converted many painters to following his style (the so-called ''[[Caravaggisti]]''), such as [[Carlo Saraceni]] (who returned to Venice 1620), [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]], and [[Simon Vouet]].  She and Vouet would go on to have a professional relationship and would influence each other in terms of style and their learnings from Caravaggio's style.<ref>Richard Spear, \"I have made up my mind to take a short trip to Rome,\" in ''Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi,'' 335\u201343.</ref> Painting styles in Rome during the early seventeenth century were diverse, however, demonstrating a more classic manner of the Bolognese disciples of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] and the [[baroque]] style of [[Pietro da Cortona]].\n\nIt appears that Artemisia also was associated with the Academy of the Desiosi. She was celebrated with a portrait carrying the inscription \"''Pincturare miraculum invidendum facilius quam imitandum''\" (To paint a wonder is more easily envied than imitated). During the same period she became associated with [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], a humanist and a collector and lover of arts, while the visiting French artist [[Pierre Dumonstier II]] produced a black and red chalk drawing of her right hand in 1625.{{r|British Museum}}\n\nDespite her artistic reputation, her strong personality, and her numerous good relationships, however, Rome was not so lucrative as she hoped. Her style, tone of defiance, and strength relaxed. She painted less intense works; for instance, her second version of ''Susanna and the Elders'' (1622).{{r|Brigstocke}} The appreciation of her art was narrowed down to portraits and to her ability with biblical heroines. She did not receive any of the lucrative commissions for altarpieces. The absence of sufficient documentation makes it difficult to follow Artemisia's movements in this period. It is certain that between 1627 and as late as 1630, she moved to Venice, perhaps in search of richer commissions. Evidence for this is that verses and letters were composed in appreciation of her and her works in Venice.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes difficult to date her paintings, it is possible to assign certain works by her to these years, the ''Portrait of a [[Gonfaloniere]]'', today in [[Bologna]] (a rare example of her capacity as portrait painter) and the ''Judith and her Maidservant'' today in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. The Detroit painting is notable for her mastery of [[chiaroscuro]] and [[tenebrism]] (the effects of extreme lights and darks), techniques for which [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Trophime Bigot]], and many others in Rome were famous. Her ''The Sleeping Venus'', today in the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], Richmond, and her ''Esther and Ahasuerus'' now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, are testimony to her assimilation of the lessons of Venetian luminism.\n\n===Naples and the English period (1630\u20131654)===\n[[File:Artemisia Gentileschi Cleopatra3.jpg|thumb|''Cleopatra'', 1633\u201335]]\nIn 1630, Artemisia moved to [[Naples]], a city rich with workshops and art lovers, in search of new and more lucrative job opportunities. The 18th-century biographer [[Bernardo de' Dominici]] speculated that Artemisia was already known in Naples before her arrival.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Artemisia Gentileschi: The Language of Painting|last=Locker|first=Jesse|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|page=100}}</ref> She may have been invited to Naples by the Duke of Alcal\u00e1, Fernando Enriquez Afan de Ribera, who had three of her paintings: a ''Penitent Magdalene'', ''Christ Blessing the Children'', and ''David with a Harp''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many other artists, including [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], and [[Simon Vouet]], had stayed in Naples for some time in their lives. At that time, [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Massimo Stanzione]], and [[Domenichino]] were working there, and later, [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] and many others would flock to the city. The Neapolitan debut of Artemisia is represented by the ''Annunciation'' in the [[Capodimonte Museum]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi|last=Christiansen|first=Keith|publisher=New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=392}}</ref>  She remained in Naples for the remainder of her career, with the exceptions of a brief trip to London and some other journeys.\n\nOn Saturday, March 18, 1634, the traveller Bullen Reymes records in his diary visiting Artemisia and Palmira ('who also paints') with a group of fellow-Englishmen.{{sfnp|Chaney|2000|p=111|ps=none}} She had relations with many renowned artists, among them [[Massimo Stanzione]], with whom, Bernardo de' Dominici reports, she started an artistic collaboration based on a real friendship and artistic similarities. Artemisia's work influenced Stanzione's use of colors as seen in his ''Assumption of the Virgin'', c. 1630. De' Dominici states that \"Stanzione learned how to compose an ''istoria'' from Domenichino, but learned his coloring from Artemisia\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn [[Naples]] for the first time Artemisia started working on paintings in a cathedral, dedicated to ''San Gennaro nell'anfiteatro di Pozzuoli'' (''Saint Januarius in the amphitheater of Pozzuoli'') in [[Pozzuoli]]. During her first Neapolitan period she painted the ''[[The Birth of Saint John the Baptist (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Birth of Saint John the Baptist]]'' now in the [[Prado]] in Madrid, and ''Corisca e il satiro'' (''Corisca and the satyr''), in a private collection. In these paintings Artemisia again demonstrates her ability to adapt to the novelties of the period and handle different subjects, instead of the usual ''Judith'', ''Susanna'', ''Bathsheba'', and ''Penitent Magdalenes'', for which she already was known. Many of these paintings were collaborations; ''Bathsheba'', for instance, was attributed to Artemisia, Codazzi, and Gargiulo.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1638, Artemisia joined her father in London at the court of [[Charles I of England]], where Orazio became court painter and received the important job of decorating a ceiling allegory of ''Triumph of Peace and the Arts'' in the [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] built for Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. Father and daughter were working together once again, although helping her father probably was not her only reason for travelling to London: Charles I had invited her to his court, and it was not possible to refuse. Charles I was an enthusiastic collector, willing to incur criticism for his spending on art. The fame of Artemisia probably intrigued him, and it is not a coincidence that his collection included a painting of great suggestion, the ''[[Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting]]'', which is the lead image of this article.\n\nOrazio died suddenly in 1639. Artemisia had her own commissions to fulfill after her father's death, although there are no known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had already left [[England]] by 1642, when the [[English Civil War]] was just starting. Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of [[Sicily]], who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and makes clear that she still was fully active.\n[[File:Artemisia Gentileschi - Sleeping Venus.JPG|thumb|''Sleeping [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'', c. 1625\u20131630, [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]]]\nAs Artemisia grew older, her work became more graceful and \"feminine,\" and while this was to some extent part of the general shift in taste and sensibility, it must also have resulted from the artist becoming more and more self-consciously a female painter.{{sfnp|Garrard|1989|pp=136\u201337|ps=none}}\n\nArtemisia was once believed to have died in 1652/1653;{{r|Lubbock}} however, modern evidence has shown that she was still accepting commissions in 1654, although she was increasingly dependent upon her assistant, Onofrio Palumbo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Vito|first=Giuseppe|year=2005|title=A note on Artemisia Gentileschi and Her Collaborator Onofrio Palumbo|url=|journal=Burlington Magazine|volume=1232|issue=137|page=749|via=}}</ref>\n\nSome have speculated that she died in the devastating plague that swept Naples in 1656 and virtually wiped out an entire generation of Neapolitan artists.\n\nSome works in this period are the ''Susanna and the Elders'' today in [[Brno]],  the ''[[Virgin and Child with a Rosary]]'' today in [[El Escorial]], the ''David and Bathsheba'' today in Columbus, Ohio, and the ''Bathsheba'' today in [[Leipzig]].\n\nHer 'David with the Head of Goliath', rediscovered in London in 2020, has been attributed by art historian Gianni Papi to Artemisia's London period, in an article published in ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]''<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Papi|first1= Gianni|last2= Gillespie|first2= Simon|last3= Chaplin|first3= Tracey D|date= 2020|title= A 'David and Goliath' by Artemisia Gentileschi rediscovered|url= https://www.burlington.org.uk/archive/back-issues/202003|journal= The Burlington Magazine|volume= 162|issue= 1404|pages= 188-195|access-date= 1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1= Gerlis|first1=Melanie|title=The Art Market|location=The Financial Times|date=27 February 2020|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7f29e18-5884-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanderson|first1=David|title=David and Goliath painting revealed as an Artemisia Gentileschi|location=The Times|date=28 February 2020|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/sword-points-to-a-lost-artemisia-dz3088cdt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Moorhead|first1=Joanna|title=Newly attributed Artemisia Gentileschi painting of David and Goliath revealed in London\n|location=The Art Newspaper |date= 28 February 2020|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/newly-attributed-artemisia-gentileschi-painting-revealed-in-london}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Moorhead|first1=Joanna|title=Artemisia Gentileschi, the baroque #MeToo heroine who avenged her rape through art\n|location=The Guardian|date=29 February 2020|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/29/artemisia-gentileschi-national-gallery-baroque-heroine-female-caravaggio}}</ref>\n\n===Artistic importance===\n[[File:Gentileschi judith1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Judith and her Maidservant'', 1613\u201314, Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]\nThe research paper \"Gentileschi, padre e figlia\" (1916) by [[Roberto Longhi]], an Italian critic, described Artemisia as \"the only woman in Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, drawing, and other fundamentals\". Longhi also wrote of ''Judith Slaying Holofernes'': \"There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men\".{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|p=112|ps=none}} These include her works of ''Jael and Sisera'', ''Judith and her Maidservant'', and ''Esther''.

In a research paper from the catalogue of the exhibition \"Orazio e Artemisia Gentileschi\", which took place in Rome in 2001 (and after in New York), Judith W. Mann critiques feminist opinion of Artemisia, finding that old stereotypes of Artemisia as sexually immoral have been replaced by new stereotypes established in feminist readings of Artemisia's paintings:\n\n:Without denying that sex and gender can offer valid interpretive strategies for the investigation of Artemisia's art, we may wonder whether the application of gendered readings has created too narrow an expectation. Underpinning Garrard's monograph, and reiterated in a limited way by R. Ward Bissell in his catalogue raisonn\u00e9, are certain presumptions: that Artemisia's full creative power emerged only in the depiction of strong, assertive women, that she would not engage in conventional religious imagery such as the Madonna and Child or a Virgin who responds with submission to the Annunciation, and that she refused to yield her personal interpretation to suit the tastes of her presumable male clientele. This stereotype has had the doubly restricting effect of causing scholars to question the attribution of pictures that do not conform to the model, and to value less highly those that do not fit the mold.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Christiansen | first=Keith | last2=Mann |first2 = Judith W. |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Orazio_and_Artemisia_Gentileschi |title=Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |isbn=1588390063 |page=250 |access-date=2017-01-12 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\nBecause Artemisia returned again and again to violent subject matter such as Judith and Holofernes, a repressed-vengeance theory has been postulated. Some art historians suggest, however, that she was shrewdly taking advantage of her fame from the rape trial to cater to a niche market in sexually charged, female-dominant art for male patrons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/31048895|title=Distraught young mother breastfeeds her infant.

This, in the face of the mild six month jail sentence the courts inflicted on Agostino Tassi.}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent critics, starting from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, tried to give a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it more accurately in the context of the different artistic environments in which the painter actively participated. A reading such as this restores Artemisia as an artist who fought with determination\u2014using the weapon of personality and of the artistic qualities\u2014against the prejudices expressed against women painters; being able to introduce herself productively in the circle of the most respected painters of her time, embracing a series of pictorial genres that probably were more ample and varied than her paintings suggest.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Feminist perspectives==\n[[File:Lucretia by Artemisia Gentileschi.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lucretia]]'', 1620\u201321]]\nFeminist interest in Artemisia Gentileschi dates from the 1970s when the feminist art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] published an article titled \"[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]\" in which that question was dissected and analyzed. The article explored the definition of \"great artists\" and posited that oppressive institutions, not lack of talent, have prevented women from achieving the same level of recognition that men received in art and other fields. Nochlin said that studies on Artemisia and other female artists were \"worth the effort\" in \"adding to our knowledge of women's achievement and of art history generally.\"{{sfnp|Nochlin|1971|ps=none}}<!--page number required--> According to the foreword by Douglas Druick in Eve Straussman-Pflanzer's ''Violence & Virtue: Artemisia's Judith Slaying Holofernes'', Nochlin's article prompted scholars to make more of an attempt to \"integrate women artists into the history of art and culture.\"{{sfnp|Straussman-Pflanzer|2013|ps=none}}<!--page number required-->\n\nArtemisia and her oeuvre became a focus again, having had little attention in art history scholarship save [[Roberto Longhi]]'s article \"Gentileschi padre e figlia (Gentileschi, father and daughter)\" in 1916 and R. Ward Bissell's article \"Artemisia Gentileschi\u2014A New Documented Chronology\" in 1968. As Artemisia and her work began to garner new attention among feminists and art historians, more literature about her, fictional and biographical, was published. A fictional account of her life by [[Anna Banti]], wife of critic Roberto Longhi, was published in 1947. This account was received well by literary critics but was criticized by feminists, notably Laura Benedetti, for being lenient in historical accuracy in order to draw parallels between author and artist.{{r|Benedetti}} The first full, factual account of Artemisia's life, ''The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art'', was published in 1989 by [[Mary Garrard]], a feminist art historian. She then published a second, smaller book titled ''Artemisia Gentileschi around 1622: The Shaping and Reshaping of an Artistic Identity'' in 2001 which explored the artist's work and identity. Garrard noted that analysis of Artemisia's oeuvre lacks focus and stable categorization outside of \"woman\", though Garrard questions whether femaleness is a legitimate category by which to judge her art at all.{{sfnp|Garrard|2001|ps=none}}<!--page number required-->\n\nArtemisia is known for her portrayals of subjects from the [[Power of Women]] group, for example her versions of ''[[Judith Slaying Holofernes]]''. She is also known for the rape trial in which she was involved, which scholar [[Griselda Pollock]] has argued had unfortunately become the repeated \"axis of interpretation of the artist's work\". Gentileschi's status in popular culture, though she is much admired by among art historians, is deemed by Pollock to be less due to her work and more to the sensationalism caused by the persistent focus on the rape trial during which she was tortured. Pollock offers a counter reading of the artist's dramatic narrative paintings, refusing to see the Judith and Holofernes images as responses to rape and the trial. Instead, Pollock points out that the subject of Judith and Holoferenes is not a revenge theme, but a story of political courage and indeed collaboration by two women committing a daring political murder in a war situation. Pollock seeks to shift attention from sensationalism towards deeper analysis of Gentileschi's paintings, notably of death and loss, suggesting the significance of her childhood bereavement as a source of her singular images of the dying Cleopatra. Pollock also argues that Gentileschi's success in the seventeenth century depended on her producing paintings for patrons often portraying subjects they selected. She aims to place Gentileschi's career in its historical context of taste for dramatic narratives of heroines from the Bible or classical sources.<ref>Pollock Differencing the Canon: Routledge 1999</ref> In a more negative vein, American professor [[Camille Paglia]] has argued that modern feminist preoccupation with Artemisia is misguided and that her accomplishments have been overstated: \"Artemisia Gentileschi was simply a polished, competent painter in a Baroque style created by men.\"<ref>Camille Paglia (1994). ''Vamps and Tramps'' NY: Vintage, p. 115</ref> Feminist literature tends to revolve around the event of Artemisia's rape, largely portraying her as a traumatized but noble survivor whose work became characterized by sex and violence as a result of her experience. Pollock (2006) interpreted the film by [[Agn\u00e8s Merlet]] as a typical example of the inability of popular culture to look at the painter's remarkable career over many decades and in many major centres of art rather than this one episode. A literature review by Laura Benedetti, \"Reconstructing Artemisia: Twentieth Century Images of a Woman Artist\", concluded that Artemisia's work is often interpreted according to the contemporary issues and personal biases of the authors. Feminist scholars, for example, have elevated Artemisia to the status of feminist icon, which Benedetti attributed to Artemisia's paintings of formidable women and her success as an artist in a male-dominated field while also being a single mother.{{r|Benedetti}} Elena Ciletti, author of ''Gran Macchina a Bellezza'', wrote that \"The stakes are very high in Artemisia's case, especially for feminists, because we have invested in her so much of our quest for justice for women, historically and currently, intellectually and politically.\"{{sfnp|Ciletti|2006|ps=none}}<!--page number required-->\n\nFeminist scholars suggest that Gentileschi wanted to take a stand against the stereotype of female submissiveness. One example of this symbolism appears in Gentileschi's \"Corsica and The Satyr,\"<ref>{{Diff|en:Corisca_and_the_Satyr|diff=|oldid=856787248|label=en:Corisca_and_the_Satyr (  oldid 856787248)}}{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}</ref> created between 1630 and 1635. In the painting, a nymph runs away from a satyr. The satyr attempts to grab the nymph by her hair, but the hair is in fact a wig.

Later [[Fede Galizia]] (born in [[Milano]] or [[Trento]] in 1578) painted still lifes and a ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes''.\n\nItalian Baroque painter [[Elisabetta Sirani]] was another female artist from this same time period.<ref>{{Diff|en:Elisabetta_Sirani|diff=|oldid=885427738|label=en:Elisabetta_Sirani (  oldid 885427738)}}{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}</ref> Sirani's painting \"Allergory Painting of Clio\" shares a common color scheme with Artemisia's work. Elisabetta was popular for a brief period of time, but she was recognized.\n\nOther women painters also began their careers while Artemisia was alive. Judged on their artistic merits, Longhi's statement that Artemisia was \"the only woman in Italy who ever knew about painting\" is clearly false.  \nThere is no doubt that Artemisia continues to be among the most highly regarded of women artists, and she has attained her place among the great Baroque artists.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe first writer who produced a novel around the figure of Artemisia may have been [[George Eliot]] in ''[[Romola]]'' (1862\u201363), where some aspects of Gentileschi's story, while set in Florence in Gentileschi's time, are recognizable, but much embroidered. A later and clearer use of Gentileschi's story appears in [[Anna Banti]]'s ''Artemisia''. Banti's book is written in an \"open diary\" format, in which she maintains a dialogue with Artemisia.\n\nGentileschi is one of the women represented in ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', an [[installation art]]work by [[Judy Chicago]] that was first exhibited in 1979.\n\nArtemisia, and more specifically her painting ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'', are referred to in [[Wendy Wasserstein]]'s play ''[[The Heidi Chronicles]]'' (1988), in which the main character, Heidi, lectures about it as part of her art history course on female painters. At the end of the play, Heidi adopts a daughter she names Judy, which is at least a partial reference to the painting.\n\nCanadian playwright [[Sally Clark (playwright)|Sally Clark]] wrote several stage plays based on the events leading up to and following the rape of Artemisia. ''Life Without Instruction,'' commissioned by Nightwood Theatre in 1988, premiered at Theatre Plus Toronto on August 2, 1991.\n\nGentileschi's life and the ''Judith Slaying Holofernes'' painting played a pivotal role in the miniseries ''[[Painted Lady (mini series)|Painted Lady]]'' (1997), starring [[Helen Mirren]].<ref name=\"lithub\"/>\n\nThe film ''[[Artemisia (film)|Artemisia]]'' (1997), by [[Agn\u00e8s Merlet]], tells the story of Artemisia's entry into being a professional artist, her relationship with Tassi, and the trial. Merlet exonerates Tassi of rape, not only by depicting their sex as loving and consensual (which was controversial when the film was released), but also by two ahistorical fabrications: Artemisia ''denies'' the rape under torture, while Tassi ''falsely confesses'' to rape to stop Artemisia's torment.\n\n[[Susan Vreeland]] published ''The Passion of Artemisia'' (2002), a biographical novel based on her life.<ref name=\"lithub\"/>\n\nShe appears in [[Eric Flint]]'s ''[[1632 series|Ring of Fire]]'' alternate history, being mentioned in ''[[1634: The Galileo Affair]]'' (2004) and figuring prominently in ''[[1635: The Dreeson Incident]]'' (2008), as well as appearing in a number of shorter stories in the ''1632'' universe.\n\nThe novel ''[[Maestra (book)|Maestra]]'' (2016) by [[Lisa Hilton (writer)|L.S.

She learned drawing, how to mix colour, and how to paint. \"By 1612, when she was not yet nineteen years old, her father could boast of her exemplary talents, claiming that in the profession of painting, which she had practised for three years, she had no peer\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garrard|first1=Mary|title=Artemisia Gentileschi: The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art|date=1989|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|page=13}}</ref>\n\nSince her father's style took inspiration from [[Caravaggio]] during that period, her style was also heavily influenced by him. Artemisia's approach to subject matter was different from her father's. Her paintings are highly naturalistic and Orazio's are idealized. At the same time, Artemisia had to resist the \"traditional attitude and psychological submission to this ''brainwashing'' and jealousy of her obvious talent\".{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|p=113|ps=none}} By doing so, she gained great respect and recognition for her work.{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|ps=none}}<!--needs page number-->\n\nThe first surviving work of the seventeen-year-old Artemisia was the ''[[Susanna and the Elders (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Susanna and the Elders]]'' (1610, [[Sch\u00f6nborn family|Sch\u00f6nborn collection]] in [[Pommersfelden]]). At the time some, influenced by the prevailing misconceptions, suspected that she was helped by her father. The painting shows how Artemisia assimilated the realism of Caravaggio without being indifferent to the language of [[Annibale Carracci]] and the [[Bologna]] school. It is one of the few paintings on the theme of [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] showing the sexual accosting by the two Elders as a traumatic event.\n\n===Rape by Agostino Tassi===\n[[File:Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist by Artemisia Gentileschi ca. 1610-1615.jpg|thumb|''[[Salome]] with the Head of Saint [[John the Baptist]]'', c. 1610\u20131615, [[Budapest]]]]\n\nIn 1611, her father was working with [[Agostino Tassi]] to decorate the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the [[Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi]] in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Elizabeth S.|date=2000-01-01|title=The Trials of Artemisia Gentileschi: A Rape as History|jstor=2671289|journal=The Sixteenth Century Journal|volume=31|issue=1|pages=47\u201375|doi=10.2307/2671289}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/baroque/Artemisia-Gentileschi.html|title=Artemisia Gentileschi - Biography & Art - The Art History Archive|website=www.arthistoryarchive.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref> Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webwinds.com/artemisia/trial.htm|title=Artemisia, The Rape and the Trial|website=www.webwinds.com|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\nAfter the rape, Artemisia continued to have sexual relations with Tassi, with the expectation that they were going to be married in order to restore her dignity and secure her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, her father Orazio pressed charges against Tassi.{{r|Cohen}} Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue of this trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio's paintings. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although the sentence was never carried out.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artemisia Gentileschi|url=https://www.biography.com/people/artemisia-gentileschi-9308725|website=Biography.com|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=May 13, 2014}}</ref> Artemisia was tortured with [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrews]] at the trial, with the intention of verifying her testimony.<ref>[http://www.webwinds.com/artemisia/trial.htm Artemisia: The Rape and the Trial] Webwinds.com</ref>\n\nArtemisia was surrounded mainly by males since the loss of her mother at age 12. When Artemisia was 17, Orazio rented the upstairs apartment of their home to a female tenant, Tuzia. Artemisia befriended Tuzia; however, Tuzia allowed Agostino Tassi and Cosimo Quorlis to accompany Artemisia in Artemisia's home on multiple occasions. The day the rape occurred, Artemisia cried for the help of Tuzia, but Tuzia simply ignored Artemisia and pretended she knew nothing of what happened. Artemisia felt betrayed by Tuzia, and Tuzia's role in facilitating the rape has been compared to the role of a procuress who is complicit in the sexual exploitation of a prostitute.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zarucchi|first=Jeanne Morgan|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|title=The Gentileschi \"Dana\u00eb\": A Narrative of Rape|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=19| issue =  2|pages=13\u201319|jstor=1358400|doi=10.2307/1358400}}</ref>\n\nThe painting called ''Mother and Child'' is attributed to those early years.

Shortly afterward the couple moved to Florence, where Artemisia received a commission for a painting at [[Casa Buonarroti]]. She became a successful [[court painter]], enjoying the patronage of the [[House of Medici]] and [[Charles I of England]]. It has been proposed that during this period Artemisia also painted the ''Virgin and Child'', now in the [[Palazzo Spada]], Rome.\n\nWhile in Florence, Artemisia and Pierantonio had a daughter around 1618, Prudentia, but who was also known as Palmira, which has led some scholars to conclude erroneously that Artemisia had two children, not one.{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|p=159|ps=none}} Prudentia was named after Artemisia's mother, who died when Artemisia was 12. It is known that her daughter was a painter, trained by her mother, although nothing is known of her work.{{sfnp|Garrard|1989|p=63|ps=none}}\n\nIn Florence, Artemisia appears to have enjoyed significant success. She was the first woman accepted into the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno]] (Academy of the Arts of Drawing). She maintained good relations with the most respected artists of her time, such as [[Cristofano Allori]], and was able to garner the favors and the protection of influential people, beginning with [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and especially of the Grand Duchess, [[Christina of Lorraine]]. Her acquaintance with [[Galileo Galilei]], evident from a letter she wrote to the scientist in 1635, appears to stem from her Florentine years.\n\nShe was esteemed by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger]] (nephew of [[Michelangelo]]): busy with construction of Casa Buonarroti to celebrate his notable relative, he asked Artemisia\u2014along with other Florentine artists, including Agostino Ciampelli, Sigismondo Coccapani, Giovan Battista Guidoni, and Zanobi Rosi\u2014to contribute a painting for the ceiling. Each artist was commissioned to present an allegory of a virtue associated with Michelangelo, and Artemisia was assigned the ''[[Allegory of Inclination]]'', presented in the form of a nude young woman holding a compass. It is believed that the subject bears a resemblance to Artemisia. Indeed, in several of her paintings, Artemisia's energetic heroines resemble her self-portraits.\n\nIn 2011, Francesco Solinas discovered a collection of thirty-six letters, dating from about 1616 to 1620, that provide new insight into Gentileschi's personal and financial life in Florence.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lettere di Artemisia: Edizione critica e annotata con quarantatre documenti inediti|last=Solinas|first=Francesco|publisher=De Luca|year=2011|isbn=9788865570524|location=Rome|pages=}}</ref> Most unexpectedly, they show that she had a passionate love affair with a wealthy Florentine nobleman named Francesco Maria Maringhi. Her husband, Stiattesi, was well aware of their relationship, and maintained a correspondence with Maringhi on the back of Artemisia's love letters. Nevertheless, he tolerated it, presumably because Maringhi was a powerful ally who provided the couple financial support. However, by 1620, rumors of the affair had begun to spread in the Florentine court, and this fact, combined with ongoing legal and financial problems, led them to resettle in Rome.\n\nSignificant works from this period include ''La Conversione della Maddalena'' (''The Conversion of the Magdalene''), ''Self-Portrait as a Lute Player'' (in the collection of the [[Wadsworth Atheneum|Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art]]) and ''Giuditta con la sua ancella'' (''Judith and her Maidservant''), now in the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. Artemisia painted a second version of ''Judith beheading Holofernes'', which now is housed in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery of Florence]]. The first, smaller ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'' (1612\u201313) is displayed in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], Naples. Despite her success, financial excesses borne by her for her husband led to problems with creditors, and she fell out with her husband. She returned without him to Rome in 1621.\n\n===Return to Rome, Venetian period (1621\u20131630)===\nArtemisia arrived in [[Rome]] the same year her father Orazio departed for [[Genoa]]. While there is not enough evidence for this, some believe that Artemisia followed her father to Genoa, asserting that this time together would have accentuated the similarity of their styles, making it often difficult to determine which of the two painted certain works. Most of the evidence, however, supports the notion that Artemisia remained in Rome, trying to find a home and raise her daughter.\n\n[[Caravaggio]]'s style remained highly influential and converted many painters to following his style (the so-called ''[[Caravaggisti]]''), such as [[Carlo Saraceni]] (who returned to Venice 1620), [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]], and [[Simon Vouet]].  She and Vouet would go on to have a professional relationship and would influence each other in terms of style and their learnings from Caravaggio's style.<ref>Richard Spear, \"I have made up my mind to take a short trip to Rome,\" in ''Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi,'' 335\u201343.</ref> Painting styles in Rome during the early seventeenth century were diverse, however, demonstrating a more classic manner of the Bolognese disciples of the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] and the [[baroque]] style of [[Pietro da Cortona]].\n\nIt appears that Artemisia also was associated with the Academy of the Desiosi. She was celebrated with a portrait carrying the inscription \"''Pincturare miraculum invidendum facilius quam imitandum''\" (To paint a wonder is more easily envied than imitated). During the same period she became associated with [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], a humanist and a collector and lover of arts, while the visiting French artist [[Pierre Dumonstier II]] produced a black and red chalk drawing of her right hand in 1625.{{r|British Museum}}\n\nDespite her artistic reputation, her strong personality, and her numerous good relationships, however, Rome was not so lucrative as she hoped. Her style, tone of defiance, and strength relaxed. She painted less intense works; for instance, her second version of ''Susanna and the Elders'' (1622).{{r|Brigstocke}} The appreciation of her art was narrowed down to portraits and to her ability with biblical heroines. She did not receive any of the lucrative commissions for altarpieces. The absence of sufficient documentation makes it difficult to follow Artemisia's movements in this period. It is certain that between 1627 and as late as 1630, she moved to Venice, perhaps in search of richer commissions. Evidence for this is that verses and letters were composed in appreciation of her and her works in Venice.\n\nAlthough it is sometimes difficult to date her paintings, it is possible to assign certain works by her to these years, the ''Portrait of a [[Gonfaloniere]]'', today in [[Bologna]] (a rare example of her capacity as portrait painter) and the ''Judith and her Maidservant'' today in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]. The Detroit painting is notable for her mastery of [[chiaroscuro]] and [[tenebrism]] (the effects of extreme lights and darks), techniques for which [[Gerrit van Honthorst]], [[Trophime Bigot]], and many others in Rome were famous. Her ''The Sleeping Venus'', today in the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], Richmond, and her ''Esther and Ahasuerus'' now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, are testimony to her assimilation of the lessons of Venetian luminism.\n\n===Naples and the English period (1630\u20131654)===\n[[File:Artemisia Gentileschi Cleopatra3.jpg|thumb|''Cleopatra'', 1633\u201335]]\nIn 1630, Artemisia moved to [[Naples]], a city rich with workshops and art lovers, in search of new and more lucrative job opportunities. The 18th-century biographer [[Bernardo de' Dominici]] speculated that Artemisia was already known in Naples before her arrival.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Artemisia Gentileschi: The Language of Painting|last=Locker|first=Jesse|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|page=100}}</ref> She may have been invited to Naples by the Duke of Alcal\u00e1, Fernando Enriquez Afan de Ribera, who had three of her paintings: a ''Penitent Magdalene'', ''Christ Blessing the Children'', and ''David with a Harp''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many other artists, including [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], and [[Simon Vouet]], had stayed in Naples for some time in their lives. At that time, [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Massimo Stanzione]], and [[Domenichino]] were working there, and later, [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] and many others would flock to the city. The Neapolitan debut of Artemisia is represented by the ''Annunciation'' in the [[Capodimonte Museum]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi|last=Christiansen|first=Keith|publisher=New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=2002|isbn=|location=|page=392}}</ref>  She remained in Naples for the remainder of her career, with the exceptions of a brief trip to London and some other journeys.\n\nOn Saturday, March 18, 1634, the traveller Bullen Reymes records in his diary visiting Artemisia and Palmira ('who also paints') with a group of fellow-Englishmen.{{sfnp|Chaney|2000|p=111|ps=none}} She had relations with many renowned artists, among them [[Massimo Stanzione]], with whom, Bernardo de' Dominici reports, she started an artistic collaboration based on a real friendship and artistic similarities. Artemisia's work influenced Stanzione's use of colors as seen in his ''Assumption of the Virgin'', c. 1630. De' Dominici states that \"Stanzione learned how to compose an ''istoria'' from Domenichino, but learned his coloring from Artemisia\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn [[Naples]] for the first time Artemisia started working on paintings in a cathedral, dedicated to ''San Gennaro nell'anfiteatro di Pozzuoli'' (''Saint Januarius in the amphitheater of Pozzuoli'') in [[Pozzuoli]]. During her first Neapolitan period she painted the ''[[The Birth of Saint John the Baptist (Artemisia Gentileschi)|Birth of Saint John the Baptist]]'' now in the [[Prado]] in Madrid, and ''Corisca e il satiro'' (''Corisca and the satyr''), in a private collection. In these paintings Artemisia again demonstrates her ability to adapt to the novelties of the period and handle different subjects, instead of the usual ''Judith'', ''Susanna'', ''Bathsheba'', and ''Penitent Magdalenes'', for which she already was known. Many of these paintings were collaborations; ''Bathsheba'', for instance, was attributed to Artemisia, Codazzi, and Gargiulo.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1638, Artemisia joined her father in London at the court of [[Charles I of England]], where Orazio became court painter and received the important job of decorating a ceiling allegory of ''Triumph of Peace and the Arts'' in the [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] built for Queen [[Henrietta Maria]]. Father and daughter were working together once again, although helping her father probably was not her only reason for travelling to London: Charles I had invited her to his court, and it was not possible to refuse. Charles I was an enthusiastic collector, willing to incur criticism for his spending on art. The fame of Artemisia probably intrigued him, and it is not a coincidence that his collection included a painting of great suggestion, the ''[[Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting]]'', which is the lead image of this article.\n\nOrazio died suddenly in 1639. Artemisia had her own commissions to fulfill after her father's death, although there are no known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had already left [[England]] by 1642, when the [[English Civil War]] was just starting. Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of [[Sicily]], who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and makes clear that she still was fully active.\n[[File:Artemisia Gentileschi - Sleeping Venus.JPG|thumb|''Sleeping [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'', c. 1625\u20131630, [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]]]\nAs Artemisia grew older, her work became more graceful and \"feminine,\" and while this was to some extent part of the general shift in taste and sensibility, it must also have resulted from the artist becoming more and more self-consciously a female painter.{{sfnp|Garrard|1989|pp=136\u201337|ps=none}}\n\nArtemisia was once believed to have died in 1652/1653;{{r|Lubbock}} however, modern evidence has shown that she was still accepting commissions in 1654, although she was increasingly dependent upon her assistant, Onofrio Palumbo.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Vito|first=Giuseppe|year=2005|title=A note on Artemisia Gentileschi and Her Collaborator Onofrio Palumbo|url=|journal=Burlington Magazine|volume=1232|issue=137|page=749|via=}}</ref>\n\nSome have speculated that she died in the devastating plague that swept Naples in 1656 and virtually wiped out an entire generation of Neapolitan artists.\n\nSome works in this period are the ''Susanna and the Elders'' today in [[Brno]],  the ''[[Virgin and Child with a Rosary]]'' today in [[El Escorial]], the ''David and Bathsheba'' today in Columbus, Ohio, and the ''Bathsheba'' today in [[Leipzig]].\n\nHer 'David with the Head of Goliath', rediscovered in London in 2020, has been attributed by art historian Gianni Papi to Artemisia's London period, in an article published in ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]''<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Papi|first1= Gianni|last2= Gillespie|first2= Simon|last3= Chaplin|first3= Tracey D|date= 2020|title= A 'David and Goliath' by Artemisia Gentileschi rediscovered|url= https://www.burlington.org.uk/archive/back-issues/202003|journal= The Burlington Magazine|volume= 162|issue= 1404|pages= 188-195|access-date= 1 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1= Gerlis|first1=Melanie|title=The Art Market|location=The Financial Times|date=27 February 2020|url=https://www.ft.com/content/e7f29e18-5884-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanderson|first1=David|title=David and Goliath painting revealed as an Artemisia Gentileschi|location=The Times|date=28 February 2020|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/sword-points-to-a-lost-artemisia-dz3088cdt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Moorhead|first1=Joanna|title=Newly attributed Artemisia Gentileschi painting of David and Goliath revealed in London\n|location=The Art Newspaper |date= 28 February 2020|url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/newly-attributed-artemisia-gentileschi-painting-revealed-in-london}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Moorhead|first1=Joanna|title=Artemisia Gentileschi, the baroque #MeToo heroine who avenged her rape through art\n|location=The Guardian|date=29 February 2020|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/29/artemisia-gentileschi-national-gallery-baroque-heroine-female-caravaggio}}</ref>\n\n===Artistic importance===\n[[File:Gentileschi judith1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Judith and her Maidservant'', 1613\u201314, Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]\nThe research paper \"Gentileschi, padre e figlia\" (1916) by [[Roberto Longhi]], an Italian critic, described Artemisia as \"the only woman in Italy who ever knew about painting, coloring, drawing, and other fundamentals\". Longhi also wrote of ''Judith Slaying Holofernes'': \"There are about fifty-seven works by Artemisia Gentileschi and 94% (forty-nine works) feature women as protagonists or equal to men\".{{sfnp|Bissell|1999|p=112|ps=none}} These include her works of ''Jael and Sisera'', ''Judith and her Maidservant'', and ''Esther''.

A nineteenth-century critic commented on Artemisia's ''Magdalene'' stating, \"no one would have imagined that it was the work of a woman.

In a research paper from the catalogue of the exhibition \"Orazio e Artemisia Gentileschi\", which took place in Rome in 2001 (and after in New York), Judith W. Mann critiques feminist opinion of Artemisia, finding that old stereotypes of Artemisia as sexually immoral have been replaced by new stereotypes established in feminist readings of Artemisia's paintings:\n\n:Without denying that sex and gender can offer valid interpretive strategies for the investigation of Artemisia's art, we may wonder whether the application of gendered readings has created too narrow an expectation. Underpinning Garrard's monograph, and reiterated in a limited way by R. Ward Bissell in his catalogue raisonn\u00e9, are certain presumptions: that Artemisia's full creative power emerged only in the depiction of strong, assertive women, that she would not engage in conventional religious imagery such as the Madonna and Child or a Virgin who responds with submission to the Annunciation, and that she refused to yield her personal interpretation to suit the tastes of her presumable male clientele. This stereotype has had the doubly restricting effect of causing scholars to question the attribution of pictures that do not conform to the model, and to value less highly those that do not fit the mold.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Christiansen | first=Keith | last2=Mann |first2 = Judith W. |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Orazio_and_Artemisia_Gentileschi |title=Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=New York |isbn=1588390063 |page=250 |access-date=2017-01-12 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\nBecause Artemisia returned again and again to violent subject matter such as Judith and Holofernes, a repressed-vengeance theory has been postulated. Some art historians suggest, however, that she was shrewdly taking advantage of her fame from the rape trial to cater to a niche market in sexually charged, female-dominant art for male patrons.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/31048895|title=Distraught young mother breastfeeds her infant.

This, in the face of the mild six month jail sentence the courts inflicted on Agostino Tassi.}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent critics, starting from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, tried to give a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it more accurately in the context of the different artistic environments in which the painter actively participated. A reading such as this restores Artemisia as an artist who fought with determination\u2014using the weapon of personality and of the artistic qualities\u2014against the prejudices expressed against women painters; being able to introduce herself productively in the circle of the most respected painters of her time, embracing a series of pictorial genres that probably were more ample and varied than her paintings suggest.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Feminist perspectives==\n[[File:Lucretia by Artemisia Gentileschi.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lucretia]]'', 1620\u201321]]\nFeminist interest in Artemisia Gentileschi dates from the 1970s when the feminist art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] published an article titled \"[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]\" in which that question was dissected and analyzed. The article explored the definition of \"great artists\" and posited that oppressive institutions, not lack of talent, have prevented women from achieving the same level of recognition that men received in art and other fields. Nochlin said that studies on Artemisia and other female artists were \"worth the effort\" in \"adding to our knowledge of women's achievement and of art history generally.\"{{sfnp|Nochlin|1971|ps=none}}<!--page number required--> According to the foreword by Douglas Druick in Eve Straussman-Pflanzer's ''Violence & Virtue: Artemisia's Judith Slaying Holofernes'', Nochlin's article prompted scholars to make more of an attempt to \"integrate women artists into the history of art and culture.\"{{sfnp|Straussman-Pflanzer|2013|ps=none}}<!--page number required-->\n\nArtemisia and her oeuvre became a focus again, having had little attention in art history scholarship save [[Roberto Longhi]]'s article \"Gentileschi padre e figlia (Gentileschi, father and daughter)\" in 1916 and R. Ward Bissell's article \"Artemisia Gentileschi\u2014A New Documented Chronology\" in 1968. As Artemisia and her work began to garner new attention among feminists and art historians, more literature about her, fictional and biographical, was published. A fictional account of her life by [[Anna Banti]], wife of critic Roberto Longhi, was published in 1947. This account was received well by literary critics but was criticized by feminists, notably Laura Benedetti, for being lenient in historical accuracy in order to draw parallels between author and artist.{{r|Benedetti}} The first full, factual account of Artemisia's life, ''The Image of the Female Hero in Italian Baroque Art'', was published in 1989 by [[Mary Garrard]], a feminist art historian. She then published a second, smaller book titled ''Artemisia Gentileschi around 1622: The Shaping and Reshaping of an Artistic Identity'' in 2001 which explored the artist's work and identity. Garrard noted that analysis of Artemisia's oeuvre lacks focus and stable categorization outside of \"woman\", though Garrard questions whether femaleness is a legitimate category by which to judge her art at all.{{sfnp|Garrard|2001|ps=none}}<!--page number required-->\n\nArtemisia is known for her portrayals of subjects from the [[Power of Women]] group, for example her versions of ''[[Judith Slaying Holofernes]]''. She is also known for the rape trial in which she was involved, which scholar [[Griselda Pollock]] has argued had unfortunately become the repeated \"axis of interpretation of the artist's work\". Gentileschi's status in popular culture, though she is much admired by among art historians, is deemed by Pollock to be less due to her work and more to the sensationalism caused by the persistent focus on the rape trial during which she was tortured. Pollock offers a counter reading of the artist's dramatic narrative paintings, refusing to see the Judith and Holofernes images as responses to rape and the trial. Instead, Pollock points out that the subject of Judith and Holoferenes is not a revenge theme, but a story of political courage and indeed collaboration by two women committing a daring political murder in a war situation. Pollock seeks to shift attention from sensationalism towards deeper analysis of Gentileschi's paintings, notably of death and loss, suggesting the significance of her childhood bereavement as a source of her singular images of the dying Cleopatra. Pollock also argues that Gentileschi's success in the seventeenth century depended on her producing paintings for patrons often portraying subjects they selected. She aims to place Gentileschi's career in its historical context of taste for dramatic narratives of heroines from the Bible or classical sources.<ref>Pollock Differencing the Canon: Routledge 1999</ref> In a more negative vein, American professor [[Camille Paglia]] has argued that modern feminist preoccupation with Artemisia is misguided and that her accomplishments have been overstated: \"Artemisia Gentileschi was simply a polished, competent painter in a Baroque style created by men.\"<ref>Camille Paglia (1994). ''Vamps and Tramps'' NY: Vintage, p. 115</ref> Feminist literature tends to revolve around the event of Artemisia's rape, largely portraying her as a traumatized but noble survivor whose work became characterized by sex and violence as a result of her experience. Pollock (2006) interpreted the film by [[Agn\u00e8s Merlet]] as a typical example of the inability of popular culture to look at the painter's remarkable career over many decades and in many major centres of art rather than this one episode. A literature review by Laura Benedetti, \"Reconstructing Artemisia: Twentieth Century Images of a Woman Artist\", concluded that Artemisia's work is often interpreted according to the contemporary issues and personal biases of the authors. Feminist scholars, for example, have elevated Artemisia to the status of feminist icon, which Benedetti attributed to Artemisia's paintings of formidable women and her success as an artist in a male-dominated field while also being a single mother.{{r|Benedetti}} Elena Ciletti, author of ''Gran Macchina a Bellezza'', wrote that \"The stakes are very high in Artemisia's case, especially for feminists, because we have invested in her so much of our quest for justice for women, historically and currently, intellectually and politically.\"{{sfnp|Ciletti|2006|ps=none}}<!--page number required-->\n\nFeminist scholars suggest that Gentileschi wanted to take a stand against the stereotype of female submissiveness.

In the painting, a nymph runs away from a satyr. The satyr attempts to grab the nymph by her hair, but the hair is in fact a wig.

Scholars have argued that Artemisia was at least partially aware of \"her position as a female artist and the current representations of women's relationship to art.\"<ref name=\"Rozsika\">{{Cite book|title=Old mistresses : women, art, and ideology|last=Rozsika|first=Parker|others=Pollock, Griselda|isbn=0710008791|location=London|oclc=8160325|date = 1981-10-29}}</ref> This is evident in her allegorical self portrait, [[Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting|Self Portrait as ''La Pittura'']], which shows Artemisia as a muse, \"symbolic embodiment of the art\" and as a professional artist.<ref name=\"Rozsika\"/>  Before Artemisia, between the end of the 1500 and the beginning of 1600, other women painters had successful careers, including [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] (born in [[Cremona]] around 1530). Later [[Fede Galizia]] (born in [[Milano]] or [[Trento]] in 1578) painted still lifes and a ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes''.\n\nItalian Baroque painter [[Elisabetta Sirani]] was another female artist from this same time period.<ref>{{Diff|en:Elisabetta_Sirani|diff=|oldid=885427738|label=en:Elisabetta_Sirani (  oldid 885427738)}}{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}</ref> Sirani's painting \"Allergory Painting of Clio\" shares a common color scheme with Artemisia's work. Elisabetta was popular for a brief period of time, but she was recognized.\n\nOther women painters also began their careers while Artemisia was alive. Judged on their artistic merits, Longhi's statement that Artemisia was \"the only woman in Italy who ever knew about painting\" is clearly false, and there is no doubt that Artemisia continues to be among the most highly regarded of women artists, and she has attained her place among the great Baroque artists.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe first writer who produced a novel around the figure of Artemisia may have been [[George Eliot]] in ''[[Romola]]'' (1862\u201363), where some aspects of Gentileschi's story, while set in Florence in Gentileschi's time, are recognizable, but much embroidered. A later and clearer use of Gentileschi's story appears in [[Anna Banti]]'s ''Artemisia''. Banti's book is written in an \"open diary\" format, in which she maintains a dialogue with Artemisia.\n\nGentileschi is one of the women represented in ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', an [[installation art]]work by [[Judy Chicago]] that was first exhibited in 1979.\n\nArtemisia, and more specifically her painting ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'', are referred to in [[Wendy Wasserstein]]'s play ''[[The Heidi Chronicles]]'' (1988), in which the main character, Heidi, lectures about it as part of her art history course on female painters. At the end of the play, Heidi adopts a daughter she names Judy, which is at least a partial reference to the painting.\n\nCanadian playwright [[Sally Clark (playwright)|Sally Clark]] wrote several stage plays based on the events leading up to and following the rape of Artemisia. ''Life Without Instruction,'' commissioned by Nightwood Theatre in 1988, premiered at Theatre Plus Toronto on August 2, 1991.\n\nGentileschi's life and the ''Judith Slaying Holofernes'' painting played a pivotal role in the miniseries ''[[Painted Lady (mini series)|Painted Lady]]'' (1997), starring [[Helen Mirren]].<ref name=\"lithub\"/>\n\nThe film ''[[Artemisia (film)|Artemisia]]'' (1997), by [[Agn\u00e8s Merlet]], tells the story of Artemisia's entry into being a professional artist, her relationship with Tassi, and the trial. Merlet exonerates Tassi of rape, not only by depicting their sex as loving and consensual (which was controversial when the film was released), but also by two ahistorical fabrications: Artemisia ''denies'' the rape under torture, while Tassi ''falsely confesses'' to rape to stop Artemisia's torment.\n\n[[Susan Vreeland]] published ''The Passion of Artemisia'' (2002), a biographical novel based on her life.<ref name=\"lithub\"/>\n\nShe appears in [[Eric Flint]]'s ''[[1632 series|Ring of Fire]]'' alternate history, being mentioned in ''[[1634: The Galileo Affair]]'' (2004) and figuring prominently in ''[[1635: The Dreeson Incident]]'' (2008), as well as appearing in a number of shorter stories in the ''1632'' universe.\n\nThe novel ''[[Maestra (book)|Maestra]]'' (2016) by [[Lisa Hilton (writer)|L.S. Hilton]] includes Artemisia as a central reference for the main character, and several of her paintings are discussed.\n\nThe novel ''Salem's Cipher'' (2016) by Jess Lourey used the painting ''Judith Beheading Holofernes'' to send a clue.\n\n''Blood Water Paint'', a play by Joy McCullough, was turned into the novel ''Blood Water Paint'' (2017) by the same author. Productions of the play were performed in Seattle in 2015 and 2019.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://lgtheater.org/2015/01/bloodwaterpaint/ | title=Blood/Water/Paint}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thestranger.com/events/40002445/blood-water-paint |title = Blood Water Paint}}</ref><ref>https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557182/blood-water-paint-by-joy-mccullough/9780735232136/</ref>\n\nAn episode of the British TV crime series ''[[List of Endeavour episodes#Series 5 (2018)|Endeavour]]'' (2018) depicts a series of murders inspired by Gentileschi's biblical paintings of women taking vengeance on the men who harmed or abused them.<ref name=\"lithub\">{{cite web |last1=Jenni |first1=Murray |title=The Vengeance of Artemisia Gentileschi |url=https://lithub.com/the-vengeance-of-artemisia-gentileschi/ |website=Literary Hub |accessdate=October 15, 2018 |date=October 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBreach Theatre's ''It's True, It's True, It's True'' (2018) is a play derived from the transcripts of the trial, translated from Latin and Italian into conversational English, and was first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], where it won The Stage Edinburgh award and a Fringe First award.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2020/breach-theatres-its-true-its-true-its-true-to-be-given-bbc-tv-screening/|title=Breach Theatre's It's True, It's True, It's True to be given BBC TV screening {{!}} News|last=Snow|first=Georgia|date=2020-02-06|website=The Stage|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref> After touring the UK, it was then broadcast on BBC Four on 9 February 2020 and was available on BBC iPlayer until 11 March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2020/breach-theatres-its-true-its-true-its-true-to-be-given-bbc-tv-screening/|title=Breach Theatre's It's True, It's True, It's True to be given BBC TV screening {{!}} News|last=Snow|first=Georgia|date=2020-02-06|website=The Stage|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref> \n\nThe speculative nonfiction [[opera]] titled ''Artemisia'' by [[Laura Schwendinger]] was performed in San Francisco in 2019.<ref name='leftcoast'/>\n\n==Selected works==\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:The Virgin nursing the Child by Artemisia Gentileschi ca. 1616-1618.jpg|''The Virgin nursing the Child'', c. 1616\u20131618\nFile:Verk\u00fcndigung an maria.jpg|''[[Annunciation]]'', 1630, [[Museo di Capodimonte]]\nFile:Artemisia Gentileschi -

In 1872 he was a sponsor of the \"Irish Exhibition\" at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin, which was arranged to promote Irish trade. Correcting a mistake about the exhibition in the ''[[Freeman's Journal]]'' led to a death threat from a religious extremist, which he did not report to the police.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1872/jul/12/question#S3V0212P0_18720712_HOC_13 Death threat read out in the Commons July 1872]</ref> In the 1890s he supported the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]].\n\nAfter withdrawing from the [[Guinness]] company in 1876, when he sold his half-share to his brother [[Edward Guinness, 1st Earl of Iveagh|Edward]] for \u00a3600,000, he was in 1880 raised to the peerage as '''Baron Ardilaun''', of Ashford in the [[Counties of Ireland|County]] of [[County Galway|Galway]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=24838 |date= 27 April 1880 |page=2725 }}</ref> His home there was at [[Ashford Castle]] on [[Lough Corrib]], and his title derived from the [[Irish language|Gaelic]] ''Ard Oile\u00e1in'', a 'high island' on the lake.<ref>In modern Irish it would be \"Ard Oilean\".</ref>\n\n==Landlord==\n[[Image:Ashford castle.jpg|thumb|260 px|right|Ashford Castle]]\nIn 1852, Sir [[Benjamin Lee Guinness]], 1st Baronet (1798-1868), heir to the Guinness brewery fortune and father of Arthur Guinness, \u201cacquired several Connacht estates that were up for sale in the [[Encumbered Estates' Court]]. He bought the Ashford estate from Lord Oranmore and Browne, the Doon estate from Sir Richard O'Donnell, the Cong estate from Alexander Lambert, part of the Rosshill estate from Lords Charlemont and Leitrim, parts of Connemara from Christopher St George. In 1859, he bought Kylemore from a banking consortium. With these purchases, Benjamin Guinness became landlord to 670 tenants, 316 of whom rented at less than \u00a35 per annum. With his father\u2019s death in 1868, Arthur Guinness, 2nd Baronet and oldest son and heir, continued in his father\u2019s footsteps, purchasing vast swaths of Galway. \u201cHe bought the Elwood estate of Strandhill, just across the river from Ashford, Cong, in 1871, and Lord Kilmaine sold him the Inishdoorus islands on Lough Corrib, and lands in the barony of Ross, part of Nymphsfield near Cong in 1875.
