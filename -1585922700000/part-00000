As the largest independent College in Ireland, Griffith College Dublin has placed an emphasis on expanding the Students\u2019 Union alongside the expansion of the College.  They can directly influence and assist students during their academic year. The Students\u2019 Union provides advice on welfare, health, accommodation, financial and academic matters in an effort to help students adjust to college life. However, its primary role is to represent its members views and defend their interests<ref>[https://archive.today/20071119064118/http://www.gcd.ie/studentsunion]</ref> Griffith College Students' Union is one of the only students' unions across the island of Ireland who are not a member of the [[Union of Students in Ireland]] (USI), the national representative body for third-level students' unions in Ireland, just like the [[University of Limerick]].\n\nThe Students' Union President is elected annually by the college students and is responsible for the union's communications, welfare and acting as editor of Griffiti Magazine. The SU also has a Clubs & Societies Officer who is responsible for helping establish and run the various clubs and societies in the college. There is also an assistant manager who is responsible for the college entertainments. The SU Manager manages the staff and daily running of the SU. The Students' Union organizes a number of different events throughout the year from [[Freshers Week]], Halloween Ball, [[Thanksgiving]], [[Diwali]], [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], Christmas Ball and the formal Griffith Ball which takes place towards the end of the year.\n\n==Sabbatical Officers==\nThe following table outlines Griffith College SU Officers and staff from the Union's beginnings in 2000 to the current day.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\"text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n!colspan=16| Sabbatical Executive Officers (Directly Elected by the Union Membership)\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n!

Originally conceived as a newspaper, Griffiti changed to a more informal magazine format in its 2nd year. It was the first Griffith College student publication to be printed entirely in colour, since then full-colour magazines have become the norm in GCD.  It is published every month of the academic year, and contains articles and stories which focus on general news, opinion and goings-on around the campus. Students of all disciplines are free to submit articles. The magazine's management dictates that the editor changes every academic year. It was launched in October 2004. As of December 2013 there has been 58 issues.

As the largest independent College in Ireland, Griffith College Dublin has placed an emphasis on expanding the Students\u2019 Union alongside the expansion of the College.  They can directly influence and assist students during their academic year. The Students\u2019 Union provides advice on welfare, health, accommodation, financial and academic matters in an effort to help students adjust to college life. However, its primary role is to represent its members views and defend their interests<ref>[https://archive.today/20071119064118/http://www.gcd.ie/studentsunion]</ref> Griffith College Students' Union is one of the only students' unions across the island of Ireland who are not a member of the [[Union of Students in Ireland]] (USI), the national representative body for third-level students' unions in Ireland, just like the [[University of Limerick]].\n\nThe Students' Union President is elected annually by the college students and is responsible for the union's communications, welfare and acting as editor of Griffiti Magazine. The SU also has a Clubs & Societies Officer who is responsible for helping establish and run the various clubs and societies in the college. There is also an assistant manager who is responsible for the college entertainments. The SU Manager manages the staff and daily running of the SU. The Students' Union organizes a number of different events throughout the year from [[Freshers Week]], Halloween Ball, [[Thanksgiving]], [[Diwali]], [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], Christmas Ball and the formal Griffith Ball which takes place towards the end of the year.\n\n==Sabbatical Officers==\nThe following table outlines Griffith College SU Officers and staff from the Union's beginnings in 2000 to the current day.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\"text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n!colspan=16| Sabbatical Executive Officers (Directly Elected by the Union Membership)\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n!

Author article in English on WordPress, philosophy website</ref>, the word [[lingam]] is related to the Old English word [[slinkan]] and these related words in other languages that express the shrinkage and with that mutual renewal as we find in slugs or snails and thus express the ability of the human genitals. Also in Slavic languages we find this ancient relation of the word lingam with expressions for slugs, eg in the Upper Sorbian [[\u0161link]] or Slovak [[slim\u00e1k]]. Thus, in the Indian worship of lingam is this essential feature of the miraculousness of human genitals.  This fact is also found in the ancient depictions of the Greek gods. The original lingam therefore has this meaning, but the indian depiction of lingam with [[yoni]] is, of course, just the depiction of the [[clitoris]], while yoni retains unclosed, imperfect, which is very unusual compared to the other best known religious symbols.\n\n== Nomenclature and significance==\n[[File:ShivaLingam new.png|alt=|thumb|338x338px|Lingam as interpreted in [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] tradition which is a major school of [[Shaivism]].

For, still reeling from the onslaught of the Muslim campaigns against lingams, the Hindus who worked with and for the British internalized their colonizers' scorn.\"}} The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper-sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute.<ref name=dasgupta107/><ref name=\"Ramos2017p56\">{{cite book|author=Imma Ramos|title=Pilgrimage and Politics in Colonial Bengal: The Myth of the Goddess Sati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRhdDgAAQBAJ |year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-84000-2|pages=56\u201358}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Hugh B.

Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to \"proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction\".<ref name=\"Ramos2017p56\"/>\n\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first ''Kamasutra'' translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883.{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=500\u2013502}} In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided being viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=500\u2013502}} This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\"{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=500\u2013502}} Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had \"a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies\" and they became \"ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature\".{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=499\u2013505}} Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=499\u2013505}}\n\n==Iconography and worship==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = A river and decorated Shiva linga pooja, Hindu rituals.jpg\n| width1 = 272\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Lord Shiva devotees offering milk, flowers, fruits and bel leaves on a Shivaling for seeking divine blessings, in a city temple at the celebration of Maha Shivaratri, in New Delhi on February 23, 2009 (1).jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Linga-yoni worship in different ways; Left: river, Right: temple.\n}}\nThe traditional lingam rituals in major Shiva temples includes offerings of flowers, grass, dried rice, fruits, leaves, water and a milk bath.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Priests chant hymns, while the devotees go the sanctum for a ''[[darshana]]'' followed by a clockwise circumambulation of the sanctum.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> On the sanctum walls, typically are reliefs of Dakshinamurti, Brahma and Vishnu.

Author article in English on WordPress, philosophy website</ref>, the word [[lingam]] is related to the Old English word [[slinkan]] and these related words in other languages that express the shrinkage and with that mutual renewal as we find in slugs or snails and thus express the ability of the human genitals. Also in Slavic languages we find this ancient relation of the word lingam with expressions for slugs, eg in the Upper Sorbian [[\u0161link]] or Slovak [[slim\u00e1k]]. Thus, in the Indian worship of lingam is this essential feature of the miraculousness of human genitals.  This fact is also found in the ancient depictions of the Greek gods. The original lingam therefore has this meaning, but the indian depiction of lingam with [[yoni]] is, of course, just the depiction of the [[clitoris]], while yoni retains unclosed, imperfect, which is very unusual compared to the other best known religious symbols.\n\n== Nomenclature and significance==\n[[File:ShivaLingam new.png|alt=|thumb|338x338px|Lingam as interpreted in [[Shaiva Siddhanta]] tradition which is a major school of [[Shaivism]].

A part of the literature corpus regards ''lingam'' to be sexual and the phallus of Shiva, while another group of texts does not. Sexuality in the former is inherently sacred and spiritual, while the latter emphasizes the ascetic nature of Shiva and renunciation to be spiritual symbolism of ''lingam''. This tension between the pursuit of spirituality through householder lifestyle and the pursuit of renunciate sannyasi lifestyle is historic, reflects the different interpretations of the lingam and what lingam worship means to its devotees.

Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation.{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=500\u2013502}} This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\"{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=500\u2013502}} Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had \"a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies\" and they became \"ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature\".{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=499\u2013505}} Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.{{sfn |Doniger |2011 |pp=499\u2013505}}\n\n==Iconography and worship==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = A river and decorated Shiva linga pooja, Hindu rituals.jpg\n| width1 = 272\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Lord Shiva devotees offering milk, flowers, fruits and bel leaves on a Shivaling for seeking divine blessings, in a city temple at the celebration of Maha Shivaratri, in New Delhi on February 23, 2009 (1).jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Linga-yoni worship in different ways; Left: river, Right: temple.\n}}\nThe traditional lingam rituals in major Shiva temples includes offerings of flowers, grass, dried rice, fruits, leaves, water and a milk bath.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Priests chant hymns, while the devotees go the sanctum for a ''[[darshana]]'' followed by a clockwise circumambulation of the sanctum.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> On the sanctum walls, typically are reliefs of Dakshinamurti, Brahma and Vishnu.

Moor]], one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of [[computer ethics]], defines four kinds of ethical robots. As an extensive researcher on the studies of [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[logic]], Moor defines machines to be ethical impact agents, implicit ethical agents, explicit ethical agents, or full ethical agents. A machine can be more than one type of agent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moor |first1=James M. |title=Four Kinds of Ethical Robots |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots |website=Philosophy Now |date=2009}}</ref>\n*'''Ethical impact agents''': These are machine systems that carry an ethical impact whether intended or not. At the same time, these agents have the potential to act unethical. Moor gives a hypothetical example called the 'Goodman agent', named after philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]. The Goodman agent compares dates but has the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]]. This bug resulted from programmers who represented dates with only the last two digits of the year. So any dates beyond 2000 would be misleadingly treated as earlier than those in the late twentieth century. Thus the Goodman agent was an ethical impact agent before 2000, and an unethical impact agent thereafter.\n*'''Implicit ethical agents''': For the consideration of human [[safety]], these agents are programmed to have a [[fail-safe]], or a built-in virtue. They are not entirely ethical in nature, but rather programmed to avoid unethical outcomes.\n*'''Explicit ethical agents''': These are machines that are capable of processing scenarios and acting on ethical decisions. Machines which have algorithms to act ethically.\n*'''Full ethical agents''': These machines are similar to explicit ethical agents in being able to make ethical decisions. However, they also contain human [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] features. (i.e. have [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and [[intentionality]])\n(See [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].)\n\n==Focuses of machine ethics==\n\n=== AI control problem ===\n{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|AI control problem}}\n\nSome scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes \"[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]\", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.<ref name=\"superintelligence\">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}</ref>  In their respective books ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'' and ''[[Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control|Human Compatible]]'', both scholars assert that while there is much uncertainty regarding the future of AI, the risk to humanity is great enough to merit significant action in the present.\n\nThis presents the [[AI control problem]]: how to build an intelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. The danger of not designing control right \"the first time,\" is that a superintelligence may be able to seize power over its environment and prevent humans from shutting it down. Potential AI control strategies include \"capability control\" (limiting an AI's ability to influence the world) and \"motivational control\" (building an AI whose goals are aligned with human values).

Moor]], one of the pioneering theoreticians in the field of [[computer ethics]], defines four kinds of ethical robots. As an extensive researcher on the studies of [[philosophy of artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of science]], and [[logic]], Moor defines machines to be ethical impact agents, implicit ethical agents, explicit ethical agents, or full ethical agents. A machine can be more than one type of agent.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moor |first1=James M. |title=Four Kinds of Ethical Robots |url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/72/Four_Kinds_of_Ethical_Robots |website=Philosophy Now |date=2009}}</ref>\n*'''Ethical impact agents''': These are machine systems that carry an ethical impact whether intended or not. At the same time, these agents have the potential to act unethical. Moor gives a hypothetical example called the 'Goodman agent', named after philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]. The Goodman agent compares dates but has the [[Year 2000 problem|millennium bug]]. This bug resulted from programmers who represented dates with only the last two digits of the year. So any dates beyond 2000 would be misleadingly treated as earlier than those in the late twentieth century. Thus the Goodman agent was an ethical impact agent before 2000, and an unethical impact agent thereafter.\n*'''Implicit ethical agents''': For the consideration of human [[safety]], these agents are programmed to have a [[fail-safe]], or a built-in virtue. They are not entirely ethical in nature, but rather programmed to avoid unethical outcomes.\n*'''Explicit ethical agents''': These are machines that are capable of processing scenarios and acting on ethical decisions. Machines which have algorithms to act ethically.\n*'''Full ethical agents''': These machines are similar to explicit ethical agents in being able to make ethical decisions. However, they also contain human [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] features. (i.e. have [[free will]], [[consciousness]] and [[intentionality]])\n(See [[Moral responsibility#Artificial systems|artificial systems and moral responsibility]].)\n\n==Focuses of machine ethics==\n\n=== AI control problem ===\n{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|AI control problem}}\n\nSome scholars, such as philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] and AI researcher [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]], argue that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes \"[[superintelligence|superintelligent]]\", then this new superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control: just as the fate of the [[mountain gorilla]] depends on human goodwill, so might the fate of humanity depend on the actions of a future machine superintelligence.<ref name=\"superintelligence\">{{cite book|last1=Bostrom|first1=Nick|author-link=Nick Bostrom|title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|date=2014|isbn=978-0199678112|edition=First|title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies}}</ref>  In their respective books ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|Superintelligence]]'' and ''[[Human Compatible: Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control|Human Compatible]]'', both scholars assert that while there is much uncertainty regarding the future of AI, the risk to humanity is great enough to merit significant action in the present.\n\nThis presents the [[AI control problem]]: how to build an intelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. The danger of not designing control right \"the first time,\" is that a superintelligence may be able to seize power over its environment and prevent humans from shutting it down. Potential AI control strategies include \"capability control\" (limiting an AI's ability to influence the world) and \"motivational control\" (building an AI whose goals are aligned with human values).  There are a number of organizations researching the AI control problem, including the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], the [[Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence]], and the [[Future of Life Institute]].\n\n===Algorithms and training===\n\nAI paradigms have been debated over, especially in relation to their efficacy and bias. [[Nick Bostrom]] and [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] have argued for [[decision trees]] (such as [[ID3 algorithm|ID3]]) over [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[Genetic algorithm|genetic algorithms]] on the grounds that decision trees obey modern social norms of transparency and predictability (e.g. ''[[stare decisis]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | title= The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence | first1= Nick | last1= Bostrom | authorlink1= Nick Bostrom | first2= Eliezer | last2= Yudkowsky | authorlink2= Eliezer Yudkowsky | year= 2011 | work= Cambridge Handbook of Artificial Intelligence | publisher= [[Cambridge Press]] | access-date= 2011-06-28 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304015020/http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/artificial-intelligence.pdf | archive-date= 2016-03-04 | url-status= dead }}</ref> In contrast, Chris Santos-Lang argued in favor of neural networks and genetic algorithms on the grounds that the norms of any age must be allowed to change and that natural failure to fully satisfy these particular norms has been essential in making humans less vulnerable than machines to criminal \"[[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]]\".<ref name=\"SantosLang2002\">{{cite web | url= http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | title= Ethics for Artificial Intelligences | first= Chris | last= Santos-Lang | year= 2002 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111203030304/http://knol.google.com/k/chris-santos-lang/ethics-for-artificial-intelligences/3iue30fi4gfq9/1 | archivedate= 2011-12-03 }}</ref><ref name=\"SantosLang2014\">{{cite book |last=Santos-Lang |first=Christopher | year=2014 |editor1-first=Simon |editor1-last=van Rysewyk  |editor2-first=Matthijs |editor2-last=Pontier |title=Machine Medical Ethics |volume=74 |publisher=Springer | location=Switzerland | pages=111\u2013127 | chapter=Moral Ecology Approaches to Machine Ethics| chapter-url=http://grinfree.com/MoralEcology.pdf | doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08108-3_8|series=Intelligent Systems, Control and Automation: Science and Engineering |isbn=978-3-319-08107-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, in an experiment at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems in the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne|Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale]] of [[Lausanne]] in [[Switzerland]], AI robots were programmed to cooperate with each other and tasked with the goal of searching for a beneficial resource while avoiding a poisonous resource.<ref>[http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/evolving-robots-learn-lie-hide-resources-each-other Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other], Popular Science, August 18, 2009</ref> During the experiment, the robots were grouped into clans, and the successful members' digital genetic code was used for the next generation, a type of algorithm known as a [[genetic algorithm]].

The robots then learned to lie to each other in an attempt to hoard the beneficial resource from other robots.<ref>Evolving Robots Learn To Lie To Each Other, Popular Science, August 18, 2009</ref>  In the same experiment, the same AI robots also learned to behave selflessly and signaled danger to other robots, and also died at the cost to save other robots.<ref>Santos-Lang, Chris (2002). \"Ethics for Artificial Intelligences\".

They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.<ref name=\"nytimes july09\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.</ref>\n\nSome experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.</ref> The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going \"Terminator\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728101106/http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm |date=2009-07-28 }}, by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.</ref><ref>[https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass], by Joseph L.

{"title_page": "Occitan literature", "text_new": "{{POV|date=September 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2016}}\n'''Occitan literature''' (referred to in older texts as '''Proven\u00e7al literature''') is a body of texts written in [[Occitan language|Occitan]], mostly in the south of France. It was the first literature in a [[Romance language]] and inspired the rise of [[vernacular literature]] throughout medieval Europe. Occitan literature's Golden Age was in the 12th century, when a rich and complex body of lyrical poetry was produced by [[troubadour]]s writing in [[Old Occitan]], which still survives to this day. Although [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is considered by some a variety of Occitan, this article will not deal with [[Catalan literature]], which started diverging from its Southern French counterpart in the late 13th century.\n\n==Introduction==\nOccitan [[literature]] started in the 11th century in several centres. It gradually spread from there, first over the greater portion (though not the whole) of southern France, and then into [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], Portugal and into what is now the north of Italy.\n\nIn its rise Occitan literature stands completely by itself, and in its development it long continued to be highly original. It presents at several points analogies with French literature; but these analogies are due principally to certain primary elements common to both and only in a slight degree to mutual reaction.\n\n==Origin==\n\nOccitan poetry first appeared in the 11th century. The oldest surviving text is the Proven\u00e7al [[Refrain|burden]] (Fr. \"refrain\") attached to a 10th-century Latin poem.<ref>''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsche Philologie'', 1881, p. 335</ref> The text has not yet been satisfactorily interpreted. The quality of the earliest remaining works suggest earlier work was lost.\n \nThe earliest Occitan poem is a 10th-century, seventeen-line charm ''[[Tomida femina]]'' probably for dispersing the pain of childbirth. Much longer is an 11th-century fragment of two hundred and fifty-seven [[decasyllabic]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s preserved in an [[Orl\u00e9ans]] manuscript, first printed by [[Raynouard]].<ref>''Choix des poesies originales des troubadours'', 1817</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have come from [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] or [[County of La Marche|Marche]] in the north of the Occitan region. The unknown author takes [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]'s treatise ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De consolatione philosophiae]]'' as the groundwork of his composition. The poem is a didactic piece composed by a clerk. The ''[[Can\u00e7\u00f3 de Santa Fe]]'' dates from 1054&ndash;1076, but probably represents a Catalan dialect that evolved into a distinct language from Occitan. From the same century there is ''[[Las, qu'i non sun sparvir, astur]]'', a secular love poem.\n\nFrom the next century are the poems of [[William IX of Aquitaine|William (Guilhem) IX]], the grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine. They consist of eleven diverse strophic pieces, and were consequently meant to be sung. Several are love songs. The only one which can be approximately dated was composed around 1119, when William was setting out for Spain to fight the [[Saracens]]. It expresses the writer's regret for the frivolity of his past life and his apprehensions as he bade farewell to his country and his young son. We also know from [[Ordericus Vitalis]] that William had composed various poems on the incidents of his ill-fated [[Crusade of 1101]]. In one of his pieces<ref>''Ben voil que sapchon ii plusor''</ref> he makes an allusion to the [[partimen]].\n\nThe origins of this poetry are uncertain. It bears no relation to [[Latin poetry]], nor to folklore. Vernacular compositions seem to have been at first produced for the amusement, or in the case of religious poetry, for the edification, of that part of lay society which had leisure and lands, and reckoned intellectual pastime among the good things of life.\n\nIn the 11th century, vernacular poetry served mainly the amusement and edification of the upper class. By the 12th and 13th centuries, historical works and popular treatises on contemporary science were composed in the vernacular.\n\nOccitan poetry may have originated amongst the [[jester]]s. Some, leaving [[jester|buffoonery]] to the ruder and less intelligent members of the profession, devoted themselves to the composition of pieces intended for singing. In the north, the jesters produced ''[[chansons de geste]]'' full of tales of battle and combat. In the courts of the southern nobles they produced love songs.\n\n==Age of the troubadours==\nStarting in the early 12th century, the best-known body of Occitan literature originated with the group of poets who would later become known as troubadours, from the verb \"trobar\", meaning \"to invent\". The troubadours used a standardized form of Old Occitan (one probably based on the dialect of [[Limoges]]), sang their pieces to music and generally used complex and elaborate meters. Their poetry was usually lyrical, with a minority of pieces of satirical, political, moralistic, religious or erotic nature.\n\n===Early period===\nThe first known troubadour was [[William IX, Duke of Aquitaine]] whose works gave the movement a position of honor, and indirectly contributed in a very powerful degree to ensure its development and preservation.\nShortly after him, centres of poetic activity made their appearance in various places, first in Limousin and [[Gascony]]. In the former province lived ''Ebolus cantator'' (a singer named [[Eble II of Ventadorn|Eble]]), who during the second part of William of Poitiers' life seems to have been brought into relation with him, and according to a contemporary historian, [[Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois|Geoffroy, prior of Vigeois]], ''erat valde gratiosus in cantilenis'' (\"gave a great deal of pleasure by his songs\"). None of his compositions survive; but under his influence [[Bernart de Ventadorn|Bernart of Ventadour]] was trained to poetry, who, though only the son of one of the serving-men of the castle, managed to gain the love of the lady of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ventadour|Ventadour]], and when on the discovery of their amour he had to depart elsewhere, received a gracious welcome from [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], consort (from 1152) of [[Henry II of England]]. Of Bernart's compositions we possess about fifty songs of elegant simplicity, some of which may be taken as the most perfect specimens of love poetry Occitan literature has ever produced. Bernart must therefore have been in repute before the middle of the 12th century; and his poetic career extended well on towards its close.\n\nAt the same period, or probably a little earlier, flourished [[Cercamon]], of genuine importance among the [[troubadour]]s both because of his early date and because definite information regarding him has been preserved. He was a Gascon, and composed, says his old biographer, pastorals according to the ancient custom (''pastorelas a la uzansa antiga''). This is the record of the appearance in the south of France of a poetic form which ultimately acquired large development. The period at which Cercamon lived is determined by a piece where he alludes very clearly to the approaching marriage of the king of France, [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], with Eleanor of Aquitaine (1137). Among the earliest troubadours may also be reckoned [[Marcabru]], a pupil of Cercamon, from whose pen we have about forty pieces, those which can be approximately dated ranging from 1135 to 1148 or thereabout. This poet has great originality of thought and style. His songs, several of which are historical, are free from the commonplaces of their class, and contain curious strictures on the corruptions of the time.\n\n===Golden age: trobar leu, troubar clus, and trobar ric===\nWe cannot here do more than enumerate the leading troubadours and briefly indicate in what conditions their poetry was developed and through what circumstances it fell into decay and finally disappeared: [[Peire d'Alvernha]], who in certain respects must be classed with Marcabru; [[Arnaut Daniel]], remarkable for his complicated versification, the inventor of the [[sestina]], a poetic form for which Dante and [[Petrarch]] express an admiration difficult for us to understand; [[Arnaut de Mareuil]]; [[Bertran de Born]], now the most generally known of all the troubadours on account of the part he is said to have played both by his sword and his sirveniescs in the struggle between Henry II of England and his rebel sons, though the importance of his part in the events of the time seems to have been greatly exaggerated; [[Peire Vidal]] of Toulouse, a poet of varied inspiration who grew rich with gifts bestowed on him by the greatest nobles of his time; [[Giraut de Bornelh|Guiraut de Borneil]], ''lo macsire dels trobadors'', and at any rate master in the art of the so-called close style (''trebar clus''), though he has also left us some songs of charming simplicity; [[Gaucelm Faidit]], from whom we have a touching lament (''plaint'') on the death of [[Richard I of England|Richard C\u0153ur de Lion]]; [[Folquet de Marselha|Folquet of Marseille]], the most powerful thinker among the poets of the south, who from being a merchant and troubadour became an [[abbot]], and finally [[bishop of Toulouse]] (d. 1231).\n\n===Later troubadours, and foreign ones===\nAs the troubadours started scattering from Southern France after the Albigensian crusade, the quality of their poetry decayed sharply: [[Dante]], in his [[De vulgari eloquentia]] mentions only authors of the previous generation (Peire d'Alvernha, Giraut de Bornelh, Bertran de Born and Arnaut Daniel) as models of vernacular literature. However, the presence of troubadours in foreign courts engendered a number of imitators in [[Catalonia]] (for example [[Cerver\u00ec de Girona]]) and Italy ([[Sordello]], [[Lanfranc Cigala]], [[Rambertino Buvalelli]]).\n\n===Troubadours and society===\nIt is not without interest to discover to what social classes the troubadours belonged. Many of them, there is no doubt, had a very humble origin. Bernart of Ventadour's father was a servant, Peire Vidal's a maker of furred garments, [[Perdigon]]'s a fisher. Others belonged to the [[bourgeoisie]], Peire d'Alvernha, for example, Peire Raimon of Toulouse, and Elias Fonsalada. Likewise we see merchants' sons as troubadours; this was the case with Folquet of Marseille and [[Aimeric de Peguilhan]]. A great many were clerics, or at least studied for the Church, for instance, Arnaut de Mareuil, [[Uc de Saint Circ]], [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Hugh Brunet]], [[Peire Cardenal]]; some had even taken orders: the [[monk of Montaudon]] and [[Gaubert de Puicibot]]. Ecclesiastical authority did not always tolerate this breach of discipline. [[Gui d'Ussel]], canon and troubadour, was obliged by the injunction of the [[pontifical legate]] to give up his song-making; Folquet, too, renounced it when he took orders. One point is particularly striking, the number of monarchs and nobles who were troubadours: [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Pons de Capdoill]], [[Guilhem Ademar]], [[Cadenet (troubadour)|Cadenet]], [[Peirol]], [[Raimbaut de Vacqueiras]], and many more. Some of this group were poor knights whose incomes were insufficient to support their rank, and took up poetry not merely for their own pleasure, but for the sake of the gifts to be obtained from the rich whose courts they frequented. A very different position was occupied by such wealthy and powerful people as William of Poitiers, [[Raimbaut of Orange|Raimbaut d'Aurenga]], the [[viscount of Saint Antonin]], [[Guillem de Bergued\u00e0]] and [[Blacatz]].\n\nThe profession was entirely dependent on the existence and prosperity of the feudal courts. The troubadours could hardly expect to obtain a livelihood from any other quarter than the generosity of the great. It will consequently be well to mention the more important at least of those princes who are known to have been patrons and some of them practisers of the poetic art. They are arranged approximately in geographical order, and after each are inserted the names of those troubadours with whom they were connected.\n\n===Patronage===\nWhile the troubadours found protectors in Catalonia, Castile and Italy, they do not seem to have been welcomed in French-speaking countries. This, however, must not be taken too absolutely. Occitan poetry was appreciated in the north of France. There is reason to believe that when [[Constance d'Arles|Constance]], daughter of one of the counts of [[Arles]], was married in 1001 to [[Robert II of France|Robert, king of France]], she brought along with her Proven\u00e7al jongleurs. Poems by troubadours are quoted in the French romances of the beginning of the 13th century; some of them are transcribed in the old collections of French songs, and the preacher [[Robert de Sorbon]] informs us in a curious passage that one day a jongleur sang a poem by Folquet of Marseilles at the court of the king of France. Since the countries of the [[O\u00efl languages|langue d'oil]] had a full developed literature of their own, the troubadours generally preferred to go to regions where they had less competition.\n\nThe decline and fall of troubadour poetry was mainly due to political causes. When about the beginning of the 13th century the [[Albigensian Crusade]] led by the French king had decimated and ruined the nobility and reduced to lasting poverty a part of the Occitan territories, the profession of troubadour ceased to be lucrative. It was then that many of those poets went to spend their last days in the north of Spain and Italy, where Occitan poetry had for more than one generation been highly esteemed. Following their example, other poets who were not natives of the south of France began to compose in Occitan, and this fashion continued till, about the middle of the 13th century, they gradually abandoned the foreign tongue in northern Italy, and somewhat later in [[Catalonia]], and took to singing the same airs in the local dialects. About the same time in the Proven\u00e7al region the flame of poetry had died out save in a few places, [[Narbonne]], [[Rodez]], [[Foix]] and [[Astarac]] where it kept burning feebly for a little longer. In the 14th century, composition in the language of the country was still practised; but the productions of this period are mainly works for instruction and edification, translations from Latin or sometimes even from French, with an occasional romance. As for the poetry of the troubadours, it was dead for ever.\n\n====France====\n* [[Henry the Young King]], son of [[Henry II of England]]: [[Bertran de Born]] (?)\n* [[Richard I of England|Richard Coeur de Lion]]: [[Arnaut Daniel]], [[Peire Vidal]], [[Folquet de Marselha]], [[Gaucelm Faidit]]\n* [[Ermengarde of Narbonne]] (1143&ndash;1192): Bernart de Ventadour, [[Peire Rogier]], [[Peire d'Alvernha]]\n* [[Raymond V of Toulouse|Raimon V]], [[count of Toulouse]] (1143&ndash;1194): Bernart de Ventadour, Peire Rogier, [[Peire Raimon]], [[Hugh Brunet]], Peire Vidal, Folquet de Marselha, [[Bernart de Durfort]]\n* [[Raymond VI of Toulouse|Raimon VI]], count of Toulouse (1194&ndash;1222): [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Aimeric de Peguihan]], [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Ademar le Negre]], [[Savaric de Malleo]]\n* [[Alfonso II, Count of Provence|Alfonso II]], [[count of Provence]] (1185&ndash;1209): [[Elias de Barjols]]\n* [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence|Raimon Berenguer IV]], count of Provence (1209&ndash;1245): [[Sordello]]\n* [[Raymond Geoffrey II of Marseille]] (d. 1192): Peire Vidal, Folquet de Marselha\n* [[Maria de Ventadorn]] (d. 1222), Gaucelm Faidit, [[Gui d'Ussel]]\n* [[William VIII of Montpellier]] (1172&ndash;1204): [[Peire Raimon]], [[Arnaut de Mareuil]], Folquet de Marselha, [[Guiraut de Calanson]], [[Aimeric de Sarlat]]\n* [[Dalfi d'Alvernha]] (1169&ndash;1234): [[Peirol]], [[Perdigon]], [[Peire de Maensac]], Gaucelm Faidit, [[Uc de Saint Circ]]\n* [[Guillaume des Baux]], [[prince of Orange]] (1182&ndash;1218): [[Raimbaut de Vacqueiras]], Perdigon\n* [[Savaric de Malleo]] (1200&ndash;1230): [[Jausbert de Puycibot]], Uc de Saint Circ\n* [[Blacatz]], a Proven\u00e7al noble (1200&ndash;1236): [[Cadenet (troubadour)|Cadenet]], [[Jean d'Aubusson]], Sordello, [[Guillem Figueira]]\n* [[Hugh II of Rodez|Hugh II]], [[count of Rodez]] (1156&ndash;1208): [[Uc Brunet]], [[Bernart de Venzac]]\n* [[Henry I of Rodez|Henry I]], count of Rodez (1208&ndash;c.1222): Uc de Saint Circ\n* [[Hugh IV of Rodez|Hugh IV]] (1222&ndash;1274) and [[Henry II of Rodez|Henry II]] (1274&ndash;1302), counts of Rodez: [[Guiraut Riquier]], [[Folquet de Lunel]], [[Serveri de Girone]], [[Bertran Carbonel]]\n* [[Nu\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez]], count of Roussillon (d. 1241): Aimeric de Belenoi\n* [[Bernard IV d'Astarac]] (1249&ndash;1291): Guiraut Riquier, [[Amanieu de Sescas]]\n\n====Aragon====\n* [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] (1162&ndash;1196): Peire Rogier, Peire Raimon, Peire Vidal, Cadenet, [[Guiraut de Cabreira]], Elias de Barjols, the [[Monk of Montaudon]], Hugh Brunet\n* [[Peter II of Aragon]] (1196&ndash;1213): Raimon de Miraval, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Perdigon, Ademar lo Negre, Hugh of Saint Circq\n* [[James I of Aragon]] (1213&ndash;1276): Peire Cardinal, [[Bernart Sicart de Maruejols]], Guiraut Riquier, [[At de Mons]]\n* [[Peter III of Aragon]] (1276&ndash;1285): [[Paulet of Marseilles]], Guiraut Riquier, Serveri de Girone\n\n====Castile and Leon====\n* [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n]] (1138&ndash;1214): [[Elias Cairel]], Peire Rogier, Guiraut de Borneil, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Hugh de Saint Circq\n* [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] (1158&ndash;1214): [[Uc de Lescura]]\n* [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (1252&ndash;1284): [[Bertran de Lamanon]], [[Bonifaci Calvo]], Guiraut Riquier, Folquet de Lund, [[Arnaut Plages]], Bertran Carbonel\n\n====Italy====\n* [[Boniface II of Montferrat]] (1192&ndash;1207): Peire Vidal, Raimbaut de Vacqueiras, [[Elias Cairel]], Gaucelm Faidit (?)\n* [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], emperor (1215&ndash;1250): Jean d'Aubusson, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Guillem Figueira\n* [[Azzo VI]], [[marquis of Este]] (1196&ndash;1212): Airneric de Pegulhan, [[Rambertin de Buvalelli]]\n* [[Azzo VII of Este|Azzo VII]], marquis of Este (1215&ndash;1264): Aimeric de Pegulhan\n\n==Form==\n\nOriginally the poems of the troubadours were intended to be sung. The poet usually composed the music as well as the words; and in several cases he owed his fame more to his musical than to his literary ability. Two manuscripts preserve specimens of the music of the troubadours, but, though the subject has been recently investigated, we are hardly able to form a clear opinion of the originality and of the merits of these musical compositions. The following are the principal poetic forms which the troubadours employed. The oldest and most usual generic term is ''[[Lyrics|vers]]'', by which is understood any composition intended to be sung, no matter what the subject. At the close of the 12th century, it became customary to call all verse treating of love ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'' the name ''vers'' being then more generally reserved for poems on other themes. The ''[[sirventesc]]'' differs from the vers and the canso only by its subject, being for the most part devoted to moral and political topics.\n\nPeire Cardinal is celebrated for the sirventescs he composed against the clergy of his time. The political poems of Bertran de Born are sirventescs. There is reason to believe that originally this word meant simply a poem composed by a ''sirvent'' (Latin ''serviens'') or man-at-arms. The sirventesc is very frequently composed in the form, sometimes even with rhymes, of a love song having acquired some popularity, so that it might be sung to the same air.\n\nThe '''''tenson''''' is a debate between two interlocutors, each of whom has a stanza or more generally a group of lines (each group having the same structure) in turn.\n\nThe [[partimen]] (French ''jeu parti'') is also a poetic debate, but it differs from the tenson insofar that the range of debate is limited. In the first stanza one of the partners proposes two alternatives; the other partner chooses one of them and defends it, the opposite side remaining to be defended by the original propounder. Often in a final couplet a judge or arbiter is appointed to decide between the parties. This poetic game is mentioned by William, count of Poitiers, at the end of the 11th century. The ''[[pastoreta]]'', afterwards ''[[pastorela]]'', is in general an account of the love adventures of a knight with a shepherdess. All these classes have one form capable of endless variations: five or more stanzas and one or two [[envoi]]s. The ''[[dansa]]'' and ''[[Balaresc|balada]]'', intended to mark the time in dancing, are pieces with a refrain. The [[aubade]], which has also a refrain, is, as the name indicates, a waking or morning song at the dawning of the day. All those classes are in stanzas. The ''[[descort]]'' is not thus divided, and consequently it must be set to music right through. Its name is derived from the fact that, its component parts not being equal, there is a kind of discord between them. It is generally reserved for themes of love. Other kinds of lyric poems, sometimes with nothing new about them except the name, were developed in the Occitan regions; but those here mentioned are the more important.\n\n===Narrative poetry===\n\nAlthough the lyrical poetry of the troubadours formed the most original part of Occitan literature, it was not the only kind. Narrative poetry, especially, received in Occitania a great development, and, thanks to recent discoveries, a considerable body of it has already become known. Several classes must be distinguished: the ''[[chanson de geste]]'', legendary or apparently historical, the romance of adventure and the [[novel]]. All these poems are in the form of ''chansons de geste'', that is, in stanzas of indefinite length, with a single rhyme.\n\nOne notable example is the saga of Girart de Roussillon, a poem of ten thousand verses, which relates the struggles of [[Charles Martel]] with his powerful vassal the Burgundian [[Gerard of Roussillon]]. Girart de Roussillon belongs only within certain limits to the Occitan literature, as it exists in two versions, one in Old Occitan and one in a hybrid language, which seems to have originated on the borders of Limousin and [[Poitou]]; both are probably a recast of an older poem, probably either of French or Burgundian origin, which is no longer extant.\n\nTo Limousin also seems to belong the poem of Aigar and Maurin (end of the 12th century), of which we have only a fragment so short that the subject cannot be clearly made out.\n\nOf less heroic character is the poem of [[Daurel and Beton]] (first half of the 13th century), connected with the [[cycle of Charlemagne]] but, judging by the romantic character of the events, more like a regular romance of adventure. We cannot, however, form a complete judgment in regard to it, as the only manuscript in which it has been preserved is defective at the close, and that to an amount there is no means of ascertaining.\nMidway between legend and history may be classified the ''[[Canso d'Antioca|Cans\u00f3 d'Antioca]]'', a mere fragment of which, 700 verses, has been recovered in [[Madrid]] and published in ''[[Archives de l'Orient latin]]'', vol. ii. This poem, which seems to have been composed by a [[Gregoire Bechada]], mentioned in a 12th-century chronicle and written in Limousin <ref>Paris, ''Romania'', xxii. 358</ref> is one of the sources of the Spanish compilation ''[[La gran conquista de Ultramar]]''.\nTo history proper belongs the ''[[Song of the Albigensian Crusade]]'', which, in its present state, is composed of two poems tacked onto each other: the first, containing the events from the beginning of the crusade till 1213, is the work of a cleric named [[William of Tudela]], a moderate supporter of the crusaders; the second, from 1213 to 1218, is by a vehement opponent of the enterprise. The language and style of the two parts differs as well.\nFinally, around 1280, [[Guillaume Anelier]], a native of [[Toulouse]], composed a poem on the war carried on in [[Navarre]] by the French in 1276 and 1277. It is an historical work of little literary merit.\n\nGerard of Roussillon, Aigar and Maurin and Daurel and Beton are in verses of ten, the others in verses of twelve syllables. The peculiarity of the versification in Gerard is that the pause in the line occurs after the sixth syllable, and not, as is usual, after the fourth.\n\nLike the chanson de geste, the romance of adventure is but slightly represented in the south; but it is to be remembered that many works of this class must have perished, as evidenced by the fact that, with few exceptions, the narrative poems which survived are known by a single manuscript only. Only three Proven\u00e7al romances of adventure are extant, ''[[Jaufri]]'' (composed in the middle of the 13th century and dedicated to a [[List of Aragonese monarchs|king of Aragon]], possibly [[James I of Aragon|James I]]), ''[[Blandin of Cornwall]]'' and ''[[Guillem de La Barra]]''. The first two are connected with the [[Arthurian cycle]]. The ''romance of Guillem de La Barra'' tells a strange story also found in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'' (2nd Day, viii.); it was finished in 1318, and is dedicated to a noble of [[Languedoc]] called [[Sicart de Montaut]]. Of these, only ''Jaufri'' is considered of any literary merit .{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nConnected with the romance of adventure is the novel (''novas'' in Occitan), which is originally an account of an event newly happened. The novel must have been at first in the south what, as we see by the ''Decameron'', it was in Italy, a society pastime with the wits in turn relating anecdotes, true or imaginary, which they think likely to amuse their auditors. But before long this kind of production was treated in verse, the form adopted being that of the romances of adventure [[octosyllabic]] verses rhyming in pairs. Some of those novels which have come down to us may be ranked with the most graceful works in Proven\u00e7al literature; two are from the pen of the [[List of Catalan people|Catalan]] author [[Raimon Vidal de Besalu]]. One, the ''Castia-gilos'' (the ''Chastisement of the Jealous Man''), is a treatment, not easily matched for elegance, of a frequently-handled theme the story of the husband who, in order to entrap his wife, takes the disguise of the lover whom she is expecting and receives with satisfaction blows intended, as he thinks, for him whose part he is playing; the other, ''The Judgment of Love'', is the recital of a question of the law of love, departing considerably from the subjects usually treated in the novels. Mention may also be made of the novel of ''The Parrot'' by [[Arnaut de Carcassonne]], in which the principal character is a [[parrot]] of great eloquence and ability, who succeeds marvellously in securing the success of the amorous enterprises of his master.\n\nNovels came to be extended to the proportions of a long romance. ''[[Romance of Flamenca|Flamenca]]'', which belongs to the novel type, has still over eight thousand verses, though the only MS. of it has lost some leaves both at the beginning and at the end. This poem, composed in all probability in 1234, is the story of a lady who by very ingenious devices, not unlike those employed in the ''[[Miles gloriosus]]'' of [[Plautus]], succeeds in eluding the vigilance of her jealous husband. No analysis can be given here of a work the action of which is highly complicated; suffice it to remark that there is no book in [[medieval literature]] which betokens so much quickness of intellect and is so instructive in regard to the manners and usages of polite society in the 13th century. We know that novels were in great favor in the south of France, although the specimens preserved are not very numerous. Statements made by [[Francesco da Barberino]] (early part of the 14th century), and recently brought to light, give us a glimpse of several works of this class which have been lost. From the Occitan territories the novel spread into Catalonia, where we find in the 14th century a number of novels in verse very similar to the Proven\u00e7al ones, and into Italy, where in general the prose form has been adopted.\n\n==Didactic and religious poetry==\n\nCompositions intended for instruction, correction and edification were very numerous in the south of France as well as elsewhere, and, in spite of the enormous losses sustained by Proven\u00e7al literature, much of this kind still remains. But it is seldom that such works have much originality or literary value. Originality was naturally absent, as the aim of the writers was mainly to bring the teachings contained in Latin works within the reach of lay hearers or readers. Literary value was not of course excluded by the lack of originality, but by an unfortunate chance the greater part of those who sought to instruct or edify, and attempted to substitute moral works for secular productions in favor with the people, were, with a few exceptions, persons of limited ability. It would be out of question to enumerate here all the didactic treatises, all the lives of saints, all the treatises of popular theology and morals, all the books of devotion, all the pious canticles, composed in Occitan verse during the Middle Ages; still some of these poems may be singled out.\n\n[[Daude de Pradas]] (early 13th century), a canon of [[Maguelone]], and at the same time a troubadour, has left a poem, the ''Auzels cassadors'', which is one of the best sources for the study of [[falconry]]. [[Raimon d'Avignon]], otherwise unknown, translated in verses, about the year 1200, [[Rogier of Parme]]'s ''Surgery'' (Romania, x. 63 and 496). We may mention also a poem on [[astrology]] by a certain C. (Guilhem?), and another, anonymous, on [[geomancy]], both written about the end of the 13th century (Romania, xxvi. 825).\n\nAs to moral compositions, we have to recall the Boethius poem (unfortunately a mere fragment) already mentioned as one of the oldest documents of the language, and really a remarkable work; and to notice an early (12th century?) metrical translation of the famous ''[[Disticha de moribus]]'' of [[Dionysius Cato]] (Romania, xxv. 98, and xxix. 445). More original are some compositions of an educational character known under the name of ''[[ensenhamenz]]'', and, in some respects, comparable to the English nurture-books.\n\nThe most interesting are those of [[Garin le Brun]] (12th century), Arnaut de Mareuil, [[Arnaut Guilhem de Marsan]], [[Amanieu de Sescas]]. Their general object is the education of ladies of rank. Of metrical lives of saints we possess about a dozen (see ''[[Histoire litt\u00e9raire de la France]]'', vol. xxxii.), among which two or three deserve a particular attention: the ''Life of Sancta Fides'', recently discovered and printed Romania, xxxi.), written early in the 12th century; the ''Life of [[St Enimia]]'' (13th century), by Bertran of Marseilles, and that of [[St Honorat of Lerins]] by [[Raimon Feraud]] (about 1300), which is distinguished by variety and elegance of versification, but it is almost entirely a translation from Latin. Lives of saints ([[St Andrew]], [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas the Apostle]], [[John the Evangelist|St John the Evangelist]]) form a part of a poem, strictly didactic, which stands out by reason of its great extent (nearly thirty-five thousand verses) and the somewhat original conception of its scheme - the ''Breviars damor'', a vast [[encyclopedia]], on a theological basis, composed by the [[Minorite]] friar [[Matfre Ermengaut of Bezers]] between 1288 and 1300 or thereabout.\n\n==Drama==\nDramatic literature in Occitan consists of mysteries and miracle plays seldom exceeding two or three thousand lines, which never developed into the enormous dramas of northern France, whose acting required several consecutive days. Comic plays, so plentiful in medieval French literature (farces, sotties), do not seem to have found favor in the south. Specimens which we possess of Occitan drama are, comparatively few; but researches in local archives, especially in old account books, have brought to light a considerable number of entries concerning the acting, at public expense, of religious plays, called, in Latin documents, ''historia'' or ''moralitas'', most of which seem to be irretrievably lost. The ''[[Sponsus]]'', in both Latin and Occitan, is preserved from the mid-11th century and may have non-liturgical roots. It shows originality in both the treatment of its biblical theme and its musical accompaniment, since it was sung in its entirety. As all the Occitan plays, sometimes mere fragments, which have escaped destruction, are preserved in about a dozen manuscripts, unearthed within the last forty or fifty years. Generally those plays belong to the 15th century or to the sixteenth. Still, a few are more ancient and may be ascribed to the 14th century or even to the end of the thirteenth. The oldest appears to be the ''Mystery of St Agnes'' (edited by Bartsch, 1869), written in Arles. Somewhat more recent, but not later than the beginning of the 14th century, is a ''Passion of Christ'' (not yet printed) and a ''mystery of the [[Marriage of the Virgin]]'', which is partly adapted from a French poem of the 13th century, (see Romania xvi. 71). A manuscript, discovered in private archives (printed by [[Alfred Jeanroy]] and Henri Teuli\u00e9, 1893), contains not less than sixteen short mysteries, three founded on the [[Old Testament]], thirteen on the [[New Testament|New]]. They were, written in Rouergue and are partly imitated from French mysteries.\n\nAt [[Manosque]] ([[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]) was found a fragment of a ''Ludus sancts Jacobi'' inserted in a register of notarial deeds (printed by C. Arnaud) of some kind. In 1513 French poems were first admitted in the competitions, and under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (from 1679) these were alone held eligible. This unfair arrangement, by which some of the leading poets of northern France profited, held good till 1893, when the town very properly transferred its patronage to a new ''Escolo moundino'', but very soon restored its support to the older institution, on learning that Occitan poetry was again to be encouraged.\n\n==From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century==\n\nIn the two centuries that followed the glorious medieval period we have a succession of works, chiefly of a didactic and edifying character, which scarcely belong to the realm of literature proper, but at least served to keep alive some kind of literary tradition. This dreary interval was relieved by a number of religious mystery plays, which, though dull to us, probably gave keen enjoyment to the people, and represent a more popular genre; the latest that have come down to us may be placed between the years 1450 and 1515. Not only did the literature deteriorate during this period, but dialects took the place of the uniform literary language employed by the troubadours, while the spoken tongue yielded more and more to French. In 1539 [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], with the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]], forbade the use of Occitan in official documents a fact that is worthy of note only as being significant in itself, not as an important factor in the decadence of Proven\u00e7al letters.\n\nOn the contrary, just about this time, there are signs of a revival. In 1565 the Gascon, [[Pey de Garros]], translated the [[Psalms]] into [[Gascon language|his dialect]], and two years later published a volume of poems. His love for his native tongue is genuine, and his command over it considerable; he deplores its neglect, and urges others to follow his example. [[Auger Gaillard]] (c. 1530\u20131595) does infinitely less credit to his province: the popularity of his light pieces was probably due to their obscenity. More in the spirit of Garros is the charming trilingual ''Salut'' composed by the famous [[du Bartas]] in honor of a visit of [[Marguerite de Valois]] to N\u00e9rac (1579): three [[nymph]]s dispute as to whether she should be welcomed in Latin, French, or Gascon, and the last, of course, wins the day.\n\n[[Provence]] proper gave birth to a poet of considerable importance in [[Louis Bellaud de la Bellaudire]] (1532\u20131588), of [[Grasse]], who, after studying at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], enlisted in the royal armies, and was made a prisoner at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] in 1572. During his captivity he wrote poems inspired by real love of liberty and of his native country (Don-Don internal, 1584 or 1585). At Aix Bellaud subsequently became the centre of a literary circle which included most of the local celebrities; all of these paid their tribute to the poets memory in the edition of his works published by his uncle, Pierre Paul, himself the author of pieces of small value, included in the same volume (Lous Passatens, obros et rimos, &c., Marseilles, 1590s). Even when Bellaud is wholly frivolous, and intent on worldly pleasures only, his work has interest as reflecting the merry, careless life of the time.\n\nA writer very popular in Provence for the light-hearted productions of his youth was [[Claude Brueys]] (1570\u20131650), remarkable chiefly for comedies that deal largely with duped husbands (''Jardin deys musos provensalos'', not published till 1628). There is a certain charm, too, in the comedies of Claude's disciple, [[Gaspard Zerbin]] (''La Perlo deys niusos et coumedies prouvensalos'', 1655); and those critics who have read the plays of [[Jean de Cabanes]] (1653\u20131712) and of Seguin (of [[Tarascon]], c. 1640), still in MS., speak highly of them.\n\nThe most consistently popular form of poetry in the south of France was always the novel. There has been no limit to the production of these; but very rarely does the author deserve special mention. An exception must be made in the case of [[Nicholas Saboly]] (1614\u20131675), who produced the best pieces of this class, both as regards beauty of language and the devotion they breathe. They have deservedly maintained their popularity to the present day. In [[Languedoc]] four poets have been cited as the best of the age [[Goudelin]], [[Jean Michel (poet)|Michel]], [[Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage|LeSage]] and [[Jacques Bonnet|Bonnet]].\n\nThis is certainly so in the case of [[Pierre Goudelin]] (province Goudouli, 1579\u20131649), of Toulouse, the most distinguished name in Occitan literature between the period of the troubadours and that of [[Jacques Jasmin|Jasmin]]. He had a good classical education, traces of which appear in all his poetry, his language and his manner being always admirable, even where his matter is lacking in depth. He is often called the [[Fran\u00e7ois de Malherbe|Malherbe]] of the South, but resembles that writer only in form: his poetry, taken as a whole, has far more sap. Goudelin essayed and was successful in almost every short genre (''Lou Ramelet Moundi'', 1617, republished with additions till 1678), the piece of his which is most generally admired being the stanzas to [[Henry IV of France]], though others will prefer him in his gayer moods. He enjoyed enormous popularity (extending to Spain and Italy), but never prostituted his art to cheap effects. His influence, especially but not exclusively in the Occitan area, has been deep and lasting. The fame of [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]], of [[N\u00eemes]], rests on the ''{{lang|fr|Embarras de la foire de [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]]}}'', a poem of astonishing vigour, but deficient in taste. [[Daniel Sage]], of [[Montpellier]] (''Las Foulies'', 1650), was a man of loose morals, which are reflected in nearly all his works: his moments of genuine inspiration from other causes are rare. More worthy of being bracketed with Goudelin is the avocat Bonnet, author of the best among the open air plays that were annually performed at [[B\u00e9ziers]] on [[Ascension Day]]: a number of these (dated 1616\u20131657) were subsequently collected, but none can compare with the opening one, Bonnet's ''{{lang|fr|Jugement de Paris}}''.\n\nAnother very charming poet is [[Nicolas Fizes]], of [[Frontignan]], whose play, the ''Op\u00e9ra de Frontignan'' (1670), dealing with a slight love intrigue, and an [[idyllic poem]] on the fountain of Frontignan, show a real poetic gift. A number of Toulouse poets, mostly laureats of the Academy, may be termed followers of Goudelin: of these [[Fran\u00e7ois Boudet]] deserves mention, who composed an [[ode]], ''Le Trinfe del Moundi'' (1678), in honor of his native dialect.\n\nThe classical revival that may be noted about this time is also generally ascribed to Goudelin's influence. Its most distinguished representative was [[Jean de Vales]], of [[Montech]], who made excellent translations from [[Virgil]] and [[Persius]], and wrote a brilliant [[burlesque]] of the former in the manner of [[Scarron]] (''Virgile deguisat'', 1648; only four books published). He also composed a pastoral idyll, which, though too long and inclined to obscenity, contains much tender description. The greatest of the pastoral poets was [[Frariois de Cortete]] (1571\u20131655), of [[Prades, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Prades]], whose comedies, ''Ramounet'' and ''Mircimoundo'' (published, unfortunately with alterations, by his son in 1684), are written with such true feeling and in so pure a style that they can be read with real pleasure. A comedy of his dealing with [[Sancho Panza]] in the palace of the Duke has been edited.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the enormous popularity of [[Daubasse]] (1664\u20131727), of [[Quercy]], who belonged to the working classes; he was patronized by the nobility in exchange for [[panegyric]]s. Gascony produced two typical works in the 17th century: ''Aders Genthomme gascoun'' (1610) and ''Dastross Trinfe de la langue gascoune'' (1642). The former depicts a regular boasting Gascon who distinguishes himself in everything; while the latter is a plea in favor of the Gascon tongue, inspired by a genuine love of country. [[Gabriel Bedout]] (''Parterre gascoun'', 1642) is chiefly noted for his ''amorous solitari'', called forth by the sufferings he endured from a hardhearted mistress. [[Louis Baron]] (b. 1612), living peacefully in his native village of [[Pouyloubrin]], celebrated it with great tenderness.\n\nIn the 18th century the number of authors is much larger, but the bulk of good work produced is not equally great in proportion. The priests are mainly responsible for the literary output of Languedoc. [[Claude Peyrot]] (1709\u20131795) one of them, celebrates his county with true rural spirit in the ''Printenzps rouergat'' and ''Quartre sosous''. But the chief of the band is the [[Abbe Favre]] (1727\u20131783), the prior of [[Celleneuve]], whose ''Sermoun de moussu sistre'', delivered by a drunken priest against intemperance, is a masterpiece. He also wrote a successful mock-heroic poem (''Siege de Caderousse'') travesties of [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], a prose novel depicting the country manners of the time (''Histoire de Jean lont pris''), and two comedies, which likewise give a vivid picture of the village life he knew so well.\n\nTwo genuine poets are the brothers [[Rigaud of Montpellier]]: Augustes (1760\u20131835) description of a vintage is deservedly famous; and Cyrille (1750-1820s) produced an equally delightful poem in the ''Amours de Mounpe\u00ef\u00e9''. [[Pierre Hellies]] of Toulouse (d. 1724) a poet of the people, whose vicious life finds an echo in his works, has a certain rude charm, at times distantly recalling [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon|Villon]]. In the Province [[Toussaint Gros]] (1698\u20131748), of [[Lyon]], holds undisputed sway.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} His style and language are admirable, but unfortunately he wasted his gifts largely on trivial pieces d'occasion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[Coyes]] (1711-17~7) comedy, the ''Franc pare'', is bright and still popular, while Germain's description of a visit paid by the ancient gods to [[Marseille]] (''La Bourrido del Dious'', 1760) has considerable humour. In Gascony the greatest poet is [[Cyrien Despourrins]] (1698\u20131755), whose pastoral idylls and mournful chansons, which he himself set to music, are imbued with tenderness and charm (most of them were collected at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] in 1828).\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] produced a large body of literature, but nothing of lasting interest. However, it gave an impetus to thought in the Occitan area, as elsewhere; and there, as elsewhere, it called forth a spirit of independence that was all in favor of a literary revival. Scholars of the stamp of [[Raynouard]] (1761\u20131863), of Aix, occupied themselves with the brilliant literary traditions of the Middle Ages; newspapers sprang up (the Proven\u00e7al ''Bouil-Abaisso'', started by [[Joseph Desanat]], and the bilingual ''Lou Tambourin et le m\u00e9nestrel'', edited by Bellot, both in 1842); poets banded together and collected their pieces in volume form (thus, the nine troubaire who published ''Lou Bouquet prouven\u00e7aou'' in 1823).\n\n==F\u00e9librige==\n[[File:Felibre 1854.jpg|thumb|Meeting of the F\u00e9libres in 1854]]\n\nMuch has been written about the ''precurseurs de [[F\u00e9librige]]'', and critics are sorely at variance as to the writers that most deserve this appellation. We shall not go far wrong if we include in the list [[Hyacinthe Morel]] (1756\u20131829), of [[Avignon]], whose collection of poems, ''Lou Saboulet'', has been republished by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]]; [[Louis Aubanel]] (178~-1842), of N\u00eemes, the successful translator of [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]]'s ''Odes''; [[Auguste Tandon]], the troubadour of Montpellier, who wrote ''Fables, contes et autres pi\u00e8ces en vers'' (1800); [[Fabre d'Olivet]], the versatile litt\u00e9rateur who in 1803 published ''Le Troubadour: Po\u00e9sies occitaniques'', which, in order to secure their success, he gave out as the work of some medieval poet Diou-loufet (1771\u20131840), who wrote a didactic poem, in the manner of Virgil, relating to silkworm-breeding (''Leis magnans''); [[Jacques Azais]] (1778\u20131856), author of satires, fables, etc.; [[d'Astros]] (1780\u20131863), a writer of fables in [[La Fontaine]]'s manner; [[Castil-Blaze]], who found time, amidst his musical pursuits, to compose Proven\u00e7al poems, intended to be set to music; the [[Marquis de la Fare-Alais]] (1791\u20131846), author of some light satirical tales (''Las Castagnados'').\n\nWhile these writers were all more or less academic, and appealed to the cultured few, four poets of the people addressed a far wider public: Verdi (1779\u20131820), of [[Bordeaux]], who wrote comic and satirical pieces; [[Jean Reboul]] (1796\u20131864), the baker of N\u00eemes, who never surpassed his first effort, ''L'Ange et l'enfant'' (1828); [[Victor Gelu]] (1806-1885), relentless and brutal, but undeniably powerful of his kind (''Fenian \u00e9 Grouman; dix chansons proven\u00e7ales'', 1840); and, greatest of them all, the true and acknowledged forerunner of the felibres, [[Jacques Jasmin]], whose poems, both lyrical and narrative, continue to find favour with men of the highest culture and literary attainments, as with the villagers for whom they were primarily intended.\n\nWhile much of this literature was still in the making, an event took place which was destined to eclipse in importance any that had gone before. In 1845 [[Joseph Roumanille]] of [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence|Saint-R\u00e9my]] ([[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]), became usher in a small school at Avignon, which was attended by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]], a native of the same district, then fifteen years of age. The former, feeling the germs of poetry within him, had composed some pieces in French; but, finding that his old mother could not understand them, he was greatly distressed. One of his chief titles to fame is that, together with [[Alphonse Daudet]], he drew the attention of [[Lamartine]] to Mistral's ''[[Mireio]]''. Roumanille and Mistral showed their gratitude by republishing the best pieces of these two precurseurs, together with those of Castil-Blaze and others, in ''Un Liame de Rasin'' (1865) and determined thenceforth to write in his native dialect only. These poems revealed a new world to young Mistral, and spurred him on to the resolve that became the one purpose of his life \"de remettre en lumi\u00e8re et conscience de sa gloire cette noble race que Mirabeau nomme encore la nation proven\u00e7ale\".\n\nMistral's personality  and  works are certainly better known than his fellows'. Still, in studying the Proven\u00e7al [[renaissance]], Roumanille's great claims should not be overlooked, and they have never been put forward with more force than by Mistral himself (in the ''preface to his Isclos doro''). Roumanille's secular verse cannot fail to appeal to every lover of pure and sincere poetry (''Li Margarideto'', 1836\u20131847; ''Li Sounjarello'', 1852; ''Li Flour de Sauvi'', 1850, 1859, etc.), his novels are second only to those of [[Saboly]], his prose works (such as ''Lou mege de Cucugnan'', 1863) sparkling with delightful humour. He it was who in 1852 collected and published ''Li Prouven\u00e7alo'', an anthology in which all the names yet to become famous, and most of those famous already (such as Jasmin), are represented. In 1853 he was one of the enthusiastic circle that had gathered round [[J.B. Gaut]] at Aix, and whose literary output is contained in the ''Roumavagi dei Troubaire'' and in the short lived journal ''Lou gay saber'' (1854).\n\nAt the same time the first attempt at regulating the orthography of Proven\u00e7al was made by him (in the introduction to his play, ''La Part dou bon Dieu'', 1853). And in 1854 he was one of the seven poets who, on May 21, foregathered at the [[castle of Fontsgugne]], near Avignon, and founded the F\u00e9librige. The etymology of this word has given rise to much speculation: the one thing certain about the word is that Mistral came across it in an old Proven\u00e7al poem, which tells how the [[Virgin]] meets [[Jesus]] in the Temple, among the seven ''felibres'' of the law. The outlines of the constitution, as finally settled in 1876, are as follows.\nThe region of the Felibrige is divided into four ''mantenen\u00e7o'' (Provence, Languedoc, [[Aquitaine]] and Catalonia 2). At the head of all is a consistori of fifty (called ''majourau''), presided over by the ''Capouli\u00e9'', who is chief of the entire Felibrige. The head of each mantenen\u00e7o is called ''sendi'' (who is at the same time a ''majourau''); and at the head of each school (as the subdivisions of the mantenen\u00e7o are called) is a ''cabisc\u00f2u''. The ordinary members, unlimited in number, are ''manten\u00e8ire''. Annual meetings and fetes are organized. The most widely read of the Felibrige publications is the ''Armana prouven\u00e7au'', which has appeared annually since, maintaining all the while its original scope and purpose; and though unpretentious in form, it contains much of the best work of the school. The other six were Mistral, [[Th\u00e9odore Aubanel]], [[Anselme Mathieu]] (a school fellow of Mistral's at Avignon), [[E. Garcin]], [[Alphonse Tavan]] and [[Paul Gi\u00e9ra]] (owner of the castle). Of these, Th\u00e9odore Aubanel has alone proved himself worthy to rank with Mistral and Roumanille.\n\nZani, the girl of his youthful and passionate love, took the veil; and this event cast a shadow over his whole life, and determined the character of all his poetry (''La miougrano entre-duberto'', 1860; ''Li Fiho d'Avignoun'', 1883). His is, without a doubt, the deepest nature and temperament among the felibres, and his lyrics are the most poignant. He has a keen sense of physical beauty in woman, and his verse is replete with suppressed passion, but he never sinks to sensuality. His powerful love drama ''Lou pau dou peccat'' was received with enthusiasm at Montpellier in 1878, and successfully produced (some years later in Arnes version) by Antoine at his Theatre Libreno mean criterion. It is the only play of real consequence that the school has yet produced. We need not do more than glance at the work of the fourth of the group of poets who alone, amidst the numerous writers of lyrics and other works that attain a high level of excellence.\n\nOne of the most pleasing features of the movement is the spirit of fraternity maintained by the f\u00e9libres with the poets and literary men of northern France, Catalonia, Italy, [[Romania]], Germany and other countries. In common with so many other productions of the Felibrige, this ''Almanac'' is published by the firm J. Roumanille, Libraire-Editeur, Avignon.\n\n[[Felix Gras]] settled at Avignon in his youth. His rustic epic, ''Li Carbouni\u00e9'' (1876) is full of elemental passion and abounds in fine descriptions of scenery, but it lacks proportion. The heroic geste of ''Toloza'' (1882), in which [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s invasion of the south is depicted with unbounded vigour and intensity, shows a great advance in art. ''Lou Roumancero prouven\u00e7au'' (1887) is a collection of poems instinct with Proven\u00e7al lore, and in ''Li Papalino'' (1891) we have some charming prose tales that bring to life again the Avignon of the [[pope]]s. Finally, the poet gave us three tales dealing with the period of the Revolution (''Li Rouge d\u00f3u miejour'', etc.); their realism and literary art called forth general admiration.\n\n[[File:Felibrige latin.jpg|thumb|''F\u00e9librige Latin'']]\n\nWhile Mistral and many of the best felibres employ the dialect of the [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], others, who have since seceded as the ''F\u00e9librige Latin'' (headed by [[Roque-Ferrier]]), prefer to use the dialect of [[Montpellier]], owing to its central position. A third class favors the [[Limousin dialect|dialect of Limousin]], considering it has been used by  the troubadours. Nearly all the leaders of the Felibrige are [[Legitimist]]s and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThere are exceptions, however, chief among them the [[Protestant]] Gras, whose ''Toloza'' clearly reflects his sympathy with the [[Albigenses]]. Yet this did not stand in the way of his election as Capouli\u00e9 proof, if proof were needed, that literary merit outweighs all other considerations in this artistic body of men. Finally, it may be noted that the felibres have often been accused of lack of patriotism towards northern France, of schemes of decentralization, and other heresies; but none of these charges holds good. The spirit of the movement, as represented by its leaders, has never been expressed with greater terseness, force and truth than in the three verses set by Felix Gras at the head of his Carbouni\u00e9: \"I love my village more than thy village; I love my Provence more than thy province; I love France more than all\".\n\n==Late twentieth and twenty-first century==\nDespite two hundred years of suppression by successive French centralist governments and the official prohibition of the language at school, in the administration and in the media, Occitan and [[Occitania]] have never ceased to inspire poets and authors. To the day, Article II of the [[French Constitution]] denies the existence and legitimacy of culturally rich and elaborate idioms such as Catalan, Breton, Basque and Occitan, among others. And though the use of the latter has been greatly affected by what is known as la [[Vergonha]] \u2014 which is the physical, legal, artistic and moral repression of the tongue in all areas of society aiming at making children feel ''ashamed'' of their parents' language to the benefit of French, \u2014 every region of the country of \u00d2c gave birth to literary geniuses: [[Joan Bodon]] in [[Guyenne]], [[Marcela Delpastre]] in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], [[Rob\u00e8rt Lafont]] in [[Provence]], [[Bernat Manciet]] in [[Gascony]] and [[Max Roqueta]] in [[Languedoc]].<ref>Olivier Burckhardt [http://www.obfuchai.com/pages/troubadours.html Modern-Day Troubadours: Contemporary Literature in the Occitan Languages] ''Contemporary Review'', January 1999, Vol. 274, Issue 1596, pp. 33-37</ref>\n\nAll genres of modern international literature are present in Occitan, especially since the second half of the 20th century, although some avant-garde Occitan literature already existed from the late 19th century.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Occitan poets]]\n* [[List of troubadours and trobairitz]]\n* [[Cantiga de amigo]]\n* [[Jacques Jasmin]]\n* [[Medieval music]]\n* [[French Medieval literature]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |title=Proven\u00e7al Literature |first=Harriet |last=Waters |chapter=Preston |volume=20 |pages=11871\u201311890 |series=Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern |publisher=R.

It was the first literature in a [[Romance language]] and inspired the rise of [[vernacular literature]] throughout medieval Europe. Occitan literature's Golden Age was in the 12th century, when a rich and complex body of lyrical poetry was produced by [[troubadour]]s writing in [[Old Occitan]], which still survives to this day. Although [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is considered by some a variety of Occitan, this article will not deal with [[Catalan literature]], which started diverging from its Southern French counterpart in the late 13th century.\n\n==Introduction==\nOccitan [[literature]] started in the 11th century in several centres. It gradually spread from there, first over the greater portion (though not the whole) of southern France, and then into [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], Portugal and into what is now the north of Italy.\n\nIn its rise Occitan literature stands completely by itself, and in its development it long continued to be highly original. It presents at several points analogies with French literature; but these analogies are due principally to certain primary elements common to both and only in a slight degree to mutual reaction.\n\n==Origin==\n\nOccitan poetry first appeared in the 11th century. The oldest surviving text is the Proven\u00e7al [[Refrain|burden]] (Fr. \"refrain\") attached to a 10th-century Latin poem.<ref>''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr deutsche Philologie'', 1881, p. 335</ref> The text has not yet been satisfactorily interpreted. The quality of the earliest remaining works suggest earlier work was lost.\n \nThe earliest Occitan poem is a 10th-century, seventeen-line charm ''[[Tomida femina]]'' probably for dispersing the pain of childbirth. Much longer is an 11th-century fragment of two hundred and fifty-seven [[decasyllabic]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s preserved in an [[Orl\u00e9ans]] manuscript, first printed by [[Raynouard]].<ref>''Choix des poesies originales des troubadours'', 1817</ref> It is believed{{by whom|date=October 2014}} to have come from [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]] or [[County of La Marche|Marche]] in the north of the Occitan region. The unknown author takes [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]'s treatise ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De consolatione philosophiae]]'' as the groundwork of his composition. The poem is a didactic piece composed by a clerk. The ''[[Can\u00e7\u00f3 de Santa Fe]]'' dates from 1054&ndash;1076, but probably represents a Catalan dialect that evolved into a distinct language from Occitan. From the same century there is ''[[Las, qu'i non sun sparvir, astur]]'', a secular love poem.\n\nFrom the next century are the poems of [[William IX of Aquitaine|William (Guilhem) IX]], the grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine. They consist of eleven diverse strophic pieces, and were consequently meant to be sung. Several are love songs. The only one which can be approximately dated was composed around 1119, when William was setting out for Spain to fight the [[Saracens]]. It expresses the writer's regret for the frivolity of his past life and his apprehensions as he bade farewell to his country and his young son. We also know from [[Ordericus Vitalis]] that William had composed various poems on the incidents of his ill-fated [[Crusade of 1101]]. In one of his pieces<ref>''Ben voil que sapchon ii plusor''</ref> he makes an allusion to the [[partimen]].\n\nThe origins of this poetry are uncertain. It bears no relation to [[Latin poetry]], nor to folklore. Vernacular compositions seem to have been at first produced for the amusement, or in the case of religious poetry, for the edification, of that part of lay society which had leisure and lands, and reckoned intellectual pastime among the good things of life.\n\nIn the 11th century, vernacular poetry served mainly the amusement and edification of the upper class. By the 12th and 13th centuries, historical works and popular treatises on contemporary science were composed in the vernacular.\n\nOccitan poetry may have originated amongst the [[jester]]s. Some, leaving [[jester|buffoonery]] to the ruder and less intelligent members of the profession, devoted themselves to the composition of pieces intended for singing. In the north, the jesters produced ''[[chansons de geste]]'' full of tales of battle and combat. In the courts of the southern nobles they produced love songs.\n\n==Age of the troubadours==\nStarting in the early 12th century, the best-known body of Occitan literature originated with the group of poets who would later become known as troubadours, from the verb \"trobar\", meaning \"to invent\". The troubadours used a standardized form of Old Occitan (one probably based on the dialect of [[Limoges]]), sang their pieces to music and generally used complex and elaborate meters. Their poetry was usually lyrical, with a minority of pieces of satirical, political, moralistic, religious or erotic nature.\n\n===Early period===\nThe first known troubadour was [[William IX, Duke of Aquitaine]] whose works gave the movement a position of honor, and indirectly contributed in a very powerful degree to ensure its development and preservation.\nShortly after him, centres of poetic activity made their appearance in various places, first in Limousin and [[Gascony]]. In the former province lived ''Ebolus cantator'' (a singer named [[Eble II of Ventadorn|Eble]]), who during the second part of William of Poitiers' life seems to have been brought into relation with him, and according to a contemporary historian, [[Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois|Geoffroy, prior of Vigeois]], ''erat valde gratiosus in cantilenis'' (\"gave a great deal of pleasure by his songs\"). None of his compositions survive; but under his influence [[Bernart de Ventadorn|Bernart of Ventadour]] was trained to poetry, who, though only the son of one of the serving-men of the castle, managed to gain the love of the lady of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ventadour|Ventadour]], and when on the discovery of their amour he had to depart elsewhere, received a gracious welcome from [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], consort (from 1152) of [[Henry II of England]]. Of Bernart's compositions we possess about fifty songs of elegant simplicity, some of which may be taken as the most perfect specimens of love poetry Occitan literature has ever produced. Bernart must therefore have been in repute before the middle of the 12th century; and his poetic career extended well on towards its close.\n\nAt the same period, or probably a little earlier, flourished [[Cercamon]], of genuine importance among the [[troubadour]]s both because of his early date and because definite information regarding him has been preserved. He was a Gascon, and composed, says his old biographer, pastorals according to the ancient custom (''pastorelas a la uzansa antiga''). This is the record of the appearance in the south of France of a poetic form which ultimately acquired large development. The period at which Cercamon lived is determined by a piece where he alludes very clearly to the approaching marriage of the king of France, [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], with Eleanor of Aquitaine (1137). Among the earliest troubadours may also be reckoned [[Marcabru]], a pupil of Cercamon, from whose pen we have about forty pieces, those which can be approximately dated ranging from 1135 to 1148 or thereabout. This poet has great originality of thought and style. His songs, several of which are historical, are free from the commonplaces of their class, and contain curious strictures on the corruptions of the time.\n\n===Golden age: trobar leu, troubar clus, and trobar ric===\nWe cannot here do more than enumerate the leading troubadours and briefly indicate in what conditions their poetry was developed and through what circumstances it fell into decay and finally disappeared: [[Peire d'Alvernha]], who in certain respects must be classed with Marcabru; [[Arnaut Daniel]], remarkable for his complicated versification, the inventor of the [[sestina]], a poetic form for which Dante and [[Petrarch]] express an admiration difficult for us to understand; [[Arnaut de Mareuil]]; [[Bertran de Born]], now the most generally known of all the troubadours on account of the part he is said to have played both by his sword and his sirveniescs in the struggle between Henry II of England and his rebel sons, though the importance of his part in the events of the time seems to have been greatly exaggerated; [[Peire Vidal]] of Toulouse, a poet of varied inspiration who grew rich with gifts bestowed on him by the greatest nobles of his time; [[Giraut de Bornelh|Guiraut de Borneil]], ''lo macsire dels trobadors'', and at any rate master in the art of the so-called close style (''trebar clus''), though he has also left us some songs of charming simplicity; [[Gaucelm Faidit]], from whom we have a touching lament (''plaint'') on the death of [[Richard I of England|Richard C\u0153ur de Lion]]; [[Folquet de Marselha|Folquet of Marseille]], the most powerful thinker among the poets of the south, who from being a merchant and troubadour became an [[abbot]], and finally [[bishop of Toulouse]] (d. 1231).\n\n===Later troubadours, and foreign ones===\nAs the troubadours started scattering from Southern France after the Albigensian crusade, the quality of their poetry decayed sharply: [[Dante]], in his [[De vulgari eloquentia]] mentions only authors of the previous generation (Peire d'Alvernha, Giraut de Bornelh, Bertran de Born and Arnaut Daniel) as models of vernacular literature. However, the presence of troubadours in foreign courts engendered a number of imitators in [[Catalonia]] (for example [[Cerver\u00ec de Girona]]) and Italy ([[Sordello]], [[Lanfranc Cigala]], [[Rambertino Buvalelli]]).\n\n===Troubadours and society===\nIt is not without interest to discover to what social classes the troubadours belonged. Many of them, there is no doubt, had a very humble origin. Bernart of Ventadour's father was a servant, Peire Vidal's a maker of furred garments, [[Perdigon]]'s a fisher. Others belonged to the [[bourgeoisie]], Peire d'Alvernha, for example, Peire Raimon of Toulouse, and Elias Fonsalada. Likewise we see merchants' sons as troubadours; this was the case with Folquet of Marseille and [[Aimeric de Peguilhan]]. A great many were clerics, or at least studied for the Church, for instance, Arnaut de Mareuil, [[Uc de Saint Circ]], [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Hugh Brunet]], [[Peire Cardenal]]; some had even taken orders: the [[monk of Montaudon]] and [[Gaubert de Puicibot]]. Ecclesiastical authority did not always tolerate this breach of discipline. [[Gui d'Ussel]], canon and troubadour, was obliged by the injunction of the [[pontifical legate]] to give up his song-making; Folquet, too, renounced it when he took orders. One point is particularly striking, the number of monarchs and nobles who were troubadours: [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Pons de Capdoill]], [[Guilhem Ademar]], [[Cadenet (troubadour)|Cadenet]], [[Peirol]], [[Raimbaut de Vacqueiras]], and many more. Some of this group were poor knights whose incomes were insufficient to support their rank, and took up poetry not merely for their own pleasure, but for the sake of the gifts to be obtained from the rich whose courts they frequented. A very different position was occupied by such wealthy and powerful people as William of Poitiers, [[Raimbaut of Orange|Raimbaut d'Aurenga]], the [[viscount of Saint Antonin]], [[Guillem de Bergued\u00e0]] and [[Blacatz]].\n\nThe profession was entirely dependent on the existence and prosperity of the feudal courts. The troubadours could hardly expect to obtain a livelihood from any other quarter than the generosity of the great. It will consequently be well to mention the more important at least of those princes who are known to have been patrons and some of them practisers of the poetic art. They are arranged approximately in geographical order, and after each are inserted the names of those troubadours with whom they were connected.\n\n===Patronage===\nWhile the troubadours found protectors in Catalonia, Castile and Italy, they do not seem to have been welcomed in French-speaking countries. This, however, must not be taken too absolutely. Occitan poetry was appreciated in the north of France. There is reason to believe that when [[Constance d'Arles|Constance]], daughter of one of the counts of [[Arles]], was married in 1001 to [[Robert II of France|Robert, king of France]], she brought along with her Proven\u00e7al jongleurs. Poems by troubadours are quoted in the French romances of the beginning of the 13th century; some of them are transcribed in the old collections of French songs, and the preacher [[Robert de Sorbon]] informs us in a curious passage that one day a jongleur sang a poem by Folquet of Marseilles at the court of the king of France. Since the countries of the [[O\u00efl languages|langue d'oil]] had a full developed literature of their own, the troubadours generally preferred to go to regions where they had less competition.\n\nThe decline and fall of troubadour poetry was mainly due to political causes. When about the beginning of the 13th century the [[Albigensian Crusade]] led by the French king had decimated and ruined the nobility and reduced to lasting poverty a part of the Occitan territories, the profession of troubadour ceased to be lucrative. It was then that many of those poets went to spend their last days in the north of Spain and Italy, where Occitan poetry had for more than one generation been highly esteemed. Following their example, other poets who were not natives of the south of France began to compose in Occitan, and this fashion continued till, about the middle of the 13th century, they gradually abandoned the foreign tongue in northern Italy, and somewhat later in [[Catalonia]], and took to singing the same airs in the local dialects. About the same time in the Proven\u00e7al region the flame of poetry had died out save in a few places, [[Narbonne]], [[Rodez]], [[Foix]] and [[Astarac]] where it kept burning feebly for a little longer. In the 14th century, composition in the language of the country was still practised; but the productions of this period are mainly works for instruction and edification, translations from Latin or sometimes even from French, with an occasional romance. As for the poetry of the troubadours, it was dead for ever.\n\n====France====\n* [[Henry the Young King]], son of [[Henry II of England]]: [[Bertran de Born]] (?)\n* [[Richard I of England|Richard Coeur de Lion]]: [[Arnaut Daniel]], [[Peire Vidal]], [[Folquet de Marselha]], [[Gaucelm Faidit]]\n* [[Ermengarde of Narbonne]] (1143&ndash;1192): Bernart de Ventadour, [[Peire Rogier]], [[Peire d'Alvernha]]\n* [[Raymond V of Toulouse|Raimon V]], [[count of Toulouse]] (1143&ndash;1194): Bernart de Ventadour, Peire Rogier, [[Peire Raimon]], [[Hugh Brunet]], Peire Vidal, Folquet de Marselha, [[Bernart de Durfort]]\n* [[Raymond VI of Toulouse|Raimon VI]], count of Toulouse (1194&ndash;1222): [[Raimon de Miraval]], [[Aimeric de Peguihan]], [[Aimeric de Belenoi]], [[Ademar le Negre]], [[Savaric de Malleo]]\n* [[Alfonso II, Count of Provence|Alfonso II]], [[count of Provence]] (1185&ndash;1209): [[Elias de Barjols]]\n* [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence|Raimon Berenguer IV]], count of Provence (1209&ndash;1245): [[Sordello]]\n* [[Raymond Geoffrey II of Marseille]] (d. 1192): Peire Vidal, Folquet de Marselha\n* [[Maria de Ventadorn]] (d. 1222), Gaucelm Faidit, [[Gui d'Ussel]]\n* [[William VIII of Montpellier]] (1172&ndash;1204): [[Peire Raimon]], [[Arnaut de Mareuil]], Folquet de Marselha, [[Guiraut de Calanson]], [[Aimeric de Sarlat]]\n* [[Dalfi d'Alvernha]] (1169&ndash;1234): [[Peirol]], [[Perdigon]], [[Peire de Maensac]], Gaucelm Faidit, [[Uc de Saint Circ]]\n* [[Guillaume des Baux]], [[prince of Orange]] (1182&ndash;1218): [[Raimbaut de Vacqueiras]], Perdigon\n* [[Savaric de Malleo]] (1200&ndash;1230): [[Jausbert de Puycibot]], Uc de Saint Circ\n* [[Blacatz]], a Proven\u00e7al noble (1200&ndash;1236): [[Cadenet (troubadour)|Cadenet]], [[Jean d'Aubusson]], Sordello, [[Guillem Figueira]]\n* [[Hugh II of Rodez|Hugh II]], [[count of Rodez]] (1156&ndash;1208): [[Uc Brunet]], [[Bernart de Venzac]]\n* [[Henry I of Rodez|Henry I]], count of Rodez (1208&ndash;c.1222): Uc de Saint Circ\n* [[Hugh IV of Rodez|Hugh IV]] (1222&ndash;1274) and [[Henry II of Rodez|Henry II]] (1274&ndash;1302), counts of Rodez: [[Guiraut Riquier]], [[Folquet de Lunel]], [[Serveri de Girone]], [[Bertran Carbonel]]\n* [[Nu\u00f1o S\u00e1nchez]], count of Roussillon (d. 1241): Aimeric de Belenoi\n* [[Bernard IV d'Astarac]] (1249&ndash;1291): Guiraut Riquier, [[Amanieu de Sescas]]\n\n====Aragon====\n* [[Alfonso II of Aragon]] (1162&ndash;1196): Peire Rogier, Peire Raimon, Peire Vidal, Cadenet, [[Guiraut de Cabreira]], Elias de Barjols, the [[Monk of Montaudon]], Hugh Brunet\n* [[Peter II of Aragon]] (1196&ndash;1213): Raimon de Miraval, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Perdigon, Ademar lo Negre, Hugh of Saint Circq\n* [[James I of Aragon]] (1213&ndash;1276): Peire Cardinal, [[Bernart Sicart de Maruejols]], Guiraut Riquier, [[At de Mons]]\n* [[Peter III of Aragon]] (1276&ndash;1285): [[Paulet of Marseilles]], Guiraut Riquier, Serveri de Girone\n\n====Castile and Leon====\n* [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n]] (1138&ndash;1214): [[Elias Cairel]], Peire Rogier, Guiraut de Borneil, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Hugh de Saint Circq\n* [[Alfonso VIII of Castile]] (1158&ndash;1214): [[Uc de Lescura]]\n* [[Alfonso X of Castile]] (1252&ndash;1284): [[Bertran de Lamanon]], [[Bonifaci Calvo]], Guiraut Riquier, Folquet de Lund, [[Arnaut Plages]], Bertran Carbonel\n\n====Italy====\n* [[Boniface II of Montferrat]] (1192&ndash;1207): Peire Vidal, Raimbaut de Vacqueiras, [[Elias Cairel]], Gaucelm Faidit (?)\n* [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], emperor (1215&ndash;1250): Jean d'Aubusson, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Guillem Figueira\n* [[Azzo VI]], [[marquis of Este]] (1196&ndash;1212): Airneric de Pegulhan, [[Rambertin de Buvalelli]]\n* [[Azzo VII of Este|Azzo VII]], marquis of Este (1215&ndash;1264): Aimeric de Pegulhan\n\n==Form==\n\nOriginally the poems of the troubadours were intended to be sung. The poet usually composed the music as well as the words; and in several cases he owed his fame more to his musical than to his literary ability. Two manuscripts preserve specimens of the music of the troubadours, but, though the subject has been recently investigated, we are hardly able to form a clear opinion of the originality and of the merits of these musical compositions. The following are the principal poetic forms which the troubadours employed. The oldest and most usual generic term is ''[[Lyrics|vers]]'', by which is understood any composition intended to be sung, no matter what the subject. At the close of the 12th century, it became customary to call all verse treating of love ''[[canso (song)|canso]]'' the name ''vers'' being then more generally reserved for poems on other themes. The ''[[sirventesc]]'' differs from the vers and the canso only by its subject, being for the most part devoted to moral and political topics.\n\nPeire Cardinal is celebrated for the sirventescs he composed against the clergy of his time. The political poems of Bertran de Born are sirventescs. There is reason to believe that originally this word meant simply a poem composed by a ''sirvent'' (Latin ''serviens'') or man-at-arms. The sirventesc is very frequently composed in the form, sometimes even with rhymes, of a love song having acquired some popularity, so that it might be sung to the same air.\n\nThe '''''tenson''''' is a debate between two interlocutors, each of whom has a stanza or more generally a group of lines (each group having the same structure) in turn.\n\nThe [[partimen]] (French ''jeu parti'') is also a poetic debate, but it differs from the tenson insofar that the range of debate is limited. In the first stanza one of the partners proposes two alternatives; the other partner chooses one of them and defends it, the opposite side remaining to be defended by the original propounder. Often in a final couplet a judge or arbiter is appointed to decide between the parties. This poetic game is mentioned by William, count of Poitiers, at the end of the 11th century. The ''[[pastoreta]]'', afterwards ''[[pastorela]]'', is in general an account of the love adventures of a knight with a shepherdess. All these classes have one form capable of endless variations: five or more stanzas and one or two [[envoi]]s. The ''[[dansa]]'' and ''[[Balaresc|balada]]'', intended to mark the time in dancing, are pieces with a refrain. The [[aubade]], which has also a refrain, is, as the name indicates, a waking or morning song at the dawning of the day. All those classes are in stanzas. The ''[[descort]]'' is not thus divided, and consequently it must be set to music right through. Its name is derived from the fact that, its component parts not being equal, there is a kind of discord between them. It is generally reserved for themes of love. Other kinds of lyric poems, sometimes with nothing new about them except the name, were developed in the Occitan regions; but those here mentioned are the more important.\n\n===Narrative poetry===\n\nAlthough the lyrical poetry of the troubadours formed the most original part of Occitan literature, it was not the only kind. Narrative poetry, especially, received in Occitania a great development, and, thanks to recent discoveries, a considerable body of it has already become known. Several classes must be distinguished: the ''[[chanson de geste]]'', legendary or apparently historical, the romance of adventure and the [[novel]]. All these poems are in the form of ''chansons de geste'', that is, in stanzas of indefinite length, with a single rhyme.\n\nOne notable example is the saga of Girart de Roussillon, a poem of ten thousand verses, which relates the struggles of [[Charles Martel]] with his powerful vassal the Burgundian [[Gerard of Roussillon]]. Girart de Roussillon belongs only within certain limits to the Occitan literature, as it exists in two versions, one in Old Occitan and one in a hybrid language, which seems to have originated on the borders of Limousin and [[Poitou]]; both are probably a recast of an older poem, probably either of French or Burgundian origin, which is no longer extant.\n\nTo Limousin also seems to belong the poem of Aigar and Maurin (end of the 12th century), of which we have only a fragment so short that the subject cannot be clearly made out.\n\nOf less heroic character is the poem of [[Daurel and Beton]] (first half of the 13th century), connected with the [[cycle of Charlemagne]] but, judging by the romantic character of the events, more like a regular romance of adventure. We cannot, however, form a complete judgment in regard to it, as the only manuscript in which it has been preserved is defective at the close, and that to an amount there is no means of ascertaining.\nMidway between legend and history may be classified the ''[[Canso d'Antioca|Cans\u00f3 d'Antioca]]'', a mere fragment of which, 700 verses, has been recovered in [[Madrid]] and published in ''[[Archives de l'Orient latin]]'', vol. ii. This poem, which seems to have been composed by a [[Gregoire Bechada]], mentioned in a 12th-century chronicle and written in Limousin <ref>Paris, ''Romania'', xxii. 358</ref> is one of the sources of the Spanish compilation ''[[La gran conquista de Ultramar]]''.\nTo history proper belongs the ''[[Song of the Albigensian Crusade]]'', which, in its present state, is composed of two poems tacked onto each other: the first, containing the events from the beginning of the crusade till 1213, is the work of a cleric named [[William of Tudela]], a moderate supporter of the crusaders; the second, from 1213 to 1218, is by a vehement opponent of the enterprise. The language and style of the two parts differs as well.\nFinally, around 1280, [[Guillaume Anelier]], a native of [[Toulouse]], composed a poem on the war carried on in [[Navarre]] by the French in 1276 and 1277. It is an historical work of little literary merit.\n\nGerard of Roussillon, Aigar and Maurin and Daurel and Beton are in verses of ten, the others in verses of twelve syllables. The peculiarity of the versification in Gerard is that the pause in the line occurs after the sixth syllable, and not, as is usual, after the fourth.\n\nLike the chanson de geste, the romance of adventure is but slightly represented in the south; but it is to be remembered that many works of this class must have perished, as evidenced by the fact that, with few exceptions, the narrative poems which survived are known by a single manuscript only. Only three Proven\u00e7al romances of adventure are extant, ''[[Jaufri]]'' (composed in the middle of the 13th century and dedicated to a [[List of Aragonese monarchs|king of Aragon]], possibly [[James I of Aragon|James I]]), ''[[Blandin of Cornwall]]'' and ''[[Guillem de La Barra]]''. The first two are connected with the [[Arthurian cycle]]. The ''romance of Guillem de La Barra'' tells a strange story also found in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]'' (2nd Day, viii.); it was finished in 1318, and is dedicated to a noble of [[Languedoc]] called [[Sicart de Montaut]]. Of these, only ''Jaufri'' is considered of any literary merit .{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nConnected with the romance of adventure is the novel (''novas'' in Occitan), which is originally an account of an event newly happened. The novel must have been at first in the south what, as we see by the ''Decameron'', it was in Italy, a society pastime with the wits in turn relating anecdotes, true or imaginary, which they think likely to amuse their auditors. But before long this kind of production was treated in verse, the form adopted being that of the romances of adventure [[octosyllabic]] verses rhyming in pairs. Some of those novels which have come down to us may be ranked with the most graceful works in Proven\u00e7al literature; two are from the pen of the [[List of Catalan people|Catalan]] author [[Raimon Vidal de Besalu]]. One, the ''Castia-gilos'' (the ''Chastisement of the Jealous Man''), is a treatment, not easily matched for elegance, of a frequently-handled theme the story of the husband who, in order to entrap his wife, takes the disguise of the lover whom she is expecting and receives with satisfaction blows intended, as he thinks, for him whose part he is playing; the other, ''The Judgment of Love'', is the recital of a question of the law of love, departing considerably from the subjects usually treated in the novels. Mention may also be made of the novel of ''The Parrot'' by [[Arnaut de Carcassonne]], in which the principal character is a [[parrot]] of great eloquence and ability, who succeeds marvellously in securing the success of the amorous enterprises of his master.\n\nNovels came to be extended to the proportions of a long romance. ''[[Romance of Flamenca|Flamenca]]'', which belongs to the novel type, has still over eight thousand verses, though the only MS. of it has lost some leaves both at the beginning and at the end. This poem, composed in all probability in 1234, is the story of a lady who by very ingenious devices, not unlike those employed in the ''[[Miles gloriosus]]'' of [[Plautus]], succeeds in eluding the vigilance of her jealous husband. No analysis can be given here of a work the action of which is highly complicated; suffice it to remark that there is no book in [[medieval literature]] which betokens so much quickness of intellect and is so instructive in regard to the manners and usages of polite society in the 13th century. We know that novels were in great favor in the south of France, although the specimens preserved are not very numerous. Statements made by [[Francesco da Barberino]] (early part of the 14th century), and recently brought to light, give us a glimpse of several works of this class which have been lost. From the Occitan territories the novel spread into Catalonia, where we find in the 14th century a number of novels in verse very similar to the Proven\u00e7al ones, and into Italy, where in general the prose form has been adopted.\n\n==Didactic and religious poetry==\n\nCompositions intended for instruction, correction and edification were very numerous in the south of France as well as elsewhere, and, in spite of the enormous losses sustained by Proven\u00e7al literature, much of this kind still remains. But it is seldom that such works have much originality or literary value. Originality was naturally absent, as the aim of the writers was mainly to bring the teachings contained in Latin works within the reach of lay hearers or readers. Literary value was not of course excluded by the lack of originality, but by an unfortunate chance the greater part of those who sought to instruct or edify, and attempted to substitute moral works for secular productions in favor with the people, were, with a few exceptions, persons of limited ability. It would be out of question to enumerate here all the didactic treatises, all the lives of saints, all the treatises of popular theology and morals, all the books of devotion, all the pious canticles, composed in Occitan verse during the Middle Ages; still some of these poems may be singled out.\n\n[[Daude de Pradas]] (early 13th century), a canon of [[Maguelone]], and at the same time a troubadour, has left a poem, the ''Auzels cassadors'', which is one of the best sources for the study of [[falconry]]. [[Raimon d'Avignon]], otherwise unknown, translated in verses, about the year 1200, [[Rogier of Parme]]'s ''Surgery'' (Romania, x. 63 and 496). We may mention also a poem on [[astrology]] by a certain C. (Guilhem?), and another, anonymous, on [[geomancy]], both written about the end of the 13th century (Romania, xxvi. 825).\n\nAs to moral compositions, we have to recall the Boethius poem (unfortunately a mere fragment) already mentioned as one of the oldest documents of the language, and really a remarkable work; and to notice an early (12th century?) metrical translation of the famous ''[[Disticha de moribus]]'' of [[Dionysius Cato]] (Romania, xxv. 98, and xxix. 445). More original are some compositions of an educational character known under the name of ''[[ensenhamenz]]'', and, in some respects, comparable to the English nurture-books.\n\nThe most interesting are those of [[Garin le Brun]] (12th century), Arnaut de Mareuil, [[Arnaut Guilhem de Marsan]], [[Amanieu de Sescas]]. Their general object is the education of ladies of rank. Of metrical lives of saints we possess about a dozen (see ''[[Histoire litt\u00e9raire de la France]]'', vol. xxxii.), among which two or three deserve a particular attention: the ''Life of Sancta Fides'', recently discovered and printed Romania, xxxi.), written early in the 12th century; the ''Life of [[St Enimia]]'' (13th century), by Bertran of Marseilles, and that of [[St Honorat of Lerins]] by [[Raimon Feraud]] (about 1300), which is distinguished by variety and elegance of versification, but it is almost entirely a translation from Latin. Lives of saints ([[St Andrew]], [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas the Apostle]], [[John the Evangelist|St John the Evangelist]]) form a part of a poem, strictly didactic, which stands out by reason of its great extent (nearly thirty-five thousand verses) and the somewhat original conception of its scheme - the ''Breviars damor'', a vast [[encyclopedia]], on a theological basis, composed by the [[Minorite]] friar [[Matfre Ermengaut of Bezers]] between 1288 and 1300 or thereabout.\n\n==Drama==\nDramatic literature in Occitan consists of mysteries and miracle plays seldom exceeding two or three thousand lines, which never developed into the enormous dramas of northern France, whose acting required several consecutive days. Comic plays, so plentiful in medieval French literature (farces, sotties), do not seem to have found favor in the south. Specimens which we possess of Occitan drama are, comparatively few; but researches in local archives, especially in old account books, have brought to light a considerable number of entries concerning the acting, at public expense, of religious plays, called, in Latin documents, ''historia'' or ''moralitas'', most of which seem to be irretrievably lost. The ''[[Sponsus]]'', in both Latin and Occitan, is preserved from the mid-11th century and may have non-liturgical roots. It shows originality in both the treatment of its biblical theme and its musical accompaniment, since it was sung in its entirety. As all the Occitan plays, sometimes mere fragments, which have escaped destruction, are preserved in about a dozen manuscripts, unearthed within the last forty or fifty years. Generally those plays belong to the 15th century or to the sixteenth. Still, a few are more ancient and may be ascribed to the 14th century or even to the end of the thirteenth. The oldest appears to be the ''Mystery of St Agnes'' (edited by Bartsch, 1869), written in Arles. Somewhat more recent, but not later than the beginning of the 14th century, is a ''Passion of Christ'' (not yet printed) and a ''mystery of the [[Marriage of the Virgin]]'', which is partly adapted from a French poem of the 13th century, (see Romania xvi. 71). A manuscript, discovered in private archives (printed by [[Alfred Jeanroy]] and Henri Teuli\u00e9, 1893), contains not less than sixteen short mysteries, three founded on the [[Old Testament]], thirteen on the [[New testament|New]]. They were, written in Rouergue and are partly imitated from French mysteries.\n\nAt [[Manosque]] ([[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]]) was found a fragment of a ''Ludus sancts Jacobi'' inserted in a register of notarial deeds (printed by C. Arnaud) of some kind. In 1513 French poems were first admitted in the competitions, and under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (from 1679) these were alone held eligible. This unfair arrangement, by which some of the leading poets of northern France profited, held good till 1893, when the town very properly transferred its patronage to a new ''Escolo moundino'', but very soon restored its support to the older institution, on learning that Occitan poetry was again to be encouraged.\n\n==From the sixteenth to the eighteenth century==\n\nIn the two centuries that followed the glorious medieval period we have a succession of works, chiefly of a didactic and edifying character, which scarcely belong to the realm of literature proper, but at least served to keep alive some kind of literary tradition. This dreary interval was relieved by a number of religious mystery plays, which, though dull to us, probably gave keen enjoyment to the people, and represent a more popular genre; the latest that have come down to us may be placed between the years 1450 and 1515. Not only did the literature deteriorate during this period, but dialects took the place of the uniform literary language employed by the troubadours, while the spoken tongue yielded more and more to French. In 1539 [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], with the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats]], forbade the use of Occitan in official documents a fact that is worthy of note only as being significant in itself, not as an important factor in the decadence of Proven\u00e7al letters.\n\nOn the contrary, just about this time, there are signs of a revival. In 1565 the Gascon, [[Pey de Garros]], translated the [[Psalms]] into [[Gascon language|his dialect]], and two years later published a volume of poems. His love for his native tongue is genuine, and his command over it considerable; he deplores its neglect, and urges others to follow his example. [[Auger Gaillard]] (c. 1530\u20131595) does infinitely less credit to his province: the popularity of his light pieces was probably due to their obscenity. More in the spirit of Garros is the charming trilingual ''Salut'' composed by the famous [[du Bartas]] in honor of a visit of [[Marguerite de Valois]] to N\u00e9rac (1579): three [[nymph]]s dispute as to whether she should be welcomed in Latin, French, or Gascon, and the last, of course, wins the day.\n\n[[Provence]] proper gave birth to a poet of considerable importance in [[Louis Bellaud de la Bellaudire]] (1532\u20131588), of [[Grasse]], who, after studying at [[Aix-en-Provence|Aix]], enlisted in the royal armies, and was made a prisoner at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] in 1572. During his captivity he wrote poems inspired by real love of liberty and of his native country (Don-Don internal, 1584 or 1585). At Aix Bellaud subsequently became the centre of a literary circle which included most of the local celebrities; all of these paid their tribute to the poets memory in the edition of his works published by his uncle, Pierre Paul, himself the author of pieces of small value, included in the same volume (Lous Passatens, obros et rimos, &c., Marseilles, 1590s). Even when Bellaud is wholly frivolous, and intent on worldly pleasures only, his work has interest as reflecting the merry, careless life of the time.\n\nA writer very popular in Provence for the light-hearted productions of his youth was [[Claude Brueys]] (1570\u20131650), remarkable chiefly for comedies that deal largely with duped husbands (''Jardin deys musos provensalos'', not published till 1628). There is a certain charm, too, in the comedies of Claude's disciple, [[Gaspard Zerbin]] (''La Perlo deys niusos et coumedies prouvensalos'', 1655); and those critics who have read the plays of [[Jean de Cabanes]] (1653\u20131712) and of Seguin (of [[Tarascon]], c. 1640), still in MS., speak highly of them.\n\nThe most consistently popular form of poetry in the south of France was always the novel. There has been no limit to the production of these; but very rarely does the author deserve special mention. An exception must be made in the case of [[Nicholas Saboly]] (1614\u20131675), who produced the best pieces of this class, both as regards beauty of language and the devotion they breathe. They have deservedly maintained their popularity to the present day. In [[Languedoc]] four poets have been cited as the best of the age [[Goudelin]], [[Jean Michel (poet)|Michel]], [[Alain-Ren\u00e9 Lesage|LeSage]] and [[Jacques Bonnet|Bonnet]].\n\nThis is certainly so in the case of [[Pierre Goudelin]] (province Goudouli, 1579\u20131649), of Toulouse, the most distinguished name in Occitan literature between the period of the troubadours and that of [[Jacques Jasmin|Jasmin]]. He had a good classical education, traces of which appear in all his poetry, his language and his manner being always admirable, even where his matter is lacking in depth. He is often called the [[Fran\u00e7ois de Malherbe|Malherbe]] of the South, but resembles that writer only in form: his poetry, taken as a whole, has far more sap. Goudelin essayed and was successful in almost every short genre (''Lou Ramelet Moundi'', 1617, republished with additions till 1678), the piece of his which is most generally admired being the stanzas to [[Henry IV of France]], though others will prefer him in his gayer moods. He enjoyed enormous popularity (extending to Spain and Italy), but never prostituted his art to cheap effects. His influence, especially but not exclusively in the Occitan area, has been deep and lasting. The fame of [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]], of [[N\u00eemes]], rests on the ''{{lang|fr|Embarras de la foire de [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]]}}'', a poem of astonishing vigour, but deficient in taste. [[Daniel Sage]], of [[Montpellier]] (''Las Foulies'', 1650), was a man of loose morals, which are reflected in nearly all his works: his moments of genuine inspiration from other causes are rare. More worthy of being bracketed with Goudelin is the avocat Bonnet, author of the best among the open air plays that were annually performed at [[B\u00e9ziers]] on [[Ascension Day]]: a number of these (dated 1616\u20131657) were subsequently collected, but none can compare with the opening one, Bonnet's ''{{lang|fr|Jugement de Paris}}''.\n\nAnother very charming poet is [[Nicolas Fizes]], of [[Frontignan]], whose play, the ''Op\u00e9ra de Frontignan'' (1670), dealing with a slight love intrigue, and an [[idyllic poem]] on the fountain of Frontignan, show a real poetic gift. A number of Toulouse poets, mostly laureats of the Academy, may be termed followers of Goudelin: of these [[Fran\u00e7ois Boudet]] deserves mention, who composed an [[ode]], ''Le Trinfe del Moundi'' (1678), in honor of his native dialect.\n\nThe classical revival that may be noted about this time is also generally ascribed to Goudelin's influence. Its most distinguished representative was [[Jean de Vales]], of [[Montech]], who made excellent translations from [[Virgil]] and [[Persius]], and wrote a brilliant [[burlesque]] of the former in the manner of [[Scarron]] (''Virgile deguisat'', 1648; only four books published). He also composed a pastoral idyll, which, though too long and inclined to obscenity, contains much tender description. The greatest of the pastoral poets was [[Frariois de Cortete]] (1571\u20131655), of [[Prades, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales|Prades]], whose comedies, ''Ramounet'' and ''Mircimoundo'' (published, unfortunately with alterations, by his son in 1684), are written with such true feeling and in so pure a style that they can be read with real pleasure. A comedy of his dealing with [[Sancho Panza]] in the palace of the Duke has been edited.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the enormous popularity of [[Daubasse]] (1664\u20131727), of [[Quercy]], who belonged to the working classes; he was patronized by the nobility in exchange for [[panegyric]]s. Gascony produced two typical works in the 17th century: ''Aders Genthomme gascoun'' (1610) and ''Dastross Trinfe de la langue gascoune'' (1642). The former depicts a regular boasting Gascon who distinguishes himself in everything; while the latter is a plea in favor of the Gascon tongue, inspired by a genuine love of country. [[Gabriel Bedout]] (''Parterre gascoun'', 1642) is chiefly noted for his ''amorous solitari'', called forth by the sufferings he endured from a hardhearted mistress. [[Louis Baron]] (b. 1612), living peacefully in his native village of [[Pouyloubrin]], celebrated it with great tenderness.\n\nIn the 18th century the number of authors is much larger, but the bulk of good work produced is not equally great in proportion. The priests are mainly responsible for the literary output of Languedoc. [[Claude Peyrot]] (1709\u20131795) one of them, celebrates his county with true rural spirit in the ''Printenzps rouergat'' and ''Quartre sosous''. But the chief of the band is the [[Abbe Favre]] (1727\u20131783), the prior of [[Celleneuve]], whose ''Sermoun de moussu sistre'', delivered by a drunken priest against intemperance, is a masterpiece. He also wrote a successful mock-heroic poem (''Siege de Caderousse'') travesties of [[Homer]] and [[Virgil]], a prose novel depicting the country manners of the time (''Histoire de Jean lont pris''), and two comedies, which likewise give a vivid picture of the village life he knew so well.\n\nTwo genuine poets are the brothers [[Rigaud of Montpellier]]: Augustes (1760\u20131835) description of a vintage is deservedly famous; and Cyrille (1750-1820s) produced an equally delightful poem in the ''Amours de Mounpe\u00ef\u00e9''. [[Pierre Hellies]] of Toulouse (d. 1724) a poet of the people, whose vicious life finds an echo in his works, has a certain rude charm, at times distantly recalling [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon|Villon]]. In the Province [[Toussaint Gros]] (1698\u20131748), of [[Lyon]], holds undisputed sway.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} His style and language are admirable, but unfortunately he wasted his gifts largely on trivial pieces d'occasion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} [[Coyes]] (1711-17~7) comedy, the ''Franc pare'', is bright and still popular, while Germain's description of a visit paid by the ancient gods to [[Marseille]] (''La Bourrido del Dious'', 1760) has considerable humour. In Gascony the greatest poet is [[Cyrien Despourrins]] (1698\u20131755), whose pastoral idylls and mournful chansons, which he himself set to music, are imbued with tenderness and charm (most of them were collected at [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]] in 1828).\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] produced a large body of literature, but nothing of lasting interest. However, it gave an impetus to thought in the Occitan area, as elsewhere; and there, as elsewhere, it called forth a spirit of independence that was all in favor of a literary revival. Scholars of the stamp of [[Raynouard]] (1761\u20131863), of Aix, occupied themselves with the brilliant literary traditions of the Middle Ages; newspapers sprang up (the Proven\u00e7al ''Bouil-Abaisso'', started by [[Joseph Desanat]], and the bilingual ''Lou Tambourin et le m\u00e9nestrel'', edited by Bellot, both in 1842); poets banded together and collected their pieces in volume form (thus, the nine troubaire who published ''Lou Bouquet prouven\u00e7aou'' in 1823).\n\n==F\u00e9librige==\n[[File:Felibre 1854.jpg|thumb|Meeting of the F\u00e9libres in 1854]]\n\nMuch has been written about the ''precurseurs de [[F\u00e9librige]]'', and critics are sorely at variance as to the writers that most deserve this appellation. We shall not go far wrong if we include in the list [[Hyacinthe Morel]] (1756\u20131829), of [[Avignon]], whose collection of poems, ''Lou Saboulet'', has been republished by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]]; [[Louis Aubanel]] (178~-1842), of N\u00eemes, the successful translator of [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]]'s ''Odes''; [[Auguste Tandon]], the troubadour of Montpellier, who wrote ''Fables, contes et autres pi\u00e8ces en vers'' (1800); [[Fabre d'Olivet]], the versatile litt\u00e9rateur who in 1803 published ''Le Troubadour: Po\u00e9sies occitaniques'', which, in order to secure their success, he gave out as the work of some medieval poet Diou-loufet (1771\u20131840), who wrote a didactic poem, in the manner of Virgil, relating to silkworm-breeding (''Leis magnans''); [[Jacques Azais]] (1778\u20131856), author of satires, fables, etc.; [[d'Astros]] (1780\u20131863), a writer of fables in [[La Fontaine]]'s manner; [[Castil-Blaze]], who found time, amidst his musical pursuits, to compose Proven\u00e7al poems, intended to be set to music; the [[Marquis de la Fare-Alais]] (1791\u20131846), author of some light satirical tales (''Las Castagnados'').\n\nWhile these writers were all more or less academic, and appealed to the cultured few, four poets of the people addressed a far wider public: Verdi (1779\u20131820), of [[Bordeaux]], who wrote comic and satirical pieces; [[Jean Reboul]] (1796\u20131864), the baker of N\u00eemes, who never surpassed his first effort, ''L'Ange et l'enfant'' (1828); [[Victor Gelu]] (1806-1885), relentless and brutal, but undeniably powerful of his kind (''Fenian \u00e9 Grouman; dix chansons proven\u00e7ales'', 1840); and, greatest of them all, the true and acknowledged forerunner of the felibres, [[Jacques Jasmin]], whose poems, both lyrical and narrative, continue to find favour with men of the highest culture and literary attainments, as with the villagers for whom they were primarily intended.\n\nWhile much of this literature was still in the making, an event took place which was destined to eclipse in importance any that had gone before. In 1845 [[Joseph Roumanille]] of [[Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence|Saint-R\u00e9my]] ([[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]]), became usher in a small school at Avignon, which was attended by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral]], a native of the same district, then fifteen years of age. The former, feeling the germs of poetry within him, had composed some pieces in French; but, finding that his old mother could not understand them, he was greatly distressed. One of his chief titles to fame is that, together with [[Alphonse Daudet]], he drew the attention of [[Lamartine]] to Mistral's ''[[Mireio]]''. Roumanille and Mistral showed their gratitude by republishing the best pieces of these two precurseurs, together with those of Castil-Blaze and others, in ''Un Liame de Rasin'' (1865) and determined thenceforth to write in his native dialect only. These poems revealed a new world to young Mistral, and spurred him on to the resolve that became the one purpose of his life \"de remettre en lumi\u00e8re et conscience de sa gloire cette noble race que Mirabeau nomme encore la nation proven\u00e7ale\".\n\nMistral's personality  and  works are certainly better known than his fellows'. Still, in studying the Proven\u00e7al [[renaissance]], Roumanille's great claims should not be overlooked, and they have never been put forward with more force than by Mistral himself (in the ''preface to his Isclos doro''). Roumanille's secular verse cannot fail to appeal to every lover of pure and sincere poetry (''Li Margarideto'', 1836\u20131847; ''Li Sounjarello'', 1852; ''Li Flour de Sauvi'', 1850, 1859, etc.), his novels are second only to those of [[Saboly]], his prose works (such as ''Lou mege de Cucugnan'', 1863) sparkling with delightful humour. He it was who in 1852 collected and published ''Li Prouven\u00e7alo'', an anthology in which all the names yet to become famous, and most of those famous already (such as Jasmin), are represented. In 1853 he was one of the enthusiastic circle that had gathered round [[J.B. Gaut]] at Aix, and whose literary output is contained in the ''Roumavagi dei Troubaire'' and in the short lived journal ''Lou gay saber'' (1854).\n\nAt the same time the first attempt at regulating the orthography of Proven\u00e7al was made by him (in the introduction to his play, ''La Part dou bon Dieu'', 1853). And in 1854 he was one of the seven poets who, on May 21, foregathered at the [[castle of Fontsgugne]], near Avignon, and founded the F\u00e9librige. The etymology of this word has given rise to much speculation: the one thing certain about the word is that Mistral came across it in an old Proven\u00e7al poem, which tells how the [[Virgin]] meets [[Jesus]] in the Temple, among the seven ''felibres'' of the law. The outlines of the constitution, as finally settled in 1876, are as follows.\nThe region of the Felibrige is divided into four ''mantenen\u00e7o'' (Provence, Languedoc, [[Aquitaine]] and Catalonia 2). At the head of all is a consistori of fifty (called ''majourau''), presided over by the ''Capouli\u00e9'', who is chief of the entire Felibrige. The head of each mantenen\u00e7o is called ''sendi'' (who is at the same time a ''majourau''); and at the head of each school (as the subdivisions of the mantenen\u00e7o are called) is a ''cabisc\u00f2u''. The ordinary members, unlimited in number, are ''manten\u00e8ire''. Annual meetings and fetes are organized. The most widely read of the Felibrige publications is the ''Armana prouven\u00e7au'', which has appeared annually since, maintaining all the while its original scope and purpose; and though unpretentious in form, it contains much of the best work of the school. The other six were Mistral, [[Th\u00e9odore Aubanel]], [[Anselme Mathieu]] (a school fellow of Mistral's at Avignon), [[E. Garcin]], [[Alphonse Tavan]] and [[Paul Gi\u00e9ra]] (owner of the castle). Of these, Th\u00e9odore Aubanel has alone proved himself worthy to rank with Mistral and Roumanille.\n\nZani, the girl of his youthful and passionate love, took the veil; and this event cast a shadow over his whole life, and determined the character of all his poetry (''La miougrano entre-duberto'', 1860; ''Li Fiho d'Avignoun'', 1883). His is, without a doubt, the deepest nature and temperament among the felibres, and his lyrics are the most poignant. He has a keen sense of physical beauty in woman, and his verse is replete with suppressed passion, but he never sinks to sensuality. His powerful love drama ''Lou pau dou peccat'' was received with enthusiasm at Montpellier in 1878, and successfully produced (some years later in Arnes version) by Antoine at his Theatre Libreno mean criterion. It is the only play of real consequence that the school has yet produced. We need not do more than glance at the work of the fourth of the group of poets who alone, amidst the numerous writers of lyrics and other works that attain a high level of excellence.\n\nOne of the most pleasing features of the movement is the spirit of fraternity maintained by the f\u00e9libres with the poets and literary men of northern France, Catalonia, Italy, [[Romania]], Germany and other countries. In common with so many other productions of the Felibrige, this ''Almanac'' is published by the firm J. Roumanille, Libraire-Editeur, Avignon.\n\n[[Felix Gras]] settled at Avignon in his youth. His rustic epic, ''Li Carbouni\u00e9'' (1876) is full of elemental passion and abounds in fine descriptions of scenery, but it lacks proportion. The heroic geste of ''Toloza'' (1882), in which [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s invasion of the south is depicted with unbounded vigour and intensity, shows a great advance in art. ''Lou Roumancero prouven\u00e7au'' (1887) is a collection of poems instinct with Proven\u00e7al lore, and in ''Li Papalino'' (1891) we have some charming prose tales that bring to life again the Avignon of the [[pope]]s. Finally, the poet gave us three tales dealing with the period of the Revolution (''Li Rouge d\u00f3u miejour'', etc.); their realism and literary art called forth general admiration.\n\n[[File:Felibrige latin.jpg|thumb|''F\u00e9librige Latin'']]\n\nWhile Mistral and many of the best felibres employ the dialect of the [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], others, who have since seceded as the ''F\u00e9librige Latin'' (headed by [[Roque-Ferrier]]), prefer to use the dialect of [[Montpellier]], owing to its central position. A third class favors the [[Limousin dialect|dialect of Limousin]], considering it has been used by  the troubadours. Nearly all the leaders of the Felibrige are [[Legitimist]]s and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThere are exceptions, however, chief among them the [[Protestant]] Gras, whose ''Toloza'' clearly reflects his sympathy with the [[Albigenses]]. Yet this did not stand in the way of his election as Capouli\u00e9 proof, if proof were needed, that literary merit outweighs all other considerations in this artistic body of men. Finally, it may be noted that the felibres have often been accused of lack of patriotism towards northern France, of schemes of decentralization, and other heresies; but none of these charges holds good. The spirit of the movement, as represented by its leaders, has never been expressed with greater terseness, force and truth than in the three verses set by Felix Gras at the head of his Carbouni\u00e9: \"I love my village more than thy village; I love my Provence more than thy province; I love France more than all\".\n\n==Late twentieth and twenty-first century==\nDespite two hundred years of suppression by successive French centralist governments and the official prohibition of the language at school, in the administration and in the media, Occitan and [[Occitania]] have never ceased to inspire poets and authors. To the day, Article II of the [[French Constitution]] denies the existence and legitimacy of culturally rich and elaborate idioms such as Catalan, Breton, Basque and Occitan, among others. And though the use of the latter has been greatly affected by what is known as la [[Vergonha]] \u2014 which is the physical, legal, artistic and moral repression of the tongue in all areas of society aiming at making children feel ''ashamed'' of their parents' language to the benefit of French, \u2014 every region of the country of \u00d2c gave birth to literary geniuses: [[Joan Bodon]] in [[Guyenne]], [[Marcela Delpastre]] in [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], [[Rob\u00e8rt Lafont]] in [[Provence]], [[Bernat Manciet]] in [[Gascony]] and [[Max Roqueta]] in [[Languedoc]].<ref>Olivier Burckhardt [http://www.obfuchai.com/pages/troubadours.html Modern-Day Troubadours: Contemporary Literature in the Occitan Languages] ''Contemporary Review'', January 1999, Vol. 274, Issue 1596, pp. 33-37</ref>\n\nAll genres of modern international literature are present in Occitan, especially since the second half of the 20th century, although some avant-garde Occitan literature already existed from the late 19th century.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Occitan poets]]\n* [[List of troubadours and trobairitz]]\n* [[Cantiga de amigo]]\n* [[Jacques Jasmin]]\n* [[Medieval music]]\n* [[French Medieval literature]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |title=Proven\u00e7al Literature |first=Harriet |last=Waters |chapter=Preston |volume=20 |pages=11871\u201311890 |series=Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern |publisher=R.
