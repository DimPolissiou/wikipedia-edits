Two, from the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa]] (compiled in [[Babylon]] round 1700 BC) are reported to have been made during the reign of king [[Sargon of Akkad]] (2334-2279 BC).<ref>Two texts which refer to the 'omens of Sargon' are reported in E.

Its contents consisted of 70 [[cuneiform]] tablets comprising 7,000 celestial omens. Texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition - the origin and content of which can only be speculated upon.<ref>[[#Reference-Baigent|Baigent (1994)]] p.71.</ref> At this time Babylonian astrology was solely mundane, concerned with the prediction of weather and political matters, and prior to the 7th century BC the practitioners' understanding of [[astronomy]] was fairly rudimentary.  Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, fishing by net or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century,  their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] began to appear.<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] p.9.</ref>\n\nBabylonian astrology developed within the context of divination.  A collection of 32 tablets with inscribed liver models, dating from about 1875 BC, are the oldest known detailed texts of Babylonian divination, and these demonstrate the same interpretational format as that employed in celestial omen analysis.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.16.</ref>  Blemishes and marks found on the liver of the sacrificial animal were interpreted as symbolic signs which presented messages from the gods to the king.\n\nThe gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the [[classical planet|planets]] or [[star]]s with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.11.</ref>  Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god's expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king [[Esarhaddon]] concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some kind of correlate within the natural world:\n{{quote|... In the beginning of the year a flood will come and break the dikes. When the Moon has made the eclipse, the king, my lord, should write to me.

Tablet source given as: ''State Archives of Assyria'' 8 250.</ref>}}\nUlla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book ''Mesopotamian Astrology'', argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so \u201cshares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations\u201d.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.13.</ref>  Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.19.</ref>  mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology.<ref>{{cite book|title=From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Michael Baigent|publisher=Arkana|date=1994}}</ref> It was only with the gradual emergence of [[horoscopic astrology]], from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of [[natal astrology]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mundane astrology|author=Michael Baigent, Nicholas Campion and Charles Harvey|publisher=Thorsons|date=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Broecke2003\">{{cite book|author=Steven Vanden Broecke|title=The limits of influence: Pico, Louvain, and the crisis of Renaissance astrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0yDeNFZOT4C&pg=PA185|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13169-9|pages=185\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Hellenistic Egypt==\n{{Main|Hellenistic astrology}}\nIn 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, historian Tamsyn Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the Egyptian [[zodiac]], which shared two signs \u2013 the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the [[Dendera Zodiac]] (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion's Claws).<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 24.</ref>\n\nAfter the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, Egypt came under [[Hellenistic]] rule and influence.  The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in Ptolemaic Alexandria that [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This  contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] pp. 11-13.</ref>\n\nThe decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into \u2018hours\u2019. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 20.</ref> The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the [[Dendera Zodiac]].\n\nParticularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]], who lived in Alexandria in Egypt. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition, and as a source of later reference is said to have \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\".<ref>[[#Robbins_Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']], 'Introduction' p. xii.</ref> It was one of the first astrological texts to be circulated in Medieval <ref>{{cite web |url = http://astrologyclub.org/history/ |title = The History of Astrology |accessdate = 2016-12-28 |date = 2014-06-13 }}</ref> Europe after being translated from Arabic into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]] (Tiburtinus) in Spain, 1138.<ref>FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Firmicus Maternus]] (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named [[Nekauba|Nechepso]] and his priest [[Petosiris]].<ref>[[#Reference-Firmicus|Firmicus (4th century)]] (III.4) 'Proemium'.</ref> The [[Hermetism|Hermetic]] texts were also put together during this period and  [[Clement of Alexandria]], writing in the [[Roman era]], demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:\n<blockquote>This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.<ref>[[#Reference-Roberts|Roberts (1906)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKsL6MsawugC&lpg=PP1&dq=ante-nicene%20fathers%20volume%20II&pg=PA488#v=onepage&q&f=false p.488].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Greece and Rome==\nThe conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to the cultures and [[cosmology|cosmological]] ideas of [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from cuneiform to Greek.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 173.</ref> Sometime around 280 BC, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]] in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what historian [[Nicholas Campion]] calls, \"the innovative energy\" in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 84.</ref>\nAccording to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the [[Eastern World]] was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BC two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of [[horoscope]]s in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future; the other being [[theurgic]] (literally  meaning 'god-work'), which emphasised the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the [[Divinity|Divine]].<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.173-174.</ref>\n\nAs with much else, Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=B32>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32.</ref> However, our earliest references to demonstrate its arrival in Rome reveal its initial influence upon the lower orders of society,<ref name=B32 /> and display concern about uncritical recourse to the ideas of  Babylonian 'star-gazers'.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.227-228.</ref> Among the Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' came to be a common [[synonym]] for [[divination]] using planets and stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]] p.16.</ref>\n\nThe first definite reference to astrology  comes from the work of the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BC composed a treatise warning farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32-33. See also [[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.228.</ref> The 2nd-century Roman poet [[Juvenal]], in his satirical attack on the habits of Roman women, also complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, despite their lowly social status, saying \"Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Amun|Hammon's]] fountain, ... nowadays no astrologer has credit unless he has been imprisoned in some distant camp, with chains clanking on either arm\".<ref>[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: '[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012).</ref>\n\nOne of the first astrologers to bring [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] astrology to Rome was [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]], who, in the first century CE, acted as the astrologer for the [[emperor]] [[Tiberius]].<ref name=\"B32\"/> Tiberius was the first emperor  reported to have had a court astrologer,<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.43.</ref> although his predecessor [[Augustus]] had also used astrology to help legitimise his [[Imperialism|Imperial]] rights.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.63.</ref> <!--Some referenced information needed with regard to bans against astrologers and use in Roman politics --> In the second century CE, the astrologer Claudius Ptolemy was so obsessed with getting horoscopes accurate that he began the first attempt to make an accurate world map (maps before this were more relativistic or allegorical) so that he could chart the relationship between the person's birthplace and the heavenly bodies. While doing so, he coined the term \"geography\".<ref>Thompson, Clive. \"The Whole World in your Hands\". ''Smithsonian'', July 2017. p. 19.</ref>\n\nEven though some use of astrology by the emperors appears to have happened, there was also a prohibition on astrology to a certain extent as well. In the 1st century CE, [[Publius Rufus Anteius]] was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor [[Nero]]. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide.

The second Abbasid [[caliph]], [[Al Mansur]] (754-775) founded the city of [[Baghdad]] to act as a centre of learning, and  included in its design a library-translation centre known as ''Bayt al-Hikma'' \u2018Storehouse of Wisdom\u2019, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic translations of Hellenistic astrological texts.<ref>[[#Reference-Houlding-2010|Houlding (2010)]] Ch. 8: 'The medieval development of Hellenistic principles concerning aspectual applications and orbs'; pp.12-13.</ref> The early translators included [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad,<ref>[[#Reference-Albiruni-chronology|Albiruni, Chronology (11th century)]] Ch.VIII, \u2018On the days of the Greek calendar\u2019, ''re''. 23 Tamm\u00fbz; Sachau.</ref> and [[Sahl ibn Bishr]] (a.k.a.

The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the [[List of traditional star names|star names]] that are commonly known today, such as [[Aldebaran]], [[Altair]], [[Betelgeuse]], [[Rigel]] and [[Vega]] retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic [[Arabic parts|lots]] to the extent that they became historically known as [[Arabic parts]], for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of [[Hellenistic astrology]].\n\nDuring the advance of Islamic science some of the practices of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]], and conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] through the suggestion that the Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance.<ref>[[#Reference-Saliba-1994|Saliba (1994)]] p.60, pp.67-69.</ref> Such refutations mainly concerned [[Judicial astrology|'judicial branches']] (such as [[horary astrology]]), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as [[Medical astrology|medical]] and [[Astrometeorology|meteorological]] astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.\n\nFor example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology' ''Res\u0101la f\u012b eb\u1e6d\u0101l a\u1e25k\u0101m al-noj\u016bm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation.

Dante attributed these arts to the planets. As the arts were seen as operating in ascending order, so were the planets  in decreasing order of planetary speed: [[grammar]] was assigned to the Moon, the quickest moving celestial body, [[dialectic]] was assigned to Mercury, [[rhetoric]] to Venus, [[music]] to the Sun, [[arithmetic]] to Mars, [[geometry]] to Jupiter and astrology/[[astronomy]] to the slowest moving body, Saturn.<ref>[[#Reference-Burckhardt|Burckhardt (1969)]]</ref>\n\nMedieval writers used astrological symbolism in their literary themes. For example, Dante's ''Divine Comedy''  builds varied references to planetary associations within his described architecture of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Paradise]], (such as the seven layers of Purgatory's mountain purging the [[Seven deadly sins|seven cardinal sins]] that correspond to astrology's [[classical planets|seven classical planets]]).<ref>[[#Reference-Crane|Crane (2012)]] pp.81-85.</ref> Similar astrological allegories and planetary themes are pursued through the works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Astrology and English literature'' | author=A.

His notebook demonstrates that he had a wide range of clients, from all walks of life, and indicates that engagement with astrology in 15th-century England was not confined to those within learned, theological or political circles.<ref name=page>Sophie Page, 'Richard Trewythian and the Uses of Astrology in Late Medieval England', ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' Vol. 64, (2001), pp. 193-228.

Many individuals now credited with having overturned the old astrological order, such as [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], were themselves practicing astrologers.<ref>Wade Rowland, ''Galileo's Mistake: A New Look At the Epic Confrontation Between Galileo and the Church'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WWyF4vS8P7UC&pg=PA39&dq=astrologers+Galileo+Galilei,+Tycho+Brahe+and+Johannes+Kepler,&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s1DwT9OFPIK_0QX4tuSQDg&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false p.39]. (Arcade Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|9781559706841}}. Brahe is described as \"an acknowledged master of astrology\", Galileo as \"a dabbler, though by no means an adept\" and it is said of Kepler that \"astrology informed his entire career\".</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Renaissance the confidence placed in astrology diminished, with the breakdown of [[Aristotelian Physics]] and rejection of the distinction between the [[Celestial spheres|celestial]] and [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar realms]], which had historically acted as the foundation of astrological theory. Keith Thomas writes that although [[heliocentrism]] is consistent with astrology theory, 16th and 17th century astronomical advances meant that \"the world could no longer be envisaged as a compact inter-locking organism; it was now a mechanism of infinite dimensions, from which the hierarchical subordination of earth to heaven had irrefutably disappeared\".<ref name=Thomas>Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971) p. 414-415, {{ISBN|9780195213607}}</ref> Initially, amongst the astronomers of the time, \"scarcely anyone attempted a serious refutation in the light of the new principles\" and in fact astronomers \"were reluctant to give up the emotional satisfaction provided by a coherent and interrelated universe\". By the 18th century the intellectual investment which had previously maintained astrology's standing was largely abandoned.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Historian of science Ann Geneva writes:\n{{Quote|Astrology in seventeenth century England was not a science. It was not a Religion. It was not magic.  Nor was it astronomy, mathematics, puritanism, neo Platism, psychology, meteorology, alchemy or witchcraft. It used some of these as tools; it held tenets in common with others; and some people were adept at several of these skills. But in the final analysis it was only itself: a unique divinatory and prognostic art embodying centuries of accreted methodology and tradition.<ref>Ann Geneva, ''Astrology and the Seventeenth Century Mind: William Lilly and the Language of the Stars'', p.9.

The earliest treatise on jyotish, the [[Bhrigu Samhita]], dates from the Vedic era. The sage Bhrigu is one of the Saptarshi, the seven sages who assisted in the creation of the universe. Written on pages of tree bark, the Samhita (Compilation) is said to contain five million horoscopes comprising all who have lived in the past or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of [[Aryabhata]] in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' and the lost ''Arya-siddh\u0101nta'', there is the ''[[Pancha-Siddh\u0101ntika]]'' of [[Varahamihira]].\n\n==China==\n{{Main|Chinese astrology}}\n[[File:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumbnail|right|120px|An oracle bone \u2013 turtle shell]]\nChinese system is based on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and  [[Chinese calendar|calendar]]s and its significant development is tied to that of [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], which came to flourish during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD).<ref>{{cite book |title=Astrology and Cosmology in Early China: Conforming Earth to Heaven |first=David W. |last=Pankenier |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mUxCAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Astrology+and+Cosmology+in+Early+China:+Conforming+Earth+to+Heaven#v=onepage&q=Astrology%20and%20Cosmology%20in%20Early%20China%3A%20Conforming%20Earth%20to%20Heaven&f=false|isbn=9781107292246 }}</ref>\n\nChinese astrology has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmony, heaven, earth and water) and uses the principles of [[yin and yang]] and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the [[wu xing]] teachings, the 10 [[Celestial stems]], the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], the [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]] (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day and [[shichen]] (\u6642\u8fb0).\n\nAstrology was traditionally regarded highly in China, and  Confucius is said to have treated astrology with respect saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref> The 60-year cycle combining the five elements with the twelve animal signs of the zodiac has been documented in China since at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang (Shing or Yin) dynasty]] (ca 1766 BC \u2013 ca 1050 BC). [[Oracle bone|Oracles bones]] have been found dating from that period with the date according to the 60-year cycle inscribed on them, along with the name of the diviner and the topic being divined about. One of the most famous astrologers in China was [[Tsou Yen]] who lived in around 300 BC, and who wrote: \"When some new dynasty is going to arise, heaven exhibits auspicious signs for the people\".\n\n==Mesoamerica==\n{{Main|Maya calendar|Aztec calendar}}\nThe calendars of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. The earliest calendars were employed by peoples such as the Zapotecs and [[Olmec]]s, and later by such peoples as the [[Maya civilisation|Maya]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]]. Although the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]] did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements to it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.\n\nThe distinctive Mayan calendar used two main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the [[Tzolkin]] of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each was linked to an elaborate astrological system to cover every facet of life. On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim.<ref name=\"Parkers\"/> A 584-day [[Venus]] cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also 'scorpion', while the name of the constellation Gemini was 'peccary'. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts.<ref>Michael D. Coe, 'The Maya', pp. 227\u201329, Thames and Hudson, London, 2005</ref> The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico.\n\nThe Aztec calendar shares the same basic structure as the Mayan calendar, with two main cycles of 360 days and 260 days. The 260-day calendar was called [[Tonalpohualli]] and was used primarily for divinatory purposes. Like the Mayan calendar, these two cycles formed a 52-year 'century', sometimes called the [[Calendar Round]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Astrology]]\n* [[Astrology and science]]\n* [[Classical planets in Western alchemy]]\n* [[Jewish views on astrology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Wikicite | id = Albiruni-chronology | reference= Al Biruni (11th century), '' The Chronology of Ancient Nations''; tr.

Its contents consisted of 70 [[cuneiform]] tablets comprising 7,000 celestial omens. Texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition - the origin and content of which can only be speculated upon.<ref>[[#Reference-Baigent|Baigent (1994)]] p.71.</ref> At this time Babylonian astrology was solely mundane, concerned with the prediction of weather and political matters, and prior to the 7th century BC the practitioners' understanding of [[astronomy]] was fairly rudimentary.  Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, fishing by net or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century,  their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] began to appear.<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] p.9.</ref>\n\nBabylonian astrology developed within the context of divination.  A collection of 32 tablets with inscribed liver models, dating from about 1875 BC, are the oldest known detailed texts of Babylonian divination, and these demonstrate the same interpretational format as that employed in celestial omen analysis.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.16.</ref>  Blemishes and marks found on the liver of the sacrificial animal were interpreted as symbolic signs which presented messages from the gods to the king.\n\nThe gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the [[classical planet|planets]] or [[star]]s with whom they were associated. Evil celestial omens attached to any particular planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.11.</ref>  Such indications were met with attempts to appease the god and find manageable ways by which the god's expression could be realised without significant harm to the king and his nation. An astronomical report to the king [[Esarhaddon]] concerning a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute kings, or substitute events, combined an unquestioning belief in magic and omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some kind of correlate within the natural world:\n{{quote|...

Tablet source given as: ''State Archives of Assyria'' 8 250.</ref>}}\nUlla Koch-Westenholz, in her 1995 book ''Mesopotamian Astrology'', argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which, despite its heavy reliance on magic, remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of revenge, and so \u201cshares some of the defining traits of modern science: it is objective and value-free, it operates according to known rules, and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations\u201d.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.13.</ref>  Koch-Westenholz also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divinatory disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively concerned with mundane astrology, being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and nations, and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the king as the governing head of the nation.<ref>[[#Reference-Koch|Koch-Westenholz (1995)]] p.19.</ref>  mundane astrology is therefore known to be one of the oldest branches of astrology.<ref>{{cite book|title=From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Michael Baigent|publisher=Arkana|date=1994}}</ref> It was only with the gradual emergence of [[horoscopic astrology]], from the 6th century BC, that astrology developed the techniques and practice of [[natal astrology]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mundane astrology|author=Michael Baigent, Nicholas Campion and Charles Harvey|publisher=Thorsons|date=1984}}</ref><ref name=\"Broecke2003\">{{cite book|author=Steven Vanden Broecke|title=The limits of influence: Pico, Louvain, and the crisis of Renaissance astrology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0yDeNFZOT4C&pg=PA185|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=2003|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-13169-9|pages=185\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Hellenistic Egypt==\n{{Main|Hellenistic astrology}}\nIn 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians so there is likely to have been some Mesopotamian influence on Egyptian astrology. Arguing in favour of this, historian Tamsyn Barton gives an example of what appears to be Mesopotamian influence on the Egyptian [[zodiac]], which shared two signs \u2013 the Balance and the Scorpion, as evidenced in the [[Dendera Zodiac]] (in the Greek version the Balance was known as the Scorpion's Claws).<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 24.</ref>\n\nAfter the occupation by [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BC, Egypt came under [[Hellenistic]] rule and influence.  The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest and during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the scholars of Alexandria were prolific writers. It was in Ptolemaic Alexandria that [[Babylonian astrology]] was mixed with the Egyptian tradition of [[Decans|Decanic astrology]] to create [[Horoscopic astrology]]. This  contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary [[exaltation (astrology)|exaltation]]s, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. Along with this it incorporated the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and [[four elements]].<ref>[[#Reference-Holden|Holden (1996)]] pp. 11-13.</ref>\n\nThe decans were a system of time measurement according to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into \u2018hours\u2019. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over the course of the year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p. 20.</ref> The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the [[Dendera Zodiac]].\n\nParticularly important in the development of horoscopic astrology was the [[astrologer]] and astronomer [[Ptolemy#Astrology|Ptolemy]], who lived in Alexandria in Egypt. Ptolemy's work the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'' laid the basis of the Western astrological tradition, and as a source of later reference is said to have \"enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more\".<ref>[[#Robbins_Tet|Robbins, ''Ptolemy Tetrabiblos'']], 'Introduction' p. xii.</ref> It was one of the first astrological texts to be circulated in Medieval <ref>{{cite web |url = http://astrologyclub.org/history/ |title = The History of Astrology |accessdate = 2016-12-28 |date = 2014-06-13 }}</ref> Europe after being translated from Arabic into Latin by [[Plato of Tivoli]] (Tiburtinus) in Spain, 1138.<ref>FA Robbins, 1940; Thorndike 1923)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Firmicus Maternus]] (4th century), the system of horoscopic astrology was given early on to an Egyptian pharaoh named [[Nekauba|Nechepso]] and his priest [[Petosiris]].<ref>[[#Reference-Firmicus|Firmicus (4th century)]] (III.4) 'Proemium'.</ref> The [[Hermetism|Hermetic]] texts were also put together during this period and  [[Clement of Alexandria]], writing in the [[Roman era]], demonstrates the degree to which astrologers were expected to have knowledge of the texts in his description of Egyptian sacred rites:\n<blockquote>This is principally shown by their sacred ceremonial. For first advances the Singer, bearing some one of the symbols of music. For they say that he must learn two of the books of Hermes, the one of which contains the hymns of the gods, the second the regulations for the king's life. And after the Singer advances the Astrologer, with a horologe in his hand, and a palm, the symbols of astrology. He must have the astrological books of Hermes, which are four in number, always in his mouth.<ref>[[#Reference-Roberts|Roberts (1906)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKsL6MsawugC&lpg=PP1&dq=ante-nicene%20fathers%20volume%20II&pg=PA488#v=onepage&q&f=false p.488].</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Greece and Rome==\nThe conquest of [[Asia]] by [[Alexander the Great]] exposed the Greeks to the cultures and [[cosmology|cosmological]] ideas of [[Syria]], Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Greek overtook cuneiform script as the international language of intellectual communication and part of this process was the transmission of astrology from cuneiform to Greek.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 173.</ref> Sometime around 280 BC, [[Berossus]], a priest of [[Marduk|Bel]] from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of [[Kos]] in order to teach astrology and Babylonian culture to the Greeks. With this, what historican [[Nicholas Campion]] calls, \"the innovative energy\" in astrology moved west to the Hellenistic world of Greece and Egypt.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] p. 84.</ref>\nAccording to Campion, the astrology that arrived from the [[Eastern World]] was marked by its complexity, with different forms of astrology emerging. By the 1st century BC two varieties of astrology were in existence, one that required the reading of [[horoscope]]s in order to establish precise details about the past, present and future; the other being [[theurgic]] (literally  meaning 'god-work'), which emphasised the [[soul|soul's]] ascent to the stars. While they were not mutually exclusive, the former sought information about the life, while the latter was concerned with personal transformation, where astrology served as a form of dialogue with the [[Divinity|Divine]].<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.173-174.</ref>\n\nAs with much else, Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].<ref name=B32>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32.</ref> However, our earliest references to demonstrate its arrival in Rome reveal its initial influence upon the lower orders of society,<ref name=B32 /> and display concern about uncritical recourse to the ideas of  Babylonian 'star-gazers'.<ref>[[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.227-228.</ref> Among the Greeks and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], Babylonia (also known as [[Chaldea]]) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' came to be a common [[synonym]] for [[divination]] using planets and stars.<ref>[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]] p.16.</ref>\n\nThe first definite reference to astrology  comes from the work of the orator [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], who in 160 BC composed a treatise warning farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.32-33. See also [[#Reference-Campion|Campion (2008)]] pp.228.</ref> The 2nd-century Roman poet [[Juvenal]], in his satirical attack on the habits of Roman women, also complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, despite their lowly social status, saying \"Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from [[Amun|Hammon's]] fountain, ... nowadays no astrologer has credit unless he has been imprisoned in some distant camp, with chains clanking on either arm\".<ref>[[Juvenal]], Satire 6: '[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm The Ways of Women]' (translated by G. G. Ramsay, 1918, retrieved 5 July 2012).</ref>\n\nOne of the first astrologers to bring [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] astrology to Rome was [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]], who, in the first century CE, acted as the astrologer for the [[emperor]] [[Tiberius]].<ref name=\"B32\"/> Tiberius was the first emperor  reported to have had a court astrologer,<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.43.</ref> although his predecessor [[Augustus]] had also used astrology to help legitimise his [[Imperialism|Imperial]] rights.<ref>[[#Reference-Barton|Barton (1994)]] p.63.</ref> <!--Some referenced information needed with regard to bans against astrologers and use in Roman politics --> In the second century CE, the astrologer Claudius Ptolemy was so obsessed with getting horoscopes accurate that he began the first attempt to make an accurate world map (maps before this were more relativistic or allegorical) so that he could chart the relationship between the person's birthplace and the heavenly bodies. While doing so, he coined the term \"geography\".<ref>Thompson, Clive. \"The Whole World in your Hands\". ''Smithsonian'', July 2017. p. 19.</ref>\n\nEven though some use of astrology by the emperors appears to have happened, there was also a prohibition on astrology to a certain extent as well. In the 1st century CE, [[Publius Rufus Anteius]] was accused of the crime of funding the banished astrologer Pammenes, and requesting his own horoscope and that of then emperor [[Nero]]. For this crime, Nero forced Anteius to commit suicide.

The second Abbasid [[caliph]], [[Al Mansur]] (754-775) founded the city of [[Baghdad]] to act as a centre of learning, and  included in its design a library-translation centre known as ''Bayt al-Hikma'' \u2018Storehouse of Wisdom\u2019, which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic translations of Hellenistic astrological texts.<ref>[[#Reference-Houlding-2010|Houlding (2010)]] Ch. 8: 'The medieval development of Hellenistic principles concerning aspectual applications and orbs'; pp.12-13.</ref> The early translators included [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Mashallah]], who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad,<ref>[[#Reference-Albiruni-chronology|Albiruni, Chronology (11th century)]] Ch.VIII, \u2018On the days of the Greek calendar\u2019, ''re''. 23 Tamm\u00fbz; Sachau.</ref> and [[Sahl ibn Bishr]] (a.k.a.

The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the [[List of traditional star names|star names]] that are commonly known today, such as [[Aldebaran]], [[Altair]], [[Betelgeuse]], [[Rigel]] and [[Vega]] retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic [[Arabic parts|lots]] to the extent that they became historically known as [[Arabic parts]], for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of [[Hellenistic astrology]].\n\nDuring the advance of Islamic science some of the practices of astrology were refuted on theological grounds by astronomers such as [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius), [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) and [[Avicenna]]. Their criticisms argued that the methods of astrologers were [[conjectural]] rather than [[empirical]], and conflicted with orthodox religious views of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] through the suggestion that the Will of God can be precisely known and predicted in advance.<ref>[[#Reference-Saliba-1994|Saliba (1994)]] p.60, pp.67-69.</ref> Such refutations mainly concerned [[Judicial astrology|'judicial branches']] (such as [[horary astrology]]), rather than the more 'natural branches' such as [[Medical astrology|medical]] and [[Astrometeorology|meteorological]] astrology, these being seen as part of the natural sciences of the time.\n\nFor example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology' ''Res\u0101la f\u012b eb\u1e6d\u0101l a\u1e25k\u0101m al-noj\u016bm'', argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle of planets acting as the agents of divine causation which express God's absolute power over creation.

Dante attributed these arts to the planets. As the arts were seen as operating in ascending order, so were the planets  in decreasing order of planetary speed: [[grammar]] was assigned to the Moon, the quickest moving celestial body, [[dialectic]] was assigned to Mercury, [[rhetoric]] to Venus, [[music]] to the Sun, [[arithmetic]] to Mars, [[geometry]] to Jupiter and astrology/[[astronomy]] to the slowest moving body, Saturn.<ref>[[#Reference-Burckhardt|Burckhardt (1969)]]</ref>\n\nMedieval writers used astrological symbolism in their literary themes. For example, Dante's ''Divine Comedy''  builds varied references to planetary associations within his described architecture of [[Hell]], [[Purgatory]] and [[Paradise]], (such as the seven layers of Purgatory's mountain purging the [[Seven deadly sins|seven cardinal sins]] that correspond to astrology's [[classical planets|seven classical planets]]).<ref>[[#Reference-Crane|Crane (2012)]] pp.81-85.</ref> Similar astrological allegories and planetary themes are pursued through the works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Astrology and English literature'' | author=A.

His notebook demonstrates that he had a wide range of clients, from all walks of life, and indicates that engagement with astrology in 15th-century England was not confined to those within learned, theological or political circles.<ref name=page>Sophie Page, 'Richard Trewythian and the Uses of Astrology in Late Medieval England', ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' Vol. 64, (2001), pp. 193-228.

Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/751562.</ref>\n\nDuring the Renaissance, court astrologers would complement their use of horoscopes with astronomical observations and discoveries. Many individuals now credited with having overturned the old astrological order, such as [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], were themselves practicing astrologers.<ref>Wade Rowland, ''Galileo's Mistake: A New Look At the Epic Confrontation Between Galileo and the Church'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=WWyF4vS8P7UC&pg=PA39&dq=astrologers+Galileo+Galilei,+Tycho+Brahe+and+Johannes+Kepler,&hl=en&sa=X&ei=s1DwT9OFPIK_0QX4tuSQDg&ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false p.39]. (Arcade Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|9781559706841}}. Brahe is described as \"an acknowledged master of astrology\", Galileo as \"a dabbler, though by no means an adept\" and it is said of Kepler that \"astrology informed his entire career\".</ref>\n\nAt the end of the Renaissance the confidence placed in astrology diminished, with the breakdown of [[Aristotelian Physics]] and rejection of the distinction between the [[Celestial spheres|celestial]] and [[Sublunary sphere|sublunar realms]], which had historically acted as the foundation of astrological theory. Keith Thomas writes that although [[heliocentrism]] is consistent with astrology theory, 16th and 17th century astronomical advances meant that \"the world could no longer be envisaged as a compact inter-locking organism; it was now a mechanism of infinite dimensions, from which the hierarchical subordination of earth to heaven had irrefutably disappeared\".<ref name=Thomas>Keith Thomas, ''Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century England'' (Oxford University Press, 1971) p. 414-415, {{ISBN|9780195213607}}</ref> Initially, amongst the astronomers of the time, \"scarcely anyone attempted a serious refutation in the light of the new principles\" and in fact astronomers \"were reluctant to give up the emotional satisfaction provided by a coherent and interrelated universe\". By the 18th century the intellectual investment which had previously maintained astrology's standing was largely abandoned.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/> Historian of science Ann Geneva writes:\n{{Quote|Astrology in seventeenth century England was not a science. It was not a Religion. It was not magic.  Nor was it astronomy, mathematics, puritanism, neo Platism, psychology, meteorology, alchemy or witchcraft. It used some of these as tools; it held tenets in common with others; and some people were adept at several of these skills. But in the final analysis it was only itself: a unique divinatory and prognostic art embodying centuries of accreted methodology and tradition.<ref>Ann Geneva, ''Astrology and the Seventeenth Century Mind: William Lilly and the Language of the Stars'', p.9.

The only work of this class to have survived is the ''[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]'', which contains rules for tracking the motions of the sun and the moon in the context of a five-year intercalation cycle.

The earliest treatise on jyotish, the [[Bhrigu Samhita]], dates from the Vedic era. The sage Bhrigu is one of the Saptarshi, the seven sages who assisted in the creation of the universe. Written on pages of tree bark, the Samhita (Compilation) is said to contain five million horoscopes comprising all who have lived in the past or will live in the future. The first named authors writing treatises on astronomy are from the 5th century AD, the date when the classical period of Indian astronomy can be said to begin. Besides the theories of [[Aryabhata]] in the ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' and the lost ''Arya-siddh\u0101nta'', there is the ''[[Pancha-Siddh\u0101ntika]]'' of [[Varahamihira]].\n\n==China==\n{{Main|Chinese astrology}}\n[[File:Shang_dynasty_inscribed_tortoise_plastron.jpg|thumbnail|right|120px|An oracle bone \u2013 turtle shell]]\nChinese system is based on [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and  [[Chinese calendar|calendar]]s and its significant development is tied to that of [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], which came to flourish during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD).<ref>{{cite book |title=Astrology and Cosmology in Early China: Conforming Earth to Heaven |first=David W. |last=Pankenier |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mUxCAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Astrology+and+Cosmology+in+Early+China:+Conforming+Earth+to+Heaven#v=onepage&q=Astrology%20and%20Cosmology%20in%20Early%20China%3A%20Conforming%20Earth%20to%20Heaven&f=false|isbn=9781107292246 }}</ref>\n\nChinese astrology has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmony, heaven, earth and water) and uses the principles of [[yin and yang]] and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the [[wu xing]] teachings, the 10 [[Celestial stems]], the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], the [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]] (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day and [[shichen]] (\u6642\u8fb0).\n\nAstrology was traditionally regarded highly in China, and  Confucius is said to have treated astrology with respect saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref> The 60-year cycle combining the five elements with the twelve animal signs of the zodiac has been documented in China since at least the time of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang (Shing or Yin) dynasty]] (ca 1766 BC \u2013 ca 1050 BC). [[Oracle bone|Oracles bones]] have been found dating from that period with the date according to the 60-year cycle inscribed on them, along with the name of the diviner and the topic being divined about. One of the most famous astrologers in China was [[Tsou Yen]] who lived in around 300 BC, and who wrote: \"When some new dynasty is going to arise, heaven exhibits auspicious signs for the people\".\n\n==Mesoamerica==\n{{Main|Maya calendar|Aztec calendar}}\nThe calendars of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica are based upon a system which had been in common use throughout the region, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. The earliest calendars were employed by peoples such as the Zapotecs and [[Olmec]]s, and later by such peoples as the [[Maya civilisation|Maya]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]]. Although the [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerican calendar]] did not originate with the Maya, their subsequent extensions and refinements to it were the most sophisticated. Along with those of the Aztecs, the Maya calendars are the best-documented and most completely understood.\n\nThe distinctive Mayan calendar used two main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the [[Tzolkin]] of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each was linked to an elaborate astrological system to cover every facet of life. On the fifth day after the birth of a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim.<ref name=\"Parkers\"/> A 584-day [[Venus]] cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also 'scorpion', while the name of the constellation Gemini was 'peccary'. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts.<ref>Michael D. Coe, 'The Maya', pp. 227\u201329, Thames and Hudson, London, 2005</ref> The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico.\n\nThe Aztec calendar shares the same basic structure as the Mayan calendar, with two main cycles of 360 days and 260 days. The 260-day calendar was called [[Tonalpohualli]] and was used primarily for divinatory purposes. Like the Mayan calendar, these two cycles formed a 52-year 'century', sometimes called the [[Calendar Round]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Astrology]]\n* [[Astrology and science]]\n* [[Classical planets in Western alchemy]]\n* [[Jewish views on astrology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Wikicite | id = Albiruni-chronology | reference= Al Biruni (11th century), '' The Chronology of Ancient Nations''; tr.

His preferred position is right back, but he can also play on the left as he has done for both club and country on a number of times, as well as defensive midfielder.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early years===\nVangjeli began playing football at the age of just 5 with local side [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] under the guidance of coach Benin Beta. As he lived near the Sk\u00ebnderbeu training ground, he would watch the first team players train which gave him the further ambition to succeed in the game. He stayed at Sk\u00ebnderbeu for 5 years until the age of 10, where he had been playing with his older brother Pavli.<ref name=\"Sporti Shqiptar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportishqiptar.com.al/hasan-lika-me-kerkoi-para-per-te-shpresa/|title=Vangjeli: Si m\u00eb k\u00ebrkuan para, q\u00eb t\u00eb luaja me komb\u00ebtaren Shpresa|date=2011-03-18|accessdate=2011-03-24|publisher=Sporti Shqiptar|author=Andi Matraxhiu|language=Albanian}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 his parents sent his brother Pavli on a 2-month trial with [[PAOK F.C.]], and when the club signed Pavli, his family then moved to [[Thessaloniki]] in [[Greece]] along with Kristi. As his brother was already at the club, his father did not want Kristi to try out for the PAOK team as well.\n\nKristi had to wait for his chance, which was given to him while he was playing football at his school, a coach from a small local team was watching the young Albanian playing from outside the gates. As Kristi did not know Greek well at the time, he did not understand him very well but he understood that he was a football coach and that he would like for Kristi to train with his team, Agios Georgios F.C. After his first training session he joined the club and played for them the very next day. After 2 years at the club, he was promoted to the first team and began to train with them at the age of just 15. As he was tall, fast and lively he was playing as a forward at the time, which was noted in a friendly game by the coach of the [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]] second team. In that friendly Vangjeli scored 2 goals for the 5th tier side and was immediately offered a trial at [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]].<ref name=\"Sporti Shqiptar\"/>\n\nWithout Agios Georgios knowing, Kristi went on trial at Aris at the end of the season, which was a successful one, leading to a 2,000,000 Drachma move to Aris. It was at Aris B that he changed his position from a forward, firstly as a defensive midfielder. At the age of 17 he was promoted to the Aris first team and in his first friendly for the senior team he was played at right fullback by [[Ole Skouboe]] due to injuries, in which he excelled and was offered his first professional contract just one month later.\n\n===Aris===\nVangjeli is a defender who can play at either right back or left back.

His preferred position is right back, but he can also play on the left as he has done for both club and country on a number of times, as well as defensive midfielder.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early years===\nVangjeli began playing football at the age of just 5 with local side [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] under the guidance of coach Benin Beta. As he lived near the Sk\u00ebnderbeu training ground, he would watch the first team players train which gave him the further ambition to succeed in the game. He stayed at Sk\u00ebnderbeu for 5 years until the age of 10, where he had been playing with his older brother Pavli.<ref name=\"Sporti Shqiptar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportishqiptar.com.al/hasan-lika-me-kerkoi-para-per-te-shpresa/|title=Vangjeli: Si m\u00eb k\u00ebrkuan para, q\u00eb t\u00eb luaja me komb\u00ebtaren Shpresa|date=2011-03-18|accessdate=2011-03-24|publisher=Sporti Shqiptar|author=Andi Matraxhiu|language=Albanian}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 his parents sent his brother Pavli on a 2-month trial with [[PAOK F.C.]], and when the club signed Pavli, his family then moved to [[Thessaloniki]] in [[Greece]] along with Kristi. As his brother was already at the club, his father did not want Kristi to try out for the PAOK team as well.\n\nKristi had to wait for his chance, which was given to him while he was playing football at his school, a coach from a small local team was watching the young Albanian playing from outside the gates. As Kristi did not know Greek well at the time, he did not understand him very well but he understood that he was a football coach and that he would like for Kristi to train with his team, Agios Georgios F.C. After his first training session he joined the club and played for them the very next day. After 2 years at the club, he was promoted to the first team and began to train with them at the age of just 15. As he was tall, fast and lively he was playing as a forward at the time, which was noted in a friendly game by the coach of the [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]] second team. In that friendly Vangjeli scored 2 goals for the 5th tier side and was immediately offered a trial at [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]].<ref name=\"Sporti Shqiptar\"/>\n\nWithout Agios Georgios knowing, Kristi went on trial at Aris at the end of the season, which was a successful one, leading to a 2,000,000 Drachma move to Aris. It was at Aris B that he changed his position from a forward, firstly as a defensive midfielder. At the age of 17 he was promoted to the Aris first team and in his first friendly for the senior team he was played at right fullback by [[Ole Skouboe]] due to injuries, in which he excelled and was offered his first professional contract just one month later.\n\n===Aris===\nVangjeli is a defender who can play at either right back or left back. In 2003, Vangjeli signed for the [[Greece|Greek]] side [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris]] and since then made over 100 appearances.\n\n===Chornomorets===\nAfter eight years at Aris, Vangjeli made a \u20ac300,000 move to [[FC Chornomorets Odessa|Chornomorets Odessa]] in the [[Ukrainian Premier League]] on 30 August 2011, signing a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chernomorets.odessa.ua/club/news/5096/|script-title=ru:\u041a\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0412\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043b \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442 \u0441 \"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435\u043c\"|publisher= Official web-site of \"FC Chornomorets Odessa\"|date=30 August 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011|language=Russian}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.albaniasoccer.com/lajme/shqiperi/kombetarja/5245.html|title=Kristi Vangjeli kalon tek Cernomorets|trans-title=Kristi Vangjeli passes to Cernomorets|language=Albanian|publisher=Albania Soccer|date=31 August 2011|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref> On the third round of [[2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League]], Vangjeli's Chornomorets faced his childhood club Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/skenderbeu-kunder-cernomorets-te-bakajt-e-vangjelit-kukesi-sfidon-trabzonsporin/|title=Sk\u00ebnderbeu kund\u00ebr Cernomorets t\u00eb Bakajt dhe Vangjelit, Kuk\u00ebsi sfidon Trabzonsporin|trans-title=Sk\u00ebnderbeu against Bakaj and Vangjeli's Chornomorets, Kuk\u00ebsi challenges Trabzonspor|publisher=Panorama Sport|language=Albanian|date=9 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/ndeshja-skenderbeu-cernomorets-vangjeli-dhe-bakaj-kthehen-si-kundershtare-ne-qemal-stafa/|title=Ndeshja Sk\u00ebnderbeu-\u00c7ernomorets; Vangjeli dhe Bakaj kthehen si kund\u00ebrshtar\u00eb n\u00eb \"Qemal Stafa\"|trans-title=Sk\u00ebnderbeu-Chornomorets match: Vangjeli and Bakaj returns to \"Qemal Stafa\" as opponents|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Panorama Sport|language=Albanian}}</ref> He left the club in January 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/kristi-vangjeli-largohet-nga-cernomorets/|title=Kristi Vangjeli largohet nga \u00c7ernomorets|trans-title=Kristi Vangjeli leaves Chornomorets|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Panorama Sport|language=Albanian}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Aris===\nOn 28 January 2014, Vangjeli signed a contract with [[Superleague Greece]] club [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/kristi-vangjeli-rikthehet-tek-aris-i-selanikut-valmir-berisha-firmos-me-romen/|title=Kristi Vangjeli rikthehet tek Aris i Selanikut, Valmir Berisha firmos 4.5 vjet me Rom\u00ebn|trans-title=Kristi Vangjeli returns to Aris Thessaloniki, Valmir Berisha signs for 4.5 years with Roma|publisher=Panorama Sport|language=Albanian|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb===\n\nOn 30 June 2014, Vangjeli signed with [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]] and returned to his hometown [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] after 15 years absence.<ref name=\"Vangjeli to Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb\">{{cite news|url=http://www.panorama-sport.com/vangjeli-te-skenderbeu-realizova-nje-enderr-nje-dite-do-luaja-ne-korce-shkembi-me-bindi/|title=Vangjeli te Sk\u00ebnderbeu: Realizova \u00ebndrr\u00ebn.

In July 2013, as part of the SoftBank transactions, Sprint acquired the remaining shares of the wireless broadband carrier [[Clearwire Corporation]], which it did not already own.\n\nIn August 2014, CEO [[Dan Hesse]] was replaced by [[Marcelo Claure]].<ref name=\"BLOOMBERGBUSINESSWEEK01262016\">{{cite news|authors=Gruley, Bryan & Moritz, Scott|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-to-fix-sprint/ |title=Inside the Plan to Pull Sprint Out of Its Death Spiral; A Japanese billionaire and a Bolivian telecom vet think they know how to fix the ailing company|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=January 26, 2016}}</ref> In May 2018, [[Michel Combes]] replaced<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/marceloclaure/status/1002184276010553344|title=MarceloClaure |work=Twitter|access-date=May 31, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Claure, and had been working to get Sprint's merger with its rival [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]] through regulatory proceedings.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/02/sprint-appoints-michel-combes-as-ceo.html|title=Sprint names Michel Combes as CEO and Marcelo Claure as executive chairman|last=Aiello|first=Chloe|date=May 2, 2018|work=CNBC|access-date=November 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 2020, [[T-Mobile US]] and Sprint Corporation completed their merger with T-Mobile now being the whole owner of Sprint, making Sprint an effective subsidiary of T-Mobile until the Sprint brand is officially phased out.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October.

Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to get the originally fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for each Sprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mo share. Following the closing of the merger, T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom will hold approximately 43% of New T-Mobile's shares while SoftBank will hold 24% and the remaining 33% will be held by public shareholders. The previous deal saw DT getting 42%, SoftBank getting 27%, and public shareholders getting 31%.

SPG's branded products and services are sold via web and available at retailers nationwide, including [[Best Buy]], [[Walmart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]] and other independent dealers.\n\n==== Boost Mobile ====\n{{Main|Boost Mobile}}\nBoost Worldwide, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sprint that provides nationwide, prepaid wireless voice, messaging and broadband data products and services to customers in the [[contiguous United States]] under the Boost Mobile brand. The services are provided as an MVNO hosted on the Sprint-owned [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EVDO]], [[WiMAX]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and [[LTE Advanced]] networks.\n\n===Sprint Smart Velocity===\nSprint Velocity was Sprint Corporation's Connected Vehicle Platform, announced in 2012 in partnership with Chrysler.\n\n== Wireless wholesale operations and affiliates==\nSprint Corporation provides services using both its own spectrum and network equipment through affiliate agreements. Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.

Later in 1995, the company began to offer wireless service under the Sprint Spectrum brand in the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]]. This was the first commercial PCS network in the United States. Although the current Sprint PCS service is [[CDMA2000|CDMA]], the original Washington-area network used [[GSM]]. Eventually, Sprint launched its new nationwide CDMA network, then in 1999 sold the decommissioned GSM infrastructure to Omnipoint which re-launched in May 2000. Omnipoint was later acquired by VoiceStream Wireless, which eventually became part of [[T-Mobile USA]].\n\n===Partnerships and more consolidation===\nIn September 1996, Sprint announced a deal with [[RadioShack]], and in 1997, Sprint stores opened at RadioShack to offer communications services and products across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/RadioShack-Sprint-Team-Up-Phone-outlets-to-2805441.php|title=RadioShack, Sprint Team Up / Phone outlets to open today inside retailer|last=Marshall|first=Jonathan|date=September 24, 1997|website=SFGate|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Sprint and [[MCI WorldCom]] announced a $129 billion merger agreement between the two companies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/1999/10/05/worldbiz/sprint_mci/|title=MCI buys Sprint for $129B - Oct. 5, 1999|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=April 26, 2019}}</ref> The deal would have been the largest corporate merger in history at the time.

Sprint Nextel was formed on August 13, 2005, when the deal was completed.\n\nSprint and Nextel faced opposition to the merger, mostly from regional affiliates that provided wireless services on behalf of the companies. These regional affiliates felt that the new company would be violating non-compete agreements that the former companies had made with the affiliates.\n\nOn September 1, 2005, Sprint Nextel combined plan offerings of its Sprint and Nextel brands to bring uniformity across the company's offerings.\n\nNextel has licensed its identity to [[NII Holdings, Inc.]], of which Sprint Nextel owned 18%. NII has used the Nextel brand to set up networks in many Latin American countries. Following Sprint's purchase of Nextel, Nextel sold all of its investment in NII Holdings.\n\nThe integration process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried to address this with the advent of [[PowerSource (phone brand)|PowerSource]] phones. These phones routed voice call and data services over Sprint's [[Personal Communications Service|PCS]] spectrum while maintaining DirectConnect services over 800&nbsp;MHz spectrum. However, this was not sufficient in coverage, due to the inability to roam on a non-PCS spectrum. Soon after the merger, top Nextel Executives began leaving the company immediately after the merger closed. Tim Donahue, the Nextel CEO, stayed on as executive chairman, but ceded decision-making authority to [[Gary D. Forsee]]. Tom Kelly, COO of Nextel, took an interim staff position as Chief Strategy Officer. Two years after the merger, only a few key Nextel executives remained, with many former Nextel middle- and upper-level managers having left, citing reasons including the unbridgeable cultural difference between the two companies.\n\nIn 2006, Sprint spun off its local telephone operations, including the former United Telephone companies and [[Centel]], as [[Embarq]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sprint, CWA Reach Deal Over Embarq Spinoff |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113983967845572443 |website=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\nSprint's acquisition of Nextel was a disaster from a fiscal standpoint in 2008, the company [[Write-off|wrote down]] $29.7&nbsp;billion of the $36&nbsp;billion sum it had paid for Nextel in 2005, wiping out 80 percent of the value of Nextel at the time it had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/28/sprint-writes-down-nextel-posts-295-billion-loss/|title=Sprint Writes Down Nextel, Posts $29.5 Billion Loss|last=Malik|first=Om|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Gigaom|page=1|accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref> The write down reflected the depreciation in Nextel's [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] since the date of acquisition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home|title=Sprint Posts $29.5 Billion Loss on Nextel Writedown|last=Harrison|first=Crayton|date=February 28, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105191249/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=awQZDoY8w00M&refer=home}}</ref>\n\n====Affiliate acquisitions and settlements====\nPrior to their merger, Sprint and Nextel were dependent on a network of affiliated companies. Following the announcement of the merger agreement, some of these affiliates came forward with strong opposition to the Sprint-Nextel merger on the grounds that the merged company might violate existing agreements or significantly undercut earnings to these affiliates. In order for Sprint Nextel to allay some of this opposition, they initiated discussions of either acquiring some of these affiliates or renegotiating existing agreements. In several cases, the newly formed company was forced to acquire affiliated companies in exchange for their dropping their opposition to the merger. Forsee said that the company would likely have to acquire all of its remaining affiliates.\n\nIn 2005, Sprint Nextel acquired three of its ten wireless affiliates: US Unwired, acquired in August; Gulf Coast Wireless, acquired in October; and IWO Holdings, acquired in October. Alamosa PCS, which Sprint Nextel acquired on February 2, 2006, was the largest of its affiliate carriers. Other acquired affiliates include Ubiquitel, iPCS, Enterprise, and Northern.

Smaller affiliated companies operate their own network assets and retail operations but offer services to customers in their geographic region under the Sprint brand.\n\nIn the early stages of network build-out, the company relied significantly on network partners known as affiliates to rapidly expand its coverage. These affiliates would lease Sprint's PCS spectrum licenses in a specific geographic area, typically rural areas, and smaller cities, and provide wireless service using the Sprint brand. Sprint provided back-end support such as billing and telephone-based customer service, while the affiliates built and maintained the network, sold equipment to customers, and staffed the retail stores in their specific regions. Its customers could \"roam\" across Sprint-operated and affiliate-operated portions of the network without being aware of the distinction, and vice versa. Outwardly, efforts were made to make it appear as if the network was operated by a single entity under the Sprint name, though complex revenue-sharing agreements were in place which was very similar in nature to cross-carrier roaming tariffs. In later years, the relationship between Sprint and its affiliates grew contentious, particularly after Sprint's acquisition of Nextel. Various affiliates included Swiftel Communications in Brookings, South Dakota;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swiftel.net/|title=Swiftel.net - Quality, reliable & local phone + TV + Internet service is what we do.|publisher=|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Shentel]] in northern Virginia, and parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia.\n\n===Sprint Rural Alliance===\n\nSprint Rural Alliance (SRA) members (aka Sprint Partners) are carriers who use their own equipment and also sell their own service under their own name while using Sprint spectrum. Sprint is given access to the SRA network in return for allowing the use of Sprint spectrum. This allows Sprint to keep the spectrum license for the geographic area being served by the SRA member. Alaska DigiTel in [[Alaska]] is a current SRA Member. Former SRA Members include Alltel Wireless in [[Montana]]; This portion of the network was obtained by [[AT&T]] during the merger of [[Alltel]] and [[Verizon Wireless]], Pioneer Cellular in [[Kansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]; they ended their agreement with Sprint on March 1, 2012, and have since transitioned to an agreement with Verizon Wireless through the LTE in Rural America program, [[nTelos]]; operated in [[West Virginia]] and was bought out and merged with [[Shentel]] which is a Sprint Affiliate.\n\n===Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)===\n\nSprint Corporation provides wholesales capacity on its CDMA2000, EVDO, and LTE wireless networks to [[mobile virtual network operator]]s (MVNOs), which allows other wireless providers to utilize its networks to offer its services. Sprint's prepaid brands also operate using Sprint's networks, however, they are not MVNOs, but rather wholly owned prepaid subsidiaries of the company.\n\n====Bring Your Own Sprint Device====\n\nSprint Corporation allows certain Sprint MVNOs to accept and activate old Sprint-branded phones through its \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" program which was established for Sprint's initiative to further reduce the number of cell phones that are thrown away each year. The program is also beneficial to MVNOs customers who do not want to pay subsidized prices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |title=Sprint Gives MVNOs an Alternative to Phone Subsidies Through \"Bring Your Own Sprint Device\" Program &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522110417/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2525 |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Custom Branded Device Program====\n\nSprint Corporation offers its MVNOs a program called the \"Custom Branded Device Program\", which gives MVNOs access to completely unbranded Android smartphones with no references to Sprint that the MVNO can then customize with its own branded apps and services through Sprint's Mobile ID and Mobile Zone products.

Sprint has an LTE roaming agreement with [[AT&T]] as well, which is typically limited to 3G speeds.  Several cases of Sprint phones simultaneously roaming on Verizon's CDMA network for voice and AT&T's LTE network for data have been observed in 2017.\n\nIn 2018 with the announcement of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger, Sprint gained access to roaming on T-Mobile's LTE network for 4 years.

Sprint later marketed \"push-to-talk\" services under the Nextel Direct Connect name.\n\nIn October 2010, as part of the \"Network Vision\" plan, Sprint CEO Dan Hesse announced the decommissioning of the iDEN network to reduce costs, improve the coverage and performance of the 3G CDMA network and enable Sprint Nextel to focus on [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] technology. Sprint Nextel announced on May 29, 2012, that it will stop marketing iDEN devices in the third quarter of 2012 and that the iDEN network could be completely decommissioned \"as early as June 30, 2013\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2296&ECID=vanity:nextelnetwork |title=Sprint to cease service on its iDEN network as early as June 30, 2013; Company continues to facilitate migration of iDEN customers to Sprint Direct Connect Service &#124; Sprint Newsroom |publisher=Newsroom.sprint.com |accessdate=July 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823015738/http://newsroom.sprint.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=2296&ECID=vanity:nextelnetwork |archive-date=August 23, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As of June 5, 2012, Sprint and Boost Mobile ceased offering iDEN devices, removing the devices and their associated service plans from the Sprint and Boost Mobile websites and retail locations.

However, on May 7, 2008, Sprint Nextel announced it would merge its WiMAX wireless broadband unit with Clearwire Corporation, receiving equity in Clearwire in return.

The groups, Mobile Beacon and Mobile Citizen, said that the network shutdown violates the contract which requires Sprint to provide high-speed internet services for low-income families and public institutions, as most of the equipment was still not LTE-compatible. Sprint pledged to provide upgrades to the equipment and work out a solution with the groups as soon as possible.
