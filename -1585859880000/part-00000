Homes for Frieze magazine. She is also heavily influenced by psychoanalysis and the theories of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]], and other well known psychological theorists.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1 = Blight|first1 = Daniel|title = Black in the Rose Garden:  Sarah Jones at Anton Kern Gallery|url = http://aperture.org/blog/black-rose-garden-sarah-jones-anton-kern-gallery/|website = Aperture|publisher = Aperture|accessdate = December 1, 2015}}</ref> These ideas of psychoanalysis were explored in her series of photos of psychoanalysts couches<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|title = Sarah Jones {{!}} Anton Kern Gallery|url = http://www.antonkerngallery.com/artist/sarah-jones/#/analyst-couch-stephen-grosz-i|website = www.antonkerngallery.com|accessdate = }}</ref> She wanted to explore the spaces that allowed for people to re-live experiences and loosen the grip that their past has on them.<ref name=\":2\" /> Through talking with the head of the British Institute of Psychoanalysis, she learned that patients often acted as if there were a third party in the session, this was interesting to her in the sense of the camera being the third presence. Creating the idea of an audience.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nJones' images are [[Narrative photography|narrative]] in nature, and she is interested in how a narrative is constructed. She also believes that photography leaves a space for the viewer to bring a unique narrative and experience to an image. She develops her narratives using various visual codes that allude to her many different references that she makes throughout her body of work.<ref name=\":2\" /> Some of these codes include her use of reference to art history, and her fetishization of hair.<ref name=\":2\" /> Her photograph \"Horse(profile)(black)(I)\" from 2010 has been referenced to Muybridge\u2019s black horse, and her photographs of roses are said to be compared to Karl Blossfeldt\u2019s botanical studies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer art historical references are apparent in her choice of colors within her photos. She has a strong presence of blue, to indicate the Sublime, or distance in [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painting]].<ref name=\":2\" /> As well as strong notes of red in her photos such as in \"Living Room (Curtain)(I)]\".<ref>http://www.sleek-mag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Sarah-Jones-The-Living-Room-Curtain-i-2003.-150-x-150-cm.jpg</ref> Her Flower series is heavily influenced by the [[Gothic art|gothic era]], pulling inspiration from the aesthetics of that time to create 'Victorian rose gardens' and rich mysterious colors and darkness.\n\nShe is also heavily influenced by the Victorian cultural obsession with photographing hair,<ref name=\":1\" /> and how hair can act as an allegory to location and figure, or in her words hair can represent \"nature gone slightly mad\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Hair reminds her of the roses she photographs, \"visceral, spindly and beautiful, in bloom but slightly diseased\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Exhibitions ==\n\n=== Solo exhibitions ===\n<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|title = Sarah Jones {{!}} Artists {{!}} Maureen Paley|url = http://www.maureenpaley.com/artists/sarah-jones/biography|website = www.maureenpaley.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Exhibitions\n|-\n|2014\n|Maureen Paley, London, UK.\nAnton Kern Gallery, New York, USA\n|-\n<td>2013</td>\n|Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Minneapolis, USA.\n|-\n| href=\"Category:English photographers\" |2008\n| href=\"Category:Alumni of Goldsmiths, University of London\" |Maureen Paley, London, UK.\n|- href=\"Category:Artists from London\"\n| href=\"Category:Living people\" |2007\n| href=\"Category:1959 births\" |Sarah Jones: Photographs, National Media Museum, Bradford, UK.\n|- href=\"Category:Academics of the University of Derby\"\n| href=\"Category:British contemporary artists\" |2006\n| href=\"Category:English contemporary artists\" |Anton Kern Gallery, New York, USA.\n|- href=\"Category:All stub articles\"\n|2002\n|Maureen Paley Interim Art, London, UK.\n\nAnton Kern Gallery, New York, USA.\n|-\n|2000\n|Le Consortium, Dijon, (as part of I Love Dijon), France (C).\n\nHuis Marseille Foundation for Photography, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n|-\n|1999\n|Museum Folkwang Essen, Essen, Germany (C).\n\nAnton Kern Gallery, New York, USA.\n\nCentre for Photography, Universidad de Salamanca, Spain.\n\nMuseum Reina Sofia, Madrid, Spain.\n\nMaureen Paley Interim Art, London, UK.\n\nJerwood Space, London, UK.\n|-\n|1998\n|Galerie Anne de Villepoix, Paris, France.\n\nL\u2019Ecole sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Tours, France.\n\nSites, Sabine Knust Galerie & Edition Maximilian Verlag, Munich, Germany.\n|-\n|1997\n|Le Consortium, Dijon, France.\n\nMaureen Paley Interim Art, London, UK.\n|-\n|1995\n|Consulting Room, Galerie du Dourven, France,\n\n(Office D\u00e9partemental de D\u00e9veloppement Culturel, Mission Arts Plastiques).\n\nConsulting Room (Couch), Camerawork Gallery, London, UK.\n|-\n|1993\n|Hales Gallery, London, UK.\n|-\n|1988\n|Watershed Arts Centre, Bristol, UK.\n|-\n|1987\n|F.Stop Gallery, Bath, UK.\n|}\n\n=== Group exhibitions ===\n<ref name=\":4\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date\n!Exhibitions\n|-\n|2015\n|The Collective, The House of St Barnabas, London, UK\n\nParadis perdu, FRAC \u2013 Nord-Pas de Calais, Dunkerque, France\n\nContemporary Photography from North West Europe.
