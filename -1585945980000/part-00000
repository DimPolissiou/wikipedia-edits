{"title_page": "I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover", "text_new": "\"'''I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover'''\" is a song from 1927, which was written by [[Mort Dixon]] with music by [[Harry M. Woods]]. Original hit recordings were made in 1927 by [[Nick Lucas]] (#2), [[Ben Bernie]] (#3), and [[Jean Goldkette]] (#10). \n\n==History==\nPenned in 1927 by Mort Dixon (lyrics) and Harry M.

Other charting 1948 versions were made by [[Russ Morgan]] (#6), [[Alvino Rey]] (#6), [[The Three Suns]] (#10), The Uptown String Band (#11), and [[Arthur Godfrey]] (#14). \n\nIn modern times the song is perhaps most associated with ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons, as it appeared in several of them, and a common tune played by the string bands in Philadelphia's [[Mummers Parade]].  The [[Sons of Ben (MLS supporters association)|Sons of Ben]], the official supporters' group of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Philadelphia Union]], have adopted the song as one of their chants, singing at every home match at the 20 minute, ten second mark, symbolic as the founding year of the Union.\n\n==Arrangements==\n*In 1948 Columbia records released a recording of the song by [[Tiny Hill]] and the Hilltoppers.\n*The [[UCLA Band]] has played an arrangement of this tune since 1954, and uses the chorus as the second part of '''[[Rover (song)|Rover]]''', the Bruin victory song. Similar lyrics have been used for two other songs.\n** ''My Dead Dog Rover'' by Hank Stu Dave and Hank (Hank Landsberg & Dave Whited) from 1977, which appears on the [[Dr. Demento 25th Anniversary Collection]] - The parody version \"I'm Looking Over my dead dog rover\" was played on [[Dr. Demento]]'s show for a time.<ref>[http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo_view.pl?SYN053344 Dr. Demento database]</ref>\n** ''I\u2019m Lookin\u2019 Over My Dead Dog Rover'' by Kevin Gershon from 1973 and played on [[KMET (FM)|KMET]] FM in Los Angeles\n* In the 1948 [[Warner Brothers]] [[cartoon]] ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]'', directed by [[Chuck Jones]], [[Wile E.

Some sources state 3 1/2 hours, other say it was 24 hours. For 120 minutes Mooney\u2019s record played on while phone calls poured in from pleased listeners who added insult to Collins\u2019 injury by praising him \"for playing something good for a change.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_UDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Jazzbo+Collins+%22I'm+Looking+Over+a+Four-Leaf+Clover%22&source=bl&ots=nonQdM3Xm_&sig=iEnT5BXvXpp9kdAcgBFTmp43tvs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m68PT9HdEsrY2QXBiI3nAg&sqi=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Jazzbo%20Collins%20%22I'm%20Looking%20Over%20a%20Four-Leaf%20Clover%22&f=false Billboard Magazine]</ref><ref>[http://ml.islandnet.com/pipermail/dixielandjazz/2003-October/014122.html Dixieland Jazz]</ref><ref>[http://ml.islandnet.com/pipermail/dixielandjazz/2003-January/007076.html Dixieland Jazz]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PVgpwVCddzYC&pg=PT174&lpg=PT174&dq=Jazzbo+Collins+%22I'm+Looking+Over+a+Four-Leaf+Clover%22&source=bl&ots=LcThfU92YX&sig=Rv73855EvMmvhSMMSZxjPW_oaH8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m68PT9HdEsrY2QXBiI3nAg&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Jazzbo%20Collins%20%22I'm%20Looking%20Over%20a%20Four-Leaf%20Clover%22&f=false \"The music business: career opportunities and self-defense\" by Dick Weissman]</ref>\n* In the 1950 cartoon ''[[Home Tweet Home]]'', [[Tweety]] sings the song while in a birdbath at the opening of the short.\n* In the 1952 cartoon ''Operation Rabbit'', [[Bugs Bunny]] sings \"I'm looking over a three-leaf clover that I overlooked B3.\"\n* In the 1957 cartoon ''[[Ducking the Devil]]'', directed by [[Robert McKimson]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] escapes from a zoo; [[Daffy Duck]], on learning that there's a $5,000 reward for its return (and that the escapee is lulled by music) ends up singing to get him back to his cage.

The [[Sons of Ben (MLS supporters association)|Sons of Ben]], the official supporters' group of [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Philadelphia Union]], have adopted the song as one of their chants, singing at every home match at the 20 minute, ten second mark, symbolic as the founding year of the Union.\n\n==Arrangements==\n*In 1948 Columbia records released a recording of the song by [[Tiny Hill]] and the Hilltoppers.\n*The [[UCLA Band]] has played an arrangement of this tune since 1954, and uses the chorus as the second part of '''[[Rover (song)|Rover]]''', the Bruin victory song. Similar lyrics have been used for two other songs.\n** ''My Dead Dog Rover'' by Hank Stu Dave and Hank (Hank Landsberg & Dave Whited) from 1977, which appears on the [[Dr. Demento 25th Anniversary Collection]] - The parody version \"I'm Looking Over my dead dog rover\" was played on [[Dr. Demento]]'s show for a time.<ref>[http://dmdb.org/cgi-bin/plinfo_view.pl?SYN053344 Dr. Demento database]</ref>\n** ''I\u2019m Lookin\u2019 Over My Dead Dog Rover'' by Kevin Gershon from 1973 and played on [[KMET (FM)|KMET]] FM in Los Angeles\n* In the 1948 [[Warner Brothers]] [[cartoon]] ''[[Fast and Furry-ous]]'', directed by [[Chuck Jones]], [[Wile E. Coyote]] chases [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]] through a [[cloverleaf interchange]] to an up-tempo orchestration of the tune.\n* Also in 1948, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]], a popular Salt Lake City disk jockey, is credited with popularizing Art Mooney's version of the song after he pulled a stunt playing the song over and over for hours on end. Some sources state 3 1/2 hours, other say it was 24 hours. For 120 minutes Mooney\u2019s record played on while phone calls poured in from pleased listeners who added insult to Collins\u2019 injury by praising him \"for playing something good for a change.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=c_UDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Jazzbo+Collins+%22I'm+Looking+Over+a+Four-Leaf+Clover%22&source=bl&ots=nonQdM3Xm_&sig=iEnT5BXvXpp9kdAcgBFTmp43tvs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m68PT9HdEsrY2QXBiI3nAg&sqi=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Jazzbo%20Collins%20%22I'm%20Looking%20Over%20a%20Four-Leaf%20Clover%22&f=false Billboard Magazine]</ref><ref>[http://ml.islandnet.com/pipermail/dixielandjazz/2003-October/014122.html Dixieland Jazz]</ref><ref>[http://ml.islandnet.com/pipermail/dixielandjazz/2003-January/007076.html Dixieland Jazz]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PVgpwVCddzYC&pg=PT174&lpg=PT174&dq=Jazzbo+Collins+%22I'm+Looking+Over+a+Four-Leaf+Clover%22&source=bl&ots=LcThfU92YX&sig=Rv73855EvMmvhSMMSZxjPW_oaH8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m68PT9HdEsrY2QXBiI3nAg&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Jazzbo%20Collins%20%22I'm%20Looking%20Over%20a%20Four-Leaf%20Clover%22&f=false \"The music business: career opportunities and self-defense\" by Dick Weissman]</ref>\n* In the 1950 cartoon ''[[Home Tweet Home]]'', [[Tweety]] sings the song while in a birdbath at the opening of the short.\n* In the 1952 cartoon ''Operation Rabbit'', [[Bugs Bunny]] sings \"I'm looking over a three-leaf clover that I overlooked B3.\"\n* In the 1957 cartoon ''[[Ducking the Devil]]'', directed by [[Robert McKimson]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] escapes from a zoo; [[Daffy Duck]], on learning that there's a $5,000 reward for its return (and that the escapee is lulled by music) ends up singing to get him back to his cage.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules.

[[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.forum.tankix.com/forums/topic/1176-open-beta-testing-still-a-testing-environment/?tab=comments#comment-13280 |title=Open Beta Testing - still a testing environment|date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alternativa Platform announced their plans to release Tanki X on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-go-live-steam-early-access-april-20tjh|title=Tanki X To Go Live On Steam Early Access On April 20th - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-13|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> As promised, Tanki X was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/607200/Tanki_X/|title=Tanki X on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tanki X left the Open Beta Testing stage and was officially released with the Arms Race update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-officially-released/ |title=Tanki X has been officially released! |last= |first= |date=13 March 2018 |website=tankix.com |publisher=Tanki Online Europe Ltd. |access-date=14 March 2018 |quote=Today, '''March 13th, 2018''', becomes the official release date of Tanki X.

It was created on the Unity engine by [[AlternativaPlatform]], a Russia-based game developing company. The game uses the [[free-to-play]] business model, where players can download and play the game for free. However, players can also pay real world money in the form of [[Micro-transactions|micro transactions]] to get \"X Crystals\". These X Crystals unlock special cosmetic features for tanks and blueprint containers which can unlock and upgrade modules. The open beta testing started on September 15, 2016<ref name=\"Tanki X (2)\">{{cite web|title=Tanki X \u2014 New project by creators of Tanki Online, AlternativaPlatform|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/257314/Tanki_X_mdash_New_project_by_creators_of_Tanki_OnlineAlternativaPlatform.php|publisher=gamasutra.com|date=October 26, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref> and the full game was released on Steam on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-launches-steam-early-access|title=Tanki X Launches On Steam Early Access - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-20|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> The game was shut down in early 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-is-discontinued-in-the-end-of-2019/|title=Tanki X is discontinued in the end of 2019|date=2019-09-03|website=Tanki X - free-to-play online game|access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers control their own tank, created from a variety of turret and hull combinations, and compete against each other in a variety of maps and game modes. At the moment, Tanki X features three game modes: [[Deathmatch]], [[Team deathmatch|Team Deathmatch]], and [[Capture the Flag]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://help.tankix.com/en/tanki-x/articles/basics/Battles|title=Knowledge Base \u2014 Tanki X \u2014 Battle modes|website=help.tankix.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}</ref> Players can create their own tank combination from a selection of different turrets and hulls, all unique in their strengths and weaknesses.    [[File:Tanki X Area159.jpg|thumb|Capture the Flag on Tanki X map \"Area 159\".]]\n\n=== In-game Currency and Ranking System ===\nFor every tank destroyed or flag captured, players build up a number of XP (rank experience points) which they are rewarded, and container points. The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in. The game also reduces each player's RP by a certain amount, depending on where they are at.\n\n==Reception==\n\nOn September 15, 2016, Tanki X began its Open Beta test.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.forum.tankix.com/forums/topic/1176-open-beta-testing-still-a-testing-environment/?tab=comments#comment-13280 |title=Open Beta Testing - still a testing environment|date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, Alternativa Platform announced their plans to release Tanki X on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mmos.com/news/tanki-x-go-live-steam-early-access-april-20tjh|title=Tanki X To Go Live On Steam Early Access On April 20th - MMOs.com|date=2017-04-13|work=MMOs.com|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en-US}}</ref> As promised, Tanki X was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on April 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/607200/Tanki_X/|title=Tanki X on Steam|website=store.steampowered.com|language=en|accessdate=2017-05-20}}</ref>\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Tanki X left the Open Beta Testing stage and was officially released with the Arms Race update.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tankix.com/en/news/tanki-x-officially-released/ |title=Tanki X has been officially released! |last= |first= |date=13 March 2018 |website=tankix.com |publisher=Tanki Online Europe Ltd. |access-date=14 March 2018 |quote=Today, '''March 13th, 2018''', becomes the official release date of Tanki X.
