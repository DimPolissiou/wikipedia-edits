{"title_page": "Machine-readable passport", "text_new": "[[Image:mrp image.gif|thumb|Page of a passport with machine-readable\n zone in the red oval]]\nA '''machine-readable passport''' ('''MRP''') is a [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] travel document (MRTD) with the data on the identity page encoded in [[optical character recognition]] format. Many countries began to issue machine-readable travel documents in the 1980s.\n\nMost travel [[passports]] worldwide are MRPs. They are standardized by the ''[[ICAO]] Document 9303'' (endorsed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] as ISO/IEC 7501-1) and have a special ''machine-readable zone'' (''MRZ''), which is usually at the bottom of the identity page at the beginning of a passport. The ''ICAO Document 9303'' describes three types of documents. Usually passport booklets are issued in  \"Type 3\" format, while identity cards and passport cards typically use the \"Type 1\" format.\nThe ''machine-readable zone'' of a Type 3 travel document spans two lines, and each line is 44 characters long. The following information must be provided in the zone: name, passport number, nationality, date of birth, sex, and passport expiration date. There is room for optional, often country-dependent, supplementary information.\nThe ''machine-readable zone'' of a Type 1 travel document spans three lines, and each line is 30 characters long.\n\nComputers with a camera and suitable software can directly read the information on machine-readable passports. This enables faster processing of arriving passengers by immigration officials, and greater accuracy than manually read passports, as well as faster data entry, more data to be read and better data matching against immigration databases and watchlists.\n\nApart from optically readable information, many passports contain an [[RFID]] chip which enables computers to read a higher amount of information, for example a photo of the bearer. These passports are called [[biometric passport]]s.\n\n==Format==\n\n===Passport booklets===\n\nPassport booklets have an identity page containing the identity data. This page is in the TD3 size of 125 \u00d7 88&nbsp;mm (4.92 \u00d7 3.46&nbsp;in).\n\nThe data of the machine-readable zone consists of two rows of 44 characters each. The only characters used are A\u2013Z, 0\u20139 and the filler character &lt;.\n\nThe format of the first row is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Positions !! Length !! Characters !! Meaning\n|-\n| 1 || 1 || alpha || P, indicating a passport\n|-\n| 2 || 1 || alpha+&lt; || Type (for countries that distinguish between different types of passports)\n|-\n| 3\u20135 || 3 || alpha+&lt; || Issuing country or organization ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] code with modifications)\n|-\n| 6\u201344 || 39 || alpha+&lt; || Surname, followed by two filler characters, followed by given names. Given names are separated by single filler characters\n|}\nIn the name field, spaces, hyphens and other punctuation are represented by &lt;, except [[apostrophe]]s, which are skipped. If the names are too long, names are abbreviated to their most significant parts. In that case, the last position must contain an alphabetic character to indicate possible truncation, and if there is a given name, the two fillers and at least one character of it must be included.\n\nThe format of the second row is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Positions !! Length !! Characters !! Meaning\n|-\n| 1\u20139 || 9 || alpha+num+&lt; || Passport number\n|-\n| 10 || 1 || numeric || Check digit over digits 1\u20139\n|-\n| 11\u201313 || 3 || alpha+&lt; || Nationality (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code with modifications)\n|-\n| 14\u201319 || 6 || numeric || Date of birth (YYMMDD)\n|-\n| 20 || 1 || numeric || Check digit over digits 14\u201319\n|-\n| 21 || 1 || alpha+&lt; || Sex (M, F or &lt; for male, female or unspecified)\n|-\n| 22\u201327 || 6 || numeric || Expiration date of passport (YYMMDD)\n|-\n| 28 || 1 || numeric || Check digit over digits 22\u201327\n|-\n| 29\u201342 || 14 || alpha+num+&lt; || Personal number (may be used by the issuing country as it desires)\n|-\n| 43 || 1 || numeric+&lt; || Check digit over digits 29\u201342 (may be &lt; if all characters are &lt;)\n|-\n| 44 || 1 || numeric || Check digit over digits 1\u201310, 14\u201320, and 22\u201343\n|}\n\nThe check digit calculation is as follows: each position is assigned a value; for the digits 0 to 9 this is the value of the digits, for the letters A to Z this is 10 to 35, for the filler &lt; this is 0. The value of each position is then multiplied by its weight; the weight of the first position is 7, of the second it is 3, and of the third it is 1, and after that the weights repeat 7, 3, 1, and so on. All values are added together and the remainder of the final value divided by 10 is the check digit.\n\nSome values that are different from ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 are used for the issuing country and nationality field:<ref>[http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p3_cons_en.pdf Doc9303 Machine Readable Travel Documents Part3 Seventh Edition, 2015]</ref>\n* D: [[Germany]]\n* EUE: [[European Union]]\n* GBD: [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]] (BOTC) (note: the country code of the overseas territory is used to indicate issuing authority and nationality of BOTC), formerly British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC)\n* GBN: [[British National (Overseas)]]\n* GBO: [[British Overseas Citizen]]\n* GBP: [[British Protected Person]]\n* GBS: [[British Subject]]\n* UNA: [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency of the United Nations]]\n* UNK: Resident of [[Kosovo]] to whom a [[UNMIK Travel Document|travel document]] has been issued by the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK)\n* UNO: [[United Nations]] organization\n* XBA: [[African Development Bank]]\n* XIM: [[African Export\u2013Import Bank]]\n* XCC: [[Caribbean Community]] or one of its emissaries\n* XCO: [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]]\n* XEC: [[Economic Community of West African States]]\n* XPO: [[International Criminal Police Organization]]\n* XOM: [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]\n* XXA: [[Stateless person]], as per the 1954 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]] \n* XXB: [[Refugee]], as per the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]\n* XXC: Refugee, other than defined above\n* XXX: Unspecified nationality\n\nOther values, which do not have broad acceptance internationally, include:\n* RKS: [[Kosovo]]\n* WSA: [[World Service Authority]] [[World Passport]]\n\n=== Official travel documents ===\nSmaller documents such as identity and passport cards are usually in the TD1 size, which is 85.6 \u00d7 54.0&nbsp;mm (3.37 \u00d7 2.13 in), the same size as credit cards.\nThe data of the machine-readable zone in a TD1 size card consists of three rows of 30 characters each. The only characters used are A\u2013Z, 0\u20139 and the filler character &lt;.\n\nSome official travel documents are in the larger TD2 size, 105.0 \u00d7 74.0 (4.13 \u00d7 2.91 in). They have a layout of the MRZ with two rows of 36 characters each, similar to the TD3 format, but with 31 characters for the name, 7 for the personal number and one less check digit. Yet some official travel documents are in the booklet format with a TD3 identity page.\n\nThe format of the first row for TD1 (credit card size) documents is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Positions !!

This is in order to allow use of a single machine reader.\n\nOnly characters A to Z (upper case), 0\u20139, and &lt; ([[angle bracket]]) are allowed.\n\n===Nationality codes and checksum calculation===\nThe nationality codes shall contain the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] code with modifications for all formats, as described in the passport booklets chapter. The check digit calculation method is also the same for all formats.\n\n===Names===\nDue to technical limits, characters inside the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) need to be restricted to the 10 Arabic numerals, the 26 capital Latin letters A through Z, and the filler character <.\n\n[[Apostrophe]]s and similar punctuation marks have to be omitted, but [[hyphen]]s and spaces should be replaced by an opening angle bracket.\n[[Diacritical mark]]s are not permitted in the MRZ. Even though they may be useful to distinguish names, the use of diacritical marks in the MRZ could confuse machine-reading equipment.\n\nSection 6 of the 9303 part 3 document specifies transliteration of letters outside the A\u2013Z range. It recommends that diacritical marks on [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters A-Z are simply omitted (\u00e7 \u2192 '''C''', \u00f0 \u2192 '''D''', \u00ea \u2192 '''E''', \u00f1 \u2192 '''N''' etc.), but it allows the following transliterations:<br />\n\u00e5 \u2192 '''AA'''<br />\n\u00e4 \u2192 '''AE'''<br />\n\u00f0 \u2192 '''DH'''<br />\n{{IPA |ij}} (Dutch letter; capital form: {{IPA |IJ}}, the J as part of the ligature being capitalized, too)\u2192 '''IJ'''<br />\n\u00f6 \u2192 '''OE'''<br />\n\u00fc \u2192 '''UE''' (German) or '''UXX''' (Spanish)<br />\n\u00f1 \u2192 '''NXX'''<br />\nThe following transliterations are mandatory:<br />\n\u00e6 \u2192 '''AE'''<br />\n\u00f8, \u0153 \u2192 '''OE'''<br />\n\u00df \u2192 '''SS'''<br />\n\u00fe \u2192 '''TH'''\n\nIn Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Scandinavia it is standard to use the \u00c5\u2192AA, \u00c4 or \u00c6\u2192AE, \u00d6 or \u00d8\u2192OE, \u00dc\u2192UE, and \u00df\u2192SS mappings, so [[M\u00fcller (surname)|M'''\u00fc'''ller'']] becomes M'''UE'''LLER, G'''\u00f6\u00df'''mann becomes G'''OESS'''MANN, and [[H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen|H'''\u00e4'''m'''\u00e4'''l'''\u00e4'''inen]] becomes H'''AE'''M'''AE'''L'''AE'''INEN. \u00f0, \u00f1 and \u00fc occur in Iceland and Spain, but they write them as D, N and U.<!-- There are images of such passports in [[Icelandic passport]] and [[Spanish passport]]-->\n\nAustrian passports may (but do not always) contain a trilingual (in German, English, and French) explanation of the German umlauts and \u00df, e.g. \n'\u00df' entspricht / is equal to / correspond \u00e0 'SS'.\n\nThere are also tables for the transliteration of names written using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] scripts, mainly based on transliteration rules into English.\nFor example, the Russian surname \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 (\"Gorba'''tschow'''\" in German,\"Gorba'''tchov'''\" in French, \"Gorba'''chov'''\" in Spanish, \"Gorba'''czow'''\" in Polish) is transcribed \"Gorba'''chev'''\" in both English and according to the ICAO 9303 rules.\n\nPeople having names using the listed letters sometimes have trouble with ignorant officials; for example, the document is thought to be a forgery or with airline tickets not having the same spelling as the passport.\n\nRussian visas (and Russian internal passports since 2011) have a different transliteration into the machine-readable zone. As an example, the letter \"\u0447\" is usually transcribed as \"ch\" in Russian travel documents, however, Russian visas and internal passports use \"3\" in the machine-readable zone instead. Another example is \"Alexei\" (travel passport) => \"\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439\" (Cyrillic version) => \"ALEKSEQ\" (machine readable version in an internal document). This makes it easier to transliterate the name back to Cyrillic.\n\n===First and given names===\nFor airline tickets, visas and more, the advice is to only use the first name written in the passport. This is a problem for people who use their second name (as defined by the order in the passport) as their main name in daily speech. It is common, for example in Scandinavia, that the second or even third name is the one defined for daily usage. For example, the actor [[Hugh Laurie]], whose full name is James Hugh Calum Laurie. Swedish travel agents usually book people using the first and daily name if the first one is not their main name, despite advice to use only the first name.

Many countries began to issue machine-readable travel documents in the 1980s. \n\nMost travel [[passports]] worldwide are MRPs. They are standardized by the ''[[ICAO]] Document 9303'' (endorsed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] as ISO/IEC 7501-1) and have a special ''machine-readable zone'' (''MRZ''), which is usually at the bottom of the identity page at the beginning of a passport. The ''ICAO Document 9303'' describes three types of documents. Usually passport booklets are issued in  \"Type 3\" format, while identity cards and passport cards typically use the \"Type 1\" format.\nThe ''machine-readable zone'' of a Type 3 travel document spans two lines, and each line is 44 characters long. The following information must be provided in the zone: name, passport number, nationality, date of birth, sex, and passport expiration date. There is room for optional, often country-dependent, supplementary information.\nThe ''machine-readable zone'' of a Type 1 travel document spans three lines, and each line is 30 characters long. \n\nComputers with a camera and suitable software can directly read the information on machine-readable passports. This enables faster processing of arriving passengers by immigration officials, and greater accuracy than manually read passports, as well as faster data entry, more data to be read and better data matching against immigration databases and watchlists.\n\nApart from optically readable information, many passports contain an [[RFID]] chip which enables computers to read a higher amount of information, for example a photo of the bearer. These passports are called [[biometric passport]]s.\n\n==Format==\n\n===Passport booklets===\n\n\nPassport booklets have an identity page containing the identity data. This page is in the TD3 size of 125 \u00d7 88&nbsp;mm (4.92 \u00d7 3.46&nbsp;in).\n\nThe data of the machine-readable zone consists of two rows of 44 characters each. The only characters used are A\u2013Z, 0\u20139 and the filler character &lt;.\n\nThe format of the first row is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Positions !! Length !! Characters !! Meaning\n|-\n| 1 || 1 || alpha || P, indicating a passport\n|-\n| 2 || 1 || alpha+&lt; || Type (for countries that distinguish between different types of passports)\n|-\n| 3\u20135 || 3 || alpha+&lt; || Issuing country or organization ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] code with modifications)\n|-\n| 6\u201344 || 39 || alpha+&lt; || Surname, followed by two filler characters, followed by given names. Given names are separated by single filler characters\n|}\nIn the name field, spaces, hyphens and other punctuation are represented by &lt;, except [[apostrophe]]s, which are skipped. If the names are too long, names are abbreviated to their most significant parts. In that case, the last position must contain an alphabetic character to indicate possible truncation, and if there is a given name, the two fillers and at least one character of it must be included.\n\nThe format of the second row is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The value of each position is then multiplied by its weight; the weight of the first position is 7, of the second it is 3, and of the third it is 1, and after that the weights repeat 7, 3, 1, and so on. All values are added together and the remainder of the final value divided by 10 is the check digit.\n\nSome values that are different from ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 are used for the issuing country and nationality field:<ref>[http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p3_cons_en.pdf Doc9303 Machine Readable Travel Documents Part3 Seventh Edition, 2015]</ref>\n* D: [[Germany]]\n* EUE: [[European Union]]\n* GBD: [[British Overseas Territories Citizen]] (BOTC) (note: the country code of the overseas territory is used to indicate issuing authority and nationality of BOTC), formerly British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC)\n* GBN: [[British National (Overseas)]]\n* GBO: [[British Overseas Citizen]]\n* GBP: [[British Protected Person]]\n* GBS: [[British Subject]]\n* UNA: [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|specialized agency of the United Nations]]\n* UNK: Resident of [[Kosovo]] to whom a [[UNMIK Travel Document|travel document]] has been issued by the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo]] (UNMIK)\n* UNO: [[United Nations]] organization\n* XBA: [[African Development Bank]]\n* XIM: [[African Export\u2013Import Bank]]\n* XCC: [[Caribbean Community]] or one of its emissaries\n* XCO: [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]]\n* XEC: [[Economic Community of West African States]]\n* XPO: [[International Criminal Police Organization]]\n* XOM: [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]\n* XXA: [[Stateless person]], as per the 1954 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]] \n* XXB: [[Refugee]], as per the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]]\n* XXC: Refugee, other than defined above\n* XXX: Unspecified nationality\n\nOther values, which do not have broad acceptance internationally, include:\n* RKS: [[Kosovo]]\n* WSA: [[World Service Authority]] [[World Passport]]\n\n=== Official travel documents ===\nSmaller documents such as identity and passport cards are usually in the TD1 size, which is 85.6 \u00d7 54.0 mm (3.37 \u00d7 2.13 in), the same size as credit cards.\nThe data of the machine-readable zone in a TD1 size card consists of three rows of 30 characters each. The only characters used are A\u2013Z, 0\u20139 and the filler character &lt;.\n\nSome official travel documents are in the larger TD2 size, 105.0 \u00d7 74.0 (4.13 \u00d7 2.91 in). They have a layout of the MRZ with two rows of 36 characters each, similar to the TD3 format, but with 31 characters for the name, 7 for the personal number and one less check digit.

This is in order to allow use of a single machine reader.\n\nOnly characters A to Z (upper case), 0\u20139, and &lt; ([[angle bracket]]) are allowed.\n\n===Nationality codes and checksum calculation===\nThe nationality codes shall contain the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-3]] code with modifications for all formats, as described in the passport booklets chapter. The check digit calculation method is also the same for all formats.\n\n===Names===\nDue to technical limits, characters inside the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) need to be restricted to the 10 Arabic numerals, the 26 capital Latin letters A through Z, and the filler character <.\n\n[[Apostrophe]]s and similar punctuation marks have to be omitted, but [[hyphen]]s and spaces should be replaced by an opening angle bracket.\n[[Diacritical mark]]s are not permitted in the MRZ. Even though they may be useful to distinguish names, the use of diacritical marks in the MRZ could confuse machine-reading equipment.\n\nSection 6 of the 9303 part 3 document specifies transliteration of letters outside the A\u2013Z range. It recommends that diacritical marks on [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] letters A-Z are simply omitted (\u00e7 \u2192 '''C''', \u00f0 \u2192 '''D''', \u00ea \u2192 '''E''', \u00f1 \u2192 '''N''' etc.), but it allows the following transliterations:<br />\n\u00e5 \u2192 '''AA'''<br />\n\u00e4 \u2192 '''AE'''<br />\n\u00f0 \u2192 '''DH'''<br />\n{{IPA |ij}} (Dutch letter; capital form: {{IPA |IJ}}, the J as part of the ligature being capitalized, too)\u2192 '''IJ'''<br />\n\u00f6 \u2192 '''OE'''<br />\n\u00fc \u2192 '''UE''' (German) or '''UXX''' (Spanish)<br />\n\u00f1 \u2192 '''NXX'''<br />\nThe following transliterations are mandatory:<br />\n\u00e6 \u2192 '''AE'''<br />\n\u00f8, \u0153 \u2192 '''OE'''<br />\n\u00df \u2192 '''SS'''<br />\n\u00fe \u2192 '''TH'''<br />\n\nIn Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Scandinavia it is standard to use the \u00c5\u2192AA, \u00c4 or \u00c6\u2192AE, \u00d6 or \u00d8\u2192OE, \u00dc\u2192UE, and \u00df\u2192SS mappings, so [[M\u00fcller (surname)|M'''\u00fc'''ller'']] becomes M'''UE'''LLER, G'''\u00f6\u00df'''mann becomes G'''OESS'''MANN, and [[H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen|H'''\u00e4'''m'''\u00e4'''l'''\u00e4'''inen]] becomes H'''AE'''M'''AE'''L'''AE'''INEN. \u00f0, \u00f1 and \u00fc occur in Iceland and Spain, but they write them as D, N and U.<!-- There are images of such passports in [[Icelandic passport]] and [[Spanish passport]]-->\n\nAustrian passports may (but do not always) contain a trilingual (in German, English, and French) explanation of the German umlauts and \u00df, e.g. \n'\u00df' entspricht / is equal to / correspond \u00e0 'SS'.\n\nThere are also tables for the transliteration of names written using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] scripts, mainly based on transliteration rules into English.\nFor example, the Russian surname \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 (\"Gorba'''tschow'''\" in German,\"Gorba'''tchov'''\" in French, \"Gorba'''chov'''\" in Spanish, \"Gorba'''czow'''\" in Polish) is transcribed \"Gorba'''chev'''\" in both English and according to the ICAO 9303 rules.\n\nPeople having names using the listed letters sometimes have trouble with ignorant officials; for example, the document is thought to be a forgery or with airline tickets not having the same spelling as the passport.\n\nRussian visas (and Russian internal passports since 2011) have a different transliteration into the machine-readable zone. As an example, the letter \"\u0447\" is usually transcribed as \"ch\" in Russian travel documents, however, Russian visas and internal passports use \"3\" in the machine-readable zone instead. Another example is \"Alexei\" (travel passport) => \"\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439\" (Cyrillic version) => \"ALEKSEQ\" (machine readable version in an internal document). This makes it easier to transliterate the name back to Cyrillic.\n\n===First and given names===\nFor airline tickets, visas and more, the advice is to only use the first name written in the passport. This is a problem for people who use their second name (as defined by the order in the passport) as their main name in daily speech. It is common, for example in Scandinavia, that the second or even third name is the one defined for daily usage. For example the actor [[Hugh Laurie]], whose full name is James Hugh Calum Laurie. Swedish travel agents usually book people using the first and daily name if the first one is not their main name, despite advice to use only the first name. If this is too long, the spelling in the MRZ could be used.\n\nFor people using a variant of their first name in daily speech, for example the former US president [[Bill Clinton]] whose full name is William Jefferson Clinton, the advice is to spell their name as in the passport.\n\nIn Scandinavian legislation, middle name is a name placed between given and surname, and is usually a family name. Such names are written as extra surname in the passports. People have been stranded at airports since they entered this extra family name in the \"middle name\" field in airline booking form, which in English speaking tradition is a given name.\n\n[[Chinese name|Chinese]], [[Japanese name|Japanese]] and [[Korean name]]s might pose a challenge too, since the family name is normally written first. Tickets should use given name and surname as indicated in passports.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Basic Access Control]]\n*[[Biometric passport]]\n*[[Card standards]]\n*[[ISO/IEC 14443]] ([[Proximity card]] standard)\n*[[List of national identity card policies by country]]\n*[[Identity document]] \n*[[Identity Cards Act 2006]] [[United Kingdom]]\n*[[Universal Electronic Card]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.highprogrammer.com/alan/numbers/mrp.html A description of the Machine Readable Passport Zone]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070126030848/http://mrtd.icao.int/ MRTD - Machine Readable Travel Document - Home (ICAO)]\n*[http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/publication.aspx?docnum=9303 ICAO Standards for e-Passports: Machine Readable Travel Documents]\n{{Passports}}\n{{Identity cards}}\n[[Category:Passports]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: For example \u2192 For example,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_passport"}
