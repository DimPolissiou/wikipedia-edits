Italy borders it on the east with the [[Metropolitan City of Turin]] and the [[province of Cuneo]], region of [[Piedmont]].\n\nHautes-Alpes is located in the [[Alps]] mountain range. The average elevation is over 1000 m, and the highest elevation is over 4000 m. The only three sizable towns are [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], [[Brian\u00e7on]], and [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], which was the subprefecture until 1926.\n\nThe third highest [[Communes of France|commune]] in all of Europe is the village of [[Saint-V\u00e9ran]].

The [[Durance]] has been dammed to create one of the largest artificial lakes in Western Europe: the [[Lac de Serre-Pon\u00e7on]]. The [[Queyras]] valley is located in the eastern part of the department and is noted by many as being an area of outstanding beauty.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe inhabitants of the department are called ''Haut-Alpins'' and ''Haut-Alpines'' in French.\n\nThe extremely mountainous terrain explains the sparse population, which was originally about 120,000. It changed little during the 19th century, but fell to about 85,000 after World War I. Thanks in large part to tourism, the population has risen from 87,436 in 1962 to 121,419 in 1999, principally in the town of Gap.\n\nPopulation development since 1791:{{historical populations|13=1791|14=120,485|15=1801|16=112,500|17=1851|18=132,038|19=1901|20=109,510|21=1911|22=105,083|23=1921|24=89,275|25=1931|26=87,566|27=1946|28=84,932|29=1954|30=85,067|31=1962|32=87,436|33=1968|34=91,790|35=1975|36=97,358|37=1982|38=105,070|39=1990|40=113,300|41=1999|42=121,631|43=2006|44=130,752|align=middle|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://splaf.free.fr/ Site sur la Population et les Limites Administratives de la France]</ref>|45=2011|46=138,605|47=2016|48=141,107}}\n\n\n==Politics==\n===Departmental Council of Hautes-Alpes===\nThe President of the Departmental Council of Hautes-Alpes has been Jean-Marie Bertrand of [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] since the [[2015 French departmental elections|2015 departmental elections]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\"\n!colspan=2| Party || Seats\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Union for a Popular Movement/meta/color}}\" |<span style=\"color:white; font-size:190%;\">\u2022</span>\n|[[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] and [[Union of Democrats and Independents]] ||align=\"right\"| 22\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Socialist Party (France)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Party of the Left]] ||align=\"right\"| 8\n|-\n|}\n\n===Members of the National Assembly===\nHautes-Alpes elected the following members of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] during the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Constituency!!Member<ref>http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{En Marche!/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[Hautes-Alpes's 1st constituency]]\n| [[Pascale Boyer]]\n| [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{En Marche!/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[Hautes-Alpes's 2nd constituency]]\n| [[Jo\u00ebl Giraud]]\n| [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]\n|}\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe tourist industry is largely dependent on skiing in winter. In summer the Alpine scenery and many outdoor activities attract visitors from across Europe (sailing, hiking, [[climbing]] and aerial sports such as [[gliding]]). The [[Tour de France]] passes through the department regularly.

Thanks in large part to tourism, the population has risen from 87,436 in 1962 to 121,419 in 1999, principally in the town of Gap.\n\nPopulation development since 1791:{{historical populations|13=1791|14=120,485|15=1801|16=112,500|17=1851|18=132,038|19=1901|20=109,510|21=1911|22=105,083|23=1921|24=89,275|25=1931|26=87,566|27=1946|28=84,932|29=1954|30=85,067|31=1962|32=87,436|33=1968|34=91,790|35=1975|36=97,358|37=1982|38=105,070|39=1990|40=113,300|41=1999|42=121,631|43=2006|44=130,752|align=middle|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://splaf.free.fr/ Site sur la Population et les Limites Administratives de la France]</ref>|45=2011|46=138,605|47=2016|48=141,107}}\n\n\n==Politics==\n===Departmental Council of Hautes-Alpes===\nThe President of the Departmental Council of Hautes-Alpes has been Jean-Marie Bertrand of the [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] since the [[2015 French departmental elections|2015 departmental elections]].\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\"\n!colspan=2| Party || Seats\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Union for a Popular Movement/meta/color}}\" |<span style=\"color:white; font-size:190%;\">\u2022</span>\n|[[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] and [[Union of Democrats and Independents]] ||align=\"right\"| 22\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: {{Socialist Party (France)/meta/color}}\" |\n|[[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and [[Radical Party of the Left]] ||align=\"right\"| 8\n|-\n|}\n\n===Members of the National Assembly===\nHautes-Alpes elected the following members of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] during the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Constituency!!Member<ref>http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{En Marche!/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[Hautes-Alpes's 1st constituency]]\n| [[Pascale Boyer]]\n| [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{En Marche!/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[Hautes-Alpes's 2nd constituency]]\n| [[Jo\u00ebl Giraud]]\n| [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]\n|}\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe tourist industry is largely dependent on skiing in winter. In summer the Alpine scenery and many outdoor activities attract visitors from across Europe (sailing, hiking, [[climbing]] and aerial sports such as [[gliding]]). The [[Tour de France]] passes through the department regularly. This draws many cycling fanatics to cycle the cols and watch the race.\n<gallery>\nFile:Coll\u00e9giale Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Nicolas de Brian\u00e7on.jpg|[[Brian\u00e7on]]\nFile:Embrun - Couvent des Cordeliers -829.jpg|[[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]]\nFile:Vue en montant \u00e0 Vallonpierre.jpg|[[Massif des \u00c9crins]]\nFile:La Grave 2.jpg|[[La Grave]]\nFile:Emparis- massif de la Meije depuis le lac Noir.jpg|[[La Meije]]\nFile:Echaugette de Mont Dauphin - panoramio.jpg|The Alps and the [[Guil]] valley seen from Fort [[Mont-Dauphin]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cantons of the Hautes-Alpes department]]\n*[[Communes of the Hautes-Alpes department]]\n*[[Arrondissements of the Hautes-Alpes department]]\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- please keep this link: Dmoz page holds a Wikipedia back link -->\n{{ODP|Regional/Europe/France/Regions/Provence-Alpes-Cote_d%27Azur/Hautes-Alpes/|Hautes-Alpes}}\n\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.hautes-alpes.net/ Official Website]\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.hautes-alpes.pref.gouv.fr/ Prefecture website]\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.cg05.fr/ General Council webstite] \n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.montdauphin-vauban.fr/ A village in the French Alps built by Vauban]\n\n{{Departments of France}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Hautes-Alpes| ]]\n[[Category:1790 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:Departments of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1790]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hautes-Alpes"}
