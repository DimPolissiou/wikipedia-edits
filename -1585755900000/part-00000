Leigh called Eileen and told them that her 15-years younger sister, [[Suzy Parker]], was making only $25 per hour working as a model for [[Huntington Hartford]].<ref name=\"everything\"/> Leigh felt Suzy, although only 16 years old, should be making $40 per hour, and told Ford she would join her two-year-old agency only if they took Parker sight-unseen.

Soon thereafter, Parker would become the most successful model of the 1950s, helping push the Ford's agency to number one. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Fords represented top models [[Mary Jane Russell]], [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]], and [[Dovima]]. By 1954, the Fords were extremely successful and were living in a duplex apartment on [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]].

That's why I'm so docile now.\" By the late 1950s, Eileen had given birth to four children: Jamie, Billy, Katie, and Lacey.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nIn 1957, Leigh, aged 40 and retired from modeling, was living in France. She decided to start another modeling agency, this time in France. The police and courts insisted she was running an illegal employment agency, and she was fined. After World War II, employment agencies were declared illegal.<ref name=\"model\"/> Leigh contacted the Fords about starting a legitimate modeling agency, the first of its kind in that country. She continued to run a successful agency, but in 1959 was charged in court again. After hiring a lawyer, she finally won her case. The Fords agreed to expand their modeling business into Europe, and Leigh would represent them in France as well as scout for potential models all over Europe. Leigh was so successful that she opened branches in London and Hamburg, Germany. She would trade her European models for Ford's American models and vice versa.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ford represented then-model [[Martha Stewart]], who like Eileen, went to [[Barnard College]]. Stewart modeled briefly in her late teens and early 20s, including for [[Chanel]]. In the 1970s, Stewart catered parties and weddings with Dorian Leigh, who became a cordon bleu level chef after retiring from the fashion industry. On the twentieth anniversary of the Ford Agency in 1966, Jerry Ford told ''The New York Times'' that they were billing $100,000 per week and that they were the first modeling agency to have a computer system. They had 175 female and 75 male models that booked 70% of modeling jobs in New York City and 30% worldwide.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nTheir top models in the 1960s included [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] (who would go on to run a successful modeling agency of her own in the 1970s, until her death from lung cancer due to heavy smoking in 1980, at age 40), [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Ann Turkel]], [[Agneta Frieberg]], [[Ali MacGraw]], [[Candice Bergen]], Tilly Tizani, [[Sondra Peterson]], and [[Donna Michelle]]. In 1968, Ford ''Eileen Ford's Book of Model Beauty'', which gave beauty tips and nutrition and exercise advice. The book included a biography and photos of Ford's most successful models from the 1950s and 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ford was still the number-one modeling agency in the world. It represented [[Jerry Hall]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Janice Dickinson]], [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Karen Graham]], [[Susan Blakely]], and others. Hutton and Graham were the earliest models to get exclusive make-up contracts with [[Revlon]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]. By 1977 however, [[John Casablancas]], who started [[Elite Model Management|Elite]], began to poach Ford's top models and her top booking agent, Monique Pillard. The Fords tried to sue Casablancas,{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} and hired famed attorney [[Roy Cohn]].<!-- so what happened? --> They also competed with several smaller modeling agencies, such as [[Wilhelmina Models|Wilhelmina]], which represented such late 1970s models as [[Gia Carangi]], [[Patti Hansen]] and [[Shaun Casey]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDuring this time, Ford Models expanded their agency. A successful Men's Division would dominate the pages of ''[[GQ]]'' magazine. In 1975, the Fords started a children's division. In her Lifetime Intimate Portrait, Eileen Ford said they started that division with [[Brooke Shields]], then 9 years old, in mind. Shields was already an established model when the Fords signed her. She shot her first national advertising campaign with [[Francesco Scavullo]] in 1966 for [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory soap]]. It was during that first year with Ford that she shot the infamous photos with photographer [[Garry Gross]]. According to court records, Brooke was paid $450 for the photo session.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBy the late 1970s, the \"model wars\" between Elite and Ford were in full stride with top models going back-and-forth between Elite, Ford, and smaller agencies like Zoli, which represented [[Rachel Ward]] and Esm\u00e9 Marshall. By this time, many top models were getting terrible reputations for drug use, staying out all night at [[Studio 54]] and for being very unprofessional.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, Eileen said several of Ford's models from the 1950s and 1960s had died from smoking and breast cancer.<ref name=\"glamour\"/> Some 1970s models died from drug use, including Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS in 1986. Top fashion photographers, tired of these models' behavior, refused to work with them any longer. In 1981, the Fords began an international modeling competition called \"Face of the 80s\", later known as [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]]. By the mid-1980s, drug-addicted blonde models were out, and more professional, brunette-haired models such as [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Ren\u00e9e Simonsen]], [[Carol Alt]], [[Linda Evangelista]], and [[Christy Turlington]] came on the scene. As a result, modeling fees rapidly accelerated and several models were making millions of dollars per year. Fashion editor Polly Mellen said, \"The girls are getting rich, so rich.\"<ref name=\"model\"/> Turlington, at the age of 16, moved into Ford's townhouse during the summer of 1985, and would rapidly become one of the Ford's biggest successes ever.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1993, Eileen said that her agency received 10,000 letters per year and 7,000 personal visits to her office. Of these, she said, maybe only four or five are \"really good ones [models]\".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ford's Famous X-Factor |journal=American Photo |date=May\u2013June 1993 |page=72}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1993, Ford's home in [[Tewksbury Township, New Jersey]], was almost completely destroyed in a fire.<ref>{{cite news |last=Speers |first=W |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A48AE61900E0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Model-Agency Fords Lose N.

She was CEO from 1995 to 2007. In December 2007, Ford was sold to Stone Tower Equity Partners. John Caplan took over as CEO while Katie Ford was on the Board of Directors. Jerry Ford died at the age 83 on August 24, 2008.

It represented [[Jerry Hall]], [[Christie Brinkley]], [[Rene Russo]], [[Kim Basinger]], [[Janice Dickinson]], [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Karen Graham]], [[Susan Blakely]], and others. Hutton and Graham were the earliest models to get exclusive make-up contracts with [[Revlon]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]]. By 1977 however, [[John Casablancas]], who started [[Elite Model Management|Elite]], began to poach Ford's top models and her top booking agent, Monique Pillard. The Fords tried to sue Casablancas,{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} and hired famed attorney [[Roy Cohn]].<!-- so what happened? --> They also competed with several smaller modeling agencies, such as [[Wilhelmina Models|Wilhelmina]], which represented such late 1970s models as [[Gia Carangi]], [[Patti Hansen]] and [[Shaun Casey]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nDuring this time, Ford Models expanded their agency. A successful Men's Division would dominate the pages of ''[[GQ]]'' magazine. In 1975, the Fords started a children's division. In her Lifetime Intimate Portrait, Eileen Ford said they started that division with [[Brooke Shields]], then 9 years old, in mind. Shields was already an established model when the Fords signed her. She shot her first national advertising campaign with [[Francesco Scavullo]] in 1966 for [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory soap]]. It was during that first year with Ford that she shot the infamous photos with photographer [[Garry Gross]]. According to court records, Brooke was paid $450 for the photo session.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nBy the late 1970s, the \"model wars\" between Elite and Ford were in full stride with top models going back-and-forth between Elite, Ford, and smaller agencies like Zoli, which represented [[Rachel Ward]] and Esm\u00e9 Marshall. By this time, many top models were getting terrible reputations for drug use, staying out all night at [[Studio 54]] and for being very unprofessional.<ref name=\"model\"/>\n\nBy the late 1970s and early 1980s, Eileen said several of Ford's models from the 1950s and 1960s had died from smoking and breast cancer.<ref name=\"glamour\"/> Some 1970s models died from drug use, including Gia Carangi, who died of AIDS in 1986. Top fashion photographers, tired of these models' behavior, refused to work with them any longer. In 1981, the Fords began an international modeling competition called \"Face of the 80s\", later known as [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]]. By the mid-1980s, drug-addicted blonde models were out, and more professional, brunette-haired models such as [[Cindy Crawford]], [[Ren\u00e9e Simonsen]], [[Carol Alt]], [[Linda Evangelista]], and [[Christy Turlington]] came on the scene. As a result, modeling fees rapidly accelerated and several models were making millions of dollars per year. Fashion editor Polly Mellen said, \"The girls are getting rich, so rich.\"<ref name=\"model\"/> Turlington, at the age of 16, moved into Ford's townhouse during the summer of 1985, and would rapidly become one of the Ford's biggest successes ever.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1993, Eileen said that her agency received 10,000 letters per year and 7,000 personal visits to her office.

(2015), [[autosome|autosomic]] tests indicate that the Yamnaya people were the result of a genetic admixture between two different hunter-gatherer populations: distinctive \"Eastern European hunter-gatherers\" with high affinity to the [[Mal'ta\u2013Buret' culture]] or other, [[Afontova Gora|closely related]] people from [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]]{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}} and a population of \"Caucasus hunter-gatherers\" who probably arrived from the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Jones|Gonzalez-Fortes|Connell|Siska|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA.{{sfn|Mathieson|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> According to co-author Andrea Manica of the [[University of Cambridge]]:\n{{quote|The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now ... we can now answer that, as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation.<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/>}}\n\nSeveral genetic studies performed since 2015 have given support to the [[Kurgan theory]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]] regarding the [[Indo-European Urheimat]] \u2013 that Indo-European languages spread throughout Europe from the Eurasian steppes and that the Yamnaya culture were Proto-Indo-Europeans. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia), would have expanded from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppes, along with the Indo-European languages. They also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages in the Bronze Age.{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}<ref name=\"allen\" /><ref>{{cite biorxiv |biorxiv=016477 |title=Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe |author=Mathieson |display-authors=etal |year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dnieper-Donets male (Volniensky).jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|[[Forensic facial reconstruction]] of a male from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]].

This admixture is referred to as [[Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH), and has earlier been found among the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Khvalynsk culture]], who preceded the Yamnaya culture on the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Unlike their Khvalynsk predecessors however, the Y-DNA of the Yamnaya is exclusively of EHG and WHG origin. This suggests that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG and WHG paternal origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=36}} Admixture between EHGs and CHGs is believed to have occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe around 5,000 BC, while admixture with EEFs happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later. As Yamnaya Y-DNA is exclusively of the EHG and WHG type, the admixture appears to have occurred between EHG and WHG males, and CHG and EEF females. According to [[David W.

Catacomb people were found to have much higher frequencies of the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] than people of the Yamnaya culture. Haplogroups U5 and U4 are typical of [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s. A generic similarity between Catacomb people and northern hunter-gatherers, particularly the people of the [[Pitted Ware culture]] of southern [[Scandinavia]], was detected.

It was preceded by the middle Volga-based [[Khvalynsk culture]] and the Don-based [[Repin culture]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;3950\u20133300&nbsp;BC),{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=275}}<ref group=web name=\"Morgunova.Khokhlova.2013\"/> and late pottery from these two cultures can barely be distinguished from early Yamnaya pottery.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=274\u2013277, 317\u2013320}} Earlier continuity from eneolithic but largely hunter-gatherer [[Samara culture]] and influences from the more agricultural [[Dnieper\u2013Donets culture|Dnieper\u2013Donets II]] are apparent.\n\nAccording to Anthony (2007), the early Yamnaya horizon spread quickly across the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]s between {{circa}}&nbsp;3400 and 3200&nbsp;BC.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=321}}\n\n<blockquote>The spread of the Yamnaya horizon was the material expression of the spread of late Proto-Indo-European across the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppes.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pp=301\u2013302}}<br/>\n\n[...] The Yamnaya horizon is the visible archaeological expression of a social adjustment to high mobility \u2013 the invention of the political infrastructure to manage larger herds from mobile homes based in the steppes.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Pavel Dolukhanov the emergence of the Pit-Grave culture represents a social development of various local Bronze Age cultures, representing \"an expression of social stratification and the emergence of chiefdom-type nomadic social structures\", which in turn intensified inter-group contacts between essentially heterogeneous social groups.{{sfn|Dolukhanov|1996|p=94}}\n\nIn its western range, it was succeeded by the [[Catacomb culture]] (2800\u20132200&nbsp;BC); in the east, by the [[Poltavka culture]] (2700\u20132100&nbsp;BC) at the middle Volga. These two cultures were followed by the [[Srubnaya culture]] (18th\u201312th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC).\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n[[File:Yamna culture tomb.jpg|thumb|Yamnaya culture grave, [[Volgograd Oblast]]]]\nThe Yamnaya culture is identified with the late [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] (PIE) in the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]]. It is the strongest candidate for the [[Urheimat]] (original homeland) of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], along with the preceding [[Sredny Stog culture]], now that archaeological evidence of the culture and its migrations has been closely tied to the evidence from linguistics{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and genetics.{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}{{sfn|Zimmer|2015}} Significantly, there were animal grave offerings<ref group=lower-alpha>The animal grave offerings made were cattle, sheep, goats and horses.</ref> a feature associated with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]].{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=43}} The culture was predominantly [[nomad]]ic, with some [[agriculture]] practiced near rivers and a few [[hillfort]]s.{{sfn|Mallory|1997}} Characteristic for the culture are the [[burial]]s in pit graves under [[kurgan]]s ([[tumuli]]). The dead bodies were placed in a [[supine position]] with bent knees and covered in [[ochre]]. Multiple graves have been found in these kurgans, often as later insertions.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} The earliest remains in [[Ukraine]] of a [[wheel]]ed cart were found in the \"Storozhova mohyla\" kurgan<ref group=lower-alpha>The \"Storozhova mohyla\" site is near [[Dnipro]], [[Ukraine]], and was excavated by A.I. Trenozhkin.</ref> associated with the Yamnaya culture.\n\n==Archaeogenetics==\n{{See|Western Steppe Herders}}\nAccording to Jones et al. (2015) and Haak et al. (2015), [[autosome|autosomic]] tests indicate that the Yamnaya people were the result of a genetic admixture between two different hunter-gatherer populations: distinctive \"Eastern European hunter-gatherers\" with high affinity to the [[Mal'ta\u2013Buret' culture]] or other, [[Afontova Gora|closely related]] people from [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberia]]{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}} and a population of \"Caucasus hunter-gatherers\" who probably arrived from the [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Jones|Gonzalez-Fortes|Connell|Siska|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA.{{sfn|Mathieson|2015}}<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/> According to co-author Andrea Manica of the [[University of Cambridge]]:\n{{quote|The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now ... we can now answer that, as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation.<ref name=\"bbcnov16\"/>}}\n\nSeveral genetic studies performed since 2015 have given support to the [[Kurgan theory]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]] regarding the [[Indo-European Urheimat]] \u2013 that Indo-European languages spread throughout Europe from the Eurasian steppes and that the Yamnaya culture were Proto-Indo-Europeans. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia), would have expanded from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppes, along with the Indo-European languages. They also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages in the Bronze Age.{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}}<ref name=\"allen\" /><ref>{{cite biorxiv |biorxiv=016477 |title=Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe |author=Mathieson |display-authors=etal |year=2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dnieper-Donets male (Volniensky).jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|[[Forensic facial reconstruction]] of a male from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]].

This admixture is referred to as [[Western Steppe Herder]] (WSH), and has earlier been found among the [[Sredny Stog culture]] and the [[Khvalynsk culture]], who preceded the Yamnaya culture on the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]]. Unlike their Khvalynsk predecessors however, the Y-DNA of the Yamnaya is exclusively of EHG and WHG origin. This suggests that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG and WHG paternal origin.{{sfn|Anthony|2019b|p=36}} Admixture between EHGs and CHGs is believed to have occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe around 5,000 BC, while admixture with EEFs happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later. As Yamnaya Y-DNA is exclusively of the EHG and WHG type, the admixture appears to have occurred between EHG and WHG males, and CHG and EEF females. According to [[David W.

Catacomb people were found to have much higher frequencies of the maternal haplogroups [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] than people of the Yamnaya culture. Haplogroups U5 and U4 are typical of [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s and [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s. A generic similarity between Catacomb people and northern hunter-gatherers, particularly the people of the [[Pitted Ware culture]] of southern [[Scandinavia]], was detected.

When Quirt urgently insists upon sending a telegram, Thomas and his daughter Penelope ([[Gail Russell]]) drive him into town in their wagon. After wiring a claim to the land recorder's office, Quirt passes out, and Penny cradles him. Ignoring the doctor's advice to rid themselves of the gunman, the compassionate Worth family tends to the delirious Quirt, and Penny becomes intrigued by his ravings about past loves.\n\nDays later, when Quirt regains consciousness, Penny patiently explains the family's belief in non-violence. Three weeks later, Laredo Stevens ([[Bruce Cabot]]) and Hondo Jeffries (Louis Faust) ride into town looking for Quirt. When Penny's younger brother Johnny (Stephen Grant) rushes home to warn Quirt of his visitors, Quirt quickly prepares to flee. Penny, now smitten with Quirt, offers to run off with him. At the sound of approaching horses, Quirt grabs his gun and discovers that it has been emptied. Training his weapon on the doorway, Quirt calmly greets Hondo and Laredo. Thinking that Quirt has the upper hand, Laredo offers to buy his claim. When Quirt sets the price at $20,000, Laredo hands over $5,000 in gold and challenges him to come for the balance when he is able \u2013 if he has the nerve.\n\n[[File:Angel and the Badman (1947).webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=21|upright=1.5|''Angel and the Badman'']]\nAfterward, Quirt saddles his horse, but when Penny begs him to stay, he changes his mind. Later, Quirt learns that cantankerous rancher Frederick Carson ([[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]]) has dammed up the stream that runs through the valley, thus draining the Worths' irrigation ditches. Quirt intimidates Carson into opening the dam.\n\nOne Sunday, Penny asks Quirt to join the family for a ride. Before they leave, Marshal Wistful McClintock ([[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]]) comes to question Quirt about a stagecoach robbery. The family swears that Quirt was with them at the time. The marshal then asks Quirt why he resigned as Wyatt Earp's deputy, sold his ranch and crossed over to the wrong side of the law soon after cattleman Walt Ennis was gunned down in a saloon brawl. When Quirt refuses to answer, the marshal leaves. Penny then begs Quirt to steer clear of Laredo, and he acquiesces because of his love for her.\n\nAs Quirt and the Worths ride to the Quaker gathering, Quirt's erstwhile sidekick, Randy McCall ([[Lee Dixon (actor)|Lee Dixon]]), tags along. Randy tells Quirt that Laredo plans to rustle a herd of cattle and suggests that they then steal the herd from Laredo and let him take the blame. Mr. Worth gives Quirt a Bible as a reward for ending the feud with Carson. Fearing that he will never be able to live up to Penny's expectations, Quirt abruptly leaves with Randy.\n\n[[File:Irene Rich, Gail Russell & John Wayne in Angel and the Badman - 1947.jpg|250px|thumb|Quirt recovering under the care of the two women (from left to right: Rich, Russell, and Wayne)]]\nQuirt and Randy steal the herd from the original rustlers. They then celebrate with showgirls Lila Neal (Joan Barton) and Christine Taylor (Rosemary Bertrand). When Lila, sensing a change in her old flame, teases Quirt about his Bible, Quirt becomes angry and rides back to the Worth farm. Overjoyed, Penny throws her arms around him, just as the marshal arrives to question Quirt about the rustling. Quirt states that Lila can provide him with an alibi. Penny is hurt that Quirt was with his old flame. She heard him talk about Lila in his delirium, and thinks that Quirt prefers Lila's fair hair. Quirt realizes the depth of his feelings for Penny, and they kiss hungrily in the barn, while the camera fades out.\n\nThe marshal warns Quirt that he is the wrong man for Penny. Quirt decides to propose to her anyway. Instead of replying, Penny invites Quirt to join her picking blackberries. Quirt answers Penny's questions about his early life. Kindly Walt Ennis raised him after his parents were massacred by Indians; then Ennis was murdered.\n\nOn their way home, Quirt and Penny are ambushed and chased by Laredo and Hondo. Their  wagon plunges over a cliff into the river. Penny develops a dangerous fever after the drenching. When the doctor informs Quirt that there is no hope for her, Quirt straps on his pistol and rides into town to exact revenge. After Quirt leaves, Penny's fever suddenly breaks.\n\nIn town, Quirt sends Bradley to tell Laredo and Hondo that he is waiting for them in the street. Penny and her family arrive. She gets Quirt to surrender his gun to her. As Laredo and Hondo draw their guns, Marshal McClintock shoots them both. Quirt rides off in the wagon with Penny. The marshal picks up Quirt's discarded weapon. Bradley comments that Quirt may need it, to which the marshal says, \"Only a man who carries a gun ever needs one.\"  The film fades to black.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Angel and the Badman 1947.jpg|left|thumb|John Wayne and Gail Russell]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Wayne]] as Quirt Evans\n* [[Gail Russell]] as Penelope Worth\n* [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] as Marshal Wistful McClintock\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as Laredo Stevens\n* [[Irene Rich]] as Mrs. Worth\n* [[Lee Dixon (actor)|Lee Dixon]] as Randy McCall\n* [[Stephen Grant (actor)|Stephen Grant]] as Johnny Worth\n* [[Tom Powers (actor)|Tom Powers]] as Dr. Mangram\n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as Frederick Carson\n* [[Olin Howland]] as Bradley\n* [[John Halloran]] as Thomas Worth\n* [[Joan Barton]] as Lila Neal\n* [[Craig Woods]] as Ward Withers\n* [[Marshall Reed]] as Nelson\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Mouse Marr (uncredited) \n* [[Hank Worden]] as Townsman (uncredited) \n* Louis Faust (as Hondo Jeffries (uncredited)) <ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039152/fullcredits</ref>\n* [[Symona Boniface]] as Dance Hall Madam (uncredited)<ref>{{citation |title=The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States |year=1971 |publisher=University of California Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanfilminst00amer/page/78 78] |isbn=978-0-520-21521-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/americanfilminst00amer/page/78 }}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography took place from mid-April through late June 1946, in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and [[Sedona, Arizona]], and in [[Monument Valley, Utah]].<ref name=\"tcminfo\">{{cite web| title= Original Print Information | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18929/Angel-and-the-Badman/original-print-info.html | accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Soundtrack===\n* \"A Little Bit Different\" (Kim Gannon and Walter Kent) by Joan Barton\n* \"Darling Nelly Gray\" (Benjamin Russell Hamby) by Joan Barton and Lee Dixon<ref name=\"imdbsoundtracks\">{{cite web|title=Soundtracks for Angel and the Badman |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039152/soundtrack |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Song==\n[[Johnny Cash]] sang a song in 1993 called Angel and the Badman.

When Quirt sets the price at $20,000, Laredo hands over $5,000 in gold and challenges him to come for the balance when he is able \u2013 if he has the nerve.\n\n[[File:Angel and the Badman (1947).webm|left|thumb|thumbtime=21|upright=1.5|''Angel and the Badman'']]\nAfterward, Quirt saddles his horse, but when Penny begs him to stay, he changes his mind. Later, Quirt learns that cantankerous rancher Frederick Carson ([[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]]) has dammed up the stream that runs through the valley, thus draining the Worths' irrigation ditches. Quirt intimidates Carson into opening the dam.\n\nOne Sunday, Penny asks Quirt to join the family for a ride. Before they leave, Marshal Wistful McClintock ([[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]]) comes to question Quirt about a stagecoach robbery. The family swears that Quirt was with them at the time. The marshal then asks Quirt why he resigned as Wyatt Earp's deputy, sold his ranch and crossed over to the wrong side of the law soon after cattleman Walt Ennis was gunned down in a saloon brawl. When Quirt refuses to answer, the marshal leaves. Penny then begs Quirt to steer clear of Laredo, and he acquiesces because of his love for her.\n\nAs Quirt and the Worths ride to the Quaker gathering, Quirt's erstwhile sidekick, Randy McCall ([[Lee Dixon (actor)|Lee Dixon]]), tags along. Randy tells Quirt that Laredo plans to rustle a herd of cattle and suggests that they then steal the herd from Laredo and let him take the blame. Mr. Worth gives Quirt a Bible as a reward for ending the feud with Carson. Fearing that he will never be able to live up to Penny's expectations, Quirt abruptly leaves with Randy.\n\n[[File:Irene Rich, Gail Russell & John Wayne in Angel and the Badman - 1947.jpg|250px|thumb|Quirt recovering under the care of the two women (from left to right: Rich, Russell, and Wayne)]]\nQuirt and Randy steal the herd from the original rustlers. They then celebrate with showgirls Lila Neal (Joan Barton) and Christine Taylor (Rosemary Bertrand). When Lila, sensing a change in her old flame, teases Quirt about his Bible, Quirt becomes angry and rides back to the Worth farm. Overjoyed, Penny throws her arms around him, just as the marshal arrives to question Quirt about the rustling. Quirt states that Lila can provide him with an alibi. Penny is hurt that Quirt was with his old flame. She heard him talk about Lila in his delirium, and thinks that Quirt prefers Lila's fair hair. Quirt realizes the depth of his feelings for Penny, and they kiss hungrily in the barn, while the camera fades out.\n\nThe marshal warns Quirt that he is the wrong man for Penny. Quirt decides to propose to her anyway. Instead of replying, Penny invites Quirt to join her picking blackberries. Quirt answers Penny's questions about his early life. Kindly Walt Ennis raised him after his parents were massacred by Indians; then Ennis was murdered.\n\nOn their way home, Quirt and Penny are ambushed and chased by Laredo and Hondo. Their  wagon plunges over a cliff into the river. Penny develops a dangerous fever after the drenching. When the doctor informs Quirt that there is no hope for her, Quirt straps on his pistol and rides into town to exact revenge. After Quirt leaves, Penny's fever suddenly breaks.\n\nIn town, Quirt sends Bradley to tell Laredo and Hondo that he is waiting for them in the street. Penny and her family arrive. She gets Quirt to surrender his gun to her. As Laredo and Hondo draw their guns, Marshal McClintock shoots them both. Quirt rides off in the wagon with Penny. The marshal picks up Quirt's discarded weapon. Bradley comments that Quirt may need it, to which the marshal says, \"Only a man who carries a gun ever needs one.\"  The film fades to black.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Angel and the Badman 1947.jpg|left|thumb|John Wayne and Gail Russell]]\n{{Div col}}\n* [[John Wayne]] as Quirt Evans\n* [[Gail Russell]] as Penelope Worth\n* [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]] as Marshal Wistful McClintock\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as Laredo Stevens\n* [[Irene Rich]] as Mrs. Worth\n* [[Lee Dixon (actor)|Lee Dixon]] as Randy McCall\n* [[Stephen Grant (actor)|Stephen Grant]] as Johnny Worth\n* [[Tom Powers (actor)|Tom Powers]] as Dr. Mangram\n* [[Paul Hurst (actor)|Paul Hurst]] as Frederick Carson\n* [[Olin Howland]] as Bradley\n* [[John Halloran]] as Thomas Worth\n* [[Joan Barton]] as Lila Neal\n* [[Craig Woods]] as Ward Withers\n* [[Marshall Reed]] as Nelson\n* [[Paul Fix]] as Mouse Marr (uncredited) \n* [[Hank Worden]] as Townsman (uncredited) \n* Louis Faust (as Hondo Jeffries (uncredited)) <ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039152/fullcredits</ref>\n* [[Symona Boniface]] as Dance Hall Madam (uncredited)<ref>{{citation |title=The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States |year=1971 |publisher=University of California Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americanfilminst00amer/page/78 78] |isbn=978-0-520-21521-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/americanfilminst00amer/page/78 }}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nPrincipal photography took place from mid-April through late June 1946, in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] and [[Sedona, Arizona]], and in [[Monument Valley, Utah]].<ref name=\"tcminfo\">{{cite web| title= Original Print Information | url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18929/Angel-and-the-Badman/original-print-info.html | accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Soundtrack===\n* \"A Little Bit Different\" (Kim Gannon and Walter Kent) by Joan Barton\n* \"Darling Nelly Gray\" (Benjamin Russell Hamby) by Joan Barton and Lee Dixon<ref name=\"imdbsoundtracks\">{{cite web|title=Soundtracks for Angel and the Badman |website=Internet Movie Database |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039152/soundtrack |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Song==\n[[Johnny Cash]] sang a song in 1993 called Angel and the Badman.
