The mention of a duma shows that there was at a very early time an eminence of note at Castleknock ; the duma may have been, Mr. Westropp observes, used for purposes of residence, sepulchre, or outlook, or, as in the case of Duma Selga, for all three.\"''\n\n''In a poem relating to the earliest centuries after Christ the origin of the name Cnucha is connected with Conn of the Hundred Battles, and the name is said to have been borne by his foster-mother: \u2014 \n:''The nurse of Conn who loved this strip of land\n:Was Cnucha of the comely head;\n:She dwelt on the dun with him\n:In the reign of Conn of the Hundred Fights.\n:Cnucha, the daughter of Concadh Cas,\n:From the land of Luimncach broad and green,\n:Died yonder in that house\n:To the horror of the Gaels.\n:The woman was buried, a grief it was.\n:In the very middle of the hill ;\n:So that from that on Cnucha\n:Is its name until the judgment.''<ref>A HISTORY OF COUNTY DUBLIN: FRANCIS ELRINGTON BALL  https://archive.org/stream/historyofcountyd06ball/historyofcountyd06ball_djvu.txt</ref>\n\n===Feudal period===\nIn 1167 Roderick O\u2019Connor, [[King of Connacht]], encamped at Castleknock with his forces and engaged the Danish residents in his pay. He led a large army to Dublin where he was solemnly inaugurated as [[High King of Ireland]]. By 1177, a feudal [[Castleknock (barony)|barony of Castleknock]] was created out of the [[Lordship of Meath]] by [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath]] who granted it to Hugh Tyrrel. It was held for three and a half knight's fees, owed to the superior Lord of Fingal. The title and lands of Castleknock were held by the Tyrell family until 1370 when Hugh Tyrell and his wife died of the Plague. It passed by inheritance to the Burnell family. The first Baron, [[Hugh Tyrrel]], gave lands in the barony at Kilmainham to the [[Venerable Order of St John|Knights of St. John]] who continue in the area today in the form of [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland|St. John Ambulance]]. Later, [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parishes]], based on the boundaries of the [[Ecclesiastical parish]]es of the [[Established church]] were used to sub-divide the barony.\n\nIn 1185, Richard de Tyrell, son of the first Baron of Castleknock, gave a grant to the Benedictine Monks of the Abbey of Little Malvern, Worcestershire, to endow a religious house at Castleknock in honour of Saint Brigid<ref>Harris's Table in Ware-Harris, Antiquitie, 1745 and Mervyn Archdall, Monasticon Hibernicum, 1786</ref>. Later they built a chapel, the White Chapel at Coolmine, which served the parish of Clonsilla. In 1219 The great tithes of the parish were appropriated by Archbishop Henry de Londres to the Priory of Malvern on condition that they should add five monks to their number. In 1225 the monks granted half of the tithes of the manor of Castleknock to the use of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, renouncing to the Archbishop all rights to the vicarage and its small tithes and oblations. In 1226 the first Prebendary of Castleknock, Richard De Gnouessale, was appointed. However, by 1468 the Church and lands at Castleknock were transferred to the ownership of the Abbey of St. Mary near Dublin. Following the [[English Reformation]] and the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England]], the Priory at Castleknock was destroyed and in 1609 a church was built on the site for the use of the [[Church of Ireland]]. The foundation stone of the church, which is in use today, still on the site of the Abbey, was laid in 1803.<ref>Church of Ireland - history http://www.castleknock.dublin.anglican.org/history/history.html</ref> The spire was added in 1864 by friends of the late [[James Hans Hamilton]] as a memorial to the 1st Baron HolmPatrick of Abbottown and [[Member of Parliament|MP]]for the County of Dublin. \n\nIn the townland of Diswellstown there is a historic \"rag well\" - a holy well near which rags were left. Although it still flows, it was \"buried\" by the County Council, and its site is now marked by a carved flagstone. Nearby the Diswellstown Stream, which rises near Castleknock village, flows west and then turns sharply south, taking in a streamlet from Carpenterstown, before running down to the Liffey in a narrow steep valley.\n\nCastleknock eventually came to be divided among a number of important families and their country estates. These included the Guinness at [[Farmleigh]], and Knockmaroon, the Laidlaws at Abbey Lodge, the Godleys at Oatlands, and the Brookes at Sommerton House.<ref>https://reynoldshistorycastleknockblog.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/knockmaroon-estate-local-history-castleknock/</ref>\n\nThe Earl of Iveagh's principle seat was at [[Farmleigh House]] until 1999 when it was purchased by the Government of Ireland. It was restored and converted into a State Guest House and opened to the public in 2001. Although they left Farmleigh in 1999, the Guinness family are still present in Castleknock at Knockmaroon House which is located on Carpenterstown Road and the seat of [[Lord Moyne]], The [[Brooke Baronets]] lived st Sommerton House until they sold it in 1911 to the Laidlaw family who were resident at Sommerton and Abbey Lodge until the 1980s<ref>https://reynoldshistorycastleknockblog.wordpress.com/tag/laidlaw-family/</ref>.\n\n===Civil parish===\nWithin the civil parish of Castleknock, there are 22 [[townlands]] per the table below. Like all civil parishes in Ireland, this civil parish is derived from, and co-extensive with, a pre-existing parish of the [[Church of Ireland]]. In 1773, an act of council united the parish with the curacies of Clonsilla and Mulhuddart. In 1837, Lewis' directory reported that the living (of the ecclesiastical parish) was a vicarage in the diocese of [[Archdiocese of Dublin|Dublin]] which was: \"... endowed with a portion of the great tithes, and united to the prebend of Castleknock and the rectory of Clonsillagh and curacy of Mullahidart, with cure of souls: it is in the patronage of the Bishop.\".<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/irl/DUB/Castleknock Lewis,] \"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\", 1837</ref> The two churches noted by Lewis in the vicarial union, one at Castleknock, the other at Clonsilla, are extant and in use by the Church of Ireland community. The former was rebuilt by a loan of \u00a31000 from the [[Board of First Fruits]] and large subscriptions, in 1810. In 1831, the population of the parish, including Blanchardstown was 4251 people of which 3409 were Catholic.<ref>''The History of the County of Dublin'', John D'Alton, 1838</ref>\n \nThe core of the parish is centred on the townland and village of the same name. The townland at the northern extremity is Huntstown, not to be confused with [[Huntstown and Littlepace]] in the neighbouring parish of [[Clonsilla]].To the south, it is bounded by the [[River Liffey]] and the [[Phoenix Park]]. To the west, it is bounded by [[Coolmine railway station]] and [[Blanchardstown Shopping Centre]]. To the east lies the 8th lock of the [[Royal Canal]] and the Cabra Gate of the Phoenix Park.\n \nFor convenience, the table below groups the parish's townlands by their location in one of the modern [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] areas. Some townlands, however, straddle both areas.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:80px\" | Modern Local<br>[[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|Authority Area]]\n! style=\"width:200px\" | Name in Irish\n! style=\"width:200px\" | Name in English\n! style=\"width:40px\" | Acres\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n|Baile an \u00c1saigh\n|[[Ashtown, Dublin|Ashtown]] <small>(partly)</small>\n|278\n|-\n|Baile Pheil\u00e9id\n|Pelletstown\n|259\n|- \n|An Chabrach\n|[[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]]\n|457\n|-\n|Caisle\u00e1n Cnucha (cuid de Ph\u00e1irc an Fhionnuisce)\n|Castleknock (part of Phoenix Park)<br><small>(partly)</small>\n|1020<br>(787)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"20\" |[[Fingal]]\n|Baile an Aba\n|[[Abbotstown]]<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Abbotstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17224.aspx |title=Abbotstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|101\n|- \n|Baile an \u00c1saigh\n|[[Ashtown, Dublin|Ashtown]] <small>(partly)</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Ashtown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17263.aspx |title=Ashtown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|278\n|- \n|Baile an Chairpint\u00e9araigh\n|Carpenterstown</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Carpenterstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17266.aspx |title=Carpenterstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|166\n|- \n|Baile an D\u00e9anaigh\n|Deanestown</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Deanestown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17228.aspx |title=Deanestown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|173\n|- \n|Baile an Diosualaigh\n|Diswellstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Diswellstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17269.aspx |title=Diswellstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|418\n|- \n|Baile an Huntaigh\n|Huntstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Huntstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17230.aspx |title=Huntstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|299\n|- \n|Baile an Ph\u00f3irt\u00e9araigh\n|Porterstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Porterstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17271.aspx |title=Porterstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|219\n|- \n|Baile Bhlains\u00e9ir\n|Blanchardstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Blanchardstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/1412097.aspx |title=Blanchardstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|454\n|- \n|Baile Mhist\u00e9il\n|Mitchelstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Mitchelstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17232.aspx |title=Mitchelstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|154\n|-  \n|Baile Scriobail\n|Scribblestown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Scribblestown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17270.aspx |title=Scribblestown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|272\n|- \n|Baile She\u00e1in\n|Johnstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Johnstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17558.aspx |title=Johnstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n| 67\n|- \n|An Chabrach\n|[[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]]\n|457\n|- \n|Caisle\u00e1n Cnucha (cuid de Ph\u00e1irc an Fhionnuisce)\n|Castleknock <br>(part of Phoenix Park)<br><small>(partly)</small>\n|1020<br>(787)\n|- \n|Ceapach\n|Cappoge or Cappagh\n|698\n|- \n|Cnoc na gCaorach\n|Sheephill\n|349\n|- \n|An Chorr Dhubh\n|[[Corduff]]\n|353\n|- \n|D\u00fan Sinche\n|[[Dunsink]]\n|423\n|- \n|P\u00e1irc Anna\n|Annfield\n| 19\n|-\n|Snugborough\n|Snugborough\n| 53\n|- \n|Steach Gob\n|Astagob\n| 93\n|-\n|}\n\n==Castleknock today==\n[[File:Arts and Crafts style cottages, Main Street, Castlekock, Dublin 15.jpg|thumb|Arts and Crafts style cottages, Main Street, Castlekmock]]\n[[File:St Bridgets Castleknock 2012.jpg|thumb|\"St. Briget's, Church of Ireland\"]]\n[[File:St Thomas the Apostle.jpg|thumb|\"St Thomas the Apostle\",<br> Laurel Lodge, Castleknock]]\n[[File:Castleknock Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|\"Our Lady Mother of the Church\",<br> Catholic church, Castleknock.]]\n[[File:Stained glass window, St. Thomas Church, Castleknock, Dublin.

There is a post-office and several cafes and restaurants. There are three primary schools in the village, Castleknock National School (Church of Ireland), St. Brigid's Primary School (Roman Catholic), and Castleknock Educate Together (Non-Denominational). Outside the village there is also Scoil Thom\u00e1is Co-educational Primary School in Laurel Lodge district and St. Patrick's Co-educational Primary School in Diswellstown. Castleknock Co-educational Community School (Multi-Denominational) is located on Carpenterstown Road.  Mount Sackville Roman Catholic independent secondary school for girls was founded in 1864 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny. \n\n\n\n====Community groups====\n* Local First Aid training, event cover and community care in the Castleknock area is provided by [http://www.stjohncastleknock.ie St. John Ambulance Castleknock Combined Division] and the [http://www.orderofmaltaireland.org/index.php/contact/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197 Order of Malta Castleknock] <ref>[http://www.orderofmaltaireland.org/index.php/contact/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=197] Order of Malta Castleknock</ref>\n* There are a number of residents associations such as \"Riverwood Residents Association\" and \"Carpenterstown Park Residents Association\".<ref>[http://www.communityvoice.ie/pages/CV162/CV162c03.htm Community Voice, ''Carpenterstown residents\u2019 association launch new website.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330075610/http://www.communityvoice.ie/pages/CV162/CV162c03.htm |date=2012-03-30 }}</ref>\n* There is an active Tidy Towns Committee.\n* Castleknock Community Centre,<ref>[http://www.castleknockcommunitycentre.ie] Castleknock Community Centre website.</ref> in the Laurel Lodge area, hosts a range of social, sporting and charitable groups.\n* [http://www.castleknockscouts.ie Castleknock Scout Group], the 175th Castleknock, Dublin Troop, operate in the main village area and the Laurel Lodge and Carpenterstown areas.\n\n=== Religious institutions ===\n[[St. Brigid]] is the patron saint of the village.\n\nIn the [[Church of Ireland]], the church of St. Brigid, cited on the ruins of an ancient monastery, is located in the middle of the village. In the [[Catholic Church]], there are two [[Ecclesiastic parish|parishes]] in the suburb: \"Our Lady Mother of the Church\" which is centred close to the village and [[St Thomas the Apostle parish, Laurel Lodge]].\n  \nBoth St. Brigid's and St. Thomas the Apostle contain windows from the [[Harry Clarke]] Studios. The window in St. Brigid's was commissioned in 1927 by R.F. Brookes of Somerton House, Castleknock, to commemorate members of his family, whereas the Harry Clarke window in St. Thomas the Apostle was donated by the Domincan Order after their convent at D\u00fan Laoghaire closed in 1991.

The mention of a duma shows that there was at a very early time an eminence of note at Castleknock ; the duma may have been, Mr. Westropp observes, used for purposes of residence, sepulchre, or outlook, or, as in the case of Duma Selga, for all three.\"''\n\n''In a poem relating to the earliest centuries after Christ the origin of the name Cnucha is connected with Conn of the Hundred Battles, and the name is said to have been borne by his foster-mother: \u2014 \n:''The nurse of Conn who loved this strip of land\n:Was Cnucha of the comely head;\n:She dwelt on the dun with him\n:In the reign of Conn of the Hundred Fights.\n:Cnucha, the daughter of Concadh Cas,\n:From the land of Luimncach broad and green,\n:Died yonder in that house\n:To the horror of the Gaels.\n:The woman was buried, a grief it was.\n:In the very middle of the hill ;\n:So that from that on Cnucha\n:Is its name until the judgment.''<ref>A HISTORY OF COUNTY DUBLIN: FRANCIS ELRINGTON BALL  https://archive.org/stream/historyofcountyd06ball/historyofcountyd06ball_djvu.txt</ref>\n\n===Feudal period===\nIn 1167 Roderick O\u2019Connor, [[King of Connacht]], encamped at Castleknock with his forces and engaged the Danish residents in his pay. He led a large army to Dublin where he was solemnly inaugurated as [[High King of Ireland]]. By 1177, a feudal [[Castleknock (barony)|barony of Castleknock]] was created out of the [[Lordship of Meath]] by [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath]] who granted it to Hugh Tyrrel. It was held for three and a half knight's fees, owed to the superior Lord of Fingal. The title and lands of Castleknock were held by the Tyrell family until 1370 when Hugh Tyrell and his wife died of the Plague. It passed by inheritance to the Burnell family. The first Baron, [[Hugh Tyrrel]], gave lands in the barony at Kilmainham to the [[Venerable Order of St John|Knights of St. John]] who continue in the area today in the form of [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland|St. John Ambulance]]. Later, [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parishes]], based on the boundaries of the [[Ecclesiastical parish]]es of the [[Established church]] were used to sub-divide the barony.\n\nIn 1185, Richard de Tyrell, son of the first Baron of Castleknock, gave a grant to the Benedictine Monks of the Abbey of Little Malvern, Worcestershire, to endow a religious house at Castleknock in honour of Saint Brigid<ref>Harris's Table in Ware-Harris, Antiquitie, 1745 and Mervyn Archdall, Monasticon Hibernicum, 1786</ref>. Later they built a chapel, the White Chapel at Coolmine, which served the parish of Clonsilla. In 1219 The great tithes of the parish were appropriated by Archbishop Henry de Londres to the Priory of Malvern on condition that they should add five monks to their number. In 1225 the monks granted half of the tithes of the manor of Castleknock to the use of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, renouncing to the Archbishop all rights to the vicarage and its small tithes and oblations. In 1226 the first Prebendary of Castleknock, Richard De Gnouessale, was appointed. However, by 1468 the Church and lands at Castleknock were transferred to the ownership of the Abbey of St. Mary near Dublin. Following the [[English Reformation]] and the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] under [[Henry VIII of England]], the Priory at Castleknock was destroyed and in 1609 a church was built on the site for the use of the [[Church of Ireland]]. The foundation stone of the church, which is in use today, still on the site of the Abbey, was laid in 1803.<ref>Church of Ireland - history http://www.castleknock.dublin.anglican.org/history/history.html</ref> The spire was added in 1864 by friends of the late [[James Hans Hamilton]] as a memorial to the 1st Baron HolmPatrick of Abbottown and [[Member of Parliament|MP]]for the County of Dublin. \n\nIn the townland of Diswellstown there is a historic \"rag well\" - a holy well near which rags were left. Although it still flows, it was \"buried\" by the County Council, and its site is now marked by a carved flagstone. Nearby the Diswellstown Stream, which rises near Castleknock village, flows west and then turns sharply south, taking in a streamlet from Carpenterstown, before running down to the Liffey in a narrow steep valley.\n\nCastleknock eventually came to be divided among a number of important families and their country estates. These included the Guinness at [[Farmleigh]], and Knockmaroon, the Laidlaws at Abbey Lodge, the Godleys at Oatlands, and the Brookes at Sommerton House.<ref>https://reynoldshistorycastleknockblog.wordpress.com/2018/04/27/knockmaroon-estate-local-history-castleknock/</ref>\n\nThe Earl of Iveagh's principle seat was at [[Farmleigh House]] until 1999 when it was purchased by the Government of Ireland. It was restored and converted into a State Guest House and opened to the public in 2001. Although they left Farmleigh in 1999, the Guinness family are still present in Castleknock at Knockmaroon House which is located on Carpenterstown Road and the seat of [[Lord Moyne]], The [[Brooke Baronets]] lived st Sommerton House until they sold it in 1911 to the Laidlaw family who were resident at Sommerton and Abbey Lodge until the 1980s<ref>https://reynoldshistorycastleknockblog.wordpress.com/tag/laidlaw-family/</ref>.\n\n===Civil parish===\nWithin the civil parish of Castleknock, there are 22 [[townlands]] per the table below. Like all civil parishes in Ireland, this civil parish is derived from, and co-extensive with, a pre-existing parish of the [[Church of Ireland]]. In 1773, an act of council united the parish with the curacies of Clonsilla and Mulhuddart. In 1837, Lewis' directory reported that the living (of the ecclesiastical parish) was a vicarage in the diocese of [[Archdiocese of Dublin|Dublin]] which was: \"... endowed with a portion of the great tithes, and united to the prebend of Castleknock and the rectory of Clonsillagh and curacy of Mullahidart, with cure of souls: it is in the patronage of the Bishop.\".<ref>[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/irl/DUB/Castleknock Lewis,] \"Topographical Dictionary of Ireland\", 1837</ref> The two churches noted by Lewis in the vicarial union, one at Castleknock, the other at Clonsilla, are extant and in use by the Church of Ireland community. The former was rebuilt by a loan of \u00a31000 from the [[Board of First Fruits]] and large subscriptions, in 1810. In 1831, the population of the parish, including Blanchardstown was 4251 people of which 3409 were Catholic.<ref>''The History of the County of Dublin'', John D'Alton, 1838</ref>\n \nThe core of the parish is centred on the townland and village of the same name. The townland at the northern extremity is Huntstown, not to be confused with [[Huntstown and Littlepace]] in the neighbouring parish of [[Clonsilla]].To the south, it is bounded by the [[River Liffey]] and the [[Phoenix Park]]. To the west, it is bounded by [[Coolmine railway station]] and [[Blanchardstown Shopping Centre]]. To the east lies the 8th lock of the [[Royal Canal]] and the Cabra Gate of the Phoenix Park.\n \nFor convenience, the table below groups the parish's townlands by their location in one of the modern [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] areas. Some townlands, however, straddle both areas.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width:80px\" | Modern Local<br>[[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|Authority Area]]\n! style=\"width:200px\" | Name in Irish\n! style=\"width:200px\" | Name in English\n! style=\"width:40px\" | Acres\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |[[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n|Baile an \u00c1saigh\n|[[Ashtown, Dublin|Ashtown]] <small>(partly)</small>\n|278\n|-\n|Baile Pheil\u00e9id\n|Pelletstown\n|259\n|- \n|An Chabrach\n|[[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]]\n|457\n|-\n|Caisle\u00e1n Cnucha (cuid de Ph\u00e1irc an Fhionnuisce)\n|Castleknock (part of Phoenix Park)<br><small>(partly)</small>\n|1020<br>(787)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"20\" |[[Fingal]]\n|Baile an Aba\n|[[Abbotstown]]<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Abbotstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17224.aspx |title=Abbotstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|101\n|- \n|Baile an \u00c1saigh\n|[[Ashtown, Dublin|Ashtown]] <small>(partly)</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Ashtown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17263.aspx |title=Ashtown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|278\n|- \n|Baile an Chairpint\u00e9araigh\n|Carpenterstown</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Carpenterstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17266.aspx |title=Carpenterstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|166\n|- \n|Baile an D\u00e9anaigh\n|Deanestown</small><ref group=\"4\" name=\"Deanestown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17228.aspx |title=Deanestown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|173\n|- \n|Baile an Diosualaigh\n|Diswellstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Diswellstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17269.aspx |title=Diswellstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|418\n|- \n|Baile an Huntaigh\n|Huntstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Huntstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17230.aspx |title=Huntstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|299\n|- \n|Baile an Ph\u00f3irt\u00e9araigh\n|Porterstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Porterstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17271.aspx |title=Porterstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|219\n|- \n|Baile Bhlains\u00e9ir\n|Blanchardstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Blanchardstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/1412097.aspx |title=Blanchardstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|454\n|- \n|Baile Mhist\u00e9il\n|Mitchelstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Mitchelstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17232.aspx |title=Mitchelstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|154\n|-  \n|Baile Scriobail\n|Scribblestown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Scribblestown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17270.aspx |title=Scribblestown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n|272\n|- \n|Baile She\u00e1in\n|Johnstown<ref group=\"4\" name=\"Johnstown\">{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/17558.aspx |title=Johnstown &#124; logainm.ie|publisher=logainm.ie|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref>\n| 67\n|- \n|An Chabrach\n|[[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]]\n|457\n|- \n|Caisle\u00e1n Cnucha (cuid de Ph\u00e1irc an Fhionnuisce)\n|Castleknock <br>(part of Phoenix Park)<br><small>(partly)</small>\n|1020<br>(787)\n|- \n|Ceapach\n|Cappoge or Cappagh\n|698\n|- \n|Cnoc na gCaorach\n|Sheephill\n|349\n|- \n|An Chorr Dhubh\n|[[Corduff]]\n|353\n|- \n|D\u00fan Sinche\n|[[Dunsink]]\n|423\n|- \n|P\u00e1irc Anna\n|Annfield\n| 19\n|-\n|Snugborough\n|Snugborough\n| 53\n|- \n|Steach Gob\n|Astagob\n| 93\n|-\n|}\n\n==Castleknock today==\n[[File:Arts and Crafts style cottages, Main Street, Castlekock, Dublin 15.jpg|thumb|Arts and Crafts style cottages, Main Street, Castlekmock]]\n[[File:St Bridgets Castleknock 2012.jpg|thumb|\"St. Briget's, Church of Ireland\"]]\n[[File:St Thomas the Apostle.jpg|thumb|\"St Thomas the Apostle\",<br> Laurel Lodge, Castleknock]]\n[[File:Castleknock Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|\"Our Lady Mother of the Church\",<br> Catholic church, Castleknock.]]\n[[File:Stained glass window, St. Thomas Church, Castleknock, Dublin.
