In 1941, fourteen members of the civilian [[Women's Emergency Signalling Corps]] (WESC) were recruited for [[wireless telegraphy]] work at the [[Royal Australian Navy Wireless/Transmitting Station Canberra]], as part of a trial to free up men for service aboard ships. Although the RAN and the Australian government were initially reluctant to support the idea, the demand for seagoing personnel imposed by the [[Pacific War]] saw the WRANS formally established as a women's auxiliary service in 1942. The surge in recruitment led to the development of an internal officer corps. Over the course of World War II, over 3,000 women served in the WRANS.\n\nThe organisation was disbanded in 1947, but was reestablished in 1951 in response to the manpower demand caused by Cold War commitments. In 1959, the WRANS was designated a permanent part of the Australian military. The WRANS continued to operate until 1985, when female personnel were integrated into the RAN.\n\n==History==\n===Origin and World War II===\nIn March 1939, [[Florence Violet McKenzie]] set up the [[Women's Emergency Signalling Corps]] (WESC) as [[wireless telegraphy]] organisation for female volunteers.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=67|loc=in Mitchell}} McKenzie established the WESC because of the threat of war, and her belief that training women in wireless telegraphy, [[morse code]], and related skills meant they could free up men for military service.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=67|loc=in Mitchell}} By August 1940, there was a waiting list of 600 women for the small school, and WESC-trained telegraphists were teaching men from the armed forces and merchant navy.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|pp=67-8|loc=in Mitchell}}\n\nInspired by an article on the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]], McKenzie contacted the RAN on several occasions to suggest that her telegraphists be employed by the RAN.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in Mitchell}}</ref> Although initial letters were unanswered, she was eventually contacted by the Director of Signals and Communications, who proposed an experimental trial.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in Mitchell}} There was opposition from both the government and the [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board]], although they eventually agreed to the trial after realising there were few other sources of trained telegraphists that could meet RAN requirements.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in Mitchell}}{{sfn|Dennis et. al.|2008|p=607}} Even so, the employment was approved on the condition that there was no publicity attached to the recruitment.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in

Canberra]].{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in Mitchell}} Six months later, another nine women were recruited.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in Mitchell}} Although treated as naval personnel, the women were technically civilian employees of the RAN.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=71|loc=in Mitchell}} Despite the formation of women's auxiliaries in the Army and Air Force, the RAN remained reluctant to formally enlist the telegraphists.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=68|loc=in Mitchell}}\n\nThe increasing demand for manpower in the [[Pacific War]] resulted in a change of opinion in the RAN, with increasing recruitment of female personnel, and public promotion of the service.{{sfn|Dennis et. al.|2008|p=607}} Approval to form a Women's Royal Australian Naval Service of 580 personnel (280 telegraphists plus 300 other duties) was granted on 24 July 1942, and the initial WESC telegraphists were offered enlistment on 1 October 1942.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=69|loc=in Mitchell}} The scale of the response to recruitment campaigns was unexpected, with over 1,000 women enlisted by the end of 1942.{{sfn|Dennis et. al.|2008|p=607}} This prompted the RAN to establish an officer corps within the WRANS, with the first training course for female officers beginning at [[Flinders Naval Depot]] on 18 January 1943, and a further 16 courses run by September 1945.{{sfn|Dennis et. al.|2008|p=607}}{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=69|loc=in Mitchell}}\n\nWomen recruited into the WRANS were not permitted to serve at sea, but were able to fill most shore-based positions.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=74|loc=in Mitchell}} WRANS performed a variety of duties, including working as telegraphists, clerks, drivers, [[Steward's Department|stewards]], cooks, [[Sick

with the WRANS uniform air-dropped to her) would see the Japanese treat her as a member of the armed forces if she was captured.{{sfn|Christopherson|2010|p=76|loc=in Mitchell}}\n\nOver 3,000 women enlisted in the WRANS during World War II, with 2,671 active at the war's end: 10% of the overall RAN strength, but significantly fewer than the 18,000 each in the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air

The Punjab has diverse styles of [[music]], ranging from folk and Sufi to classical, notably the [[Patiala gharana]].\n\n\n==Classical music==\n*[[Patiala Gharana]]\n*[[Sham Chaurasia gharana]]\n*[[Punjab Gharana]]\n\n===Instruments===\nDuring the past century, Punjabi folk musicians used 87 instruments, 55 of which are still used today.<ref>Pande, p. 70</ref> It is notable that the instruments used today serve a function that exceeds musical necessity in that they are closely tied to Punjabi culture and heritage. The dhol, for example, continues to be popular because it is important to special proceedings such as weddings and sporting events. Additionally, the popularity of certain instruments encourages people to continue learning to play them; therefore, maintaining their relevance in Punjabi events. Terrorist events in during the late 1980s threatened the existence of Punjabi folk music and the instruments that accompanied this genre. With several notable artists being killed and major festivals being cancelled there was not a space for folk music to exist.<ref>Pande, p. 71</ref> The boom of technology also threatened folk music by creating a new genre of music known as Punjabi Pop, which mixed electronic and folk music. The following instruments are the most popular within Punjabi music. \n \nAlgoza:\nThe algoza \u201cconsists of two joined beak flutes, one for melody, the second for drone\u201d and the \u201cflutes are either tied together or may be held together loosely with the hands\u201d. A continuous flow of air is necessary as the player blows into the two flutes simultaneously.<ref>Pande, p. 74</ref>\n\n[[Dhol]]: \nResembles much of the construction of a drum. It is a two-sided drum of mango wood, 48&nbsp;cm long and 38&nbsp;cm wide and is played using two slightly curved sticks.<ref name=p79>Pande, p. 79</ref> It is thought to have a much more significant value to the artisans such as the blacksmiths or the cobblers. It is usually played during neutral occasions and mostly by only men.\n\nChimta:\nThe chimta are similar to tongs and consist of 122&nbsp;cm long iron strip that is bent in half and adorned with an iron ring set. The small metal discs called chaene are \u201cattached on the inner side of the tongs so as to strike against each other like small cymbals when the arms of the chimta are struck\u201d.<ref>Pande, p. 77</ref>\n\nDholki: \nThe dholki is a smaller, feminine version of the dhol.<ref name=p79/> It is played by women in marriages and religious gatherings. It is rarely decorated with tassels.\n\nKanjari:\nThis is a shallow one sided drum, round or sometimes octagonal, 18 to 28&nbsp;cm in diameter and set with rattling discs around the rim- in essence of a tambourine.<ref>Pande, p. 83</ref> It accompanies singing, dances and religious activities.\n\nKato:\nThis a stick with a squirrel (galad) on top. Attached to the head of the squirrel is a cord, which jerks its head up, \u201cproducing a sharp click\u201d.<ref>Pande, p. 81</ref> At the same time, bells attached to its tail jingles.\n\nDhad:\nThe Dhad has the hourglass shape of the damroo and but is slightly larger. The body of this instrument is made from mango, mulberry or sheesham wood and the heads are covered in goatskin held taut with cords. The fingers are used to tap and make sounds that can vary based on how tightly or loosely the strings are maintained.<ref>Pande, p. 78</ref>\n\n===Dances===\nDance traditions of Punjab represent a collection of folk art forms that have evolved significantly and changed in meaning throughout the centuries. After the Partition of 1947, Punjab was marked by a period state-building efforts that sought to establish a national identity, which was intimately tied to the revival, folklorization, and ritualization of many of Punjab's older dances. During this period, bhangra dance in particular became tokenized as the iconic emblem of the Punjab region as a whole, overshadowing other important and centuries-old folk dances of the region. Punjab's rich repertoire of folk dances include jhummar, sammi, luddi, dandas, nachar, and giddha.<ref>Dhillon, Iqbal Singh (ca. 1989). \u201cPunjab.\u201d In Folk Dances of the North, ed. Rajpal Singh and I.S. Dhillon. Patiala: North Zone Cultural Centre.</ref> There are prominent dances in Punjab, but are perhaps less familiar to a global audience. Jhummar is A widely established Punjabi dance, there was a decline in jhummar performances, through it was later revived as a conscious reaction to the over-commodified and over-sensationalized bhangra dance to invoke a more traditional notion of Punjab. The name jhummar stems from ghoomar, designated a performance done in a circular direction or group of individuals spinning. It is generally performed only be men, and the movement are generally \u201crelatively slow and gentle, and often considered rather \u201cfeminine\u201d when compared to other Punjabi dances. Dance movements are performed in unison.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year=2014|title='It's Our Culture': Dynamics of the Revival and Reemergence of Punjabi Jhummar|doi=10.1353/amu.2013.0025 |journal=Asian Music |volume=45|issue=1|pages=34}}.</ref> Musical accompaniment usually involves the dhol barrel drum. Summi is a simple female dominated dance traditionally performed by women in the Sandal Bar region of Punjab that has existed from at least the eighteenth century that was revived after the Partition of 1947.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year= 2012|title=Desperately Seeking Sammi: Re-inventing Women\u2019s Dance in Punjab|journal=Sikh Formations |volume=8|issue=2|pages= 127\u2013146|doi=10.1080/17448727.2012.702416}}</ref> Giddha is a dance of the Malwa, Southeast region of Punjab that has both expression in men and women's forms, and involves pairs of individuals dancing while others stand in a circle around them singing lyrical verses (bolis).\n\n==Devotional music==\n\n===Shabd Vani===\n{{anchor| shabd vani | shabad vani | shabdvani | shabadvani }}\n[[Shabda#Sikhism|Shabda]] in [[Sikhism]] is a term used for hymns within Sikh scriptures. Etymologically , the word \" shabad \" is derived from the Sanskrit word ''Shabad'' which means ''sound'' or ''word''. Preaching of [[Sikh Gurus]] is called ''vani'' or ''voice'' of Sikh gurus, which is set to music in various [[Sikh scriptures]] called ''grantha'' where chapters are organised by [[ragas]], with each chapter containing many ''shabads'' or hymns of that ''raga''. The first ''Shabad'' in [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is the [[Mool Mantar]]. Example of ''Shabad'' in other Sikh scriptures, include the hymn [[Deh Siva Var Mohe]] in [[ Dasam Granth]].  [[Gurmukhi]] script is used for the ''Shabad''. Singing of Shabd by ''Raagi'' (Sikh devotional singers) is called the ''Shabd Vani''.<ref name=punsa1>2001, Studies in Sikhism and Comparative Religion - Volume 20 - Page 100-110.</ref>\n\n===Sufi music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nSufi music includes the singing of Sufi poetry in several genres. Some of the poets whose compositions are often sung include [[Baba Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Waris Shah]], and [[Mian Muhammad Bakhsh]].\n\n== Folk music ==\n{{main|Folk music of Punjab}}\nFolk music of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] is the traditional music of Punjab produced using traditional musical instruments like [[Tumbi]], [[Algoze]], [[Dhadd]], [[Sarangi]], [[Chimta]] and more. There is a wide range of [[Folk music of Punjab#Folk songs|folk songs]] for every occasion from birth to death including marriage, festivals, fairs and religious ceremonies.\n\nFolk music is often perceived as the traditional music of Punjab and typically has communal authorship. This aspect of folk music has shifted with time but the older categories of folk begin with the dhadi genre, which does follow ideas of communal authorship. The folk dhadi genre emphasizes stories of heroism and love stories, as exemplified by the numerous ballads of the legendary romantic tales of Hir-Ranjha and Sahiba-Mirza. Folk music is also commonly used in various life-cycle events in the Punjab region. \u201cIn almost every wedding ceremony family members, friends, and professional folk musicians perform different sets of folk songs which use themes from a nostalgic past, but communicate themes of separation, joy, fear, and hope in the present.\u201d<ref name=j1>{{cite journal|author1=Myrvold, Kristina|year=2004|title=Wedding Ceremonies in Punjab|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|pages=155\u2013170|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/5_myrvold.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023327/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/5_myrvold.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lyrical content of many of these wedding songs have the paternal home depicted as a source of love and nurture, while the in-laws home is a source of tyranny and torture.<ref name=j2/> Folk music continues to be used as a modern tool and a way of locating identification.\n\n===Ritual and life-cycle songs===\nThe notion of the traditional or folk music remains a critical part of Punjab society because it aids in the preservation of long-established customs. Life-cycle songs mostly \u201ccoincide with ritual occasions and they often mark stages in a ceremony\u201d and can vary in topic ranging from birth to marriage.<ref name=j3/> For example, family members and friends sing these songs during wedding festivities, by doing so help protect the traditional rituals associated with each step of the marriage. ''Suhag'' or ''ghorian'', which are sung for the bride and groom respectively, typically give praise to God and ask for blessings from God. Women typically sing these songs in a choral fashion and may also focus on the ideal groom and bride. Both song genres celebrate the emotion of joy specifically surrounding the wedding process. The ghorian emotes feeling of \u201cpure joy and desire\u201d, while the suhag is a \u201cmixture of joy and grief\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Singh, Nahar|year=2011|title=Suhag and Ghorian: Elucidation of Culture through a Female Voice|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=49\u201373|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/2_Suhag.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193606/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/2_Suhag.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are also songs that are associated with each night of the wedding starting as far back as five nights before to spread turmeric paste on the bride and groom. By having these songs, Punjabi people continue to celebrate the traditional cultural practices and have \u201ctransformed and even\u2026revitalized\u201d the way marriages are celebrated.<ref name=j1/>\n\nWhile folk songs exist to commemorate important moments in one's life, they also \u201cserve as a repository of local culture, beliefs, social structures, and response to historical change\u201d because they reflect the current climate within local communities.<ref name=j2/> With the subject of these songs varying from praising God to simply discussing the qualms of an agrarian lifestyle, they provide greater insight into Punjabi daily life. While folks song are \u201cset in complex cultural context of a society\u201d that is consumed by a strict social system influenced by social and economic status, they reveal that these \u201cvillage people of all levels interact daily in a manner that demonstrates their mutual codependence\u201d.<ref name=j2>{{cite journal|author1=Singh, Nahar|author2=Gill, R.S.|year=2004|title=Punjabi Folk Songs|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=11|issue=2|pages=171\u201395|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/6_singh_gill.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041828/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/6_singh_gill.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of this, folk music serves as a way to further encourage this mixture that helps to break down social constructs.\n\n===Short verse forms and entertainment songs===\nThese include Tappa, Mahia, and Dhola.\n\n===Professional musicians and genres===\nProfessional performing communities in Punjab represent endogamous ethnic groups who generally occupy a lower-class status of service providers and are patronized by higher classes.<ref name=j3>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year=2011|title=Music and Musicians in Punjab|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=1\u201347|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/1_PunjabiMusicIntro.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022627/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/1_PunjabiMusicIntro.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> Generally, men dominant professional music production and are trained in the \u2018master-disciple\u2019 system. Professional musicians are occupational speciationalists who inherit their professions through their musician ancestors.

However, despite their contributions to the music world and performing sector of Punjab, they are poorly recognized by their neighbors and outsiders. mainstream Punjab classifies these people as the \u201cacrobats\u201d of the society. The Bazigar people have neither inclination nor the opportunity to remedy that situation. At present they are becoming more and more integrated into the mainstream society. Their performances consist of the display of a variety of physical feats- of strength, balance, agility, and courage. Performances were usually invited by big festivals and occasions. They would begin with the beating of the dhols in order to enhance excitement and call attention to the event.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year=2011|title=The Bazigar (Goaar) People and Their Performing Arts|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=217\u2013250|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/8_Bazigar_article.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195053/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/8_Bazigar_article.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDhadi: Refers to both a genre of Punjabi music and the performers who play it. It is a distinctly composed ensemble of ballad-singers. The folk dhadi genre is subject to three main poetic forms namely baint, sadd, and kali. It has four main aspects: discourse, poetry, singing and music. The concerts were usually held outside of villages on the banks of a pond or in some other open space under the dense shade of a few large tree, or else the religious-camps of the village. A distinctive feature of the folk dhadi's art has been a continuous and strict practice regimen. Usually these dhadis were completely illiterate or practically so. They would have to learn by hearing others, so their power of memory, would have to be very great. Their attire usually consisted of dazzling white, starched turbans with fan. The white color is a symbol of wisdom, learning and cleanliness.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Thuhi, Hardial|year=2011|title=The Folk Dhadi Genre|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=131\u2013167|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/5_DhadiArt.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030604/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/5_DhadiArt.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another ballad-style form of music is the tumba-algoza genre based in the regions of Malwa and Majha.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Thuhi, Hardial|year=2011|title=The Tumba-Algoza Ballad Tradition|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=169\u2013202|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/6_TheTumba.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001210/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/6_TheTumba.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Popular music==\n\n===Bhangra evolution from folk to pop===\n{{main|Bhangra (music)}}\n\nBhangra describes dance-oriented popular music with Punjabi rhythms. The name refers to one of the traditional and folkloric Punjabi dances. Thus in bhangra music the emphasis is usually on the music (i.e. rhythm for dancing) and less on the singer and the lyrics. Shift from folk instruments to pop started to happen since the 1980s, since then Bhangra dance music developed into a popular pop genre appreciated all over the globe, specially among the Punjabi diaspora.\n\n===Punjabi pop===\n\nPunjabi songs in recent years have entered mainstream Indian culture, as well as in the UK and U.S., and its inclusion in Bollywood songs. The rise in popularity in Punjabi music in London and in the suburb of Southall, which has a sizeable South Asian population, can be attributed to the diaspora of immigrants from both the east and west Punjab to the United Kingdom in the 1970s. By the 1980s, Punjabi music, many types of which were now being referred to as \u201cbhangra,\u201d started to be played in discos.<ref name=j4>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year= 2012|title=Migration Shaping Media: Punjabi Popular Music in Global Historical Perspective|journal= Popular Music and Society |volume=35|issue=3|pages= 333\u2013358|doi=10.1080/03007766.2011.600516}}</ref>\nMr-Punjab- Most Famous Punjabi Songs mp3 downlaod site 2020 in Punjab.

This inclusion of Punjabi music in popular culture has continued and become more salient today, as exemplified by UK-based Panjabi MC's \u201c[[Mundian to Bach Ke]]\u201d becoming a Top 40 hit in the United States, being listened to widely by non-Punjabis.<ref name=j4/> Furthermore, second generation Indian American youth in major American cities such as New York and New Jersey have adopted elements of Punjabi music into their nightlife. The music that is popular amongst this Indian American subculture incorporates both Western and Eastern influences. Urban sounds including hip hop, R&B, and reggae are mixed with the more traditional Indian genres of bhangra and Hindi film music.<ref name=j5>{{cite journal|author1=Maira, Sunaina|year= 1999|title=Identity Dub: The Paradoxes of an Indian American Subculture (New York Mix)|jstor=656528|journal= Cultural Anthropology |volume=14|issue=1|pages= 29\u201360|doi=10.1525/can.1999.14.1.29}}</ref>\n\nPunjabi music has also made its mark in mainstream Hindi cinema.

In the UK in particular, Punjabi music became intertwined with American and British popular music, as Punjabi youth connected their western experience with their cultural roots. It became an important medium through which Punjabi youth could navigate their unique identities as British Indians. The British press sporadically became aware of trends in Punjabi music,<ref>Banerji, Sabita, and Gerd Baumann.

The decade was marked by a musical style that contained consistent elements of traditional music including instruments such as the dhol, tumbi, and algoza. However, the 90s were the first time that elements from other genres such as reggae and disco/club type of instrumentals were incorporated in the music. This is seen as the decade that produced the birth of what is commonly referred to today as \u201cfusion\u201d Punjabi music.<ref name=j6/>\n\nOne prime example of a breakthrough artist that exemplified this new fusion style was Apache Indian. His song \u201cArranged Marriage,\u201d produced by British Indian Punjabi brothers Simon and Diamond and released on the album titled No Reservations (1993), combined a reggae lyrical style, traditional dhol elements, and a Punjabi background chorus.<ref>Taylor, Timothy.

They included Bally Sagoo, Sukshinder Shinda, and Jazzy B. Bally Sagoo became famous for his productions and remix. Shinda became renowned for his production ability and inclusion of vigorous dhol beats, while Jazzy B exemplified the influence hip-hop had in Punjabi music in his image and tough lyrics.\n\n====Global Punjabi music industry====\nDiaspora music has been spread back to India through media, including radio, cassettes and the TV channels MTV and ETC Panjabi.<ref name=b1/> The 2000s Diaspora music was a reflection of the evolution that took place in Punjabi music in the 1990s. Artists began to develop and build upon the styles and foundations that were previously established as popular and successful musical styles abroad.\n\nWith the mixture of styles of both Punjabi and Western culture, there became a fusion in both the music and the identity formation of those living abroad. Because samples of famous Hindi and Punjabi music have been included in the club scene, youth are able to \u201cinculcate an Indian identity.\u201d<ref name=j5/> Youth of the Diaspora can use these fusions to help establish their hybrid identities. These identities could include urban American culture or British culture alongside Indian culture. While this new identity has been created by the Diaspora youth the same ideas of identity do not hold for older generations, causing divides between the two.\n\nThe artists of this time period and the music they produced had a large effect on the popularity and transformation of Punjabi music into a type of genre that became an enjoyable and popular component of nightlife for South Asians.<ref name=j5/> Dr. Zeus for example produced club-friendly instrumentals and collaborated with established Punjabi artists to take the fusion sound to a higher and more sophisticated level. His song \u201cKangna\u201d reflects a fusion between club, hip-hop, and Punjabi musical styles. While Punjabi MC became famous in the late 1990s for his hit \u201cMundian tho Bachke Rahin,\u201d he has continued to produce music that reflects a similar style and is extremely popular with the first and second generation South Asian population.<ref name=j5/> These styles continue to progress into the present decade.\n\nBy 2016, Punjabi music grew by 80% over two to three years in Canada,{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=These numbers don't make sense}} where Punjabi folk hop artists, such as Jaz Dhami, credit Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] for his contribution for \"promoting Indian culture and Punjabi music ... leader who understands the importance of Punjabi music in his country's music space.\"<ref name=just1>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3974492/Oye-Canada-Punjabi-music-sees-rise-popularity-maple-country-PM-Trudeau-promotes-Indian-culture.html#ixzz586TCmF4U Oye Canada!

The Punjab has diverse styles of [[music]], ranging from folk and Sufi to classical, notably the [[Patiala gharana]].\n\n\n==Classical music==\n*[[Patiala Gharana]]\n*[[Sham Chaurasia gharana]]\n*[[Punjab Gharana]]\n\n===Instruments===\nDuring the past century, Punjabi folk musicians used 87 instruments, 55 of which are still used today.<ref>Pande, p. 70</ref> It is notable that the instruments used today serve a function that exceeds musical necessity in that they are closely tied to Punjabi culture and heritage. The dhol, for example, continues to be popular because it is important to special proceedings such as weddings and sporting events. Additionally, the popularity of certain instruments encourages people to continue learning to play them; therefore, maintaining their relevance in Punjabi events. Terrorist events in during the late 1980s threatened the existence of Punjabi folk music and the instruments that accompanied this genre. With several notable artists being killed and major festivals being cancelled there was not a space for folk music to exist.<ref>Pande, p. 71</ref> The boom of technology also threatened folk music by creating a new genre of music known as Punjabi Pop, which mixed electronic and folk music. The following instruments are the most popular within Punjabi music. \n \nAlgoza:\nThe algoza \u201cconsists of two joined beak flutes, one for melody, the second for drone\u201d and the \u201cflutes are either tied together or may be held together loosely with the hands\u201d. A continuous flow of air is necessary as the player blows into the two flutes simultaneously.<ref>Pande, p. 74</ref>\n\n[[Dhol]]: \nResembles much of the construction of a drum. It is a two-sided drum of mango wood, 48&nbsp;cm long and 38&nbsp;cm wide and is played using two slightly curved sticks.<ref name=p79>Pande, p. 79</ref> It is thought to have a much more significant value to the artisans such as the blacksmiths or the cobblers. It is usually played during neutral occasions and mostly by only men.\n\nChimta:\nThe chimta are similar to tongs and consist of 122&nbsp;cm long iron strip that is bent in half and adorned with an iron ring set. The small metal discs called chaene are \u201cattached on the inner side of the tongs so as to strike against each other like small cymbals when the arms of the chimta are struck\u201d.<ref>Pande, p. 77</ref>\n\nDholki: \nThe dholki is a smaller, feminine version of the dhol.<ref name=p79/> It is played by women in marriages and religious gatherings. It is rarely decorated with tassels.\n\nKanjari:\nThis is a shallow one sided drum, round or sometimes octagonal, 18 to 28&nbsp;cm in diameter and set with rattling discs around the rim- in essence of a tambourine.<ref>Pande, p. 83</ref> It accompanies singing, dances and religious activities.\n\nKato:\nThis a stick with a squirrel (galad) on top. Attached to the head of the squirrel is a cord, which jerks its head up, \u201cproducing a sharp click\u201d.<ref>Pande, p. 81</ref> At the same time, bells attached to its tail jingles.\n\nDhad:\nThe Dhad has the hourglass shape of the damroo and but is slightly larger. The body of this instrument is made from mango, mulberry or sheesham wood and the heads are covered in goatskin held taut with cords. The fingers are used to tap and make sounds that can vary based on how tightly or loosely the strings are maintained.<ref>Pande, p. 78</ref>\n\n===Dances===\nDance traditions of Punjab represent a collection of folk art forms that have evolved significantly and changed in meaning throughout the centuries. After the Partition of 1947, Punjab was marked by a period state-building efforts that sought to establish a national identity, which was intimately tied to the revival, folklorization, and ritualization of many of Punjab's older dances. During this period, bhangra dance in particular became tokenized as the iconic emblem of the Punjab region as a whole, overshadowing other important and centuries-old folk dances of the region. Punjab's rich repertoire of folk dances include jhummar, sammi, luddi, dandas, nachar, and giddha.<ref>Dhillon, Iqbal Singh (ca. 1989). \u201cPunjab.\u201d In Folk Dances of the North, ed. Rajpal Singh and I.S. Dhillon. Patiala: North Zone Cultural Centre.</ref> There are prominent dances in Punjab, but are perhaps less familiar to a global audience. Jhummar is A widely established Punjabi dance, there was a decline in jhummar performances, through it was later revived as a conscious reaction to the over-commodified and over-sensationalized bhangra dance to invoke a more traditional notion of Punjab. The name jhummar stems from ghoomar, designated a performance done in a circular direction or group of individuals spinning. It is generally performed only be men, and the movement are generally \u201crelatively slow and gentle, and often considered rather \u201cfeminine\u201d when compared to other Punjabi dances. Dance movements are performed in unison.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year=2014|title='It's Our Culture': Dynamics of the Revival and Reemergence of Punjabi Jhummar|doi=10.1353/amu.2013.0025 |journal=Asian Music |volume=45|issue=1|pages=34}}.</ref> Musical accompaniment usually involves the dhol barrel drum.

Etymologically , the word \" shabad \" is derived from the Sanskrit word ''Shabad'' which means ''sound'' or ''word''. Preaching of [[Sikh Gurus]] is called ''vani'' or ''voice'' of Sikh gurus, which is set to music in various [[Sikh scriptures]] called ''grantha'' where chapters are organised by [[ragas]], with each chapter containing many ''shabads'' or hymns of that ''raga''. The first ''Shabad'' in [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is the [[Mool Mantar]]. Example of ''Shabad'' in other Sikh scriptures, include the hymn [[Deh Siva Var Mohe]] in [[ Dasam Granth]].  [[Gurmukhi]] script is used for the ''Shabad''. Singing of Shabd by ''Raagi'' (Sikh devotional singers) is called the ''Shabd Vani''.<ref name=punsa1>2001, Studies in Sikhism and Comparative Religion - Volume 20 - Page 100-110.</ref>\n\n===Sufi music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nSufi music includes the singing of Sufi poetry in several genres. Some of the poets whose compositions are often sung include [[Baba Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Waris Shah]], and [[Mian Muhammad Bakhsh]].\n\n== Folk music ==\n{{main|Folk music of Punjab}}\nFolk music of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] is the traditional music of Punjab produced using traditional musical instruments like [[Tumbi]], [[Algoze]], [[Dhadd]], [[Sarangi]], [[Chimta]] and more. There is a wide range of [[Folk music of Punjab#Folk songs|folk songs]] for every occasion from birth to death including marriage, festivals, fairs and religious ceremonies.\n\nFolk music is often perceived as the traditional music of Punjab and typically has communal authorship. This aspect of folk music has shifted with time but the older categories of folk begin with the dhadi genre, which does follow ideas of communal authorship. The folk dhadi genre emphasizes stories of heroism and love stories, as exemplified by the numerous ballads of the legendary romantic tales of Hir-Ranjha and Sahiba-Mirza. Folk music is also commonly used in various life-cycle events in the Punjab region. \u201cIn almost every wedding ceremony family members, friends, and professional folk musicians perform different sets of folk songs which use themes from a nostalgic past, but communicate themes of separation, joy, fear, and hope in the present.\u201d<ref name=j1>{{cite journal|author1=Myrvold, Kristina|year=2004|title=Wedding Ceremonies in Punjab|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|pages=155\u2013170|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/5_myrvold.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023327/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/5_myrvold.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> The lyrical content of many of these wedding songs have the paternal home depicted as a source of love and nurture, while the in-laws home is a source of tyranny and torture.<ref name=j2/> Folk music continues to be used as a modern tool and a way of locating identification.\n\n===Ritual and life-cycle songs===\nThe notion of the traditional or folk music remains a critical part of Punjab society because it aids in the preservation of long-established customs. Life-cycle songs mostly \u201ccoincide with ritual occasions and they often mark stages in a ceremony\u201d and can vary in topic ranging from birth to marriage.<ref name=j3/> For example, family members and friends sing these songs during wedding festivities, by doing so help protect the traditional rituals associated with each step of the marriage. ''Suhag'' or ''ghorian'', which are sung for the bride and groom respectively, typically give praise to God and ask for blessings from God. Women typically sing these songs in a choral fashion and may also focus on the ideal groom and bride. Both song genres celebrate the emotion of joy specifically surrounding the wedding process. The ghorian emotes feeling of \u201cpure joy and desire\u201d, while the suhag is a \u201cmixture of joy and grief\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Singh, Nahar|year=2011|title=Suhag and Ghorian: Elucidation of Culture through a Female Voice|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=49\u201373|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/2_Suhag.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193606/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/2_Suhag.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are also songs that are associated with each night of the wedding starting as far back as five nights before to spread turmeric paste on the bride and groom. By having these songs, Punjabi people continue to celebrate the traditional cultural practices and have \u201ctransformed and even\u2026revitalized\u201d the way marriages are celebrated.<ref name=j1/>\n\nWhile folk songs exist to commemorate important moments in one's life, they also \u201cserve as a repository of local culture, beliefs, social structures, and response to historical change\u201d because they reflect the current climate within local communities.<ref name=j2/> With the subject of these songs varying from praising God to simply discussing the qualms of an agrarian lifestyle, they provide greater insight into Punjabi daily life. While folks song are \u201cset in complex cultural context of a society\u201d that is consumed by a strict social system influenced by social and economic status, they reveal that these \u201cvillage people of all levels interact daily in a manner that demonstrates their mutual codependence\u201d.<ref name=j2>{{cite journal|author1=Singh, Nahar|author2=Gill, R.S.|year=2004|title=Punjabi Folk Songs|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=11|issue=2|pages=171\u201395|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/6_singh_gill.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041828/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal_11_2/6_singh_gill.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Because of this, folk music serves as a way to further encourage this mixture that helps to break down social constructs.\n\n===Short verse forms and entertainment songs===\nThese include Tappa, Mahia, and Dhola.\n\n===Professional musicians and genres===\nProfessional performing communities in Punjab represent endogamous ethnic groups who generally occupy a lower-class status of service providers and are patronized by higher classes.<ref name=j3>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year=2011|title=Music and Musicians in Punjab|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=1\u201347|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/1_PunjabiMusicIntro.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924022627/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/1_PunjabiMusicIntro.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> Generally, men dominant professional music production and are trained in the \u2018master-disciple\u2019 system.

However, despite their contributions to the music world and performing sector of Punjab, they are poorly recognized by their neighbors and outsiders. mainstream Punjab classifies these people as the \u201cacrobats\u201d of the society. The Bazigar people have neither inclination nor the opportunity to remedy that situation. At present they are becoming more and more integrated into the mainstream society. Their performances consist of the display of a variety of physical feats- of strength, balance, agility, and courage. Performances were usually invited by big festivals and occasions. They would begin with the beating of the dhols in order to enhance excitement and call attention to the event.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year=2011|title=The Bazigar (Goaar) People and Their Performing Arts|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=217\u2013250|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/8_Bazigar_article.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304195053/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/8_Bazigar_article.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDhadi: Refers to both a genre of Punjabi music and the performers who play it. It is a distinctly composed ensemble of ballad-singers. The folk dhadi genre is subject to three main poetic forms namely baint, sadd, and kali. It has four main aspects: discourse, poetry, singing and music. The concerts were usually held outside of villages on the banks of a pond or in some other open space under the dense shade of a few large tree, or else the religious-camps of the village. A distinctive feature of the folk dhadi's art has been a continuous and strict practice regimen. Usually these dhadis were completely illiterate or practically so. They would have to learn by hearing others, so their power of memory, would have to be very great. Their attire usually consisted of dazzling white, starched turbans with fan. The white color is a symbol of wisdom, learning and cleanliness.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Thuhi, Hardial|year=2011|title=The Folk Dhadi Genre|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=131\u2013167|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/5_DhadiArt.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030604/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/5_DhadiArt.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> Another ballad-style form of music is the tumba-algoza genre based in the regions of Malwa and Majha.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Thuhi, Hardial|year=2011|title=The Tumba-Algoza Ballad Tradition|journal=Journal of Punjab Studies|volume=18|issue=1/2|pages=169\u2013202|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/6_TheTumba.pdf|access-date=2014-12-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001210/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journal/v18_1-2/articles/6_TheTumba.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Popular music==\n\n===Bhangra evolution from folk to pop===\n{{main|Bhangra (music)}}\n\nBhangra describes dance-oriented popular music with Punjabi rhythms. The name refers to one of the traditional and folkloric Punjabi dances. Thus in bhangra music the emphasis is usually on the music (i.e. rhythm for dancing) and less on the singer and the lyrics. Shift from folk instruments to pop started to happen since the 1980s, since then Bhangra dance music developed into a popular pop genre appreciated all over the globe, specially among the Punjabi diaspora.\n\n===Punjabi pop===\n\nPunjabi songs in recent years have entered mainstream Indian culture, as well as in the UK and U.S., and its inclusion in Bollywood songs. The rise in popularity in Punjabi music in London and in the suburb of Southall, which has a sizeable South Asian population, can be attributed to the diaspora of immigrants from both the east and west Punjab to the United Kingdom in the 1970s. By the 1980s, Punjabi music, many types of which were now being referred to as \u201cbhangra,\u201d started to be played in discos.<ref name=j4>{{cite journal|author1=Schreffler, Gibb|year= 2012|title=Migration Shaping Media: Punjabi Popular Music in Global Historical Perspective|journal= Popular Music and Society |volume=35|issue=3|pages= 333\u2013358|doi=10.1080/03007766.2011.600516}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the UK, Punjabi music has also gained popularity in the United States. This inclusion of Punjabi music in popular culture has continued and become more salient today, as exemplified by UK-based Panjabi MC's \u201c[[Mundian to Bach Ke]]\u201d becoming a Top 40 hit in the United States, being listened to widely by non-Punjabis.<ref name=j4/> Furthermore, second generation Indian American youth in major American cities such as New York and New Jersey have adopted elements of Punjabi music into their nightlife. The music that is popular amongst this Indian American subculture incorporates both Western and Eastern influences. Urban sounds including hip hop, R&B, and reggae are mixed with the more traditional Indian genres of bhangra and Hindi film music.<ref name=j5>{{cite journal|author1=Maira, Sunaina|year= 1999|title=Identity Dub: The Paradoxes of an Indian American Subculture (New York Mix)|jstor=656528|journal= Cultural Anthropology |volume=14|issue=1|pages= 29\u201360|doi=10.1525/can.1999.14.1.29}}</ref>\n\nPunjabi music has also made its mark in mainstream Hindi cinema.

In the UK in particular, Punjabi music became intertwined with American and British popular music, as Punjabi youth connected their western experience with their cultural roots. It became an important medium through which Punjabi youth could navigate their unique identities as British Indians. The British press sporadically became aware of trends in Punjabi music,<ref>Banerji, Sabita, and Gerd Baumann.

The decade was marked by a musical style that contained consistent elements of traditional music including instruments such as the dhol, tumbi, and algoza. However, the 90s were the first time that elements from other genres such as reggae and disco/club type of instrumentals were incorporated in the music. This is seen as the decade that produced the birth of what is commonly referred to today as \u201cfusion\u201d Punjabi music.<ref name=j6/>\n\nOne prime example of a breakthrough artist that exemplified this new fusion style was Apache Indian. His song \u201cArranged Marriage,\u201d produced by British Indian Punjabi brothers Simon and Diamond and released on the album titled No Reservations (1993), combined a reggae lyrical style, traditional dhol elements, and a Punjabi background chorus.<ref>Taylor, Timothy.

New York; London: Routledge.</ref> Many more prominent Punjabi artists and producers broke through into mainstream Punjabi music during this time. They included Bally Sagoo, Sukshinder Shinda, and Jazzy B. Bally Sagoo became famous for his productions and remix. Shinda became renowned for his production ability and inclusion of vigorous dhol beats, while Jazzy B exemplified the influence hip-hop had in Punjabi music in his image and tough lyrics.\n\n====Global Punjabi music industry====\nDiaspora music has been spread back to India through media, including radio, cassettes and the TV channels MTV and ETC Panjabi.<ref name=b1/> The 2000s Diaspora music was a reflection of the evolution that took place in Punjabi music in the 1990s. Artists began to develop and build upon the styles and foundations that were previously established as popular and successful musical styles abroad.\n\nWith the mixture of styles of both Punjabi and Western culture, there became a fusion in both the music and the identity formation of those living abroad. Because samples of famous Hindi and Punjabi music have been included in the club scene, youth are able to \u201cinculcate an Indian identity.\u201d<ref name=j5/> Youth of the Diaspora can use these fusions to help establish their hybrid identities. These identities could include urban American culture or British culture alongside Indian culture. While this new identity has been created by the Diaspora youth the same ideas of identity do not hold for older generations, causing divides between the two.\n\nThe artists of this time period and the music they produced had a large effect on the popularity and transformation of Punjabi music into a type of genre that became an enjoyable and popular component of nightlife for South Asians.<ref name=j5/> Dr. Zeus for example produced club-friendly instrumentals and collaborated with established Punjabi artists to take the fusion sound to a higher and more sophisticated level. His song \u201cKangna\u201d reflects a fusion between club, hip-hop, and Punjabi musical styles. While Punjabi MC became famous in the late 1990s for his hit \u201cMundian tho Bachke Rahin,\u201d he has continued to produce music that reflects a similar style and is extremely popular with the first and second generation South Asian population.<ref name=j5/> These styles continue to progress into the present decade.\n\nBy 2016, Punjabi music grew by 80% over two to three years in Canada,{{clarify|date=April 2018|reason=These numbers don't make sense}} where Punjabi folk hop artists, such as Jaz Dhami, credit Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] for his contribution for \"promoting Indian culture and Punjabi music ... leader who understands the importance of Punjabi music in his country's music space.\"<ref name=just1>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-3974492/Oye-Canada-Punjabi-music-sees-rise-popularity-maple-country-PM-Trudeau-promotes-Indian-culture.html#ixzz586TCmF4U Oye Canada!

Mercer, the son of Hugh Tenant Weedon Mercer and his wife Louisa Griffin (daughter of [[Cyrus Griffin]]), was born in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]], to a wealthy and well-known family. His grandfather and namesake [[Hugh Mercer]] of [[Pennsylvania]] had been a general under [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Mercer attended [[West Point]] in 1824. He was expelled for participating in the [[Eggnog Riot]] in 1826. But following a pardon by President [[John Quincy Adams]], Mercer was permitted to graduate in 1828 (3rd out of 33).\n\nMercer was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|US Artillery]]. He spent much of his time serving in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and was an aide to Maj. Gen. [[Winfield Scott]]. Mercer was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] of artillery in October 1834.\n\nIn April 1835, he resigned his commission and settled in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] where he married a local woman. While Mercer worked as a bank cashier, he served as an artillery officer in the [[Georgia Militia]]. He started building the [[Italianate]]-style [[Mercer House (Savannah, Georgia)|Mercer House]] on Bull Street at the southwest end of [[Squares of Savannah, Georgia|Monterey Square]], in Savannah. However the Civil War interrupted its construction and no Mercer ever lived there.\n\n==Civil War==\nIn 1861, he enlisted in the [[Confederate army]], and was commissioned as the [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the [[1st Georgia Infantry]]. He was promoted to brigadier general by the end of October. He served as commander of the District of Georgia. In August 1862, he played a major role in impressing the first group of slaves and free blacks into service for the Confederacy. By November, however, he lost his authority to impress workers, and depended on Gov. [[Joseph E. Brown]] and local sheriffs to provide slaves to join the Confederate effort. At the beginning of the [[Atlanta Campaign]], he left Savannah and took command of a brigade in the [[Army of Tennessee]].\n\nMercer fought at [[Dalton, Georgia|Dalton]], [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] and [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]] (where his son was wounded). Following the [[Battle of Atlanta]] in 1864, he became ill and was relieved of command. He was sent home to Savannah where he served under Lt. Gen. [[William J. Hardee]].

However, with failing health, Mercer traveled to the spa resort in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany for treatment in 1872. He died there in 1877. Mercer's body was returned to Savannah.

Recall spokesperson Jennifer Heighton says interruptions began at the [[Maple Ridge Home Show]] where people with \"Marc Dalton observer\" name tags would argue and scare off potential signers from their booth. Heighton further claims observers would stand close to canvassers and pretend to be part of the conversation. Claims of harassment also took place at Maple Ridge's downtown Haney Farmer's Market and other City locations where they would discourage the public from signing the petition. Heighton and the group called for an investigation by [[Elections BC|Elections B.C.]] regarding the matter: \u201cRegardless of the Maple Ridge recall withdrawal, it is critically important that the legislation be respected and the right of democratic dissent be upheld. That\u2019s why we want Elections B.C. to fully investigate this situation.\u201d Dalton defended the use of observers and scrutineers claiming they are not mentioned in the recall act, there\u2019s nothing that prohibits them. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nHe holds degrees from [[Simon Fraser University]], specifically a BA in French and MA in Translation Studies with an emphasis on xenolinguistics.

I personally have an uncle in a care home who I love dearly who has contracted coronavirus,\" [[New Democratic Party|NDP]] MP [[Scott Duvall]], party critic for Senior's policy has called on Dalton to issue a public apology. \"I think it's actually disgusting.

Organizer Yvonne Hale said regarding the representatives run, \u201cI think that goes to show that he\u2019s [Dalton] more focused on himself than his constituents.\" The call to remove Dalton from office ended up stalling following allegations of interference from his supporters and the [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C. Liberal Party]]. Recall spokesperson Jennifer Heighton says interruptions began at the [[Maple Ridge Home Show]] where people with \"Marc Dalton observer\" name tags would argue and scare off potential signers from their booth. Heighton further claims observers would stand close to canvassers and pretend to be part of the conversation. Claims of harassment also took place at Maple Ridge's downtown Haney Farmer's Market and other City locations where they would discourage the public from signing the petition. Heighton and the group called for an investigation by [[Elections BC|Elections B.C.]] regarding the matter: \u201cRegardless of the Maple Ridge recall withdrawal, it is critically important that the legislation be respected and the right of democratic dissent be upheld. That\u2019s why we want Elections B.C. to fully investigate this situation.\u201d Dalton defended the use of observers and scrutineers claiming they are not mentioned in the recall act, there\u2019s nothing that prohibits them. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nHe holds degrees from [[Simon Fraser University]], specifically a BA in French and MA in Translation Studies with an emphasis on xenolinguistics.
