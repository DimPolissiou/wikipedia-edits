Ministers and high-level government delegations of all GEF member countries take part in the meetings. The Assembly combines plenary meetings and high-level panels, exhibits, side events and GEF project site visits. Prominent environmentalists, parliamentarians, business leaders, scientists, and NGO leaders discuss global environmental challenges within the context of sustainable development and other international development goals.\n* The '''GEF Council''' is the main governing body of the GEF. It comprises 32 members appointed by constituencies of GEF member countries (14 from developed countries, 16 from developing countries and 2 from economies in transition). Council Members - List of Council Members and Alternates rotate every three years or until the constituency appoints a new Member. The Council, which meets twice annually, develops, adopts and evaluates the operational policies and programs for GEF-financed activities. It also reviews and approves the work program (projects submitted for approval), making decisions by consensus.\n* The '''GEF Secretariat''' is based in Washington, D.C. and reports directly to the GEF Council and Assembly, ensuring that their decisions are translated into effective actions. The secretariat coordinates the formulation of projects included in the work programs, oversees its implementation, and makes certain that operational strategy and policies are followed. The CEO and Chairperson, Naoko Ishii heads the Secretariat.\n* The '''GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP)''' provides the GEF with scientific and technical advice on policies, operational strategies, programs and projects. The Panel consists of six members, who are internationally recognized experts in the GEF's key areas of work. They are supported by a global network of experts and institutions. In addition, the STAP interacts with other relevant scientific and technical bodies, particularly with the subsidiary bodies of the environmental conventions.\n* The '''GEF Independent Evaluation Office (GEF IEO)''' reports directly to the Council. It is headed by a Director, appointed by the Council, who coordinates a team of specialized evaluators. It works with the Secretariat and the GEF Agencies to share lessons learned and best practices. The Office undertakes independent evaluations of GEF impact and effectiveness. These are typically on focal areas, institutional issues or cross-cutting themes.\n* '''GEF Agencies''' are the operational arm of the GEF. They work closely with project proponents \u2014 government agencies, civil society organizations and other stakeholders \u2014 to design, develop and implement GEF-funded projects and programs. The GEF works with 18 agencies.\n# [[United Nations Development Programme]]\n# [[UN Environment Program|United Nations Environment Programme]]\n# [[World Bank]]\n# [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]\n# [[Inter-American Development Bank]]\n# [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]\n# [[Asian Development Bank]]\n# [[African Development Bank]]\n# [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]\n# [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]]\n# [[World Wildlife Fund US|World Wildlife Fund - US]]\n# [[Conservation International]]\n# [[West African Development Bank|West African Development Bank (BOAD)]]\n# [[Brazilian Biodiversity Fund]] (FUNBIO)\n# [[Foreign Economic Cooperation Office, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China]] (FECO) \n# [[Development Bank of Southern Africa|Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA)]]\n# [[Development Bank of Latin America|Development Bank of Latin America (CAF)]]\n# [[International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe Global Environment Facility was established in October 1992 as a $1 billion pilot program in the World Bank to assist in the protection of the global environment and to promote environmental sustainable development. The GEF would provide new and additional grants and concessional funding to cover the \"incremental\" or additional costs associated with transforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits.\n \nThe United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Program, and the World Bank were the three initial partners implementing GEF projects.\n\nIn 1992, at the [[Rio Earth Summit]], the GEF was restructured and moved out of the World Bank system to become a permanent, separate institution. The decision to make the GEF an independent organization enhanced the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process and in implementation of the projects. Since 1994, however, the World Bank has served as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and provided administrative services.\n \nAs part of the restructuring, the GEF was entrusted to become the financial mechanism for both the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. In partnership with the Montreal Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Ozone Layer Depleting Substances, the GEF started funding projects that enable the Russian Federation and nations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals.\n\nIn 1998, the GEF Council decided to expand beyond the initial three Implementing Agencies, including to the International Finance Corporation, to broaden its ability to enable innovating financing mechanisms and better leverage private sector investment.<ref>{{cite web|title=EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXECUTING AGENCIES|url=https://www.thegef.org/sites/default/files/council-meeting-documents/GEF.C.12.10_5.pdf|website=Global Environment Facility|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> The GEF subsequently was also selected to serve as financial mechanism for three more international conventions: The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (2001), the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (2003), and the [[Minamata Convention on Mercury]] (2013).\n\n== Areas of work ==\nThe GEF work focuses on six main areas, including biodiversity, climate change (mitigation and adaptation), chemicals, international waters, land degradation, sustainable forest management/REDD+.\n\n'''[[Biodiversity]]''': Biodiversity is under heavy threat. Reducing and preventing further [[biodiversity loss]] are considered among the most critical challenges to humankind. Of all the problems the world faces in managing \u201cglobal goods,\u201d only the loss of biodiversity is irreversible. The GEF supports projects that address the key drivers of biodiversity loss which focus on the highest leveraging opportunities to achieve sustainable biodiversity conservation.\n\n'''[[Climate change]]''': Climate change from human-induced emissions of heat-trapping [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) is a critical global issue, requiring substantial action. These actions include investment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and adaptation to climate changes including variability. The early impacts of climate change have already appeared, and scientists believe that further impacts are inevitable. Many of the most serious and negative impacts of climate change will be disproportionately borne by the poorest people in developing countries. The GEF supports projects in developing countries .\n* [[Climate change mitigation]]: Reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions in the areas of renewable energy; energy efficiency; sustainable transport; and management of [[land use, land-use change, and forestry]].\n* [[Climate change adaptation]]: Aiming at developing countries to become climate-resilient by promoting immediate and longer-term adaptation measures in development policies, plans, programs, projects, and actions.\n\n'''Chemicals''': [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) are pesticides, industrial chemicals, or unwanted by-products of industrial processes that have been used for decades but have more recently been found to share a number of disturbing characteristics, including:\n* Persistence \u2014 they resist degradation in air, water, and sediments;\n* Bio-accumulation \u2014 they accumulate in living tissues at concentrations higher than those in the surrounding environment;  \n* Long-range transport \u2014 they can travel great distances from the source of release through air, water, and migratory animals, often contaminating areas thousands of kilometers away from any known source.\n\nThe GEF supports projects in eliminating the production and use of specific POPs, taking measures to ensure that POPs wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner, identifying the sources and reducing releases of POPs byproducts.\n\n'''[[Circular Economy]]''': GEF has issued a \"background note\" and hosted events on the [[circular economy]], which shifts from a take-make-waste economy to one that seeks to use no [[non-renewable]] source materials and produce [[zero waste]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assembly.thegef.org/publications/gef-assembly-background-note-circular-economy|title=GEF Assembly Background Note: Circular Economy|date=June 20, 2018|website=Global Environment Facility}}</ref> GEF is a member of the [[Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy]] (PACE), for which GEF's CEO, Naoko Ishii, is the co-chair of the Board of Directors along with [[Frans van Houten]] of [[Royal Philips]] and a representative of the [[UNEP]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|title=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|website=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/projects/circular-economy/|title=Circular Economy|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref>\n\n'''[[International waters]]''': Diversions of water for irrigation, bulk supply, and potable use, together with the pollution of common water bodies are creating cross-border tensions. These tensions also persist across the oceans, with three-quarters of fish stocks being overfished, fished at their maximum, or in a depleted state. The GEF supports projects in helping countries work together to overcome these tensions in large water systems and to collectively manage their transboundary surface water basins, groundwater basins, and coastal and marine systems in order to share the benefits from them.\n\n'''[[Land degradation]]''': Land degradation is a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and society's ability to function. Because of the interconnectivity between ecosystems across scales, land degradation triggers destructive processes that can have cascading effects across the entire biosphere.  Loss of biomass through vegetation clearance and increased soil erosion produces greenhouse gases that contribute global warming and climate change. The GEF supports projects in reversing and preventing desertification/land degradation and in mitigating the effects of drought in affected areas in order to support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.\n\n'''[[Sustainable forest management]] / [[REDD]]+''': [[Forest]]s cover almost one-third of the world's land area. They have a unique potential to produce multiple global environmental benefits such as [[biodiversity]] conservation, [[carbon sequestration]], and protection against [[desertification]]. Sustainably managed forests can enhance the provision of wood and [[non-timber forest product]]s for about 1.6 billion people depending on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems are also expected to play a key role in helping people in developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. The GEF supports projects in forest conservation (primarily [[protected area]]s and buffer zones), sustainable use of forests (forest production landscapes, sustainable forest management), and addressing forests and trees in the wider landscape.\n\n'''[[Ozone depletion]]''': Increased [[UV-B]] radiation reaching the Earth would pose risks to human health and the environment. In response, countries negotiated and adopted the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] in 1985, and the [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in 1987. The GEF supports projects in developing countries and countries with economies in transition (CEITs) that are not eligible for funding under the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol, to implement activities to phase out ozone depleting substances (ODS) in a manner consistent with these countries\u2019 obligations under the Montreal Protocol.\n\nBesides these seven areas, the GEF has also worked on other programs including:\n* Capacity development\n* Country support programme\n* [[Debt-for-nature swap]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/debt-for-nature-swaps.html|title=Debt for Nature Swaps|website=UNDP}}</ref>\n* Gender Mainstreaming\n* Results and learning\n* Earth fund and [[public-private partnerships]]\n* Small grants programme<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgp.undp.org|title=Welcome to The GEF Small Grants Programme|website=www.sgp.undp.org}}</ref>\n* Small Island Developing States\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Climate Investment Funds]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thegef.org GEF official website]\n* [http://www.iwlearn.net GEF International Waters Resource Center]\n* [http://www.newgreenorder.info Independent academic research-based critiques of the GEF]\n* [http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/global-environment-facility-gef Global Environment Facility Profile on database of market governance mechanisms]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Conservation organizations]]\n[[Category:International environmental organizations]]\n[[Category:Environmental agencies]]\n[[Category:Intergovernmental environmental organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox organization\n|logo = Global Environment Facility Logo.jpg\n|logo_size = 125px\n|key_people = [[Naoko Ishii]], CEO and Chairperson\n|location = [[Washington, District of Columbia]], [[United States|United States of America]]\n|area_served = Worldwide\n|type = [[Foundation (nonprofit)|Fund]]\n|focus = [[Natural environment|Environment]]\n|homepage = {{Official website|http://www.thegef.org}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Global Environment Facility (GEF)''' was established on the eve of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to help tackle our planet\u2019s most pressing environmental problems.

The Council, which meets twice annually, develops, adopts and evaluates the operational policies and programs for GEF-financed activities. It also reviews and approves the work program (projects submitted for approval), making decisions by consensus.\n* The '''GEF Secretariat''' is based in Washington, D.C. and reports directly to the GEF Council and Assembly, ensuring that their decisions are translated into effective actions. The secretariat coordinates the formulation of projects included in the work programs, oversees its implementation, and makes certain that operational strategy and policies are followed. The CEO and Chairperson, Naoko Ishii heads the Secretariat.\n* The '''GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP)''' provides the GEF with scientific and technical advice on policies, operational strategies, programs and projects. The Panel consists of six members, who are internationally recognized experts in the GEF\u2019s key areas of work. They are supported by a global network of experts and institutions. In addition, the STAP interacts with other relevant scientific and technical bodies, particularly with the subsidiary bodies of the environmental conventions.\n* The '''GEF Independent Evaluation Office (GEF IEO)''' reports directly to the Council. It is headed by a Director, appointed by the Council, who coordinates a team of specialized evaluators. It works with the Secretariat and the GEF Agencies to share lessons learned and best practices. The Office undertakes independent evaluations of GEF impact and effectiveness. These are typically on focal areas, institutional issues or cross-cutting themes.\n* '''GEF Agencies''' are the operational arm of the GEF. They work closely with project proponents \u2014 government agencies, civil society organizations and other stakeholders \u2014 to design, develop and implement GEF-funded projects and programs. The GEF works with 18 agencies.\n# [[United Nations Development Programme]]\n# [[UN Environment Program|United Nations Environment Programme]]\n# [[World Bank]]\n# [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]\n# [[Inter-American Development Bank]]\n# [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]\n# [[Asian Development Bank]]\n# [[African Development Bank]]\n# [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]]\n# [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]]\n# [[World Wildlife Fund US|World Wildlife Fund - US]]\n# [[Conservation International]]\n# [[West African Development Bank|West African Development Bank (BOAD)]]\n# [[Brazilian Biodiversity Fund]] (FUNBIO)\n# [[Foreign Economic Cooperation Office, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China]] (FECO) \n# [[Development Bank of Southern Africa|Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA)]]\n# [[Development Bank of Latin America|Development Bank of Latin America (CAF)]]\n# [[International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]\n\n==History==\n\nThe Global Environment Facility was established in October 1992 as a $1 billion pilot program in the World Bank to assist in the protection of the global environment and to promote environmental sustainable development. The GEF would provide new and additional grants and concessional funding to cover the \"incremental\" or additional costs associated with transforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits.\n \nThe United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Program, and the World Bank were the three initial partners implementing GEF projects.\n\nIn 1992, at the [[Rio Earth Summit]], the GEF was restructured and moved out of the World Bank system to become a permanent, separate institution. The decision to make the GEF an independent organization enhanced the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process and in implementation of the projects. Since 1994, however, the World Bank has served as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and provided administrative services.\n \nAs part of the restructuring, the GEF was entrusted to become the financial mechanism for both the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. In partnership with the Montreal Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Ozone Layer Depleting Substances, the GEF started funding projects that enable the Russian Federation and nations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals.\n\nIn 1998, the GEF Council decided to expand beyond the initial three Implementing Agencies, including to the International Finance Corporation, to broaden its ability to enable innovating financing mechanisms and better leverage private sector investment.<ref>{{cite web|title=EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXECUTING AGENCIES|url=https://www.thegef.org/sites/default/files/council-meeting-documents/GEF.C.12.10_5.pdf|website=Global Environment Facility|accessdate=29 October 2017}}</ref> The GEF subsequently was also selected to serve as financial mechanism for three more international conventions: The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (2001), the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (2003), and the [[Minamata Convention on Mercury]] (2013).\n\n== Areas of work ==\nThe GEF work focuses on six main areas, including biodiversity, climate change (mitigation and adaptation), chemicals, international waters, land degradation, sustainable forest management/REDD+.\n\n'''[[Biodiversity]]''': Biodiversity is under heavy threat. Reducing and preventing further [[biodiversity loss]] are considered among the most critical challenges to humankind. Of all the problems the world faces in managing \u201cglobal goods,\u201d only the loss of biodiversity is irreversible. The GEF supports projects that address the key drivers of biodiversity loss which focus on the highest leveraging opportunities to achieve sustainable biodiversity conservation.\n\n'''[[Climate change]]''': Climate change from human-induced emissions of heat-trapping [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) is a critical global issue, requiring substantial action. These actions include investment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and adaptation to climate changes including variability. The early impacts of climate change have already appeared, and scientists believe that further impacts are inevitable. Many of the most serious and negative impacts of climate change will be disproportionately borne by the poorest people in developing countries. The GEF supports projects in developing countries .\n* [[Climate change mitigation]]: Reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions in the areas of renewable energy; energy efficiency; sustainable transport; and management of [[land use, land-use change, and forestry]].\n* [[Climate change adaptation]]: Aiming at developing countries to become climate-resilient by promoting immediate and longer-term adaptation measures in development policies, plans, programs, projects, and actions.\n\n'''Chemicals''': [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) are pesticides, industrial chemicals, or unwanted by-products of industrial processes that have been used for decades but have more recently been found to share a number of disturbing characteristics, including:\n* Persistence \u2014 they resist degradation in air, water, and sediments;\n* Bio-accumulation \u2014 they accumulate in living tissues at concentrations higher than those in the surrounding environment;  \n* Long-range transport \u2014 they can travel great distances from the source of release through air, water, and migratory animals, often contaminating areas thousands of kilometers away from any known source.\n\nThe GEF supports projects in eliminating the production and use of specific POPs, taking measures to ensure that POPs wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner, identifying the sources and reducing releases of POPs byproducts.\n\n'''[[Circular Economy]]''': GEF has issued a \"background note\" and hosted events on the [[circular economy]], which shifts from a take-make-waste economy to one that seeks to use no [[non-renewable]] source materials and produce [[zero waste]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assembly.thegef.org/publications/gef-assembly-background-note-circular-economy|title=GEF Assembly Background Note: Circular Economy|date=June 20, 2018|website=Global Environment Facility}}</ref> GEF is a member of the [[Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy]] (PACE), for which GEF's CEO, Naoko Ishii, is the co-chair of the Board of Directors along with [[Frans van Houten]] of [[Royal Philips]] and a representative of the [[UNEP]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acceleratecirculareconomy.org/|title=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy|website=Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/projects/circular-economy/|title=Circular Economy|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref>\n\n'''[[International waters]]''': Diversions of water for irrigation, bulk supply, and potable use, together with the pollution of common water bodies are creating cross-border tensions. These tensions also persist across the oceans, with three-quarters of fish stocks being overfished, fished at their maximum, or in a depleted state. The GEF supports projects in helping countries work together to overcome these tensions in large water systems and to collectively manage their transboundary surface water basins, groundwater basins, and coastal and marine systems in order to share the benefits from them.\n\n'''[[Land degradation]]''': Land degradation is a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and society\u2019s ability to function. Because of the interconnectivity between ecosystems across scales, land degradation triggers destructive processes that can have cascading effects across the entire biosphere.  Loss of biomass through vegetation clearance and increased soil erosion produces greenhouse gases that contribute global warming and climate change. The GEF supports projects in reversing and preventing desertification/land degradation and in mitigating the effects of drought in affected areas in order to support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.\n\n'''[[Sustainable forest management]] / [[REDD]]+''': [[Forest]]s cover almost one-third of the world\u2019s land area. They have a unique potential to produce multiple global environmental benefits such as [[biodiversity]] conservation, [[carbon sequestration]], and protection against [[desertification]]. Sustainably managed forests can enhance the provision of wood and [[non-timber forest product]]s for about 1.6 billion people depending on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems are also expected to play a key role in helping people in developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. The GEF supports projects in forest conservation (primarily [[protected area]]s and buffer zones), sustainable use of forests (forest production landscapes, sustainable forest management), and addressing forests and trees in the wider landscape.\n\n'''[[Ozone depletion]]''': Increased [[UV-B]] radiation reaching the Earth would pose risks to human health and the environment. In response, countries negotiated and adopted the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] in 1985, and the [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in 1987. The GEF supports projects in developing countries and countries with economies in transition (CEITs) that are not eligible for funding under the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol, to implement activities to phase out ozone depleting substances (ODS) in a manner consistent with these countries\u2019 obligations under the Montreal Protocol.\n\nBesides these seven areas, the GEF has also worked on other programs including:\n* Capacity development\n* Country support programme\n* [[Debt-for-nature swap]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/debt-for-nature-swaps.html|title=Debt for Nature Swaps|website=UNDP}}</ref>\n* Gender Mainstreaming\n* Results and learning\n* Earth fund and [[public-private partnerships]]\n* Small grants programme<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sgp.undp.org|title=Welcome to The GEF Small Grants Programme|website=www.sgp.undp.org}}</ref>\n* Small Island Developing States\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Climate Investment Funds]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thegef.org GEF official website]\n* [http://www.iwlearn.net GEF International Waters Resource Center]\n* [http://www.newgreenorder.info Independent academic research-based critiques of the GEF]\n* [http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/global-environment-facility-gef Global Environment Facility Profile on database of market governance mechanisms]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Conservation organizations]]\n[[Category:International environmental organizations]]\n[[Category:Environmental agencies]]\n[[Category:Intergovernmental environmental organizations]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Environment_Facility"}

The club was founded in 1917, reaching the highest level of Danish football in 1987, and afterwards became one of the most successful football clubs in Denmark. They won the [[1993\u201394 Danish Superliga]], finished 3rd in 1994\u201395 and 2000-01, 2nd in 1997\u201398, and won the [[Danish Cup]] in 2001. Silkeborg has participated in Europe several times, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in 1996.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1917, the football section of Silkeborg IF played in the top ranks of [[Jutland]] until a short visit in the third division in 1962. In 1966, however the team was promoted to the 2nd division of Danish football. In 1982, the club took the decisive step towards the Danish top football, as the company SIF Football Support A / S was founded, a professional company that would be responsible for professional football in Silkeborg. This resulted in a rise in 1987 to the country's top row, the 1st division. This came as a large surprise to most football enthusiasts and a reporter from the Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' wrote, \"It will be a surprise if Silkeborg will win a corner kick.\" The team, however, played well and already in the third game of the season Silkeborg IF defeated Denmark's dominant team, [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] with a 1-0 win at home.\n\n===1994 championship===\nThere were many vital matches in the 1993\u201394 season, but perhaps the most important game for Silkeborg was the tournament's third round match at home against Br\u00f8ndby. Just before the game, the team's big name [[Jakob Kjeldberg]] had been sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]],<ref>[http://www.silkeborgif.com/om-sif/fodbold/aarene-der-gik/199394/ 1993\u20131994 season], Silkeborg IF by year, accessed on December 4, 2013.</ref> and when Br\u00f8ndby put themselves ahead 2\u20130 early in the game, it looked difficult for the home team. But Silkeborg totally turned the match upside down and won 4\u20132 in front of an enthusiastic audience.<ref>[http://www.superstats.dk/kampe/397 Superstats SIF-BIF 15.08.1993], SIF-BIF: 4\u20132, accessed on December 4, 2013.</ref> During the rest of autumn, SIF delivered one attractive game after another. The team lost only 2 of 18 matches and finished the autumn in 1st place.\n\nThe playoffs were a thrilling affair. The superior play in the autumn was followed by a more calculating style. Away from home, SIF ran into a few serious defeats, but, in turn, Silkeborg Stadion was a fortress. Here, SIF won six out of seven games and conceded only one goal. In the second-to-last round, SIF could secure the championship with an away win against the only remaining competitor, [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. Silkeborg fans flocked to the national arena, [[Parken Stadium]], where the match was witnessed by the largest crowd in history of the Danish Superliga, namely 26,679.<ref>[http://www.superstats.dk/kampe/522 Superstats FCK-SIF 05.06.1994], FCK-SIF: 4\u20131, accessed on December 4, 2013.</ref> The many visiting SIF fans, however, witnessed SIF scoring the first goal of the match but eventually losing 1\u20134.\n\nThe situation before the final round was that SIF should provide a better result than Copenhagen to become champions. At home, SIF played [[Aalborg Boldspilklub|Aalborg BK]] and won 2\u20130 on two goals by leading scorer [[Heine Fernandez]]. In Odense, [[Odense Boldklub|OB]] obtained a lead over Copenhagen in the 2nd half and won 3\u20132 on a goal in injury time, securing SIF the championship.\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n| GK_nat  = DEN|  GK = [[Peter Kj\u00e6r (footballer)|Kj\u00e6r]]\n| RB_nat  = DEN|  RB = [[Morten Bruun|Bruun]]\n| RCB_nat = DEN| RCB = [[Bora Zivkovic|Zivkovic]]\n| LCB_nat = DEN| LCB = [[Michael Larsen (footballer)|Larsen]]\n| LB_nat  = DEN|  LB = [[Per Ottosen|Ottosen]]\n| RCM_nat = DEN| RCM = [[Jacob Juhl|Juhl]]\n| LCM_nat = DEN| LCM = [[Nicolai Wael|Wael]]\n| AM_nat  = DEN|  AM = [[Thomas R\u00f8ll|R\u00f8ll]]\n| RM_nat  = DEN|  RM = [[Brian Pedersen (footballer)|Pedersen]]\n| LM_nat  = DEN|  LM = [[Thomas Poulsen|Poulsen]]\n| CF_nat  = DEN|  CF = [[Henrik Pedersen|Pedersen]]\n| caption = The 11 starters of the final in the [[2000\u201301 Danish Cup]]\n}}\n\n===2001 cup winners and relegation===\nIn 2001, Silkeborg won the [[2000\u201301 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] with a 4\u20131 victory against league rivals AB. Behind 0\u20131 at half-time, the team scored 4 times in the second half of the match by Brian Pedersen, Thomas Poulsen and 2 from [[Henrik Pedersen]]. [[Steven Lust\u00fc]], who later would become a prominent player for Silkeborg, played the entire game for AB. The following years' results were not very impressive. After the cup victory, the club sold Henrik Pedersen to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Peter Kj\u00e6r (footballer)|Peter Kj\u00e6r]] to [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]] and [[Thomas R\u00f8ll]] to Copenhagen. At the same time, [[Morten Bruun]], the player with most caps to his name in the club history, retired. In 2003, the team was relegated to the 1st Division, but returned to the Superliga the following year. For two seasons in a row, the team finished eighth in the league with 12 teams, but in 2007 the team was again relegated. When former player [[Troels Bech]] returned to the club as head coach in 2009, however, he transformed the team and helped the club to promotion. Silkeborg finished fifth in the league in [[2010\u201311 Danish Superliga|2011]], the best result in 15 years.\n\n===2018-19 1st Division Title===\n\nIn the [[2018-19 Danish 1st Division]] Silkeborg IF were crowned champions of the First Division for a third time, ensuring a return to the Danish Superliga for the [[2019-20 Danish Superliga|2019-20]] season following a one year absence.\n\nDanish Striker [[Ronnie Schwartz]] was the league\u2019s top scorer for Silkeborg with 17 league goals registered; sharing the golden boot with [[FC Roskilde|Roskilde\u2019s]] [[Emil Nielsen]].\n\nThey secured the league title with 61 points, only 1 point clear of nearest rivals [[Viborg FF]] ensuring an automatic return to the Superliga.\n\n==Achievements==\n*'''[[Danish

The club was founded in 1917, reaching the highest level of Danish football in 1987, and afterwards became one of the most successful football clubs in Denmark. They won the [[1993\u201394 Danish Superliga]], finished 3rd in 1994\u201395 and 2000-01, 2nd in 1997\u201398, and won the [[Danish Cup]] in 2001. Silkeborg has participated in Europe several times, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] in 1996.\n\n==History==\nFounded in 1917, the football section of Silkeborg IF played in the top ranks of [[Jutland]] until a short visit in the third division in 1962. In 1966, however the team was promoted to the 2nd division of Danish football. In 1982, the club took the decisive step towards the Danish top football, as the company SIF Football Support A / S was founded, a professional company that would be responsible for professional football in Silkeborg. This resulted in a rise in 1987 to the country's top row, the 1st division. This came as a large surprise to most football enthusiasts and a reporter from the Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'' wrote, \"It will be a surprise if Silkeborg will win a corner kick.\" The team, however, played well and already in the third game of the season Silkeborg IF defeated Denmark's dominant team, [[Br\u00f8ndby IF|Br\u00f8ndby]] with a 1-0 win at home.\n\n===1994 championship===\nThere were many vital matches in the 1993\u201394 season, but perhaps the most important game for Silkeborg was the tournament's third round match at home against Br\u00f8ndby. Just before the game, the team's big name [[Jakob Kjeldberg]] had been sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]],<ref>[http://www.silkeborgif.com/om-sif/fodbold/aarene-der-gik/199394/ 1993\u20131994 season], Silkeborg IF by year, accessed on December 4, 2013.</ref> and when Br\u00f8ndby put themselves ahead 2\u20130 early in the game, it looked difficult for the home team. But Silkeborg totally turned the match upside down and won 4\u20132 in front of an enthusiastic audience.<ref>[http://www.superstats.dk/kampe/397 Superstats SIF-BIF 15.08.1993], SIF-BIF: 4\u20132, accessed on December 4, 2013.</ref> During the rest of autumn, SIF delivered one attractive game after another. The team lost only 2 of 18 matches and finished the autumn in 1st place.\n\nThe playoffs were a thrilling affair. The superior play in the autumn was followed by a more calculating style. Away from home, SIF ran into a few serious defeats, but, in turn, Silkeborg Stadion was a fortress. Here, SIF won six out of seven games and conceded only one goal. In the second-to-last round, SIF could secure the championship with an away win against the only remaining competitor, [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. Silkeborg fans flocked to the national arena, [[Parken Stadium]], where the match was witnessed by the largest crowd in history of the Danish Superliga, namely 26,679.<ref>[http://www.superstats.dk/kampe/522 Superstats FCK-SIF 05.06.1994], FCK-SIF: 4\u20131, accessed on December 4, 2013.</ref> The many visiting SIF fans, however, witnessed SIF scoring the first goal of the match but eventually losing 1\u20134.\n\nThe situation before the final round was that SIF should provide a better result than Copenhagen to become champions. At home, SIF played [[Aalborg Boldspilklub|Aalborg BK]] and won 2\u20130 on two goals by leading scorer [[Heine Fernandez]]. In Odense, [[Odense Boldklub|OB]] obtained a lead over Copenhagen in the 2nd half and won 3\u20132 on a goal in injury time, securing SIF the championship.\n{{football squad on pitch|align=right\n| GK_nat  = DEN|  GK = [[Peter Kj\u00e6r (footballer)|Kj\u00e6r]]\n| RB_nat  = DEN|  RB = [[Morten Bruun|Bruun]]\n| RCB_nat = DEN| RCB = [[Bora Zivkovic|Zivkovic]]\n| LCB_nat = DEN| LCB = [[Michael Larsen (footballer)|Larsen]]\n| LB_nat  = DEN|  LB = [[Per Ottosen|Ottosen]]\n| RCM_nat = DEN| RCM = [[Jacob Juhl|Juhl]]\n| LCM_nat = DEN| LCM = [[Nicolai Wael|Wael]]\n| AM_nat  = DEN|  AM = [[Thomas R\u00f8ll|R\u00f8ll]]\n| RM_nat  = DEN|  RM = [[Brian Pedersen (footballer)|Pedersen]]\n| LM_nat  = DEN|  LM = [[Thomas Poulsen|Poulsen]]\n| CF_nat  = DEN|  CF = [[Henrik Pedersen|Pedersen]]\n| caption = The 11 starters of the final in the [[2000\u201301 Danish Cup]]\n}}\n\n===2001 cup winners and relegation===\nIn 2001, Silkeborg won the [[2000\u201301 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] with a 4\u20131 victory against league rivals AB. Behind 0\u20131 at half-time, the team scored 4 times in the second half of the match by Brian Pedersen, Thomas Poulsen and 2 from [[Henrik Pedersen]]. [[Steven Lust\u00fc]], who later would become a prominent player for Silkeborg, played the entire game for AB. The following years' results were not very impressive. After the cup victory, the club sold Henrik Pedersen to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], [[Peter Kj\u00e6r (footballer)|Peter Kj\u00e6r]] to [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.|Be\u015fikta\u015f]] and [[Thomas R\u00f8ll]] to Copenhagen. At the same time, [[Morten Bruun]], the player with most caps to his name in the club history, retired. In 2003, the team was relegated to the 1st Division, but returned to the Superliga the following year. For two seasons in a row, the team finished eighth in the league with 12 teams, but in 2007 the team was again relegated. When former player [[Troels Bech]] returned to the club as head coach in 2009, however, he transformed the team and helped the club to promotion. Silkeborg finished fifth in the league in [[2010\u201311 Danish Superliga|2011]], the best result in 15 years.\n\n===2018-19 1st Division Title===\n\nIn the [[2018-19 Danish 1st Division]] Silkeborg IF were crowned champions of the First Division for a third time, ensuring a return to the Danish Superliga for the [[2019-20 Danish Superliga|2019-20]] season following a one year absence.\n\nDanish Striker [[Ronnie Schwartz]] was the league\u2019s top scorer for Silkeborg with 17 league goals registered; sharing the golden boot with [[FC Roskilde|Roskilde\u2019s]] [[Emil Nielsen]].\n\nThey secured the league title with 61 points, only 1 point clear of nearest rivals [[Viborg FF]] ensuring an automatic return to the Superliga.\n\n==Achievements==\n*'''[[Danish

It was presumably taken out of circulation again, following Ichiro's 2012 trade to the Yankees coupled with Johnson's 2015 election into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The number was once again worn by Ichiro upon his return to the Mariners in 2018, until retiring in 2019.\n\nNumber '''14''' ([[Lou Piniella]]) was not given to any uniformed personnel between Piniella's 2002 departure and 2015, but it was issued to third-base coach [[Manny Acta]] for the 2016 season.\n\n[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997.\n\n[[Uniform number (Major League Baseball)|Uniform number]] '''00''' is presumed off-limits, as it has been worn by the Mariner Moose since 1997 (outfielder [[Jeffrey Leonard]] was the last player to wear 00 for the M's, in 1990). From 1990 to 1996, the Moose wore the last 2 digits of the year of the current season.\n\n==Culture==\n{{outdated section|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Louie Louie===\nAs part of the seventh inning stretch, after the crowd is led in singing \"[[Take Me Out To The Ball Game]]\" or \"[[God Bless America]]\" the public address system begins playing the [[The Kingsmen|Kingsmen's]] version of \"[[Louie Louie]]\". This commemorates a 1985 prank attempt to make \"Louie Louie\" the state song of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n===Hydroplane Races and Cap-and-Ball Game===\nAs part of the mid-inning entertainment during games, three animated hydroplanes race on the T-Mobile Park Jumbotron screen. Each boat is \"sponsored\" by a local business. Fans are encouraged to cheer the boats on. The hydroplane races are inspired by actual hydroplane races held annually during [[Seafair]], Seattle's primary summer event.\n\nSimilarly, in a separate event, a baseball is hidden underneath one of three animated Mariners baseball caps and the fans are encouraged to shout out which cap they think the ball is under at the end of the caps' \"dance.\" Both events are strictly for fun and no prizes are awarded.\n\n===Buhner Buzz Cut Night===\nIn 1994, the Mariners started a promotion called \"Buhner Buzz Cut Night\" Inspired by [[Jay Buhner]]'s shaved head; any fan who was willing to have their head shaved before the game\u2014or was already bald\u2014would receive a free ticket to the game and a T-shirt with a slogan such as \"Bald is Buhnerful\" or \"Take Me Out To The Bald Game\". Hair 10 inches or longer was collected for charity. The promotion continued until Buhner's retirement in 2001, with a year's hiatus in 2000, and is still remembered by fans today.\n\n===Rally Fries===\n[[File:Rally fries sign.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Boston Red Sox]] fans holding a sign requesting rally fries.]]\nRally Fries are a baseball [[tradition]] started by Mariners broadcaster [[Mike Blowers]] in 2007. During a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], a fan tried to catch a foul ball along the right-field line but in turn spilled his tray of [[french fries]] along the track. While chatting on the air and seeing the mishap, Blowers' partner, [[Dave Sims]], suggested that he should send a new tray of fries to the fan. Blowers agreed, and sent his intern to deliver a plate of fries to the man.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Patrick|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/699195-seattle-mariners-5-best-safeco-field-traditions#/articles/699195-seattle-mariners-5-best-safeco-field-traditions|title=Seattle Mariners: 5 Best Safeco Field Traditions|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=2011-05-15|accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>\n\nAt the Mariners' next game, fans made signs and boards asking Blowers for fries as well. Coincidentally, every time the fries were delivered, the Mariners seem to score or rally from a deficit, and thus the \"Rally Fries\" were created. This became so popular with the fans that signs were even seen when the Mariners were the visiting team, although on August 1, 2009, Blowers established that he only gives out fries at home games.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/327493_moore14.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Jim | last1=Moore | title=Go 2 Guy: Fry, fry away -- rally fries take off | date=August 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, Blowers would select a person or a group of people that appealed to him, whether it was through fans wearing elaborate costumes or waving funny signs and boards. The fries were usually delivered from [[Ivar's]], a Seattle-based seafood restaurant with a location at [[T-Mobile Park]]. The amount of fries given out varied with the size of the winning group of fans. The winners were generally selected around the 5th or 6th inning, although potential candidates were shown in almost every inning beforehand.\n\n===King's Court===\nAs the 2011 season progressed, the Mariners marketing staff came up with an idea to encourage the growing fanbase of star pitcher \"King\" [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]]. Every Hernandez start at T-Mobile Park is now accompanied by the King's Court, a designated cheering section for fans to sing, chant, and cheer while donning yellow T-shirts and K cards that are supplied by the team.\n\nThe King's Court is both a personal rooting section for Hernandez and trend-setter for T-Mobile Park. The team encouraged fans to dress like Larry Bernandez, Hernandez's alter ego from a Mariners TV Commercial, or show up in wacky costumes, rewarding the best with a ceremonial turkey leg.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floyd |first=Brian |url=http://seattle.sbnation.com/seattle-mariners/2011/6/29/2246979/felix-hernandez-kings-court-mariners-marlins-calvinball |title=F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez Ignites King's Court; Mariners, Marlins Play Calvinball |publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court is a special occurrence when the King's Court is extended to the entirety of T-Mobile Park. The first Supreme Court was F\u00e9lix's first home game following his [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez's perfect game|perfect game]] in 2012. Since then it has occurred each year at F\u00e9lix's first home game of each season.\n\n===The Maple Grove===\nThe ultimately disappointing 2017 season had a few bright spots, including the establishment of the Maple Grove, a variation of the King\u2019s Court which honors [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] rather than F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez. At home games where Paxton starts, a group of fans sit by a Maple Grove banner, typically in the left field bleachers. A potted maple tree is also present in their section, provided by the Mariners; the Grove dubbed the tree \"Stick Rizzs\", in honor of a long-time Mariner broadcaster Rick Rizzs.\n\nWhen Paxton got to two strikes on a batter, the Grove held up \u201cEh\u201d Cards, a tip of the cap to Paxton\u2019s home country of Canada and a nod to the \"K\" (for strikeout) cards held up in King's Court. Variant cards have also been produced for special occasions, such as when a planned Paxton start turned into a Hern\u00e1ndez start (a King's Grove, with \"K'eh\" cards to cheer for Hern\u00e1ndez). Other examples include when celebrating Paxton reaching 300 strikeouts, or in tribute to broadcaster Angie Mentink (\"A\" cards, to show support after she had publicly disclosed her being diagnosed with breast cancer).\n\nThe Maple Grove differs from the King\u2019s Court in that it was created and organized by fans, while the Court was promoted by the Mariners marketing team. When asked, Paxton stated that fans creating the Maple Grove was really special to him and that he never imagined that something of the sort would ever be done for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-fans-created-the-maple-grove-for-canadian-james-paxton-and-he-loves-it/|title=Mariners fans created the \u2018Maple Grove\u2019 for Canadian James Paxton, and he loves it|last=Giambalvo|first=Emily|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=July 27, 2017|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The Grove continued until Paxton was traded to the Yankees following the 2018 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-trade-james-paxton-to-the-yankees-for-three-prospects/|title=Mariners trade left-hander James Paxton to the Yankees for three prospects|last=Divish|first=Ryan|date=November 19, 2018|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roster and Baseball Hall of Fame==\n{{Seattle Mariners roster}}\n\n===Baseball Hall of Famers===\nThe following elected members of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] spent part of their careers with the Mariners.<ref>[http://baseballhall.org/explorer National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum: Home]</ref>\n\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = Seattle Mariners\n|   All Team Names = Mariners\n|          ColorA# = 0C2C56\n|          ColorB# = FFFFFF\n|          ColorC# = 005C5C\n|          ColorD# = FFFFFF\n|      Team Name 1 = '''Seattle Mariners'''\n|         List 1.1 = [[Pat Gillick]]<sup></sup>\n|         List 1.2 = [[Goose Gossage]]<br />'''[[Ken Griffey Jr.]]''' *\n|         List 1.3 = [[Rickey Henderson]]<br />[[Randy Johnson]] *<sup></sup>\n|         List 1.4 = '''[[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]]''' *<br />[[Gaylord Perry]]\n|         List 1.5 = [[Dick Williams]]\n|      Team Name 2 =\n|         List 2.1 =\n|         List 2.2 =\n|         List 2.3 =\n|         List 2.4 =\n|         List 2.5 =\n|      Team Name 3 =\n|         List 3.1 =\n|         List 3.2 =\n|         List 3.3 =\n|         List 3.4 =\n|         List 3.5 =\n|      Team Name 4 =\n|         List 4.1 =\n|         List 4.2 =\n|         List 4.3 =\n|         List 4.4 =\n|         List 4.5 =\n|        Footnote1 = * Seattle Mariners listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n|        Footnote2 =\n|        Footnote3 =\n|        Footnote4 =\n|}}\n\n===Ford C.

Since July {{by|1999}}, the Mariners' home [[Baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[T-Mobile Park]], located in the [[SoDo, Seattle|SoDo]] neighborhood of Seattle.\n\nThe \"Mariners\" name originates from the prominence of [[seamanship|marine]] culture in the city of Seattle. They are [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknamed]] the '''Ms''', a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992. They adopted their current team colors \u2013 [[navy blue]], northwest green ([[teal]]), and [[Silver (color)|silver]] \u2013 prior to the 1993 season, after having been [[royal blue]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]] since the team's inception.<ref name=\"MarinersLogosAndColors\" /> Their [[List of Major League Baseball mascots|mascot]] is the [[Mariner Moose]].\n\nThe organization did not field a winning team until 1991, and any real success eluded them until {{Baseball year|1995}} when they won their first division championship and defeated the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[American League Division Series|ALDS]]. The [[The Double (Seattle Mariners)|game-winning hit in Game 5]], in which [[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]] drove home [[Ken Griffey Jr.]] to win the game in the 11th inning, clinched a series win for the Mariners, served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle, and has since become an iconic moment in team history.\n\nThe Mariners won 116 games in {{mlby|2001}}, which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the [[1906 Chicago Cubs season|1906 Chicago Cubs]] for the Major League record for most wins in a single season.\n\nThrough the end of the [[2019 Major League Baseball season|2019]] season, the franchise has finished with a losing record in [[List of Seattle Mariners seasons|29 of 43 seasons]].

It was presumably taken out of circulation again, following Ichiro's 2012 trade to the Yankees coupled with Johnson's 2015 election into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Each boat is \"sponsored\" by a local business. Fans are encouraged to cheer the boats on. The hydroplane races are inspired by actual hydroplane races held annually during [[Seafair]], Seattle's primary summer event.\n\nSimilarly, in a separate event, a baseball is hidden underneath one of three animated Mariners baseball caps and the fans are encouraged to shout out which cap they think the ball is under at the end of the caps' \"dance.\" Both events are strictly for fun and no prizes are awarded.\n\n===Buhner Buzz Cut Night===\nIn 1994, the Mariners started a promotion called \"Buhner Buzz Cut Night\" Inspired by [[Jay Buhner]]'s shaved head; any fan who was willing to have their head shaved before the game\u2014or was already bald\u2014would receive a free ticket to the game and a T-shirt with a slogan such as \"Bald is Buhnerful\" or \"Take Me Out To The Bald Game\". Hair 10 inches or longer was collected for charity.

During a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], a fan tried to catch a foul ball along the right-field line but in turn spilled his tray of [[french fries]] along the track. While chatting on the air and seeing the mishap, Blowers' partner, [[Dave Sims]], suggested that he should send a new tray of fries to the fan. Blowers agreed, and sent his intern to deliver a plate of fries to the man.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hansen|first=Patrick|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/699195-seattle-mariners-5-best-safeco-field-traditions#/articles/699195-seattle-mariners-5-best-safeco-field-traditions|title=Seattle Mariners: 5 Best Safeco Field Traditions|website=[[Bleacher Report]]|date=2011-05-15|accessdate=2012-10-27}}</ref>\n\nAt the Mariners' next game, fans made signs and boards asking Blowers for fries as well. Coincidentally, every time the fries were delivered, the Mariners seem to score or rally from a deficit, and thus the \"Rally Fries\" were created. This became so popular with the fans that signs were even seen when the Mariners were the visiting team, although on August 1, 2009, Blowers established that he only gives out fries at home games.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/baseball/327493_moore14.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Jim | last1=Moore | title=Go 2 Guy: Fry, fry away -- rally fries take off | date=August 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, Blowers would select a person or a group of people that appealed to him, whether it was through fans wearing elaborate costumes or waving funny signs and boards. The fries were usually delivered from [[Ivar's]], a Seattle-based seafood restaurant with a location at [[T-Mobile Park]]. The amount of fries given out varied with the size of the winning group of fans. The winners were generally selected around the 5th or 6th inning, although potential candidates were shown in almost every inning beforehand.\n\n===King's Court===\nAs the 2011 season progressed, the Mariners marketing staff came up with an idea to encourage the growing fanbase of star pitcher \"King\" [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]]. Every Hernandez start at T-Mobile Park is now accompanied by the King's Court, a designated cheering section for fans to sing, chant, and cheer while donning yellow T-shirts and K cards that are supplied by the team.\n\nThe King's Court is both a personal rooting section for Hernandez and trend-setter for T-Mobile Park. The team encouraged fans to dress like Larry Bernandez, Hernandez's alter ego from a Mariners TV Commercial, or show up in wacky costumes, rewarding the best with a ceremonial turkey leg.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floyd |first=Brian |url=http://seattle.sbnation.com/seattle-mariners/2011/6/29/2246979/felix-hernandez-kings-court-mariners-marlins-calvinball |title=F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez Ignites King's Court; Mariners, Marlins Play Calvinball |publisher=[[SB Nation]] |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2012-10-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court is a special occurrence when the King's Court is extended to the entirety of T-Mobile Park. The first Supreme Court was F\u00e9lix's first home game following his [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez's perfect game|perfect game]] in 2012. Since then it has occurred each year at F\u00e9lix's first home game of each season.\n\n===The Maple Grove===\nThe ultimately disappointing 2017 season had a few bright spots, including the establishment of the Maple Grove, a variation of the King\u2019s Court which honors [[James Paxton (baseball)|James Paxton]] rather than F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez. At home games where Paxton starts, a group of fans sit by a Maple Grove banner, typically in the left field bleachers. A potted maple tree is also present in their section, provided by the Mariners; the Grove dubbed the tree \"Stick Rizzs\", in honor of a long-time Mariner broadcaster Rick Rizzs.\n\nWhen Paxton got to two strikes on a batter, the Grove held up \u201cEh\u201d Cards, a tip of the cap to Paxton\u2019s home country of Canada and a nod to the \"K\" (for strikeout) cards held up in King's Court. Variant cards have also been produced for special occasions, such as when a planned Paxton start turned into a Hern\u00e1ndez start (a King's Grove, with \"K'eh\" cards to cheer for Hern\u00e1ndez). Other examples include when celebrating Paxton reaching 300 strikeouts, or in tribute to broadcaster Angie Mentink (\"A\" cards, to show support after she had publicly disclosed her being diagnosed with breast cancer).\n\nThe Maple Grove differs from the King\u2019s Court in that it was created and organized by fans, while the Court was promoted by the Mariners marketing team. When asked, Paxton stated that fans creating the Maple Grove was really special to him and that he never imagined that something of the sort would ever be done for him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-fans-created-the-maple-grove-for-canadian-james-paxton-and-he-loves-it/|title=Mariners fans created the \u2018Maple Grove\u2019 for Canadian James Paxton, and he loves it|last=Giambalvo|first=Emily|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=July 27, 2017|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref> The Grove continued until Paxton was traded to the Yankees following the 2018 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/mariners/mariners-trade-james-paxton-to-the-yankees-for-three-prospects/|title=Mariners trade left-hander James Paxton to the Yankees for three prospects|last=Divish|first=Ryan|date=November 19, 2018|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=January 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roster and Baseball Hall of Fame==\n{{Seattle Mariners roster}}\n\n===Baseball Hall of Famers===\nThe following elected members of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] spent part of their careers with the Mariners.<ref>[http://baseballhall.org/explorer National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum: Home]</ref>\n\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name = Seattle Mariners\n|   All Team Names = Mariners\n|          ColorA# = 0C2C56\n|          ColorB# = FFFFFF\n|          ColorC# = 005C5C\n|          ColorD# = FFFFFF\n|      Team Name 1 = '''Seattle Mariners'''\n|         List 1.1 = [[Pat Gillick]]<sup></sup>\n|         List 1.2 = [[Goose Gossage]]<br />'''[[Ken Griffey Jr.]]''' *\n|         List 1.3 = [[Rickey Henderson]]<br />[[Randy Johnson]] *<sup></sup>\n|         List 1.4 = '''[[Edgar Mart\u00ednez]]''' *<br />[[Gaylord Perry]]\n|         List 1.5 = [[Dick Williams]]\n|      Team Name 2 =\n|         List 2.1 =\n|         List 2.2 =\n|         List 2.3 =\n|         List 2.4 =\n|         List 2.5 =\n|      Team Name 3 =\n|         List 3.1 =\n|         List 3.2 =\n|         List 3.3 =\n|         List 3.4 =\n|         List 3.5 =\n|      Team Name 4 =\n|         List 4.1 =\n|         List 4.2 =\n|         List 4.3 =\n|         List 4.4 =\n|         List 4.5 =\n|        Footnote1 = * Seattle Mariners listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n|        Footnote2 =\n|        Footnote3 =\n|        Footnote4 =\n|}}\n\n===Ford C.

Created by [[Richard Levinson]] and [[William Link]] and developed by [[television producer|executive producer]] [[Bruce Geller]]. The title character, Joe Mannix, is a [[private investigator]] played by [[Mike Connors]].\n\n==Premise==\nDuring the first season of the series, Joe Mannix works for a large Los Angeles [[detective]] agency called Intertect, which was the planned original title of the show.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f2aGT9AtKM|title=YouTube|publisher=}}</ref> His superior is Lew Wickersham, played by [[Joseph Campanella]]. Intertect uses computers to help solve crimes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Snauffer |first=Douglas |year=2006 |title=Crime Television |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]] |page=40 |isbn=0-275-98807-4}}</ref>\n\nAs opposed to the other employees, Mannix belongs to the classic American [[detective fiction|detective archetype]], thus he usually ignores the computers' solutions, disobeys his boss's orders, displays no curiosity about the outside world,  and sets out to do things his own way. He wears large-polka dotted sport coats and has his own office that he keeps sloppy between his assignments. A picture of ''MAD'' Magazine's Alfred E. Neuman hangs in his office.  Lew has cameras in all the rooms of the Intertect offices monitoring the performance of his employees and providing instant feedback through intercoms in the room. Unlike the other Intertect operatives, Mannix attempts to block the camera with a coat rack and questions Lew, comparing him to [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Name Is Mannix |series=Mannix |date=September 16, 1967 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nTo improve the ratings of the show, Desilu head [[Lucille Ball]] and producer Bruce Geller made some changes,<ref>p.41 Snauffer, Douglas ''Crime Television'' 2006 Greenwood Publishing</ref> making the show similar to other private-eye shows. Ball thought the computers were too high-tech and beyond the comprehension of the average viewer of the time and had them removed.\n\nFrom the second season on, Mannix works on his own with the assistance of his loyal secretary Peggy Fair, a police officer's widow played by [[Gail Fisher]] &ndash; one of the first black actresses to have a regular series role. He also has a working relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department, as he will often exchange information with his contacts. The first of these to have a featured role was Lieutenant George Kramer, portrayed by [[Larry Linville]], who had been the partner of Peggy's late husband.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Merry Go Round for Murder |series=Mannix |date=April 5, 1969 |season=2 |number=24}}</ref> Over the course of the series, Mannix's most frequently used contact is Lieutenant Art Malcolm, played by [[Ward Wood]]. Another semi-regular guest, although not as frequent, was [[Robert Reed]], whose appearances as Lieutenant Adam Tobias coincided with his tenure on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', which also was produced by Paramount Television.{{sfn|Snauffer|2006|p=41}} [[Jack Ging]] played another Mannix contact, Lieutenant Dan Ives, who made several appearances later in the series.\n\nIn the 1969 season, he also employs the services of a competitive private investigator, Albie Loos (performed by [[Joe Mantell]]), as a sort of investigative gofer.

Whenever he gets into one of his [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s, he can expect to be shot at or run off the road by another car or find his vehicle sabotaged. Nevertheless, he keeps his cool and perseveres until his antagonists are brought down.\n\nWhile making the [[television pilot]] \"The Name Is Mannix\", Connors dislocated his shoulder running away from a ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''\u2013type pursuit from a helicopter,<ref name=autogenerated1/>{{sfn|Snauffer|2006|p=41}} and broke his left wrist punching a stuntman who happened to be wearing a steel plate on his back. This character aspect was lampooned multiple times by radio comedians [[Bob and Ray]], as \"Blimmix\", portrayed as dim-witted, and ending with Blimmix being soundly beaten by his adversary. These parodies retained the theme song composed by Lalo Schifrin at the beginning and conclusion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |author-link1=Tim Brooks (television historian) |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle F. |date=2009 |title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946\u2013Present]] |edition=9th |location=New York |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |page=851 |isbn=978-0-345-49773-4}}</ref>\n\nStarting in season two, Mannix lives and works in [[West Los Angeles]] in a mixed-use development called Paseo Verde; his home at 17 Paseo Verde has an attached office out of which he runs his agency. The design for the 17 Paseo Verde set is based on a Santa Barbara, CA, building that still exists. \n\nMannix grew up in a town called Summer Grove, where he was a star football and basketball player. Summer Grove had a thriving Armenian immigrant community. As of 1969, Mannix's mother had died 10 years earlier, and Mannix had not been back to the town since the funeral. Mannix's estranged father, Stefan, was still living in Summer Grove, and Mannix and his father would start a reconciliation.<ref name=ReturnToSummerGrove/> When Mannix returns to Summer Grove for a case three years later, his father and he are on good terms.<ref name=WineFromTheseGrapes/>\n\nFollowing military service in the Korean War, Mannix attended Western Pacific University on the [[GI Bill]], graduated in 1955, and obtained his private investigator's license in 1956. He is a black belt in karate.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Many Deaths of Saint Christopher |series=Mannix |date=October 7, 1967 |season=1 |number=4}}</ref> Throughout the series, he appears proficient in a variety of athletic pursuits, including sailing, horseback riding, and skiing. He is an accomplished pool player, golfs regularly, and is also a skilled airplane pilot. In the first season, he carries a [[Walther PP]] semiautomatic pistol. From the second season on, Mannix carries a [[Colt Detective Special]] [[snubnosed revolver]] in [[.38 Special]] caliber.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Appearances on other shows===\nIn 1971, Connors guest-starred on an episode of ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' entitled \"Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage |series=Here's Lucy |date=October 4, 1971 |season=4 |number=4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Connors reprised the role of Mannix on an episode of ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' titled \"Hard-Boiled Murder\", and the show served as a sequel to the 1973 ''Mannix'' episode \"Little Girl Lost\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Hard-Boiled Murder |series=Diagnosis: Murder |date=February 13, 1997 |season=4 |number=17}}</ref> Several other actors from the old \"Mannix\" episode also reprised their roles. In a comic reference to Mannix's famous history of serious injuries, the show portrayed the main character of \"Diagnosis: Murder\", Dr. Mark Sloan (Dick van Dyke), as Mannix's longtime physician.\n\n\"Mannix\" was used as a reference several times by ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' when there was a foot chase or a fight.\n\n==Production==\n[[Gary Morton]], the second husband of [[Lucille Ball]] and head of [[Desilu]] Studios, noticed a 1937 [[Bentley]] convertible being driven by Mike Connors. A car enthusiast, Morton began talking about cars to Connors when he remembered a Desilu detective show coming up in which he thought Connors would do well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Aaker |first=Everett |date=2006 |title=Encyclopedia of Early Television Crime Fighters |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |page=140 |isbn=0-7864-2476-1}}</ref>\n\n''Mannix'' was initially a production of [[Desilu Productions]], which had been purchased by [[Gulf + Western]] earlier in 1967. During the first season, Gulf + Western integrated Desilu's operations into its [[Paramount Pictures]] subsidiary and the company became [[Paramount Television]]. The series featured a dynamic split-screen opening credits sequence set to theme music from noted composer [[Lalo Schifrin]]. Unusual for a private detective series, the ''Mannix'' theme is in [[triple time]], the same signature used for [[waltz|waltzes]].\n\nThe show's [[title card]], [[opening credits]], and closing [[credits roll]] are set in variations of the [[City (typeface)|City]] [[typeface]], a squared-off, split-serif face that was long used by [[IBM Corporation]] as part of their corporate design and still appears in their logo. This refers to the computers used by Intertect in the first season. The dot over the \"i\" in Mannix had the appearance of a computer tape reel. This was removed after the first season.\n\nOver the life of the series, several famous entertainers were featured in one-time roles, including [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]] as themselves and [[Lou Rawls]] as a club singer, [[Rich Little]] as an impressionist, and [[Milton Berle]] as a stand-up comedian. Essay humorist [[Art Buchwald]] also had a cameo role unrelated to journalism, and in another episode, [[Rona Barrett]] played herself.\n\n===Mannix's automobiles===\nThe automobile was a focus of Mannix's professional life, and he had several of them as his personal vehicle in the eight-year run of the series. Those were:\n* Season 1 \u2013 1966 [[Mercury Comet]] Caliente convertible (pilot episode: \"The Name Is Mannix\"), 1967 [[Mercury Comet]] Cyclone convertible (one episode only: \"Skid Marks on a Dry Run\"), 1967 [[Ford Galaxie]] 500 four-door hardtop then a 1967 [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Ford Fairlane]] 500 four-door sedan after the Galaxie got shot up \u2013 both were Intertect company cars (one episode only: \"The Cost of a Vacation\"). In all other season-one episodes, Mannix drove a 1967 [[Oldsmobile Toronado#First generation, 1966\u201370|Oldsmobile Toronado]] customized into a roadster by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], builder of TV's Batmobile from the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' ABC series, since the producers wanted a convertible and Oldsmobile never produced an open-topped Toronado. Due to a change in episode run order (\"The Cost of a Vacation\" was the second episode of Mannix shot after the pilot, although it was the sixth episode CBS broadcast), the one-shot appearances of the Galaxie and Fairlane were after the Toronado had been established as Mannix's car.\n\n* Season 2 \u2013 1968 [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]] GTS 340 convertible \"kustomized\" by George Barris with functional hood scoops, Lucas Flamethrower driving lights, blacked-out grille, racing-style gas filler cap, molded-in rear spoiler, blacked out tail light panel, and custom tail light lenses. The car was originally red, but Executive Producer Bruce Geller wanted it changed to a British Racing Green, which Barris did. (This car still retains its original red paint under the carpet.) A Motorola car-phone (a remarkably expensive and rare item in 1968) was installed. Rader mag wheels like those on the Batmobile were originally installed by Barris, but changed later in the 1968 season to Cragar S/S chrome wheels. George Barris also installed his own \"Barris Kustoms\" emblem on the lower part of each front fender. No duplicate 1968 Mannix Darts were built; it is a \"1 of 1\" car. This car was used in both the 1968 and 1969 seasons of Mannix.\n\nThough a 1969 Dart was built by Barris to replicate this car in the show's 1969 season, the 1968 Dart was regularly seen during the 1969 season. (In the 1969 episode \"A Penny for the Peep Show\", both the 1968 and 1969 Darts are used in the same shot, to elude a police tail on Mannix, but no explanation in the episode was given for why or how two identically customized green Dart convertibles show up together.)\n\nIn further tracing the car's history, the 1968 Dart was reportedly sold to a secretary at Paramount Studios and then was lost for decades until being discovered near a ranger station in the Southern California mountains. It has since been restored to its original Mannix/Barris condition and was featured in Hemmings ''Muscle Machines'', December 2009 issue.\n\nThe 1968 ''Mannix'' Dart and its intriguing history was also featured on the TV show ''Drive'' on Discovery HD Theater in 2010. The TV show reunited the car with Mike Connors for the first time in over 40 years. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBOAJSF1ypA&t=7s]\n\nThe car is currently owned by C. Van Tune, former editor-in-chief of ''Motor Trend'' magazine, who conducted the TV interview with Mike Connors and who also wrote an article on the ''Mannix'' Dart for the summer 2011 issue of ''Motor Trend Classic'' magazine. In that article, the Dart is reunited with Mike Connors, George Barris, and'' Mannix ''stuntman Dick Ziker.\n\nAnother article on the famous Dart was published in the October 2011 issue of ''Mopar Action'' magazine. An article in the ''New York Times'' (July 22, 2012) included information on the 1968 ''Mannix'' Dart and a recent photo of Mike Connors with the car. The ''Mannix'' Dart was also mentioned on Sirius/XM Radio's \"60s on 6\" channel by disc jockey Mike Kelly.\n\nIn October 2016, the car magazine \"Power & Performance News\" [https://www.powerperformancenews.com/features/mannixs-1968-dodge-dart-gts/] published an article on the 1968 \"Mannix\" Dart, written by C. Van Tune. \n\n* Season 3 \u2013 1969 [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]] GTS 340 convertible \"kustomized\" by George Barris to replicate the 1968 Dart: This car was totalled in a wreck soon after being sold, following its use on the series.\n\n* Season 4 \u2013 1970 [[Plymouth Barracuda#1970|Plymouth Cuda 340]] dark green convertible.\n\n* Season 5 \u2013 1971 Plymouth Cuda convertible, actually, three 1971s (all dark green with green interiors and black soft tops), were supplied by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]], and all had differently sized (318, 340, 383) engines. One was wrecked, but later repaired. One episode the hood is raised, dynamite discovered, and the air cleaner reads 383.\n\n* Season 6 \u2013 1973 Plymouth Cuda convertible (actually two of the 1971 cars updated with 1973 grilles, headlamps, front fenders, front/rear bumpers, and tail lights.)\n\n* Season 7 \u2013 [[Dodge Challenger#First generation (1970\u20131974)|1974 Dodge Challenger]] 360 Coupe: Two were built especially for the show, and had every available option installed, including the rare factory sunroof. Mild Barris customizing included Cragar S/S 15-inch chrome wheels, G60x15 Goodyear radial tires, and an upper body pinstripe.\n\n* Season 8 \u2013 [[Second-generation Chevrolet Camaro|Chevrolet Camaro]] LT, and a red 1975 Chevrolet Impala 2 door with a white convertible.\n\nPeggy Fair's cars were less prominent, but in seasons two through eight, they included a [[Simca 1000]], [[Simca 1204]] hatchback, [[Dodge Colt]] hardtop, and finally a [[Chevrolet Vega]] hatchback.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mannix episodes}}\n{{:List of Mannix episodes}}\n\n==Guest stars==\nMannix featured hundreds of guest stars:\n{{col-begin|width=95%}}\n{{Col-4}}\n*[[Julie Adams]]\n*[[Charles Aidman]]\n*[[Claude Akins]]\n*[[Anne Archer]]\n*[[Barry Atwater]]\n*[[Val Avery]]\n*[[Richard Bakalyan]]\n*[[Hugh Beaumont]]\n*[[Vincent Beck]]\n*[[Henry Beckman]]\n*[[Ed Begley Jr.]]\n*[[Pamela Bellwood]]\n*[[Lee Bergere]]\n*[[Oscar Beregi Jr]]\n*Alan Bergmann\n*[[Milton Berle]]\n*[[Whit Bissell]]\n*[[Bill Bixby]]\n*[[Lloyd Bochner]]\n*[[Antoinette Bower]]\n*[[Eric Braeden]]\n*[[Richard Bull (actor)|Richard Bull ]]\n*[[Brooke Bundy]]\n*[[Victor Buono]]\n*[[Joseph Campanella]]{{efn|After playing Mannix's boss in Season 1, he returned as a different character, a client, in a 1972 episode.}}\n*Fred Carson\n*[[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]]\n*Christopher Cary\n*[[Ted Cassidy]]\n*[[Robert Colbert]]\n*[[John Colicos]]\n{{Col-4}}\n*[[Robert Conrad]]\n*[[Yvonne Craig]]\n*[[John Dehner]]\n*[[John Doucette]]\n*[[Don Dubbins]]\n*[[Howard Duff]]\n*[[Anthony Eisley]]\n*[[Dana Elcar]]\n*[[Robert Ellenstein]]\n*[[Roy Engel]]\n*[[Erik Estrada]]\n*[[Linda Evans]]\n*[[Shelley Fabares]]\n*[[Norman Fell]]\n*[[Paul Fix]]\n*[[Victor French]]\n*[[Beverly Garland]]\n*[[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]]\n*[[Harold Gould]]\n*[[Gloria Grahame]]\n*[[Kevin Hagen]]\n*[[Mariette Hartley]]\n*[[Katherine Helmond]]\n*[[Douglas Henderson (actor)|Douglas Henderson]]\n*[[Howard Hessman]]\n*[[John Hillerman]]\n*[[Kim Hunter]]\n*[[Diana Hyland]]\n*[[Mako (actor)|Mako Iwamatsu]]\n*Allen Jaffe\n*[[Russell Johnson]]\n*[[Victor Jory]]\n*[[Gordon Jump]]\n*[[Diane Keaton]]\n{{Col-4}}\n*[[Sally Kellerman]]\n*[[Sandy Kenyon]]\n*[[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight ]]\n*[[Walter Koenig]]\n*[[Nancy Kovack]]\n*[[Marta Kristen]]\n*[[Cloris Leachman]]\n*[[Ronald Long]]\n*[[Perry Lopez]]\n*[[Barbara Luna]]\n*[[Dawn Lyn]]\n*[[Ken Lynch]]\n*[[Carol Lynley]]\n*[[Larry Manetti]]\n*[[Scott Marlowe]]\n*[[John Marley]]\n*[[Arlene Martel]]\n*[[Darren McGavin]]\n*[[Gerald McRaney]]\n*[[Burgess Meredith]]\n*[[Lee Meriwether]]\n*[[Vera Miles]]\n*[[Del Monroe]]\n*[[Priscilla Morrill]]\n*[[Diana Muldaur]]\n*[[Richard Mulligan]]\n*[[Lloyd Nolan]]\n*[[Mel Novak]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanarland.com/interview/interview-melnovakvo-mel-novak-en.html|title=Interview de Mel Novak\n|website=nanarland.com|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n*[[Alan Oppenheimer]]\n*[[Leslie Parrish]]\n*[[Felton Perry]]\n{{Col-4}}\n*[[Nehemiah Persoff]]\n*[[Barney Phillips]]\n*[[Paul Picerni]]\n*[[Ford Rainey]]\n*[[Lou Rawls]]\n*[[Stafford Repp]]\n*[[John Ritter]]\n*[[Pernell Roberts]]\n*[[Percy Rodriguez]]\n*[[Marion Ross]]\n*[[Alfred Ryder]]\n*[[Tom Selleck]]\n*[[William Shatner]]\n*[[Martin Sheen]]\n*[[Tom Skerritt]]\n*[[Warren Stevens]]\n*[[Dean Stockwell]]\n*[[Loretta Swit]]\n*[[Nita Talbot]]\n*[[Vic Tayback]]\n*[[Berlinda Tolbert]]\n*[[Malachi Throne]]\n*[[Harry Townes]]\n*[[John Vernon]]\n*[[Garry Walberg]]\n*[[Jessica Walter]]\n*[[David Wayne]]\n*[[Adam West]]\n*[[William Windom (actor)|William Windom]]\n*[[H.M.

Created by [[Richard Levinson]] and [[William Link]] and developed by [[television producer|executive producer]] [[Bruce Geller]], the title character, Joe Mannix, is a [[private investigator]]. He was played by [[Mike Connors]].\n\n==Premise==\nDuring the first season of the series, Joe Mannix works for a large Los Angeles [[detective]] agency called Intertect, which was the planned original title of the show.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f2aGT9AtKM|title=YouTube|publisher=}}</ref> His superior is Lew Wickersham, played by [[Joseph Campanella]]. Intertect uses computers to help solve crimes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Snauffer |first=Douglas |year=2006 |title=Crime Television |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Praeger Publishers]] |page=40 |isbn=0-275-98807-4}}</ref>\n\nAs opposed to the other employees, Mannix belongs to the classic American [[detective fiction|detective archetype]], thus he usually ignores the computers' solutions, disobeys his boss's orders, displays no curiosity about the outside world,  and sets out to do things his own way. He wears large-polka dotted sport coats and has his own office that he keeps sloppy between his assignments. A picture of ''MAD'' Magazine's Alfred E. Neuman hangs in his office.  Lew has cameras in all the rooms of the Intertect offices monitoring the performance of his employees and providing instant feedback through intercoms in the room. Unlike the other Intertect operatives, Mannix attempts to block the camera with a coat rack and questions Lew, comparing him to [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Name Is Mannix |series=Mannix |date=September 16, 1967 |season=1 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nTo improve the ratings of the show, Desilu head [[Lucille Ball]] and producer Bruce Geller made some changes,<ref>p.41 Snauffer, Douglas ''Crime Television'' 2006 Greenwood Publishing</ref> making the show similar to other private-eye shows. Ball thought the computers were too high-tech and beyond the comprehension of the average viewer of the time and had them removed.\n\nFrom the second season on, Mannix works on his own with the assistance of his loyal secretary Peggy Fair, a police officer's widow played by [[Gail Fisher]] &ndash; one of the first black actresses to have a regular series role. He also has a working relationship with the Los Angeles Police Department, as he will often exchange information with his contacts. The first of these to have a featured role was Lieutenant George Kramer, portrayed by [[Larry Linville]], who had been the partner of Peggy's late husband.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Merry Go Round for Murder |series=Mannix |date=April 5, 1969 |season=2 |number=24}}</ref> Over the course of the series, Mannix's most frequently used contact is Lieutenant Art Malcolm, played by [[Ward Wood]]. Another semi-regular guest, although not as frequent, was [[Robert Reed]], whose appearances as Lieutenant Adam Tobias coincided with his tenure on ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', which also was produced by Paramount Television.{{sfn|Snauffer|2006|p=41}} [[Jack Ging]] played another Mannix contact, Lieutenant Dan Ives, who made several appearances later in the series.\n\nIn the 1969 season, he also employs the services of a competitive private investigator, Albie Loos (performed by [[Joe Mantell]]), as a sort of investigative gofer. In the 1972 season, Albie returns, played by a different actor ([[Milton Selzer]]).\n\nWhile ''Mannix'' was not generally known as a show that explored socially relevant topics, several episodes had topical themes. Season two had episodes featuring compulsive gambling,<ref>{{cite episode |title=Odds Against Donald Jordan |series=Mannix |date=March 1, 1969 |season=2 |number=21}}</ref> deaf and blind characters who were instrumental in solving cases in spite of their physical limitations,<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Silent Cry |series=Mannix |date=September 28, 1968 |season=2 |number=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=The Solid Gold Web |series=Mannix |date=March 22, 1969 |season=2 |number=23}}</ref> and episodes that focused on racism against Blacks and Hispanics.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Death in a Minor Key |series=Mannix |date=February 8, 1969 |season=2 |number=18}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Last Rites for Miss Emma |series=Mannix |date=March 8, 1969 |season=2 |number=22}}</ref><ref name=ToCatchARabbit>{{cite episode |title=To Catch a Rabbit |series=Mannix |date=April 12, 1969 |season=2 |number=25}}</ref> Season six had an episode focusing on the effects the [[Vietnam War]] had on returning [[veteran]]s, including the effects of [[PTSD]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=To Kill a Memory |series=Mannix |date=October 29, 1972 |season=6 |number=7}}</ref>\n\n==Character==\nJoseph R. \"Joe\" Mannix is a regular guy, without pretense, who has a store of proverbs on which to rely in conversation.

Whenever he gets into one of his [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s, he can expect to be shot at or run off the road by another car or find his vehicle sabotaged. Nevertheless, he keeps his cool and perseveres until his antagonists are brought down.\n\nWhile making the [[television pilot]] \"The Name Is Mannix\", Connors dislocated his shoulder running away from a ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''\u2013type pursuit from a helicopter,<ref name=autogenerated1/>{{sfn|Snauffer|2006|p=41}} and broke his left wrist punching a stuntman who happened to be wearing a steel plate on his back. This character aspect was lampooned multiple times by radio comedians [[Bob and Ray]], as \"Blimmix\", portrayed as dim-witted, and ending with Blimmix being soundly beaten by his adversary. These parodies retained the theme song composed by Lalo Schifrin at the beginning and conclusion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |author-link1=Tim Brooks (television historian) |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle F. |date=2009 |title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946\u2013Present]] |edition=9th |location=New York |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]] |page=851 |isbn=978-0-345-49773-4}}</ref>\n\nStarting in season two, Mannix lives and works in [[West Los Angeles]] in a mixed-use development called Paseo Verde; his home at 17 Paseo Verde has an attached office out of which he runs his agency. The design for the 17 Paseo Verde set is based on a Santa Barbara, CA, building that still exists. \n\nMannix grew up in a town called Summer Grove, where he was a star football and basketball player. Summer Grove had a thriving Armenian immigrant community. As of 1969, Mannix's mother had died 10 years earlier, and Mannix had not been back to the town since the funeral. Mannix's estranged father, Stefan, was still living in Summer Grove, and Mannix and his father would start a reconciliation.<ref name=ReturnToSummerGrove/> When Mannix returns to Summer Grove for a case three years later, his father and he are on good terms.<ref name=WineFromTheseGrapes/>\n\nFollowing military service in the Korean War, Mannix attended Western Pacific University on the [[GI Bill]], graduated in 1955, and obtained his private investigator's license in 1956. He is a black belt in karate.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Many Deaths of Saint Christopher |series=Mannix |date=October 7, 1967 |season=1 |number=4}}</ref> Throughout the series, he appears proficient in a variety of athletic pursuits, including sailing, horseback riding, and skiing. He is an accomplished pool player, golfs regularly, and is also a skilled airplane pilot. In the first season, he carries a [[Walther PP]] semiautomatic pistol. From the second season on, Mannix carries a [[Colt Detective Special]] [[snubnosed revolver]] in [[.38 Special]] caliber.{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Appearances on other shows===\nIn 1971, Connors guest-starred on an episode of ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' entitled \"Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage |series=Here's Lucy |date=October 4, 1971 |season=4 |number=4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Connors reprised the role of Mannix on an episode of ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' titled \"Hard-Boiled Murder\", and the show served as a sequel to the 1973 ''Mannix'' episode \"Little Girl Lost\".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Hard-Boiled Murder |series=Diagnosis: Murder |date=February 13, 1997 |season=4 |number=17}}</ref> Several other actors from the old \"Mannix\" episode also reprised their roles. In a comic reference to Mannix's famous history of serious injuries, the show portrayed the main character of \"Diagnosis: Murder\", Dr. Mark Sloan (Dick van Dyke), as Mannix's longtime physician.\n\n\"Mannix\" was used as a reference several times by ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' when there was a foot chase or a fight.\n\n==Production==\n[[Gary Morton]], the second husband of [[Lucille Ball]] and head of [[Desilu]] Studios, noticed a 1937 [[Bentley]] convertible being driven by Mike Connors. A car enthusiast, Morton began talking about cars to Connors when he remembered a Desilu detective show coming up in which he thought Connors would do well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Aaker |first=Everett |date=2006 |title=Encyclopedia of Early Television Crime Fighters |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |page=140 |isbn=0-7864-2476-1}}</ref>\n\n''Mannix'' was initially a production of [[Desilu Productions]], which had been purchased by [[Gulf + Western]] earlier in 1967. During the first season, Gulf + Western integrated Desilu's operations into its [[Paramount Pictures]] subsidiary and the company became [[Paramount Television]]. The series featured a dynamic split-screen opening credits sequence set to theme music from noted composer [[Lalo Schifrin]]. Unusual for a private detective series, the ''Mannix'' theme is in [[triple time]], the same signature used for [[waltz|waltzes]].\n\nThe show's [[title card]], [[opening credits]], and closing [[credits roll]] are set in variations of the [[City (typeface)|City]] [[typeface]], a squared-off, split-serif face that was long used by [[IBM Corporation]] as part of their corporate design and still appears in their logo. This refers to the computers used by Intertect in the first season. The dot over the \"i\" in Mannix had the appearance of a computer tape reel. This was removed after the first season.\n\nOver the life of the series, several famous entertainers were featured in one-time roles, including [[Neil Diamond]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]] as themselves and [[Lou Rawls]] as a club singer, [[Rich Little]] as an impressionist, and [[Milton Berle]] as a stand-up comedian. Essay humorist [[Art Buchwald]] also had a cameo role unrelated to journalism, and in another episode, [[Rona Barrett]] played herself.\n\n===Mannix's automobiles===\nThe automobile was a focus of Mannix's professional life, and he had several of them as his personal vehicle in the eight-year run of the series. Those were:\n* Season 1 \u2013 1966 [[Mercury Comet]] Caliente convertible (pilot episode: \"The Name Is Mannix\"), 1967 [[Mercury Comet]] Cyclone convertible (one episode only: \"Skid Marks on a Dry Run\"), 1967 [[Ford Galaxie]] 500 four-door hardtop then a 1967 [[Ford Fairlane (North America)|Ford Fairlane]] 500 four-door sedan after the Galaxie got shot up \u2013 both were Intertect company cars (one episode only: \"The Cost of a Vacation\"). In all other season-one episodes, Mannix drove a 1967 [[Oldsmobile Toronado#First generation, 1966\u201370|Oldsmobile Toronado]] customized into a roadster by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], builder of TV's Batmobile from the 1960s ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' ABC series, since the producers wanted a convertible and Oldsmobile never produced an open-topped Toronado. Due to a change in episode run order (\"The Cost of a Vacation\" was the second episode of Mannix shot after the pilot, although it was the sixth episode CBS broadcast), the one-shot appearances of the Galaxie and Fairlane were after the Toronado had been established as Mannix's car.\n\n* Season 2 \u2013 1968 [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]] GTS 340 convertible \"kustomized\" by George Barris with functional hood scoops, Lucas Flamethrower driving lights, blacked-out grille, racing-style gas filler cap, molded-in rear spoiler, blacked out tail light panel, and custom tail light lenses. The car was originally red, but Executive Producer Bruce Geller wanted it changed to a British Racing Green, which Barris did. (This car still retains its original red paint under the carpet.) A Motorola car-phone (a remarkably expensive and rare item in 1968) was installed. Rader mag wheels like those on the Batmobile were originally installed by Barris, but changed later in the 1968 season to Cragar S/S chrome wheels. George Barris also installed his own \"Barris Kustoms\" emblem on the lower part of each front fender. No duplicate 1968 Mannix Darts were built; it is a \"1 of 1\" car. This car was used in both the 1968 and 1969 seasons of Mannix.\n\nThough a 1969 Dart was built by Barris to replicate this car in the show's 1969 season, the 1968 Dart was regularly seen during the 1969 season. (In the 1969 episode \"A Penny for the Peep Show\", both the 1968 and 1969 Darts are used in the same shot, to elude a police tail on Mannix, but no explanation in the episode was given for why or how two identically customized green Dart convertibles show up together.)\n\nIn further tracing the car's history, the 1968 Dart was reportedly sold to a secretary at Paramount Studios and then was lost for decades until being discovered near a ranger station in the Southern California mountains. It has since been restored to its original Mannix/Barris condition and was featured in Hemmings ''Muscle Machines'', December 2009 issue.\n\nThe 1968 ''Mannix'' Dart and its intriguing history was also featured on the TV show ''Drive'' on Discovery HD Theater in 2010. The TV show reunited the car with Mike Connors for the first time in over 40 years. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBOAJSF1ypA&t=7s]\n\nThe car is currently owned by C. Van Tune, former editor-in-chief of ''Motor Trend'' magazine, who conducted the TV interview with Mike Connors and who also wrote an article on the ''Mannix'' Dart for the summer 2011 issue of ''Motor Trend Classic'' magazine. In that article, the Dart is reunited with Mike Connors, George Barris, and'' Mannix ''stuntman Dick Ziker.\n\nAnother article on the famous Dart was published in the October 2011 issue of ''Mopar Action'' magazine. An article in the ''New York Times'' (July 22, 2012) included information on the 1968 ''Mannix'' Dart and a recent photo of Mike Connors with the car. The ''Mannix'' Dart was also mentioned on Sirius/XM Radio's \"60s on 6\" channel by disc jockey Mike Kelly.\n\nIn October 2016, the car magazine \"Power & Performance News\" [https://www.powerperformancenews.com/features/mannixs-1968-dodge-dart-gts/] published an article on the 1968 \"Mannix\" Dart, written by C. Van Tune. \n\n* Season 3 \u2013 1969 [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]] GTS 340 convertible \"kustomized\" by George Barris to replicate the 1968 Dart: This car was totalled in a wreck soon after being sold, following its use on the series.\n\n* Season 4 \u2013 1970 [[Plymouth Barracuda#1970|Plymouth Cuda 340]] dark green convertible.\n\n* Season 5 \u2013 1971 Plymouth Cuda convertible, actually, three 1971s (all dark green with green interiors and black soft tops), were supplied by [[Chrysler|Chrysler Corporation]], and all had differently sized (318, 340, 383) engines.

Kawasaki traction control and ignition-management system that was lifted from the [[ZX-10R]].  Also with cosmetic updates and incremental chassis upgrades and suspension revised internals. There was also a slipper clutch added for the first time. The motor gets cylinder heads with polished ports and cams with more lift and longer duration.  Piston are lighter with added compression that get cooled by a new oil jet system.  Stronger connecting rods and crankshaft as well \nas a stronger tensioner and cam chain. while the transmission gets heat treated surface gears.
