It grossed $86&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget of $20&nbsp;million. Two sequels, ''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'', and ''[[John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum]]'', were released in February 2017 and May 2019 respectively, both to comparable critical and commercial success, with another sequel, ''John Wick: Chapter 4'', set for a May 2021 release. It is also the only film in the series to be distributed by [[Summit Entertainment]], as the other films are distributed by [[Lionsgate Films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAfter John Wick loses his wife Helen to a terminal illness, he receives a [[beagle]] puppy named Daisy from her to help him cope with his grief. Despite John's stoic demeanor, he bonds with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader Iosef insists on buying his car, but John repeatedly states that it is not for sale. Frustrated, the mobsters follow John to his home, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy.\n\nIosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio, the shop's owner, recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches Iosef before kicking him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who identifies Iosef as the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia|Russian crime syndicate]] in [[New York City]]. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's activities, beats and berates Iosef before explaining to him who John Wick is: A famed assassin formerly in Viggo's employ, nicknamed \"[[Baba Yaga]]\" (translated in the film as {{Langnf||Russian|\"[[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]\"}}). Previously, when John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an \"impossible task\", implied to involve multiple assassinations in a short period of time. John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate.\n\nViggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John refuses. Viggo then sends a twelve-man hit squad to John's house, but John kills them all and has the bodies professionally removed. An unsurprised Viggo places a $2 million bounty on John's head and personally offers the [[contract killing|contract]] to John's mentor, Marcus, who accepts the offer. John seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no assassinations on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break the rules to kill John at the Continental. Winston, the Continental's owner, tells John that Viggo has Iosef under guard at his nightclub, the Red Circle. John enters the Red Circle and makes his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape.\n\nJohn retreats to the Continental to patch up his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. John forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]], knocks her unconscious, and leaves her with Harry, a fellow assassin, to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry. John travels to the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]] church, which serves as Viggo's front, and destroys Viggo's cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking that he could leave his old life behind. Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself and to kill Kirill before accosting Viggo, who (implied to be tired of his son's behavior) reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to the [[safe house]], killing Iosef and his bodyguards.\n\nPerkins learns that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus beaten and tortured before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. While waiting for John, Perkins is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for killing Harry on Continental grounds. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to the harbor helipad, where he kills Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a battle on the dock. Viggo pulls out a knife, and John allows himself to be stabbed, surprising Viggo. John then disarms Viggo and fatally wounds him. John breaks into a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and releases a [[pit bull]] puppy scheduled to be euthanized. John and the dog walk home along the boardwalk, where he had his last date with Helen.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Keanu Reeves]] as [[John Wick (character)|John Wick]]\n:A former hitman who  returns to the underworld he fought to leave behind.<ref name=\"John Wick Review\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/mess-with-keanus-puppy-at-your-peril-in-blazing-97633834091.html|title=Mess With Keanu Reeves' Puppy At Your Peril In Blazing John Wick Trailer|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919232713/https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/mess-with-keanus-puppy-at-your-peril-in-blazing-97633834091.html|archive-date=September 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/uploads/assets/JOHN%20WICK%20FINAL%20Production%20Notes.pdf|title=John Wick PRODUCTION NOTES|publisher=[[Lionsgate]]|accessdate=October 22, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129041940/http://www.lionsgatepublicity.com/uploads/assets/JOHN%20WICK%20FINAL%20Production%20Notes.pdf|archive-date=November 29, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> On accepting the role of Wick, Reeves explained, \"Basil and Peter Lawson of Thunder Road brought the script to me with the idea that I would be a part of such a great collaboration.

It grossed $86&nbsp;million worldwide against a production budget of $20&nbsp;million. Two sequels, ''[[John Wick: Chapter 2]]'', and ''[[John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum]]'', were released in February 2017 and May 2019 respectively, both to comparable critical and commercial success, with another sequel, ''John Wick: Chapter 4'', set for a May 2021 release. It is also the only film in the series to be distributed by [[Summit Entertainment]], as the other films are distributed by [[Lionsgate Films]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nAfter John Wick loses his wife Helen to a terminal illness, he receives a [[beagle]] puppy named Daisy from her to help him cope with his grief. Despite John's stoic demeanor, he bonds with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader Iosef insists on buying his car, but John repeatedly states that it is not for sale. Frustrated, the mobsters follow John to his home, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy.\n\nIosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio, the shop's owner, recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches Iosef before kicking him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who identifies Iosef as the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia|Russian crime syndicate]] in [[New York City]]. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's activities, beats and berates Iosef before explaining to him who John Wick is: A famed assassin formerly in Viggo's employ, nicknamed \"[[Baba Yaga]]\" (translated in the film as {{Langnf||Russian|\"[[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]\"}}). Previously, when John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an \"impossible task\", implied to involve multiple assassinations in a short period of time. John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate.\n\nViggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John refuses. Viggo then sends a twelve-man hit squad to John's house, but John kills them all and has the bodies professionally removed. An unsurprised Viggo places a $2 million bounty on John's head and personally offers the [[contract killing|contract]] to John's mentor, Marcus, who accepts the offer. John seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no assassinations on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break the rules to kill John at the Continental. Winston, the Continental's owner, tells John that Viggo has Iosef under guard at his nightclub, the Red Circle. John enters the Red Circle and makes his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape.\n\nJohn retreats to the Continental to patch up his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. John forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]], knocks her unconscious, and leaves her with Harry, a fellow assassin, to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry. John travels to the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]] church, which serves as Viggo's front, and destroys Viggo's cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking that he could leave his old life behind. Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself and to kill Kirill before accosting Viggo, who (implied to be tired of his son's behavior) reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to the [[safe house]], killing Iosef and his bodyguards.\n\nPerkins learns that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus beaten and tortured before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. While waiting for John, Perkins is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for killing Harry on Continental grounds. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to the harbor helipad, where he kills Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a battle on the dock.
