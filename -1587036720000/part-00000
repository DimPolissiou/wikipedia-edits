She was the youngest child among the nine children of  [[Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and his wife [[Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg (1865\u20131927)|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna]], born Princess Elizabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. She was going to be named Marianne in honor of her mother's favorite sister, [[Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg]], but her paternal aunt [[Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia]] insisted that her niece  should be named after her.<ref name = \" Vera Constantinovna\">Vera Constantinovna, ''Kadetskaya pereklichka''</ref> Her godparents were her brother [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]]. Vera Constantinovna spent her first years in fabulous splendour during the last period of Imperial Russia. Her father, a respected poet, was a second cousin of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nPrincess Vera was eight years old when [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated]] and World War I broke out, in the summer of 1914. Vera was with her parents and her brother George in Germany visiting her maternal relatives in [[Altenburg]] at the start of the war. The conflict took them by surprise, trapping them in Germany, an enemy country. It was thanks to the intervention of the German Empress, [[Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein]] that they were allowed to return to Russia.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 154\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 154</ref>  Vera\u2019s older siblings joined the Russian army in the military effort, and her favorite brother [[Prince Oleg Constantinovich of Russia|Oleg]] was killed in action. She was considered too young and was not allowed to attend her brother's funeral. Her brother\u2019s death was just the first of many family misfortunes.\n\nThe following year, her father died of a heart attack in her presence. In a letter to her brother, she later described how she was sitting with her father in his study, when Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich began gasping. Princess Vera managed to push open a heavy door between her parents' studies, pushing aside several heavy plants that stood in front of the door, and ran to her mother crying that her father couldn't breathe.

Only [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich of Russia|Prince Gabriel]] was eventually released.

However, with their situation  becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]], through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, to travel to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFrom [[Kronstadt]] twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to [[Sweden]] aboard the Swedish vessel ''\u00c5ngermanland'' in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the [[Bolsheviks]] to be taken by ship to [[Sweden]], via [[Tallinn]] to [[Helsinki]] and via [[Mariehamn]] to [[Stockholm]], at the invitation of [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]].

As Sweden proved too expensive to live in, Elizabeth Mavrikievna  wrote a letter to [[Albert I of Belgium]], asking him to allow them to move to his country.

At age twelve, she escaped revolutionary Russia, fleeing with her mother and brother George to [[Sweden]]. She spent the rest of her long life in exile, first in Western Europe and from the 1950s in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nPrincess Vera Konstantinovna of Russia was born at [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] on 24 April 1906. She was the youngest child among the nine children of  [[Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and his wife [[Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg (1865\u20131927)|Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna]], born Princess Elizabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. She was going to be named Marianne in honor of her mother's favorite sister, [[Princess Marie Anne of Saxe-Altenburg]], but her paternal aunt [[Grand Duchess Vera Constantinovna of Russia]] insisted that her niece  should be named after her.<ref name = \" Vera Constantinovna\">Vera Constantinovna, ''Kadetskaya pereklichka''</ref> Her godparents were her brother [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra Feodorovna]]. Vera Constantinovna spent her first years in fabulous splendour during the last period of Imperial Russia. Her father, a respected poet, was a second cousin of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nPrincess Vera was eight years old when [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated]] and World War I broke out, in the summer of 1914. Vera was with her parents and her brother George in Germany visiting her maternal relatives in [[Altenburg]] at the start of the war. The conflict took them by surprise, trapping them in Germany, an enemy country. It was thanks to the intervention of the German Empress, [[Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein]] that they were allowed to return to Russia.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 154\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 154</ref>  Vera\u2019s older siblings joined the Russian army in the military effort, and her favorite brother [[Prince Oleg Constantinovich of Russia|Oleg]] was killed in action. She was considered too young and was not allowed to attend her brother's funeral. Her brother\u2019s death was just the first of many family misfortunes.\n\nThe following year, her father died of a heart attack in her presence. In a letter to her brother, she later described how she was sitting with her father in his study, when Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich began gasping. Princess Vera managed to push open a heavy door between her parents' studies, pushing aside several heavy plants that stood in front of the door, and ran to her mother crying that her father couldn't breathe. Her mother ran after her, but the grand duke had already died.<ref name = \" Zeepvat, Charlotte 185\">Zeepvat, Charlotte, ''The Camera and the Tsars'', p. 185</ref>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich 1911.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Left to right back row: Princess Tatiana; Prince Gabriel; Prince Ivan; Grand Duchess Elizabeta Mavrikievna and Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich.

They stayed in the palace until the summer of 1918, when the revolution forced them to leave it and to take an apartment in the city.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nDuring the Russian revolution, four of Vera\u2019s brothers were imprisoned by the [[Bolsheviks]]. Only [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich of Russia|Prince Gabriel]] was eventually released. Three of her brothers ([[Prince John Constantinovich of Russia|Ivan]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Constantine]] and [[Prince Igor Constantinovich of Russia|Igor]]) were killed at [[Alapaevsk]], along with other Romanov relatives, in July 1918.\n\nInitially, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna was reluctant to leave Russia remembering her late husband's words, that if Russia was in need, it was a Romanov's duty to help. However, with their situation  becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]], through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, to travel to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFrom [[Kronstadt]] twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to [[Sweden]] aboard the Swedish vessel ''\u00c5ngermanland'' in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the [[Bolsheviks]] to be taken by ship to [[Sweden]], via [[Tallinn]] to [[Helsinki]] and via [[Mariehamn]] to [[Stockholm]], at the invitation of [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]]. At [[Stockholm]] harbor, they met Prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]], who took them to the [[Stockholm Palace|royal palace]]. Later, Vsevolod and Catherine were able to reunite to their mother.\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich in exile2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On the sofa: Princess Tatiana with her children Teymuraz and Nathalie Bagration-Mukhransky and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna.

As Sweden proved too expensive to live in, Elizabeth Mavrikievna  wrote a letter to [[Albert I of Belgium]], asking him to allow them to move to his country. In 1920 they relocated to [[Brussels]] where they were frequently ill. In 1922, Vera's uncle, Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Altenburg invited them to move to Germany.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  Elizabeth Mavrikievna settled in the ancestral castle of her family near [[Leipzig]], in the small town of [[Altenburg]].

A decade later they reunite as Jess is about to marry Peter. Alice decides that the four should spend the weekend in Miami partying. They are also joined by Pippa, Jess's friend from her semester in Australia. The friends get high and party at a club and then decide to hire a male stripper. When the stripper arrives at the door, he makes Jess uncomfortable with his rough talk. Alice decides to take a turn and jumps on him, causing them to both fall and the stripper to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace, killing him. Before they decide what to do, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions that her friends hired a stripper and she is confused. Peter takes this to mean that Jess is leaving him and decides to race down to Miami to convince Jess to take him back.\n\nThe friends purchase a burner phone and call Blair's uncle, who is a lawyer. After telling them they moved the body, he tells them they could face up to fifteen years in prison unless no body is found. The friends decide to dispose of the body by throwing it into the ocean. After doing so, they realize that their neighbors' security camera caught them on tape and send Blair to seduce them to get the footage only to have her discover the cameras don't work after she has slept with them. By this point, the body has washed up on the shore and they must come up with a new plan to dispose of it.\n\nA police officer knocks on their door and Frankie knocks him out after he gropes her, only for the friends to realize that he was the actual stripper they had ordered, leaving them to wonder who they killed. They use the stripper's car to try to dispose of the body again only to return home defeated after a car accident. Then when Alice finds out Jess invited Frankie and Blair to a bridal shower over her, Jess verbally berates her for her obsessive clinginess and storms off to prepare for the consequences.\n\nAt this point, two police officers arrive and tell the women they are not in trouble as the man they killed was a violent criminal who had been on the run from the police. As they interrogate the women Pippa realizes that the \"police\" are actually the accomplices of the man they killed. Realizing that they are caught, the men tie up the women and the now-awakened stripper and threaten to shoot them. Jess meanwhile has missed most of the drama due to being upstairs taking a shower in preparation for her mugshot. Realizing what has happened, she manages to subdue one of the captors using hairspray and handcuffs and fights off the other one as he prepares to kill Blair. After Alice shoots the second captor, the first one reappears having freed himself from the toy handcuffs only to be run over when Peter, high on the drugs he took to keep him awake on his roadtrip to Miami, crashes into the front of the house and kills him.\n\nJess reaffirms that she wants to marry Peter and the two marry that weekend at a foam party with their friends in attendance. Frankie and Blair decide to reunite as a couple and Alice hooks up with Scotty, the police officer stripper that she met at Jess's bachelorette party.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pippa sings a song with lyrics that allude to the evening.\n\nIn a post-credits scene Alice finds the thief's stolen diamonds. \n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Jessica \"Jess\" Thayer\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Pippa/Kiwi\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Ilana Glazer]] as Frankie\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Blair\n* [[Paul W.

A decade later they reunite as Jess is about to get married to Peter. Alice decides that the four should spend the weekend in Miami partying. They are also joined by Pippa, Jess's friend from her semester in Australia. The friends get high and party at a club and then decide to hire a male stripper. When the stripper arrives at the door, he makes Jess uncomfortable with his rough talk. Alice decides to take a turn and jumps on him, causing them to both fall and the stripper to hit his head on the edge of the fireplace, killing him. Before they decide what to do, Jess takes a call from Peter and mentions that her friends hired a stripper and she is confused. Peter takes this to mean that Jess is leaving him and decides to race down to Miami to convince Jess to take him back.\n\nThe friends purchase a burner phone and call Blair's uncle, who is a lawyer. After telling them they moved the body, he tells them they could face up to fifteen years in prison unless no body is found. The friends decide to dispose of the body by throwing it into the ocean. After doing so, they realize that their neighbors' security camera caught them on tape and send Blair to seduce them to get the footage only to have her discover the cameras don't work after she has slept with them. By this point, the body has washed up on the shore and they must come up with a new plan to dispose of it.\n\nA police officer knocks on their door and Frankie knocks him out after he gropes her, only for the friends to realize that he was the actual stripper they had ordered, leaving them to wonder who they killed. They use the stripper's car to try to dispose of the body again only to return home defeated after a car accident. Then when Alice finds out Jess invited Frankie and Blair to a bridal shower over her, Jess verbally berates her for her obsessive clinginess and storms off to prepare for the consequences.\n\nAt this point, two police officers arrive and tell the women they are not in trouble as the man they killed was a violent criminal who had been on the run from the police. As they interrogate the women Pippa realizes that the \"police\" are actually the accomplices of the man they killed. Realizing that they are caught, the men tie up the women and the now-awakened stripper and threaten to shoot them. Jess meanwhile has missed most of the drama due to being upstairs taking a shower in preparation for her mugshot. Realizing what has happened, she manages to subdue one of the captors using hairspray and handcuffs and fights off the other one as he prepares to kill Blair. After Alice shoots the second captor, the first one reappears having freed himself from the toy handcuffs only to be run over when Peter, high on the drugs he took to keep him awake on his roadtrip to Miami, crashes into the front of the house and kills him.\n\nJess reaffirms that she wants to marry Peter and the two marry that weekend at a foam party with their friends in attendance. Frankie and Blair decide to reunite as a couple and Alice hooks up with Scotty, the police officer stripper that she met at Jess's bachelorette party.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pippa sings a song with lyrics that allude to the evening.\n\nIn a post-credits scene Alice finds the thief's stolen diamonds. \n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as Jessica \"Jess\" Thayer\n* [[Kate McKinnon]] as Pippa/Kiwi\n* [[Jillian Bell]] as Alice\n* [[Ilana Glazer]] as Frankie\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as Blair\n* [[Paul W.
